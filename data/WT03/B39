Arbs Pan Bergen Brunswig/Ivax Deal

They Say the Transaction May Fall Through, or at Least it Should
Bergen Brunswig Corp.'s $1.66 billion stock deal with generic drug manufacturer
Ivax Corp. has some arbitrageurs scratching their heads, although analysts are
more positive on the deal.

The deal for financially trouble Ivax-a rare example of a drug wholesaler
buying a drug manufacturer-led to tumbles in both companies' stocks after it
was announced Tuesday. Bergen Brunswig fell $5.125, or 15.6%, to close at
$27.625, and Ivax dropped $3.75, or 21%, to close at $12.50, a 52-week low.

The deal followed Ivax's disclosure earlier this year that earnings would be
lower than anticipated and that the company would therefore violate its bank
covenants.

"It's a terrible deal and Bergen is nuts," said one arbitrageur.
"If the deal breaks, we think Ivax goes down considerably and Bergen Brunswig
won't move much," the arb added, giving the deal even odds of collapse.
"There's a lot of shareholder anger out there," he said.

Another arb said Bergen Brunswig is sure to annoy a lot of its suppliers and
will have to choose between their products and Ivax's. "Bergen Brunswig is
buying a company that does a lot of business with people they compete with," he
said.

If Bergen Brunswig shareholders vote against a deal with Ivax, it won't be the
first time Ivax got left at the altar. Shareholders of Halfslund Nycomed of
Norway rejected a stock swap with Ivax late last year.

But because insiders at both Ivax and Bergen Brunswig hold large amounts of
shares, any anti-deal sentiment doesn't much matter, a third arb said.

"If I'm a Bergen shareholder, I'd be very upset about the transaction," the arb
said. "But I don't think it's a deal killer."

The arb explained the Ivax drop as simple mathematics, offering that the .42
shares of Bergen Brunswig shares Ivax shareholders would receive for each of
theirs valued the stock at 11.6025, less than its trading level at the time.

"Maybe that's all Ivax could get," he said.
Not everyone was negative on the transaction. Analyst Kevin Silverman of Everen
Securities had good things to say about it. He suggested Ivax would give Bergen
Brunswig additional profits that would otherwise go to its suppliers.

"They're buying products from existing manufacturers and earning 15%,"
Silverman said. "The manufacturers are making 40%.

Combined with Bergen Brunswig's $2 billion in generic drug sales, the addition
of generic drugs manufactured at Ivax could add another $600 million to the top
line, he said.

"It makes perfect sense to me."
Silverman said Bergen Brunswig stock dropped because the deal brings dilution
of 30 cents per share and 30 cents times 15 equals $4.50.   "That's about what
the stock dropped on the first day," he said.

Another reason for the stock drops, Silverman said, is that such a deal has
never been done before. "People don't particularly like change and that's what
they're getting here."

Olympic Continues Search for Gold

But Followers of its Situation Suggest Only Fools Would Bite
Olympic Financial Ltd. continues to insist publicly that its search for a buyer
is moving ahead, but the search for a new CEO, the resignation of a board
member and the adoption of a poison pill have left observers wondering whether
Olympic will sell.

Minneapolis-based Olympic, the nation's largest independent provider of
automobile financing, is moving full speed ahead with its search for a new CEO.
Jeffrey Mack resigned as CEO on Aug. 26, the same day Olympic announced it was
entertaining an offer from an interested party.

Bob Ollech, an analyst with Principal Financial Securities, said he just
received a call from the headhunter employed by Olympic looking for leads for
its search. "According to her, they were in the early stages, still looking
around," Ollech said.

Mack was said to have balked at the idea of selling the company, according to
Ollech, but the board that he chose proved to be more powerful than him and
decided to move ahead with the plan despite his objections. Ollech added that
the search for a new CEO makes any sale even less likely.

"It certainly makes you think it's less likely to happen, only from a common
sense standpoint," Ollech said. "If they were to offer the CEO position to
someone, and in the same breath try to sell the company, they'd have a hard
time selling that job. On the other hand, they need a strong CEO to run
day-to-day operations in the event that they can't sell it anymore."

Jennifer Wykert, investor relations consultant for Olympic, described Olympic's
decision to step up its search as a "prudent action" to avoid having to start
from ground zero if a suitor with the right price fails to materialize.

The resignation of board member Rick Zona, which came around Oct. 22, after the
initial buyer declined to make an offer, raised even more eyebrows and
concerns, according to one analyst who asked not to be named.

Ollech speculated that there could have been a number of circumstances that
could have led to Zona's untimely departure. As the first theory goes, First
Bank Systems Inc. may have been looking seriously at buying Olympic, and Zona,
who is vice chairman of finance at the regional bank holding company, resigned
to avoid any possible conflict of interest. The second possibility was that
Zona had a "falling out" with the board about selling.

Third, Ollech continued, because Zona was on Olympic's audit committee, perhaps
there was something afoot in terms of the company's financial condition, or
credit quality. Another possibility is that he resigned for personal reasons.

In any case, the tumultuous activity has not helped Olympic's already volatile
stock, which hit a high of $26.625 in September. At presstime, Olympic's stock
was $15.75, which was a modest recovery from a recent $13.50 low.

Last month, Olympic announced that a first round of buyers had decided against
making definitive offers for the company. But it said a second group of suitors
that had been waiting in the wings were stepping in with their proposals,
including an outright sale, an equity infusion and a strategic alliance.

Then, on Nov. 4, Olympic adopted a poison pill to thwart any attempt at a
hostile takeover.

Pat McGurn, director of corporate programs with Institutional
Shareholder Services, said this move is not unusual. "Diana Corp. went through
a well-publicized shopping of itself and, in the end, decided not to do it at
all, and then adopted a poison pill," McGurn said.

One arbitrageur saw it more as a move of desperation. "Their stock tanked.
They're afraid somebody could come in and buy them on the cheap," the arb said.
"They may well be talking to people, but if they couldn't find a good buyer
when their stock was in the low $20s, how can they expect it when the stock is
at $15."

Meanwhile, an analyst who asked not to be named raised questions about
Olympic's ability to find a buyer. He said, "Olympic has a $2.20 per share
[earnings] estimate for '97. If someone really believed that $2.20 estimate,
why would they not be able to get someone? That's 12 or 13 times earnings."

A number of other analysts agreed that a sale does not seem to be in Olympic's
immediate future.

Robert Evans, an analyst with John G. Kinnard & Co., said Olympic is still
talking to three or four parties regarding the sale of the company, but, "I
don't know if it's at the same pace and sense of urgency as it was. In my
opinion, the company is probably not going to be acquired at least in the next
few weeks."
In its latest move, Olympic hedged its position by saying it had reevaluated
its price objective, leaving the door open to a slightly lower bid.

Nice-Guy Strategy Improves Zell's Odds

The Gravedancer Drops His Lawsuit and Goes After the Votes
Sam Zell is still zealously pursuing Chateau Properties, Inc., but now he's
using sugar instead of vinegar to catch his fly.

By dropping a lawsuit and his hostile tender offer via his Manufactured Home
Communities, Inc. (MHC), and tailoring his $387.3 million bid to management's
needs, he's revealing whose favor he's courting: the holders of operating
partnership (OP) units.

Sources debated whether the tactic would work. At presstime, Chateau announced
its rejection of MHC's bid, but that surely will not stop Zell in his tracks,
sources said.

"If anything, the likelihood of his succeeding has increased to say 75%/25%,"
an analyst said.

MHC currently is under agreement to merge with ROC Communities in a $TK million
deal. Chateau would have to reject Zell's offer or pony up a reported $10
million to $12 million break-up fee for its merger with ROC.

"[Chateau Chairman John Boll] may just be posturing to get the decks clean" by
betting shareholders won't approve the ROC merger. Then he would be free to
pursue the Zell offer.

Indeed, the outcome of ROC's and Chateau's proxy votes this week will play a
large role in whether the Chicago investor ultimately will attain his goal.

On one side were those who saw Zell losing out if he couldn't accomplish the
task of convincing shareholders to vote down the merger. On the other side were
those who believed shareholders would indeed disapprove the merger, leaving
Clinton Township, Mich.-based Chateau vulnerable to his advances.

The Chateau/ROC merger was universally panned by analysts. "This is a unique
situation where one plus one equals less than two," said one who declined to be
named. "I can't imagine two-thirds of ROC holders approving the deal," he
added, giving a higher probability to an eventual Zell win.

The latest MHC strategy consisted of a choice of $26 cash or a convertible
preferred security "designed to address the needs of Chateau OP Unit holders,"
according to a press release. The former bid offered to exchange $26 in cash or
1.15 MHC common share per Chateau share. Taxes would have removed about $4.50
per share from the cash offer, which is what the OP unit holders would have had
to take, sources said.

The initial plan also would have consumed resources that sources said are
better spent enticing Chateau.

"The tender offer would have dragged on for months. This was Zell's effort to
reach closure, a desire to merge sooner rather than later," said Louis Taylor,
an analyst with Prudential Securities.

Sources did agree that the new bid was superior and had a better chance of
success, but one said he'd hold off judgment until Englewood, Colo.-based ROC
holds its vote.

The dialogue surrounding the triangle-formerly a square when Sun Communities
weighed in with a bid for Chateau-has been decidedly one-sided, said
Christopher Hartung, an analyst with Montgomery Securities.

"MHC is the only one we've heard from," he said. "They've got a great marketing
machine. Because Chateau and ROC have been limited as to what they can say, we
haven't heard the whole story," Hartung added.

Additionally, the MHC line has been that its bid offered a generous multiple in
an undervalued industry. But with Chateau's stock price at $24.375 at
presstime, Zell's bid confers on Chateau a premium of only 6%, hardly the 21%
of the original offer.

That said, now that Chateau turned down Chicago-based MHC's bid, it could face
shareholder charges that it breached its fiduciary duty. "They'll have to ask
if management is making decisions based on economics or emotions," said Taylor.
"Are they fighting for the company or for their long term employment?" he
added.

Officials at the three companies, all of which own and operate mobile home
parks, did not return phone calls *Kate Maletz.

Restructuring  Coming For Fitzgeralds Gamin:

A prepackaged restructuring seems to be in the offing for beleaguered
Fitzgeralds Gaming Corp., as both debt and equity are held by fewer than a
dozen groups, sources said.

As the private, Las Vegas-based operator of hotels and casinos, heads into
December with an $8 million interest payment looming large, interest coverage
is barely one to one, sources said. And while Fitzgeralds CFO Fernando
Bensuaski said the company "intends" to make the payment, he could make no
assurances.

He added that the company is in the process of trying to secure financing from
institutional investors, whom he would not identify. And while Bensuaski flatly
denied a bankruptcy is impending, sources didn't buy it.

The culprit, sources said, is the usual one: a combination of too much debt on
a company in an out-of-favor, and highly competitive industry.

One distressed source saw one of three scenarios likely: the bondholders will
gain equity in a new company, the casinos will be sold off piecemeal, or a
combination of the two will occur.

Fitzgeralds' bonds-$123 million in 13% senior secured notes due 2002-are thinly
traded and last sold for 72 in mid September. The issue was a year old on
Saturday.

Management owns about 80% of the common stock. The company also has issued $20
million in preferred stock and $25 million in mixed tranches including $18
million in notes secured on the company's Reno property with interest at prime
plus one.

The 13%s are owned by "less than half a dozen" holders, with Putnam Investments
possessing the bulk, a source said. Putnam's analyst Herb Wagner declined to
comment.

The concentration of notes in few hands could mean a quick end to Fitzgeralds'
suffering. "Maybe they [the holders] could force a restructuring that's
beneficial to them," said Kevin Pilot, the president of Phoenix Capital. And
while Bensuaski insisted no talks about bankruptcy have taken place, the market
was saying a restructuring was in the offing.

"As long as they can make payroll, it makes sense for them to make some kind of
deal," with the bondholders, said Andrew Susser, an analyst with Moody's
Investors Service, which downgraded the 13%s from B3 to Caa Nov. 7.

"The question is, can they compete long term?" Susser said. "That's a call the
noteholders have to make."

A gaming analyst who requested anonymity said, "Long term, it's a tough
company. There is a future in this company."

Fitzgeralds has made some significant capital expenditures recently, including
hotel rooms in its Tunica, Miss., satellite and new restaurants in its Las
Vegas and Tunica locations. Sources said the investment could pay off.

But in the meantime, the company's "high leverage, low liquidity, weak cash
flows, heavy amortization schedule, and competitive pressures in each if its
key markets," remain a problem, according to Moody's.

Bensuaski said Fitzgeralds' plans include seeking capital with the help of
Southcoast Capital Corp., an investment bank it hired in August. It could not
be determined why Oppenheimer & Co. was no longer representing Fitzgerald.

The company hasn't released its third quarter numbers yet, but "we don't expect
great results," said the gaming analyst. He added he expected earnings would be
flat compared with last year.

Fitzgeralds' troubles hang against a backdrop of an industry saturated with
players. The entire gaming sector is hurting, sources said, especially in
Tunica, where the company just completed construction on a 507 room hotel,
Fitzgeralds Tunica. Competition in the area is fierce, Susser said, and the
addition of Harrah's Mardi Gras and Grand Casinos earlier this year have
increased the number of gaming positions by 40%.

The Reno, Nev. outpost, Silver Legacy, saw steep room-rate discounting and
lower margins due in part to the absence of a major bowling tournament. Bowling
events, though, should draw people to the area in 1997 and 1998, but room rates
could drop further as more hotels are scheduled to open in the city *Kate
Maletz.

Reconfigured Deal For FoxMeyer

McKesson Corp. renegotiated the terms of its purchase of bankrupt
FoxMeyer Corp., working out a deal that a source said "won't even cover
lawyer's fees."

A Delaware court approved the transaction whereby McKesson pays $20 million to
$23 million in cash to the bankrupt estate. Then, the first $20 million that
the company collects in receivables would go to McKesson, and the next $10
million in receivables will be split 50%/50% by McKesson and the estate,
according to the source who was present at an auction hearing on Nov. 8. The
remainder would go to the estate, and would pay off professional fees.

The former deal saw McKesson paying $80 million in cash, which would be held in
escrow for about six months, sources said.

The source said vendors complained about the new arrangement and that the money
would be difficult to collect. Robert Peiser, the company's vice chairman and
CEO, theorized that with the outstanding receivables amounting to $90 million,
and McKesson skimming off the first $25 million, the receivables could reach
$70 million to $75 million.

"I think that's insane," the source said. "It's complex, it's not that easy to
recover."

The unsecured trade claims dipped back to the 10 to 12 range from the 15 to 20
they were at the week before on the news of the reconfigured deal. "Rumors that
another company would come in [with a better bid] had held up the unsecured
trade claims," the source said *Kate Maletz.

DOj takes new Mergers approach

The Department of Justice's Antitrust Division's broadening of traditional
legal reviews of anticompetitive issues allows for fairer analyses of
horizontal mergers, the acting head of the division said in a recent speech.

Speaking earlier this month before the American Bar Association in Washington,
Joel Klein said the DOJ now looks beyond the two traditionally recognized
methods of antitrust analysis: "per se" and "rule of reason."

According to the Supreme Court, per se mergers, which account for a small
minority of cases, are those "because of their pernicious effect on competition
and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable.
Rule of reason analyses require a comprehensive market analyses of pro- and
anti-competitive effects.

"A reasonable mode of antitrust analysis needn't always require full-blown
assessments of market effects," Klein said. "Some middle ground between the two
traditional approaches often makes sense.

"Matters that are too complex for per se condemnation sometimes get shoe horned
into that category, while some  anticompetitive practices without any
demonstrable virtue escape condemnation because of insufficient evidence to
satisfy the requirements of a full-blown market analysis," he said.

Rather than restrict itself to the per se and rule of reason  polar
alternatives, the DOJ, Klein said, uses a three-step approach when considering
whether horizontal mergers would directly limit price or production competition

The first step, he said, is to decide whether the deal would be a per se
violation, such as an agreement to fix prices, curtail output or divide
markets. Once the DOJ concludes a horizontal deal is not per se illegal, he
continued, the agency then asks the parties involved whether there's a
"procompetitive justification" for the agreement.

"We expect a response that doesn't merely speculate about the existence of
efficiencies, but rather comes forward with real world factual and expert
economic evidence to support the claim," he said.

If the DOJ finds significant procompetitive benefits to a deal, Klein said, the
agency then looks at whether likely anti-competitive effects would outweigh
them. "The key point I want to stress," he said, "is that only if there are
real procompetitive benefits should there be any need to show actual
anticompetitive effects."

Using such analyses, Klein said, should open the door to at least some
additional consideration of procompetitive justifications for horizontal
mergers. On the other hand, he added, the approach also ensures that facially
anticompetitive, but potentially justifiable, agreements are not automatically
given green lights simply because they can't be condemned as per se illegal.

"By requiring proof of procompetitive benefits, we're lessening the burden of
proving a violation compared to what we'd have to show under a full-blown rule
of reason analysis," he said *Richard Rubin.

Arbs Miffed at AIM's Abstention

Arbs were seething that one Wallace Computer Services, Inc. shareholder
abstained from a Nov. 6 vote on whether shareholders have a voice in takeovers.

AIM Strategic Income Fund, a closed-end management investment company,
abstained, after initially signaling it was in favor of the proposed bylaw
change that would require Wallace's board to hold a shareholder vote within 90
days after it received a qualified bid in order to keep up a defensive posture
against the offer. An AIM spokesman verified that the fund abstained on the
vote.

The absence of its four million votes prevented a quorum and ensured a victory
for Wallace's board, which has defended its refusal to consider a 1995 bid from
Moore Corp., an arbitrageur said.

Now some investors are protesting by refusing to buy AIM funds, the arb said.
"In no way was AIM acting in the best interest of its shareholders by taking
its stock out of play," he added *Kate Maletz.

TI May Sell off Defense and Electronics Units

While Texas Instruments denies it, the industry was abuzz with rumors that the
Dallas semiconductor giant would sell off its defense systems and electronics
business subsidiaries.

A decline in U.S. defense spending and consolidation in the industry are
reasons Texas Instruments would be looking to rid itself of the operations,
said Michael Geran, an analyst with Pershing Investment Research.

"The equipment side of their [the Pentagon's] budget has been whacked. You've
got a situation where the whole industry is changing and you have to put up the
crown jewels to see what they're worth," he added.
Possible acquirors for the units are McDonnell Douglas Corp., Raytheon Co.,
Northrup Grumman and General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics.

Texas Instruments declined to comment on the speculation, saying only that the
company had not made any announcements.

TI posted a third quarter net loss of $148 million, or 78 cents per share
(including a one-time $192 million acquisition-related charge) on revenue of
$2.8 billion, compared to net income of $289 million, or $1.48 per share, on
revenue of $3.4 billion the year-earlier period.

According to the company, revenue for the businesses was up slightly over the
year-earlier period and margins remained stable.

Without the charge, net income was $44 million, or 23 cents per share.  The
company would not break out numbers on the units.

specialty hardware business as part of an effort to eliminate divisions that do
not fit into its long-term growth plans.

The specialty hardware business, together with the synthetic batting division,
has annual sales in the range of $40 million and operates at approximately a
break-even level, according to the company. The two businesses had been
reclassified as disconfrom the sales, estimated at
$8 million, will be used to acquire shares und60s," the
spokesman said. "They have been marginally profitable. In fact, we haven't even
publicized them as part of our division for many years. It was just time. They
don't have anything to do with our three major divisions."

Griffon, noted for its diversity of products, has businesses that manufacture
garage doors, specialty plastic films used in diapers and other personal
products, and information and communication systems.

Champion Builds Future With Redman

Cited by Fortune as one of the "100 Fastest Growing Companies in America,"
Champion Enterprises, the second-largest manufactured housing producer in the
U.S., grew another 75% in October when it acquired number three Redman
Industries  in a $367 million stock swap.

The new company, with 1995 pro forma sales of $1.4 billion, is nipping at the
heels of industry leader  Fleetwood Enterprises, with sales of $2 billion.

Champion, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., has grown from being No. 5 to No. 2 in
three years through high internal growth as well as acquisitions, said
Jacqueline Dout, Champion's CFO. Dallas-based Redman was Champion's seventh
acquisition in two-and-a-half years, she said.

"It was a tremendous acquisition," said Troy Ussery, an analyst at Rauscher
Pierce Refsnes. "It brought Champion to the position of being one of the
largduct line complements our product line very nicely," Dout said. "We
are similar in the fact that we focus on mid- to high-end manufacturing in
housing, but in most areas of the country we're at slightly different price
points so we complement each otherd financial advisor to Redman. At that time,
explained Jeoff Stern, Champiobig percentage of
the industry. Fleetwood holds about 20% and the next four share the next 40% to
50% of the market. The remaining 30% of the industry is split among another 100
companies.

Making a Geographic  Fit
In addition to the growth factor, the other major motivation behind the
acquisition was geographic: a natural merger of two similar, regional companies
that, together, would serve almost the entire country.

"Their product line complements our product line very nicely," Dout said. "We
are similar in the fact that we focus on mid- to high-end manufacturing in
housing, but in most areas of the country we're at slightly different price
points so we complement each otherd financial advisor to Redman. At that time,
explained Jeoff Stern, Champion's advisor and a managing director at Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette, Champion was a much smaller company, Redman was private, and
the two CEOs shared a strong mutual respect.

But it wasn't until June 5 of this year that Alexander, on Redman's behalf,
approached Young at an industry conference about a possible deal. It would be
the only company Redman would talk to.

"I approached no one else" but Champion, said Alexander. "It was Sturgess'
view-and he had spoken with members of his board-that the commonality of focus
in terms of business strategy, and yet the differences in the physical
locations of facilities, made this a combination that was a win-win for both
sides, which doesn't happen often today."

Young met with Sturgess and the financial advisors of both companies almost a
month later to pursue the stock transaction. After that, things moved rather
quickly.

A rumor of illness at the top of Redman may have contributed to the speed with
which the deal was done, according to one source who asked not to be
ideh. "Redman deserved a slightly higher price because of its sheer magnitude,
and its quality and depth of management," U diligence, the group met again to
discuss a range of exchange ratios, the midpoint of which was 1.24 Champion
shares per Redman share. The ratio and the deal were soon settled upon.

A pooling transaction was important to the deal, Dout said. "By merging the two
companies together, it makes us stronger financially and operationally. This
way both shareholders win. We always go for a win-win proposition."

Although analysts uniformly agreed that Champion paid a higher multiple of
operating profit for Redman than previous acquisitions-6.4 times EBITDA
compared to an average 3.9 times-they also agreed that Champion got its money's
worth. "Redman deserved a slightly higher price because of its sheer magnitude,
and its quality and depth of management," Ussery said.

"The big question is: 'What's next?,'" said Ussery. "Champion will clearly
benefit in the upcoming year from the Redman acquisition, but we have several
other major competitors who will run out of steam in 1997 without an
acquisition. This is the tip of the iceberg."

Ussery added that when using the same evaluation as the Redman acquisition,
Belmont Homes, the nation's eleventh largest manufactured home builder, would
be around $16 a share; so at its current price of $10.50, it's bound to be
raising eyebrows-with Champion or other industry players.

"With Redman, the immediate need for more acquisitions isn't as great for
Champion, but Walt [Young] has never been one to pass up a bargain," Ussery
said Alena Joy Berenblatt.

FANNIE LIMIT MOVE TO $207,000 IMMINENT

Fannie Mae is on the verge matching Freddie Mac's $4,150 conforming
loan limit increase and will announce the decision to raise its limit to
$207,000 sometime within the next two weeks, according to mortgage industry
sources close to the agency.
        Fannie has received numerous requests from its customers to raise
its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effect Jan. 1,
sources said. And the agency, which had maintained that would fully
consider the views of its customers before rendering a decision, may make
its announcement as soon as Jan. 15.
        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last two
weeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of
(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and the
potential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fully
discuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders.
        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgage
companies that have traditionally directed most of their business to Fannie
Mae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to take
advantage of the agency's higher limit.
        However, those occurrences may not have qualified as a trend.
Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddie raised
its limits, and a Freddie spokesperson couldn't confirm whether the company
had actually seen an increase in commitments, offering that it had no
updated data to support that conclusion.
        But in talks with its customers over the last month, Jeffers said
Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over the change in the
marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knew that to be a real
possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting to Freddie, "though it's
too early to see it happening--I wouldn't be surprised."
        Freddie Mac decided to raise its limits in December to match a rise
is the Federal Housing Finance Board's home price index. Both Fannie and
Freddie's loan limits are statutorily tied to the index, but Fannie opted
not to raise its limits, thus making the conforming loan limits different
for each agency for the first time ever.
        The debate over raising the limits revolves around the FHFB index,
an economic indicator that has declined each of the last two years. Despite
declines in 1993 and 1994, neither government-sponsored enterprise lowered
its loan limit, decisions that garnered criticism from Congress and HUD
Secretary Henry Cisneros. But declines in home price index are considered
anomalies, so when the index rose for the first time in three years in
November, Freddie lifted its limit to match the increase; Fannie kept its
limit at $203,150. Freddie's critics immediately charged that agency had
raised the limit without considering the previous year's decreases.
        Freddie's decision also  sparked the ire of some in the thrift
industry who contended that the agency is encroaching on the lower crust of
the jumbo loan market niche it has carved out. Freddie Mac argues, however,
that that is not the case, noting that only 1% of all its 1994 loan
purchases were for the loan limit maximum.
        Lawmakers chided Freddie for its decision and praised Fannie for
maintaining its limit. Privately, House Banking Committee sources
acknowledged that the market was likely to force Fannie to raise its limit.
        Freddie's decision also affected the Federal Housing
Administration. Although Freddie's loan limits are tied to FHFB's index,
FHA's limits are tied to Freddie Mac's conforming loan limit. So when
Freddie upped its limits, it inadvertently raised FHA's. HUD pondered
whether it had the statutory authority to avoid raising the limits, but
after a week of review it concluded that it too had to make an increase.
Minus the statutory authority to force Freddie or FHA to maintain its
limits, one House Banking Committee staffer expected the issue to be taken
up by Congress early in 1996.
        The differing loan limits has caused problems for lenders, the
biggest of which are the costs associated with having to split their
portfolios between Fannie and Freddie, said Vicki Vidal, director of
government agency relations for the Mortgage Bankers Association. "Anything
above the Fannie limit must be segregated from Freddie pools and that takes
manpower and diligence," she said. "In some cases a (computerized) system
can tell you, but some for some lenders the actual physical shipping and
handling has to be done."
        Some Fannie-exclusive lenders also faced the additional costs of
switching to Freddie Mac's system. One mortgage industry lobbyist said that
with mortgage origination margins thin anyway, some lenders weren't look
fondly upon switching, primarily because of the costs associated and the
time it would take to retrain their staffs.

SEC ISSUES DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING RULE

The Securities and Exchange Commission said its proposed
regulations on derivatives disclosure are aimed at closing three kinds of
problems it found during an extensive review of company reports, but the
initial reaction of some thrift lenders is that the rule may be redundant.
        The SEC proposed amending its regulations to clarify and expand its
existing requirements for financial statement footnote disclosures about
registrants' accounting policies for derivative financial instruments.
Specifically, the proposed rule changes would affect SEC Regulations S-X,
S-K and various forms including Form 20-F. The proposed amendments were
published in the Jan. 8 Federal Register; comments are due to the SEC by
May 7.
        "This rule appears to be much farther reaching than one would
initially conclude," said Marti Sworobuk, accounting manager for America's
Community Bankers. ACB's accounting committee hasn't reviewed the proposed
regulation yet, but Sworobuk offered that "it doesn't appear to be so much
as a derivative disclosure as it is a document intended to require
financial institutions to disclose how they manage interest rate risk," she
said.
        Under the proposed rule, she said, SEC-regulated institutions would
be required to disclose of whatever they are doing to manage risk, such as
hedging risk by using loan portfolios or by matching the terms of their
funding sources. "It doesn't just involve derivative instruments," she
said.
        Sworobuk said ACB may be interested in how much additional burden
the rule would put on thrifts--if any. "The SEC should recognize that some
financial institutions are already submitting the same kind of information
to banking regulators," she said, speaking of the Consolidated
Maturity/Rate Schedule, or CMR, that thrifts are already required to submit
to the Office of Thrift Supervision. Other banking regulators are expected
to implement similar disclosures later this year, Sworobuk added, possibly
as soon as June.
        "These disclosures provided to the agencies under FIDICIA 305 would
meet the requirements initiated by the SEC," she said.
        The SEC amendments would only affect publicly traded institutions,
but it is also likely to have an effect on the business strategies of
acquisition-minded commercial banks, mortgage banks and thrifts. Merger
activity among banks has been strong over the last year, and SEC-regulated
lenders may have to more closely consider the derivative accounting
practices of any institution they've targeted for acquisition.
        "The proposed amendments were developed after extensive review by
the SEC staff of disclosures made by approximately 500 registrants and
consideration of the findings of studies published by various public and
private sector organizations," said SEC Chief Accountant Michael H. Sutton.
"The commission is hopeful that the proposed disclosures are responsive to
concerns of investors and will head to more useful disclosures about
derivatives and other related instruments."
        The SEC wants to improve what it considers inadequate disclosures
about companies' accounting policies. Its proposal would require "enhanced
descriptions in the footnotes to the financial statements of accounting
policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity
instruments," the agency said.
        The agency is also looking to improve companies' disclosures of
market risk, which the SEC said applies to financial instruments other than
derivatives. Here the agency said it wants to see both quantitative and
qualitative disclosures. For quantitative disclosures, the agency is
proposing three alternatives from which firms would be free to choose.
These are:
         Tables showing expected cash flows and related contract terms
categorized by expected maturity dates.
         Sensitivity analysis showing the possible loss in earnings, fair
values or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments from certain
hypothetical changes in rates or prices.
         Value at risk disclosures showing the  potential loss in earnings,
fair values or cash flows of market risk over a selected period of time
from events with selected probabilities of occurrence.
        The qualitative disclosures about market risk would cover how a
company manages its exposures with "a description of the objectives,
general strategies and instruments, if any, used to manage those
exposures."
 The third kind of problem the SEC wants to correct occurs when firms do
not provide information about derivatives tied to other activities that are
disclosed.
        "For example, when the information is required to be disclosed in
the footnotes to the financial statements about interest rates and
repricing characteristics of debt obligations, registrants should include,
when material, disclosure of the effects of derivatives," the SEC said.
        "Similarly, summary information and disclosures in Management's
Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") about the cost of debt obligations should
include, when material, disclosure of the effects of derivatives."
        In light of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
the SEC said it would look at ways provide a safe harbor where appropriate
in the derivatives disclosures. These particular proposals would generally
not apply to mutual funds or small business issuers, although some of the
disclosures could be required under separate regulations.
        The SEC said it will take comment on the proposals until May and
expects to revisit the rules after five years.

IRS FINALIZES DEBT FORGIVENESS REGULATION

The Internal Revenue Service's final rule on reporting of discharge
of indebtedness is much more acceptable to the lending industry than the
proposed regulation, which ran into a firestorm when published for comment
in 1993.
        America's Community Bankers reacted to the new rule by saying it
"substantially mitigated" the compliance burden on the lending industry
imposed by the temporary rule. For example, said James O'Connor, tax lawyer
for the ACB, the "indebtedness" on which reporting is required to limited
to stated principal and does not include interest and penalties.
        Rick Steinegar, chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association's tax
subcommittee and director of taxes for GE Capital Mortgage Corp. said the
rules "are an improvement over the proposed rule." For example, it gives
entities covered by the regulation until Dec. 26 to gear up to comply.
Moreover, it gives specific instances where disclosure is triggered, unlike
the proposed rule, which provided a less-specific "facts and circumstances"
criteria that would have made it more difficult for institutions to
determine if compliance was required.
        Steinegar also noted that the final rule will only apply to
"applicable financial entities," such as direct or indirect units of bank
or thrift holding companies and government-sponsored enterprises. That does
not cover independent mortgage bankers, he said.
        Independent mortgage bankers would be required to comply only when
they acted as a servicer for a government-sponsored enterprise, such as
GNMA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the VA.
        "It is much more specific and easy to comply with," he said.
        The regulations, published in the Jan. 4 Federal Register, require
financial institutions to disclose to the agency on Form 1099-C information
returns when borrowers negotiate a cut in principal on indebtedness of $600
or more. The issue has been a contentious one for mortgage lenders because
they say that the need for borrowers to pay taxes on the amount forgiven in
excess of $600 only exacerbates a borrower's problems.
        But lenders and borrowers were unable to win legislation mitigating
the need to pay taxes on forgiven debt, and have negotiated with the IRS
for several years on ways to least reduce the burden imposed by the need to
forgive debt.
        The final rules are effective for discharges of indebtedness
occurring after Dec. 21, 1996. No penalties will be imposed by the IRS for
failures to file until then, O'Connor said.

NOTEBOOK


HUD Finalizes Reg
For HECM Endorsements
        HUD-approved lenders participating in the Home Equity Conversion
Mortgage program will now find processing these loans without approval from
the department easier.
        HUD published its final rule Dec. 21 authorizing its approved
lenders to process HECM, or "reverse mortgage," loans under its direct
endorsement program. Lenders have been authorized to do so since Nov. 17,
but the final rule, which appears in the Dec. 21 Federal Register, makes
the change official; it also completes one of many streamlining procedures
HUD has initiated over the last several months.
        The HECM interim rule was issued Aug. 16. Under the rule, any HECM
that lenders have not issued a conditional commitment is eligible for
direct endorsement. However, lenders with fewer than 50 HECMs insured
before Sept. 15, 1995 must submit five HECM test cases to the local HUD
office for pre-closing review prior to endorsement for insurance.
        If HUD deems the underwriting of those test cases satisfactory, it
will give the lender unconditional authority to participate in the HECM-DE
program. o
Freddie Revises Rules
For Balloons and Resets
        Freddie Mac seller/servicers will need to contact reset and balloon
mortgage borrowers about 50 days earlier than they're used to, according to
revisions that Freddie Mac has made to its seller/servicer guide.
Under the revised guidelines, which were announced in Bulletin 95-13,
lenders must now notify borrowers between 100 and 110 days before the
loan's maturity date, if not required sooner by law. Under Freddie's
previous guidelines, lenders were required to contact borrowers at least 60
days before the balloon maturity date. Additionally, Freddie said it has
added information that servicers must include in the notification, and has
also provided more guidance to lenders in working with borrowers who do not
meet reset conditions and can't pay off their balloon/reset mortgages.
Freddie said the new requirement would take effect June 1. o
HUD Reaches Accords
With Nine FHA Lenders
        Nine FHA-approved lenders reached settlement agreements with HUD
for a variety of irregular actions involving Federal Housing Administration
programs, the department announced Dec. 12.
        The department's Mortgagee Review Board, which investigated the
lenders based on suggestions from HUD field offices, cited The Money Store,
Sacramento, Calif., for violations of HUD-FHA Title I property improvement
loan requirements. Specifically, the board said TMS failed to properly
service Title I loans, did not submit timely FHA insurance claims and
failed to report timely the sale of Title I notes and transfers of
insurance reserves. As a settlement agreement, TMS agreed to pay HUD
$35,000, cancel insurance on several loans and submit to future reviews by
the department.
        Among the other eight lenders HUD reached settlements with in
December was the New England National Mortgage Corporation, Andover, Mass.,
which was cited for permitting non-exclusive employees to originate FHA
loans, and First American Mortgage Co., Sulphur Springs, Texas, which was
cited for permitting borrowers to hand-carry verifications of employment
and failing to perform face-to-face interviews. New England National agreed
to pay an undisclosed civil money penalty and First American agreed to
indemnify HUD for claim losses. Both also agreed to implement corrective
actions.
        Other settlement agreements included: Western Fidelity Mortgage
Co., Salt Lake City; Pacific Inland Mortgage Corp., Anaheim Hills, Calif.;
Interbank Funding Group, San Diego; Mortgage America Nationwide, Grand
Terrace, Calif.; Unifed Mortgage Corp., San Diego; and Z and Z Funding
Group, San Diego. As part of the settlement, the lenders do not admit to
any fault or liability. o
Fed Offers Video
On Home Buying Process
        The Federal Reserve Board is offering an educational video for
consumers it hopes will enlighten prospective home buyers on the nuances of
obtaining a mortgage.
        The video, entitled "Both Borrower and Lender," is designed for
first-time home buyers and is divided into four segments: Financial
preparedness; types and terms of mortgages; the mortgage application
process; and settlement and closing. The entire program is roughly two
hours long with each segment runs about 30 minutes.
        The video can be reviewed on the American Bankers Association
satellite network, American Financial Skylink, Jan. 30, and is available
for single or bulk purchase from VIDICOPY at a rate of $12.95 each for
orders of 30 or fewer copies; orders of above 31 or more copies are
available for $11.45 each.

FANNIE JOINS RURAL HOUSING SERVICE'S AMERICAN INDIAN PILOT PROGRAM

Lenders will be able to begin offering mortgages to certain
American Indian tribes without the anxieties traditionally associated with
lending on tribal trust lands. Starting in January, Fannie will begin
taking part in the Rural Housing Service's Rural Housing Native American
pilot, but will limit its initial participation to 10 tribes.
        The eligible tribes include: Gila River, Arizona; Navajo Nation,
Arizona; San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico; Pala Band of All Mission, California;
Salish-Kootenai, Montana; Chippewa-Cree, Montana; Seminole Nation, Florida;
Cheyenne River Sioux, South Dakota; Lac Courte Oreilles, Wisconsin; and
Omaha, Nebraska.
        Fannie, which agreed to participate last summer and has committed
$20 million to the pilot, said these tribes were selected because they have
a good working relationship with RHS and the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
although it noted that 15 additional tribes may be added later in the
pilot.
        RHS has also determined that these tribes have a judicial system
that supports mortgage lending and are receptive to using debt refinancing
for new and existing homes. They are likely to approve the required legal
documents without extensive changes, and have at least 10 tribal members
who have sufficient income and credit histories to qualify for a mortgage,
Fannie said.
        In a related issue, Fannie (Announcement 95-21) has clarified that
it does not place a limitation on the number of Section 184 Indian Housing
Authority mortgages it will buy. In Announcement 95-06, the company said
those loans would be considered as being secured investment properties.
This prompted questions, the agency said, about whether a borrower
financing a number of properties is eligible.

Now DLJ is Dumping Its Mortgage Unit


Washington-A few weeks after it gave up on warehousing, Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette is looking to sell a major chunk of its mortgage affiliate, First
Franklin Financial Corp., San Jose, CA.

Sources told NMN late last week that First Franklin is shopping around its
mortgage servicing portfolio which may be as large as $7 billion.

First Franklin president and chief executive William Dallas, who sold the
company to DLJ in 1994, could not be reached for comment.

Last week servicing brokers said the portfolio could be a hard sell right now.

"A lot of what they have is California-based and it's likely they will not get
a good price for it with concerns about refinancings plaguing the market," a
senior mortgage official said.

One West Coast servicing broker said DLJ's merchant banking unit - which
controls First Franklin - hopes to get as much as $100 million for the unit,
"but likely won't.

"They were shopping it around for $100 million last year (1995)," the broker
said, requesting anonymity.  "If they can get $90 million, I think they'd take
it."

The broker said that DLJ likely will take a loss on the company.  "DLJ bought
the company at the top of the market," he said.  "Ultimately, this isn't going
to look good."

One source said, "this deal is going to hurt them (DLJ)," he said.  "I think
the merchant banking unit has a lot to explain to its investors."

First Franklin is the result of a merger between itself and Franklin Mortgage
Corp., Irvine, CA.  In 1994 Franklin also bought the Jacksonville, FL,
servicing operation of Ryland Mortgage Co., Columbia, MD.

In early December it was revealed that DLJ was exiting the warehouse/gestation
repo business, a line of products it had a strong presence in.

Low-Mod Mortgage is Freddie's Largest


Far Rockaway, NY-The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  has purchased its
largest mortgage loan ever, a $44.43 million multifamily mortgage secured by
Wavecrest Gardens, a 1,657-unit complex here.

Larson Financial Resources, a Program Plus lender based in Somerset, NJ, was
the originator of this mortgage, which was made to Goldfarb Properties, the
owner of the complex.

The mortgage is a 20-year fixed-rate loan with a gross spread of 175 basis
points over Treasuries, with a loan-to-value ratio of 75% and a debt service
coverage ratio of 1.38.

Freddie Mac's previous largest loan purchase was for $30 million in the
Chicago area.  Its average loan size for multifamily is $5 million.  It
traditionally has made loans on smaller properties.

Wavecrest Gardens is affordable to households with income of $34,000 or less,
which is 80% of the local median income.  The complex has no subsidized
apartments.

Thus this loan helps Freddie Mac meet its affordable housing mandates as
established by Congress for both low and moderate income families and for
central cities.  Far Rockaway is part of New York City.

Leland Brendsel, chairman and chief executive of Freddie Mac, said this
transaction "shows our strong commitment to multifamily lending."

The company has found that contributing to the deterioration of multifamily
housing are situations where owners are under economic distress.

It is important to create an economic situation where the owner can maintain
the building, Mr.  Brendsel said.

Freddie Mac is looking to work with high quality lenders like Larson and high
quality owners like Goldfarb that are committed to maintain the properties
they own, he added

Thomas J.  Watt, senior vice president, multifamily housing, added that the
deal is "tangible evidence of Freddie Mac's ongoing commitment to New York
City."

He likened Wavecrest Gardens to a community, with medical offices in a number
of buildings, an adjacent shopping center and even housing the local office of
Rep.  Floyd Flake, D., NY.

Rep.  Flake, whose tenancy mirrors the nearly 10 years that Goldfarb has
controlled Wavecrest Gardens, said the owner's "commitment far exceeds what
they've put in in dollars."

Since acquiring the complex, Goldfarb has done massive renovations to 70% of
the apartments.  The new loan will allow the owners to continue renovations
and make other improvements.

"Freddie Mac's financing of such a sizable, multifamily apartment complex
demonstrates its commitment to the stability of New York City's rental housing
market and to urban communities that have a vested interest in affordable
housing," Mr.  Flake said.

As of the end of November, Freddie Mac had purchased $180 million of
multifamily mortgages in the New York City area.

Mr.  Brendsel said the company expects to purchase $2 billion in multifamily
loans during 1995.

FASB Report Details Derivatives Disclosures


Norwalk, CT-Federal Accounting Standards Board disclosure of derivatives
holdings by several businesses - including several mortgage industry players -
are available in a recent 100-page report by the agency for $11 a copy.

Among the institutions studied are:  Astoria Federal Savings, Bank of America,
Chase Manhattan and Chemical banks, Citicorp, Crestar Financial, First
Chicago, Hibernia Savings Bank, Huntington Bancshares, J.P.  Morgan, Merrill
Lynch and Nationsbanc.

The report details several institutions' compliance with the 1994 FASB
Statement 119 that required business holdings such as swaps, options, futures
and forwards to record the fair value of these financial instruments in
certain ways on their balance sheets.

Statement 119 set new disclosure requirements for many futures market
derivatives that are not mortgage instruments, but often trade in the same
circles.

Fannie Goes for Stock Split and Buyback Plan


Washington-In a surprise move, the Federal National Mortgage Association last
Wednesday announced a four-for-one stock split and a stock buyback plan that
sent the company's stock up 5.25 points to $125 a share.

Fannie Mae stock has gained 15 points since Dec.  18.

"It is a nice bundle of goodies to put under the Christmas tree for investors
at the end of the year," said Thomas O'Donnell, senior analyst at Smith Barney
Inc.

"And unlike most goodies, it is not going to be in the trash heap in January.
It is going to be something that is going to carry through 1996 and 1997," Mr.
O'Donnell said.

The surprise move accomplishes several objectives for the agency.

First, Fannie Mae will diversify its capital base by issuing $1 billion in
preferred stock and use the proceeds to repurchase common stock, somewhere in
the range of 7.5-to-8 million shares.

Second, Fannie Mae will contribute three million shares ($375 million) to the
Fannie Mae Foundation to fund its charitable and affordable housing activities
through the end of this decade.

FNMA has been contributing $40 million a year to the foundation but this
contribution will allow the foundation to increase its spending on affordable
housing to $50-$70 million a year.

Fannie Mae will take a one-time $350 million charge in the fourth quarter, but
analysts believe it will help the agency meet its Federally mandated
affordable housing goals while reducing its affordable housing expenses going
forward.

Third, FNMA's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 6% of the
shares outstanding for additional capital restructuring.  Analysts believe
these buybacks will take place in 1997.

"With these initiatives, we will maintain our capital base comfortably above
the statutory requirements, enhance shareholder value, and further expand our
commitment to affordable housing," FNMA chairman and chief executive James
Johnson said.

Unlike its competitor, FNMA does not have any preferred stock on its books.
Noncumulative preferred stock currently comprises 14.7% of the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.'s total capital base of $5.54 billion.

"The issuance of preferred stock is capital neutral, but it gives Fannie Mae a
more diversified funding base," Mr.  O'Donnell said.  "You want to have more
than one funding source," he added.

FNMA's Federal regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight,
also gave its stamp of approval.

"Fannie Mae's capital restructuring plan will not affect the company's
compliance with capital requirements so long as any common stock that is
withdrawn is replaced by preferred stock that meets regulatory requirements
for core capital," OFHEO director Aida Alvarez said.

Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are at 52-week highs and Freddie Mac
currently has a $200 million stock repurchase plan in effect.

A Freddie Mac spokesman refused to comment on the possibility of a stock
split.

Fannie Mae shareholders of record on Jan.  8 will participate in the
four-for-one split and the additional shares will be mailed Jan.  12.

Fannie Mae chief financial officer Timothy Howard commented that the split
"should make its common stock more affordable and attractive to individual
investors."

Meanwhile, Mr.  O'Donnell of Smith Barney increased his estimate of 1996
per-share earnings from $9.85 to $10.  And he raised his 12-month target price
on Fannie Mae stock from $120 to $150 on a pre-split bases.

"With the mortgage market as strong as it is right now, the stock should
perform well," Mr.  O'Donnell said.

FNMA, NBA Teams Join Up for Rehabs


Boston-The Federal National Mortgage Association has formed partnerships with
10 National Basketball Association teams to rehabilitate housing in the
surrounding neighborhoods of the various teams.

Rehabilitation has begun on the second of five properties in Boston where FNMA
teamed up with the Boston Celtics and the city government to provide
renovation funds.

The rehabilitation will be financed with a grant of $125,000 from the Fannie
Mae Foundation, an undisclosed sum from the Boston Celtics and $100,000 from
the city of Boston.

The project is managed by Nuestra Comunidad, a nonprofit organization that
provides housing for low- and moderate-income families.

Employees of Fannie Mae and the Celtics will work together on the rehab.

Fannie Mae recently formed its partnership with the Atlanta Hawks.  It will
involve Hawks players and staff and Fannie Mae employees in consumer education
efforts to promote homeownership.

The Hawks Home Team along with Fannie Mae staff will participate in the
rehabilitation of two homes for low-income families in Atlanta's Martin Luther
King Jr.  historic district.

The project is managed by the Historic District Development Corp.  and funded
with a $75,000 grant from the Foundation.

As part of the Hawks partnership, Fannie Mae will become a broadcast sponsor
of the Hawks' games, airing advertisements that offer viewers free information
on becoming a homeowner.

Fannie Mae's partnership with the Houston Rockets will sponsor the
construction of two homes in Houston's Fifth Ward neighborhood.

The construction will be managed by the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment
Corp., a local nonprofit.

The Foundation provided a grant of $75,000.

Fannie Mae also became a broadcast sponsor for the Rockets' games.

In addition to the Celtics, Hawks, and Rockets, Fannie Mae has formed
partnerships with NBA teams in Seattle; Oakland, CA; Cleveland; San Antonio;
Milwaukee; Charlotte, NC:  Portland, OR; and Washington, DC.

By the end of the 1994-95 season, Fannie Mae's Home Team partnerships with NBA
teams have built or rehabilitated 29 homes in inner-city communities and the
Foundation has made more than $900,000 in grants to local nonprofit
organization to support the effort.

GSE Stocks Seen Staying High in '96


New York-In recent weeks, the stock prices of both the Federal National
Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  have been trading
near or above their previous 52-week highs and, according to one analyst,
should continue to trade at a high level into 1996.

Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst for Smith Barney, said, "the outlook for both
stocks is attractive and they should continue to trade highly.  The question
is whether Fannie Mae is a $125 stock that is going higher, or a $90-$100
stock masquerading as a $125 stock.  I think it's a $125 stock going higher."

Mr.  O'Donnell attributed the increased stock values of both companies to
numerous factors.

"Both stocks have done very well all year and the recent upswing could be
because a lot of people want(ed) the stocks in their portfolios by the end of
the year.  Another reason is that high-tech stocks have been in trouble while
the financials are doing very well.  Fannie and Freddie both represent
conservative financials - a good place to be.

Mr.  O'Donnell also said, "the fundamentals in the mortgage market are very
good, especially fixed-rate mortgages which can be sold in the secondary
market.  And then the monthly numbers each company puts out have been very
positive, and this attracts investors."

Another possibility for why the two stocks are trading at their 52-week highs,
according to Douglas Robinson, a spokesperson for Freddie Mac, is that the
stocks often trade in tandem with the bond market, which has been doing
reasonably well in recent weeks.

But even if the bond market falters, according to Mr.  O'Donnell, the outlook
for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock is quite good.

Asset Disposition Roundup


Washington-The Federal National Mortgage Association is consolidating all of
its property management and disposition functions to the Southwestern Regional
Office in Dallas.

The change will allow the secondary mortgage market company to dispose of
acquired properties "more quickly and efficiently," said Robert Engelstad,
senior vice president for mortgage and lender standards.

It also will enable the agency to offer lenders a full range of services "that
were previously available only in areas where we had large concentrations of
properties," Mr.  Engelstad said in a recent lender-letter.

However, Fannie Mae has elected to keep the post-foreclosure underwriting and
servicing review functions performed by each regional office in those offices.

"To assure a more consistent application of our underwriting and servicing
policies, we feel it is more appropriate to assign the responsibility ...  to
the servicer's leader regional office, particularly since that office is the
one that is already performing post-purchase underwriting reviews and
monitoring a servicer's delinquent loan servicing performance," the letter
explained.

The Dallas office will assume responsibility for managing and disposing of
properties acquired in the Midwestern region on or after Feb.  1.

Effective dates for further consolidation have not yet been set, but Fannie
Mae has targeted the Southeastern region for the first quarter of 1996, the
Northeastern region for the third quarter, and the Western region for early in
1997.

Smith Barney & Others Named in EA Suit


Washington-The government is suing Smith Barney Inc.  and an affiliate for
negligence in the sale of WESTSAV Mortgage Corp., Phoenix, a $2.2 billion
servicer that was sold by the Resolution Trust Corp.  in 1991.

Several other defendants were named in the case, including the winning bidder
for WESTSAV, Robert W.  Stallings, who renamed the company Express America
Mortgage Corp., and transformed it into an aggressive wholesaler with $6.5
billion in servicing.

In September 1994, Mr.  Stallings sold Express America's servicing to
NationsBanc, Charlotte, NC.  Express America no longer is in the mortgage
business.

The RTC charges that Mr.  Stallings and Robert H.  Brown, senior vice
president of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., Dallas, engaged in "bid
manipulation" that allowed Mr.  Stallings to buy WESTSAV at a significant
discount.

Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, the broker of record on the sale, was an affiliate of
Smith Barney, a relationship that was not known to the RTC, the lawsuit says.
Smith Barney served as the government's adviser on most of its mortgage
banking sales.

The government charges that the defendants' conduct, "resulted in the RTC
receiving many millions of dollars less for WESTSAV than it would have
received in an arms-length bidding process."

The agency believes it could have made at least $15 million more on the deal
if Smith Barney and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes had acted properly.

The RTC sold WESTSAV through a stock deal to First Western Partners Inc., Mr.
Stallings' company, in May 1991.  The net purchase price was about $26
million, according to the lawsuit.

Before buying WESTSAV, Mr.  Stallings worked for two S&Ls that later failed.
He served as chief executive of WESTSAV's parent Western Savings and Loan,
Dallas, before resigning in February 1990 to bid on WESTSAV.

In October 1990 four firms made final bids for WESTSAV:  First Financial Group
which bid $27.3 million (net to the RTC); First Western $31.8 million (net);
Maximilian $40 million (net); and Standard Federal/AMSI, $29 million (net).
The lawsuit did not specify their locations.

The RTC says First Western had no real financing lined up to buy WESTSAV but
the deal got pushed through by Mr.  Brown who was a long-time friend of Mr.
Stallings.

One Rauscher official, Tom Lykos, questioned First Western's financing but was
told by Mr.  Brown "not to worry about it," the lawsuit says.

The agency says Mr.  Brown gave "inside information" to Mr.  Stallings on the
pending sale.

The RTC also charges that Rauscher evaluated the bids incorrectly which
benefited First Western and Stallings.

"While RPR (Rauscher) reduced the First Western bid by the amount of WESTSAV's
liabilities, RPR also reduced the competing bids by the WESTSAV liabilities
which was wrong because the competing bids were submitted on a net basis," the
RTC charges.

The RTC investigated the case for at least two years.  The law firm bringing
the case on behalf of the government is Morris & Hecker, the same firm that
won large settlements in the government's case against Charles Keating and
professional defendants including several prominent law and accounting firms.

Mr.  Stallings could not be reached for comment.  Smith Barney also could not
be reached for comment.

Rauscher and Mr.  Brown released a statement saying the lawsuit is "without
merit."

The statement adds that, "based on our own investigation into the matter we
have no reason to believe that any RPR employee did anything illegal or
unethical in the course of the WESTSAV transaction."

Editorial:  Credit Where It's Due


The fact that a governor of the Federal Reserve Board got turned down for a
credit card is almost laughable.  And the fact that it was Lawrence B.
Lindsey, the central banker most involved with consumer credit, who has been
warning of the dangers inherent in bankers and other lenders turning their
decision-making responsibilities over to automated systems, makes it even more
ironic.

According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, Mr.  Lindsey applied for a
Toys 'R' Us card through Bank of New York, Delaware, which uses a strict
credit-scoring system.  The Federal Reserve official had refinanced a
mortgage; extended a line of credit and had several "routine reviews" of his
credit files over the past year.

So in spite of the fact that Mr.  Lindsey has a perfect payment record and
adequate income for the credit card account he wanted to open, the number of
lenders just looking at his background disqualified him under BofNY's credit
scoring.

And it seems, at the Delaware-based credit-card operation, while a human being
reviews all approvals, no one looks at the rejections based solely on score.

Of course as soon as the bank learned that it had rejected an application from
a VIP, it offered to issue a card with the full amount of credit Mr.  Lindsey
had been seeking.

The point is that no consumer who pays all of his bills on time should be
denied appropriate credit based on some arbitrary, non-thinking system.

We know of mortgage lenders where senior management reviews every rejected
loan application.  At these companies the question is can the application be
rescued and a means found of providing a mortgage.

Unfortunately the trend is in the other direction, toward arbitrary systems.
We don't think there's anything inherently wrong with credit scoring.  But
where it is allowed to make final judgments without any human, subjective
oversight it can get out of hand, as the incident with Fed Governor Lindsey
demonstrates.

Wisconsin had variable-rate mortgages before almost any other state.  The
state's former Sen.  William Proxmire, who was to become chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, as a young man saw a family member foreclosed
because of the over-rapid increase in payments on a VRM.

That incident probably delayed the implementation of adjustable-rate lending
by Federal financial institutions by eight to 10 years.

New technology must be programmed to serve people.  If we become subservient
to the technology we will have lost a lot more than we possibly can gain from
the workload it assumes.

Land Investor Turns from Selling to Developing Properties


Washington-When Eastern Realty won the bidding for a $99 million land
portfolio from the Resolution Trust Corp.  in late 1993, the exit strategy
called for selling off most the portfolio over time.

But times have changed and "now we find ourselves developing the larger
properties," ER president Jay Rollins said.

Eastern Realty, McLean, VA, and its capital partner are developing four
residential tracks it acquired in the land offering known as MACO III, named
after RTC's Mid-Atlantic Consolidated Office.

MACO III is an equity partnership and Eastern Realty is the general partner in
charge of managing, developing and liquidating the assets for RTC.

At a development site near Frederick, MD, Eastern Realty has delivered 12
finished lots to production builders and it is under contract to deliver
another 65 lots.  When completed, the MACO III land asset will have 300 home
sites.

Prior to starting ER, Mr.  Rollins was director of finance for NVR, a large
homebuilder based in McLean.  And his long-term goal is to expand ER's land
business with builders.

"Our business focus in the future will be equity joint ventures with
residential builders and developers," Mr.  Rollins said in an interview.

But right now, Eastern is concentrating on managing and working $400 million
in land and commercial assets it has acquired over the past 30 months with its
capital partners.

The partnerships have purchased raw and finished land, including residential
and commercial land, from New Jersey to Tennessee.

When Eastern Realty opened its doors in early 1993, land assets were plentiful
and capital was scarce.  "Return expectations on pure equity capital were in
the 40% range," Mr.  Rollins.

But the market for land has shifted dramatically, he said, after capital began
chasing the available product.

"Return expectations still are in the low 20's but it is very common to
leverage those returns with a debt component," he said.

With these changing market conditions, Mr.  Rollins has changed his approach.

In its most recent deal, Eastern Realty and a capital partner acquired a $31
million pool of hotel, office and land assets from First Fidelity Bancorp.,
Newark, NJ.

"We expanded our reach beyond land assets and purchased subperforming hotel
loans and a commercial office condominium project," Mr.  Rollins said.

He also pointed out that banks are starting to sell smaller pools of assets.

"We think the large portfolio sales are winding down," he said.  "We are
looking to buy single asset notes, primarily land, and smaller pools of
assets," Mr.  Rollins said.

As part of its operations, Eastern Realty also services land and construction
loans for banks and other investors.  The company currently services $40
million in land and construction loans.  Its biggest client is Nomura Asset
Capital Corp., New York, the land financing arm of Nomura Securities.

MBS Roundup


Chicago-A recent report on Norwest Corp.  by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.
here cites the banking company's "flexibility to recognize the significant
off-balance-sheet values housed" in its mortgage banking subsidiary as a
reason for comfort in its capitalization levels.

This was cited as one of the justifications for DCR assigning an "AA" rating
to a $200 million medium term note issue from Norwest Corp.

Des Moines, IA-based Norwest Mortgage was the top originator in the country
during the third quarter, with volume of $10.7 billion for the three-month
period, and has the fourth-largest servicing portfolio in the industry, at
$100.1 billion as of Sept.  30.

The mortgage operation is one of several "well-diversified" sources of revenue
for Norwest Corp.

"The efficiencies of scale have become apparent in Norwest Mortgage's reported
profitability over the past year.

"Positively, application volume and the level of unclosed loans are at high
levels, suggesting that performance should remain strong through the
seasonally slow winter months," DCR said.

But Credit Availability Keeps Growing


New York-Credit availability for the nation's construction contractors
continues to expand, according to an annual survey conducted by the
Construction Financial Management Association, Princeton, NJ.

Eighty-four percent of respondents said that access to credit had improved
this year, up from 78% last year, and 38% said their working capital line of
credit had increased in 1995, versus 29% last year.

Danny B.  Parrish, national president of CFMA, said, "this is terrific news.

"Lenders' confidence in the construction industry - evidenced by their
granting easier access to credit and larger credit lines - should mean higher
volume and revenue in 1996."

The survey polled 5,000 companies with annual revenues greater than $1
million.  But despite their easier access to credit, respondents were not as
optimistic about future contract revenue as they were last year.  Fifty-five
percent in 1995 anticipated an increase in next year's contract revenues, down
from 64% last year.

Effort to Save LIHTC Gets Bipartisan Support


Washington-Proponents of the low-income housing tax credit have lined up a
majority in both houses of Congress to save the tax credit from the budget ax.

The budget balancing bill vetoed by President Clinton would have phased out
the LIHTC in fiscal year 1997 and saved the Federal government $3 billion by
2002.

But the negotiations to rewrite the budget bill are giving LIHTC proponents a
second chance to preserve the tax credit that currently produces 100,000
rental units each year and approximately 90% of new and rehabilitated
affordable housing nationwide.

"The program works," Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D'Amato, R.,
NY, said at press conference in which a bipartisan group of congressmen,
mayors and business leaders urged Congress to keep the program alive.

"There is very solid support for the low-income housing tax credit program,"
Sen.  Paul Sarbanes, D., MD, said.  "It desires to be retained."

Sales of the tax credits to corporations and individuals raises equity to
finance the construction of affordable housing.

At the press conference, the Enterprise Foundation, Columbia, MD, and the
Local Initiatives Support Corp.  here announced that they plan to raise $4.5
billion in equity from selling tax credits and develop more than 100,000
affordable housing units over the next seven years if the credit is preserved.

"To sunset the most effective tool ever found to attract private capital to
the housing needs of working families is contrary not only to good policy, but
to common sense," said LISC president Paul Grogan.

While cutting the LIHTC program is a budget game, the program has its critics
because the sales of the tax credits involve syndication fees and it is
estimated investors expect a 15% return on their investments along with the
tax advantages.

Syndicating limited partnerships to individuals is technically complex and
expensive and the U.S.  General Accounting Office estimated several years ago
that syndication costs consume 27% of the equity raised.

In addition, the Internal Revenue Service and state housing agencies are
supposed to monitor compliance with the LIHTC requirements, but IRS is not set
up to administer a housing program.

The LIHTC program has become threatened many times before and it is an easy
target for congressional budget cutters.

However, advocates of affordable housing are aware that Congress is reducing
the Federal government's role in providing low-income housing and LIHTC
program is one of the last and most popular housing programs left.

"Subjecting, the credit to a year-by-year review creates a disincentive for
investors and developers, and could ultimately destroy what has become one of
the most effective programs for producing low-income housing in America," said
Enterprise Foundation chairman and chief executive Barton Harvey, IL.

Even critics agreed that year-by-year extensions of the tax credit is the
worse way to administer the program.

It increases the risks to developers and drives up the risk premium investors
demand when they purchase the credits, a budget analyst said.

Letter to the Editor


To the Editor:

I was misunderstood and sequentially misquoted in a front page article in the
Nov.  20th issue of National Mortgage News.  Reporter Brad Finkelstein quoted
me as saying:  "More and more companies are turning away from brokers.  There
is a cumulative amount of evidence that loans from brokers are not as high
quality and (the wholesalers) are taking action.  There is a lesson in this
for mortgage brokers."

I hadn't seen or read the article before I stood accused of being "too close
to the banks" and unfair to brokers.

Brokers need to know that the reporter got part or my remarks to him right,
part wrong.  I clearly said some of those things, but there were three
separate ideas in separate contexts.

By linking two ideas, the flight from wholesale and a lesson, with a third,
loan quality, in a single paragraph, the reporter mistakenly attributed to me
something Jim Johnson said.  I don't think brokers originate inferior quality
product.  To the contrary.  Let me explain.

When the reporter called recently and asked what I knew about PNC, I said two
things:  1) there was a change in management and 2) the company closed its
table funded broker operation.  A contact at the company had days earlier
confirmed these developments upon my inquiry.

I told the reporter that PNC is the forty-second "name" to exit wholesale the
past 18 months.  (Wholesale Access keeps the scorecard via The Wholesale
Directory, so we know.)

We talked about Jim Johnson's remarks in San Diego.  I raised the subject,
having read an article about the conference in September's Origination News.
I said I thought Johnson probably had it wrong.

What I believed was that brokers don't determine quality - wholesalers do,
they underwrite.  What I heard was that the data Fannie Mae have probably only
shows the recent economic misfortune of the country's two largest markets,
California and New York/New Jersey.

Property values, home prices and activity are soft in these areas right now.
Unfortunately, both are markets where brokers are the pre-eminent originators.
They get well over 50% of total originations in these markets.  So, guess
what, a downturn occurs and a correlation between brokers and higher
delinquency surfaces.  Hardly a surprise.

Frankly, I believe that Johnson linked the two developments together before
MBA audiences in order to justify adopting tiered pricing based on type of
originator.

NAMB needs to deal head-on with the TPO issue Fannie Mae's chairman raises.
Otherwise, it will miss an important opportunity to set the record straight.
This was the lesson - not broker quality, or the disappearance of a myriad of
names from wholesaler ranks.

EDS:  AU Removes Bar to Direct GSE Lending


Arlington, VA-Nothing currently prevents the secondary market agencies from
lending direct to the consumer, says Larry Walker of EDS.

Speaking at a conference here, he said, that is why "the term 'rip our face
off' comes to mind," when the industry assesses the significance of the
agencies' recent automation efforts, including automated underwriting.

Despite the fact that the agencies say their charters don't allow them to lend
direct to the consumer, Mr.  Walker said, neither agency's charter expressly
prohibits consumer lending.

"Their charter doesn't provide for them to act as technology vendor either,"
he added, echoing a point which others have made to National Mortgage News.

"Fannie and Freddie between them account for more than half of the technology
dollars spent so far this year in the U.S.," Mr.  Walker said in a follow-up
interview, referring to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.

He had given an address entitled, "The effect of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's
technology on the marketplace," at an electronic mortgage lending conference
run by AIC.

In a subsequent discussion, Mr.  Walker said, "of course Congress could
prevent it, but - while the agency charters don't provide for direct lending -
there is nothing there to stop it."

As to why the agency charters are widely perceived as direct lending
obstacles, it is possible that many may not have looked at the actual
documents, he said.

The Mortgage Bankers Association shares his interpretation of the agency
charters, Mr.  Walker said.

Despite painting an ominous scenario, Mr.  Walker said of the agencies, "at
this point we probably should believe them."

But, since, he continued, "the agencies have all the keys" he counseled
lenders to position themselves so as to be less dependent on the agencies.

Besides the specter of the government-sponsored agencies replacing lenders,
Mr.  Walker - who directs the real estate and mortgage industry group EDS, a
Plano, TX, technology vendor - said in his address, "there is a fear the GSEs
will replace software vendors."

He was particularly critical of Fannie Mae which he said "has gone further"
than Freddie Mac.

Fannie Mae had less financial need to get into technology sales and has
offered technologies which extend beyond its legitimate need for upholding
credit quality (something for which automated underwriting is used), he said.

Additionally, Fannie's network is less open to censorship than Freddie's, he
said.

He also questioned recent advertising campaigns in consumer publications by
Fannie Mae.

"If they're not going direct to the consumer, why are they running ads in
Ladies Home Journal?," he asked the audience.

Also regarding motivation to enter the technology arena, he said Freddie Mac
was somewhat forced to change its function.  That's because the agency was
formed to serve thrifts but the thrift crisis eliminated much of its customer
base.

"So, the only ones we could give credence to would be Freddie Mac," Mr.
Walker continued.

Noting that Fannie Mae goes beyond offering automated underwriting, to Desktop
Originator, an origination system for brokers, and to Desktop Trader, he said,
"Fannie Mae seems to be going down the path of software writer again."

He was referring to Fannie's purchase, in the 1980s, of Servantis Systems
Inc., a Norcross, GA, firm which it subsequently sold.

Servantis, which lately goes under the name of SSI, provides origination and
servicing software.  (Fannie used to market the origination product as
MORTRACKS, Mr.  Walker noted.)

Last August, a Fannie Mae representative publicly said "we're a technology
vendor.".

Regarding the agency networks, Mr.  Walker contrasted Fannie's silence with
Freddie's announcement that it does not monitor traffic through its network.

Unlike Fannie's Mornet, Freddie's Goldworks is run by a third party (Advantis
Inc.  of Schaumburg, IL).

Although both agencies have likened their electronic network to a mall, in
which they are but one store, Mr.  Walker argues the analogy doesn't hold well
for Fannie.

"The difference is that Fannie owns the mall - and the security system -
whereas Freddie rents," he said.

HUD Sale Features Nonperforming


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development's next sale will
feature $700 million in nonperforming single-family loans, with 40% of the
houses in California, Colorado and Texas.

The bid date on the 16,700 loans is scheduled for March 20 and HUD is trying
to make its second single-family sale more attractive to regional lenders and
small investors.

HUD wants to lower the minimum bid requirement from the current $5 million and
create pools in terms of performance/delinquency status and by location.

But the final structure of the sale has not been determined yet and bid
packages are not expected to be ready until early February.

The Federal Housing Administration-assigned loans in the sale have already
gone through a 36-month forbearance period and the entire pool has a weighted
average coupon of 10% with remaining maturities of 15-20 years.

Hamilton Securities Group here is advising HUD on the March sale; it also
worked on the October sale in which four winning bidders divided $524 million
in FHA one-to-four-family loans.

Home Building Slows for Three Quarters


Washington-The home building industry slowed down nationwide during the first
three quarters of 1995, with the number of single-family building permits
issued dropping in 24 of the top 25 most active major markets - and in 47 of
the top 50 - according to the National Association of Home Builders.

Jim Irvine, president of the NAHB, said, "builders across the country are
experiencing a somewhat slower year.  Housing starts in 1995 have been
leveling off since a strong 1994.  Builders should see some slight improvement
in 1996, if interest rates remain in the current 7.5% range and the overall
economy shows some growth."

Atlanta was the only market among the top 25 in the nation to increase its
single-family permits through the first nine months of 1995.  In Atlanta, the
most active market, there were 26,886 single-family housing permits issued, a
5.8% increase over 1994.

Only two other markets in the top 50 showed increases in single-family housing
starts through three quarters.  They are Memphis, which increased 1.9%, and
Grand Rapids, MI, which increased 7.8%.

The second most active was Phoenix/Mesa, which despite its high ranking,
experienced a 3.5% decline in the number of permits issued.  Rounding out the
top five, the third most active was Chicago, down 8.8%, fourth was Washington,
DC, down 16.7%, and fifth was Las Vegas, down 5.9%.

However, the NAHB said that the nationwide decline in the number of
single-family housing permits issued was somewhat offset by an increase in
permits for multifamily units, as multifamily construction continued its
increase from its depression of 1993.

Overall, of the top 50 most active markets for issuing single-family permits,
27 declined more than 10% through the first nine months of 1995, with five
declining more than 20%.

Equity Roundup:  GSE Stocks Haven't Seen Their Best Days Yet


New York-Smith Barney asks the question, "are Fannie and Freddie's best days
behind them?"  Its answer, "No.  In fact, we think that there is no credible
evidence that the profitability of the two housing-related
government-sponsored enterprises has passed a peak."

Smith Barney said some investors have expressed concern that the recent run-up
in the stock price of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  might have left their shares susceptible to
a free-fall.

But fear that the two GSEs have become too big and are due for a downfall is
nothing new.  According to Smith Barney, since 1991, doubters have been saying
that the two companies are so big, and so dominant, that their profitability
has peaked.

The most commonly stated reason for their contention, Smith Barney said, is
that almost 60% of all mortgages have been securitized - one of Fannie and
Freddie's two basic businesses.  Doubters fear that if more than half of the
market has already been securitized, there simply cannot be much more room to
grow.

But Smith Barney is upbeat regarding the GSEs, saying, "we see a business that
should be trending upward on a structural basis - leaving cyclicality and rate
movements aside - in coming years."

Smith Barney cites the following:  a trend toward global funding which will
broaden the market for GSE debt and reduce funding costs, a new lending
criteria to serve the vastly underserved affordable housing market,
technological initiatives which should widen the housing market by increasing
speed and reducing origination costs, and increased expense control which will
be helped by technology.

Smith Barney, however, did caution, "neither we nor our model have been able
to detect GSEs' business in a structural decline.  But, of course, the past is
prologue and the bear case could prove right, going forward.  However, we
don't think so."

Glenfed Withdraws Goodwill Settlement Offer


Glendale, CA-Unless the government shows signs of negotiating seriously by the
first of the year, Glendale Federal Bank said it will withdraw its proposal to
pledge settlement funds to public policy investments.

Stephen J.  Trafton, Glendale Federal's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the government's seeking of "an appeal to the United States Supreme Court
of a very strong U.S.  Court of Federal Claims decision in favor of Glendale
Federal that was affirmed overwhelmingly in a 9-2 ruling by the U.S.  Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit could represent another lost opportunity."

He warned that "the amount of the bank's damages grows each day that the
litigation continues, and with a final judicial resolution of the liability
issue, we may be compelled to accept nothing less than unconditional cash
payment for damages."

Glendale Federal had offered to commit $1.5 billion, an amount it says it can
document having lost as a result of the government's breach of a supervisory
goodwill agreement involving Glendale's bailing out a failing Florida thrift.
As a result of the government reneging, Glendale says it was forced into a
massive and costly recapitalization.

"Now that the government has filed its appeal to the Supreme Court, we must
limit the time for acceptance of our settlement proposal," said Mr.  Trafton.
"Damage to the bank continues to grow as the government extends the
litigation, and a final judicial resolution of the government's liability
would cast the entire issue of settlement into question."

The Supreme Court may decline to consider the government's appeal, in which
case the liability judgment against the government in the Court of Federal
Claims would stand without possibility of further appeal.

Glendale Federal Bank is one of the largest savings institutions in the United
States, with 148 bank offices and 22 loan offices in California.

REIT '96 Outlook:  Steady Performers


San Francisco-In 1995, the yields on top stocks left even the leading real
estate investment trust issues in the dust.

But in 1996, say a variety of observers, fund managers increasingly will tuck
away 1995 profits in REITs, which, though not spectacular, can be counted on
to perform reliably.

Paul Puryear of Raymond James & Associates in St.  Petersburg says his firm
remains bullish on REITs for 1996 because "REITs are developing a track record
of delivering on earnings."

Predicting that the stock market as a whole will slow down, Mr.  Puryear told
NMN that low interest rates, low inflation and a probable slowdown in the
economy will make REIT earnings look more attractive in 1996.

"Twelve to 18% total returns look good in that environment," he said,
predicting that more utilities will invest in REITs.

REITs allow real estate investment without the management headaches.  Because
the underlying fundamentals for real estate are very strong right now, mutual
fund managers will look to these investment vehicles for the "hedge factor,"
A.G.  Edwards analyst Arthur Havener said.

A low-interest environment offers REITs cheaper capital, noted Mr.  Havener,
predicting the availability of 10-year financing in the 6%-7% range.  He said
leading REITs will want to amass cash in the bank "in anticipation of the
acquisition market picking up again."

This year, Mr.  Havener said, a number of real estate sellers are sitting on
the sidelines awaiting the outcome of the capital gains issue.  With or
without capital gains tax relief, many will sell, and REITs will share in the
harvest.

The highly fragmented and undermanaged self-storage industry will offer a
number of acquisition targets that could roll up into "one big REIT," said
NAREIT's Virginia Wade.

Chicago-based Real Estate Research Corp.  says pension funds in particular
will look more favorably on REITs in the coming year.  RERC surveys show that
55% of pension funds intend to increase their REIT investments in 1996.

"REITs have matured in the last several years," says RERC researcher Robert
Bergson.  He said they have increased their attractiveness to traditionally
conservative institutional investors, despite the funds having been burned by
REIT investments in the eighties.

Cindy McHugh of Equity Residential Properties Trust concurs that REIT
investments by pension fund will increase in 1996, but said the increase will
be "very, very slow.  Their due diligence process is very extensive."

And REITs are increasingly using the Internet.  NAREIT - very much involved in
making the public more aware of REITs - has a web site, and Kranzco Realty
Trust, a shopping center REIT and pioneer in using the World Wide Web, told
NMN its Web experience has been very positive.

"We've gotten a lot of feedback from analysts, investors, brokers and
tenants," said Michael Kranzdorf, the company's director of information.  He
said he expects more REITs to tout themselves on the Web because it has proven
more effective than any other medium in drawing direct inquiries from
investors.

"In 1996, for the first time in several years South West Property Trust
expects the supply of new apartments in its markets as a whole to modestly
exceed demand," said a September SWP report.

That potential softness in rental markets for cities like Dallas has drawn
considerable attention, but Mr.  Puryear said people in the apartment REIT
industry "are watching apartment start data very closely" in those markets and
"there is a definite constraint on supply."

Despite talk of an overabundance of apartment REITs, he expects the leading
residential REITs to remain strong performers.

Some apartment REIT stocks that "stagnated all year" are now "setting new
highs every day," said Mr.  Havener.  "Bay Apartments has taken off; it's now
in the $23 and change area."

As REIT managers maneuver to enhance unencumbered revenues to achieve growth,
1996 will continue to be a year of the balancing act.  REITs are not
structured to amass war chests.  The attractive feature of them for investors,
as Ms McHugh points out, is the dividend.  Major investor Ken Heeber, who has
been exiting REITs this year, has been quoted as grumbling that they are
showing FFO growth of 10% to 15%, with dividends lagging at 5%.

Grumbles like that can hurt.  To increase or not to increase dividend yields
may be a big question for REITs in 1996.

Duff & Phelps Likes Selloff of PruHome


Chicago-The sale of Prudential Home Mortgage Co., Clayton, MO, should result
in reduced consolidated financial leverage for its parent company Prudential
Insurance Co.  of America, Newark, NJ, according to a report from Duff &
Phelps Credit Rating Co.  here.

On the other hand, by selling the mortgage operation, Prudential loses the
benefits of "good, long-term returns" and would have to replace those to
maintain its historical corporate-wide earnings potential.

"It is anticipated that business opportunities to expand existing businesses
with less interest rate sensitivity and lower earnings volatility would
eventually be sought as the strategic direction of The Prudential under its
new chairman, Art Ryan, becomes more focused on the company's core insurance,
health care and investment management businesses," DCR said.

Mellon Bank Is Set to Buy Source One


Farmington Hills, MI-Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, will be purchasing Source
One Mortgage Services Corp.  here from Fund American Enterprises Holdings
Inc., Norwich, VT, industry sources confirm.

The sales price is set at a premium of $65 million over the company's adjusted
book value at the closing date.  The adjusted book value was $285 million at
the end of the third quarter 1995, according to a Fund American spokesperson.

Lehman Brothers served as Fund American's adviser in this transaction.

Fund American would not disclose who the purchaser was other than to say it
has signed a letter of intent with a "significant financial institution."

The buyer is a "first rate organization" that is a "good match" for Source
One, the spokesperson said.

Mellon said it had no comment.

A definitive agreement will be signed before the end of this month.

Source One, which currently services $33 billion, is a low cost servicer, with
excess capacity available, which makes it attractive for an organization
growing its servicing, added the spokesperson.

During the refinancing boom of the early 1990s, Source One was subject to
severe run-off problems with purchased mortgage servicing rights.  To make up
earnings, the firm later sold portions of its servicing portfolio.

Fund American placed Source One on the auction block in August 1994, but
failed to get its price and pulled the company.  Lehman Brothers had also
served as adviser in that attempt.

Source One's servicing portfolio dropped from $40 billion at the end of the
third quarter of 1994 to $28.6 billion at the end of the third quarter last
year, a 28.5% decline, according to data from a National Mortgage News survey.

But the company has been growing the portfolio again, the Fund American
spokesperson said.

The same survey has Mellon Bank as the nation's 11th-largest servicer, with a
portfolio of $45.67 billion.

On a pro-forma basis (and including the pending Chase Manhattan/Chemical
merger), the Source One/Mellon combination would constitute the industry's
seventh-largest servicer, at more than $78 billion.

What was not a factor in Fund American's decision to sell was fears about
run-off in a declining interest rate environment, coupled with a new rule that
equalizes the accounting treatment between originated and purchased mortgage
servicing rights.

"Portfolio run-off is a difficulty for the entire industry.

"But that is not a major consideration here.

"In the mortgage business, especially with FAS 122, you have to accept that
(servicing) is volatile," the spokesperson said.

Source One had originations of $3 billion for the first nine months of 1995,
of which 60% was retail and 40% wholesale.

Mellon has been an active buyer of mortgage servicing as of late, with its
most significant deal coming in September, when it purchased Metmor Mortgage,
Overland Park, KS, from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, for
$165 million cash.

In that deal it acquired a $13 billion residential and commercial servicing
portfolio.

Back in 1994, it acquired U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage Co., Portland, OR, a $4.3
billion servicer.

Mellon also was a bidder in a bankruptcy court-ordered rebidding for Lomas
Mortgage USA, Dallas, but was not the winner.

Separately, Mellon announced it has named Ronald E.  Stroble national retail
production manager for Mellon Mortgage Co.

He joined Mellon as part of the U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage deal (where he was
production manager), and will remain based in Portland.

Mr.  Stroble is responsible for Mellon's 107 retail production offices
nationwide.

Construction Contracts Fall by 4%


New York-The value of new construction contracts fell 4% in October to an
annualized $289.7 billion, according to the F.W.  Dodge Division of
McGraw-Hill.

Each of the construction industry's three main sectors - nonresidential
building, housing and nonbuilding construction - showed modest declines from
relatively healthy levels.

Robert A.  Murray, vice president for economic affairs for F.W.  Dodge, said,
"following the generally strong level of contracting during 1995's third
quarter, the loss of momentum in October did not come as much of a surprise.

"It's consistent with various signs of a slower pace for the economy, and it
continues a pattern which has been present throughout this construction
recovery of strengthening activity followed by a pause."

F.W.  Dodge reported that during October, nonresidential building decreased 7%
to $104.8 billion from September, a lackluster amount by recent 1995 standards
but still a 4% increase over 1994's average rate.

The most pronounced downturn was felt in the institutional building categories
where slower contracting for schools, hospitals and detention facilities led
to a 14% decline from September.  Mr.  Murray said that while institutional
building has been a steady source of expansion during the past 18 months, the
October decline is suggestive of a slowdown in growth in the near future.

Other nonresidential building, such as office construction and industrial
plants, also fell from recent levels.

Residential construction, at $125.6 billion, fell 1% in October.  F.W.  Dodge
said that four of the nation's five major regions reported moderate
reductions, while the South Central region boasted a 5% increase.

Nonbuilding construction dropped 3% in October to $59.4 billion, entirely due
to a sharply reduced amount of utility construction, which on a month-to-month
basis can be volatile.

Overall in 1995, total construction was up 1% over the first 10 months of
1994.

o The Manufactured Housing Institute, Arlington, VA, announced that during
October manufactured home shipments topped 30,000 homes for the fourth time in
1995.  The shipment of 32,663 manufactured homes was a 15.6% increase over
October 1994.  Through the first 10 months of this year, there were 286,013
homes shipped, a 12.4% increase over last year.

o Bell Federal Savings and Loan Association, Chicago, announced in their
Survey of Building that total building permits for new homes and multifamily
housing in the Chicago metropolitan area dropped 6% during October from the
level reported in 1994.  Home permits fell 2% and multifamily permits fell
16%.

Throughout the metropolitan area, 2,094 permits were issued during October for
single-family homes compared with 2,130 in 1994, with the city of Chicago
nearly doubling from 75 to 140 while the suburbs fell from 1,884 to 1,776.

In the seven-county metropolitan area 757 multifamily permits were issued
during October, down from 904 last year.  Multifamily housing permits dropped
9% within the city of Chicago and 19% in the suburbs.

Permits issued for both single-family homes and multifamily units through the
first 10 months of 1995 totaled 25,248, a 4% decrease from the 26,356 reported
through October of 1994.

DejaVu Half-a World Away


New York-When the Japanese government moved just before yearend to vote a
modest amount of public money to help deal with a mountain of bad real estate
and housing loans, we felt the early 1980s had come 'round again.

There is a strong public reluctance in Japan to the use of taxpayer money and
strong sentiment for leaving the mess to the banks involved (and those that
are not) to clean up.

The decision to seek a taxpayer bailout has been politically divisive and
there is speculation that Japan's Finance Minister will resign as a result of
the uproar.

What the Japanese have done is to allocate $6.8 billion in public money to
create an agency which will use the funds and loans from banks and other
financial institutions to dispose of all the bad assets (did someone say
Resolution Trust Corp.?).

There are eight jusen, or housing loan funds, which were created essentially
as affiliates of other financial institutions.  The big money-center banks,
many of which owned large shares in the mortgage firms, have agreed to write
off a big chunk of the $64 billion in losses that are expected from the
liquidation of seven of the eight mortgage firms.

According to Thomson BankWatch, the stumbling point for some time has been the
allocation of the substantial losses among the creditor group, and whether the
government would provide direct assistance.

There are two aspects to the plan.  The allocation of approximately '6.3
trillion in "first round losses" from jusen problem loans.  Second, is the
establishment of the Jusen Resolution Corp.  (JRC) to liquidate, over a
10-year period, approximately '3.3 trillion in problem assets backed by some
form of collateral and '3.5 trillion in performing assets.

Regarding the allocation of the first round losses, founding banks of the
jusen will write off 100% of loans, or '3.5 trillion.  Other bank lenders will
write off from 40% to 60% of their loans, to total '1.7 trillion.

The agricultural credit sector will write off an amount equal to less than 10%
of their exposure, or '530 billion (this is the interest earned on loans made
to the jusen since initial restructuring plans started in 1993).

Finally, the government will provide '685 billion in the 1996 general budget
into seven special accounts (one for each of the housing loan companies) in
the deposit insurance authority.  These funds will also be used to cover first
round write-offs of unrecovered loans.

The JRC will acquire the remaining '6.7 trillion in loans, of which about half
are nonperforming, but backed by some collateral.

These assets will be purchased by the JRC at face value, with funding in the
form of low-interest loans from the founding banks, the agricultural credit
sector and other lenders.

The JRC will be capitalized at '100 billion by founding banks and the deposit
insurance corporation (the latter using funds provided by the Bank of Japan).

The JRC will maintain the loans in seven separate accounts - one from each of
the original housing loan companies.

Founding banks, together with the government, are expected to share ultimate
losses on these assets, in a yet undefined ratio.

The JRC, with an expected life of 10 years, will be staffed by housing loan
company employees as well as law enforcement officers, prosecutors and tax
officials.

The proposal has split the ruling coalition in Japan's legislature, the Diet.
While most observers expect the Diet to approve the proposed bailout as it is
spelled out in the government's budget, that approval is not assured.

There is a huge volume of bad loans piled up by the country's eight mortgage
companies.  For the most part, these unrecoverable debts were put on the books
in the 1980s when the companies took on huge property deals, most of which
went bad as the Japanese economy tanked early in this decade.

Finance companies and agricultural cooperatives also were substantial
investors.

The banks and other investors in the jusen had about $130 billion invested in
them as of last March.  The seven troubled companies reported bad assets
between 40% and 70% of total assets.

The government had encouraged formation of the jusen.  Loans from banks and
others accounted for an increasing portion of the housing market and the jusen
took their surplus loan funds into highly speculative real estate deals, in
much the same fashion as did many of the "high-flier" thrifts which ignored
housing to take advantage of expanded powers at both the state and Federal
level.

Most economists believe that on the whole, bad loans at these institutions
account for more than half the total.

The forgiveness of loans by the big banks will be accompanied by some new
lending by agricultural cooperatives and assistance from other financial
institutions.

In addition to the $64 billion already recognized as unrecoverable, some
estimates are that the mortgage companies have $12 billion additional in loans
that will have to be written off.  But this is just the beginning of the
process of cleaning up Japan's bad-debt problem.

The Japanese financial system is believed to have more than $400 billion in
bad debts, and the country's banks have been retreating from aggressive
foreign investment to a more insular approach.

As a result, Japanese banks have been taking big losses on real estate
investments in the U.S.  In many cases, the percentage of loss for Japanese
investors has equaled that of the RTC when it was selling properties acquired
by failed savings and loans.

In Japan, the farm cooperatives will fare better than any of the other groups
involved in the government-sponsored solution.  They will be asked to make
grants and low interest loans to the new agency totaling about $5.3 billion.

In exchange their $5.5 billion in claims for loans to the mortgage companies
will be repaid.

Prime Minister Tomichi Murayama made no bones about the fact that it is the
social and political importance of agriculture that shaped the decision to
favor the cooperatives in structuring the workout plan.  But the decision was
political with the Agricultural Ministry winning out over the Finance Ministry
on the issue.

This is in sharp contrast to the policy followed by the U.S.  Government,
which beginning in the early 1980s followed a policy favoring the commercial
banks in each phase of the savings and loan and real estate workout, but never
has enunciated the reasoning behind its actions.

Nonbank financial institutions in Japan, which have about $17 billion on loan
to the mortgage companies, can kiss that amount good-bye and are being asked
to provide both capital and loans to the rescue agency.

Observers suggested that the $6.8 billion in public money may be only the
beginning for the Japanese taxpayer, particularly if the economy worsens
and/or real estate prices decline further.

But it seems to us that the Japanese have made a pretty good start on their
problem in contrast to a dozen years ago, when politics in this country
produced a policy of inaction.

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board had asked for $15 billion to be charged to
the thrift industry as a means of tackling the problems that were emerging in
Texas, California, Arizona and Ohio, among others.

The S&L industry balked, both at the size of the payment and at the idea of
the FHLBB having that much money with which to close down institutions.

Looking back, the $15 billion would not have solved the problem, but it
probably would have saved $50 billion or more of the eventual cost.
Institutions that could have been shut continued to operate - and to bleed -
until 1987, or even later.

The industry's cost went well beyond $15 billion and if the Savings
Association Insurance Fund legislation is any guide, the price will go up
still further.

By short-circuiting the politics and reaching down for public money in the
initial phases of its workout, the Japanese Finance Ministry likely is
reducing the long-term cost to that nation's citizens.

GlenFed Selling $2B in CMOs


Glendale, CA-Glendale Federal Bank recently put $1.8 billion in fixed-rate
collateralized mortgage obligations up for sale in a move that will mean
taking a $30 million after-tax loss for the quarter ending Dec.  31.

About half of Glenfed's CMO portfolio had been sold by mid-December and the
bank reported that it expected to complete the sale by early 1996.  Glenfed
then plans to replace the fixed-rate securities with adjustable rate assets.

The CMOs are all short-term securities that were categorized as having an
average life of two to four years when the bank purchased them about two years
ago, according to retail bank operations staff.  Most are first tranche
investments but a few are second tranche, issued from at least 20 different
sources and backed by a diverse, nationwide base of loans.

Bank president Stephen J.  Trafton said the bank took advantage of a one-time
window of opportunity covering a 90-day period between mid-November and Dec.
31, 1995 to reclassify the assets.  The move was allowed under Federal
accounting standard 115.

"These sales will improve our capital ratios, thus freeing up capital for
possible use in pursuing additional merger and acquisition and other
reinvestment strategies," he said.

The reclassification is designed to make Glenfed's portfolio more "flexible,"
Mr.  Trafton said.  A bank analyst has recently named Glenfed a takeover
candidate, but a bank spokesman said Mr.  Trafton's comment about mergers and
acquisitions "has nothing to do with fattening ourselves for somebody else."

In addition to putting the CMOs on the market, the bank simultaneously
recategorized $1 billion of its adjustable rate pass-through securities
portfolio as "available for sale," but has no immediate plans to sell them,
officials reported.

The bank has been selling off loans and loan products since last year, when it
made plans to achieve a goal ratio of 70% deposits to 30% borrowings for its
conversion.  The bank's ratio of deposits to borrowings was 60% to 40% as of
its last earnings report on Sept.  30.

In preparing for conversion, the bank also is bracing itself for an upcoming
$47 million loss that will hit when the Federal budget reconciliation bill
passes.  The loss is a one-time assessment Glenfed is being charged to
recapitalize the Savings Association Insurance Fund when it converts.

Fleet Selling Mortgages To Fund NatWest Buy


Boston-Fleet Financial Group's strategy for acquiring NatWest Bank will put
billions of dollars in securities and residential loan assets on the market as
it sells off large portions of NatWest's loan portfolio as well as its own to
fund the move.

Fleet plans to sell off $18 billion of its holdings (mostly mortgages and
securities) and $13 billion of NatWest's to finance the $3.26 billion deal.
About $1 billion is to be used to fund the transaction while the rest goes to
retire debt.

"We were able to realign our balance sheet fairly dramatically in terms of
certain assets being replaced by loan assets," said president and chief
executive Terrence Murray, who said at a recent press conference that he was
pleased that Fleet was "selling no stock to complete this transaction and
financing largely internally."

Fleet's vice chairman Jay Sarles will become chairman of the new combined
Fleet Bank of New York, that includes the NatWest holdings.  NatWest chairman,
president and chief executive John Tugwell will become Fleet Bank of New
York's president and chief executive.

Most of the loan assets being sold will be residential mortgages that the bank
plans to replace with other loan types, said Fleet executive vice president
Eugene McQuade.

"In terms of the balance sheet restructuring, what we're talking about doing
both at Fleet and Natwest is to eliminate mostly low-yielding assets, mostly
investment securities and residential mortgages," he said.

"Essentially, we will make room on the balance sheet for higher-yielding
assets which we'll get from NatWest, which essentially are commercial and
industrial loans and consumer loans."

Officials at Fleet could not immediately be reached for further comment about
the composition and amount of mortgages and securities they would be selling
to finance the acquisition.

But Sept.  30 earnings reports from the companies indicate that billions of
dollars of loans from each bank's portfolios must be involved.

Fleet had $51 billion in net loans and NatWest had just $19 billion.  Loans at
that time made up about 60% of each bank's total assets.  A spokesman said
that Fleet's figures included the loan assets of the recently acquired Shawmut
National Bank.

Securitizations potentially involved $4.757 billion of mortgage-backed
securities Fleet classified as available for sale Sept.  30.  Shawmut had
$3.28 billion on its books at that time, most of which were classified as
held-to-maturity, according to earnings reports.  At both banks the MBS
represented about 40% of their total securities holdings.

Other funds involved in the deal include about $200 million that will be saved
when Fleet lays off about 1,800 employees and closes 30 of NatWest's 300-plus
branches, Mr.  McQuade said.  Most branch closings are expected to be in Long
Island, NY, where the two banks have the most overlap, and most staff cuts
will be corporate finance, technical and back-office jobs.  About half the
positions are expected to be lost through "attrition."

After $2.7 million in cash is raised for the deal, to be paid at closing
slated to occur in the second quarter of 1996, Fleet will have up to eight
years to pay NatWest's London-based parent the remaining $560 million in
payments linked to the acquired bank's earnings.  These will be annual
payments equal to about 50% of NatWest's earnings each year.

Fleet also plans to issue $600 million in preferred stock equity and $400
million in securitized debt, Mr.  McQuade said.  National Westminster Bancorp
has agreed to buy $300 million of the preferred stock issued, he added.  The
British company also agreed to keep $375 million of NatWest's problem loans
and repossessed properties in the deal, according to ratings agency reports.

Ratings agency analysts have primarily given the deal good reviews, but a few
have expressed concerns about how the sale will affect company in the next few
years.

In addition to putting more MBS on the market, the acquisition also could
potentially affect $1.8 billion in securities, according to Moody's Investors
Service, which has revised its rating outlook for these credits upward to
"positive" from "stable."

"While FLT's leverage will increase initially, creditors should benefit from a
better earning asset mix, a lower reliance on purchased funding, enhanced
revenues and expense reductions," Moody's reported.

The rating agency also reported that Fleet will benefit from strengthening its
market in the Northeast, strengthening its presence in New York and New
Jersey.  But Fleet's decision to acquire NatWest so soon after merging with
Shawmut may "present a significant challenge for FLT's management."

Because of this, analysts at Thomson Financial Services believe the
acquisition could potentially have negative implications for the company's
credit in the next one to two years until it can prove its ability to rebuild
capital.

"The increase in risk of the new asset mix will likely put a strain on reserve
coverage," Thomson's BankWatch, Inc.  reported.  "Although the acquisition
reduces FLT's reliance on purchased funds and pro forma, FLT's balance sheet
clearly has a higher risk profile."

Thomson viewed the bank's longer-term and shorter term credit more favorably.

The Haves and Have-Nots


by William J.  McDonough President, Federal Reserve Bank of New York

Mr.  McDonough recently spoke about the business community's stake in
improving inner-city areas.  His remarks were delivered at the winter
management conference of America's Community Bankers and have been excerpted
as our Open Forum.

In the long-run, I am convinced, economic development can be sustained only if
the growing economic pie is shared by all parts of society - rich and poor,
urban and rural, skilled and less skilled - and by all racial groups.  Unless
all parts of society share in and therefore have a stake in economic growth,
we cannot have the social and political cohesion that is essential to sustain
growth.

I will not dwell on what government can and should do.  Those debates are
going on in Washington, and elsewhere, and we are well aware of the issues.
Broadly, I think there is widespread agreement that efforts by Federal, state
and local governments to reduce regulations can lead to lower costs, making it
easier to do business and create jobs.

Moreover, it is also clear that government is a key player in improving our
public education system.  But government action alone is not sufficient.
Government efforts require the essential underlying support of the private
sector.  Private sector participants need to redouble their efforts to bring
job growth and prosperity to all levels of our society.  This is a task the
government simply cannot shoulder alone.

Private sector involvement is important not only for philanthropic reasons but
also for reasons of raw self-interest.  A recent report of the Committee for
Economic Development summarizes in a concise and persuasive way why each of us
- particularly those who are business leaders - have a stake in the inner
cities.

First, inner-city blight undermines the fiscal and operational health of major
cities because distressed neighborhoods contribute little to a city's tax base
yet impose heavy demands on public services.

Second, cities possess significant national economic assets in the form of
productivity-enhancing infrastructure and unique cultural institutions, as
well as anchors to the economic growth of their suburbs.  Inner-city distress
weakens the value of those assets.

Third, employers must rely for their future workforce on groups heavily
represented in inner cities.  The inadequacy of educational preparation in the
inner cities can diminish the quality of this nation's human capital, a key to
economic growth and prosperity.

Fourth, the costs of inner-city problems fall on taxpayers wherever they
reside.

Finally, there is an inconsistency between the isolation of our distressed
urban neighborhoods and our national ideals of equality of opportunity for all
persons.

I commend the CED report to you and its recommendations for greater
business-sector involvement with community groups in rebuilding areas where
economic blight is most concentrated.  I share many of the views expressed in
the CED report and believe the time is short to act upon them.

I know that you as community bankers play a particularly important role in
providing financing for local communities.  I also know that many of you are
currently involved, as we are at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a
wide range of educational and community development initiatives.

For example, I am well aware that banks have accomplished a great deal in
activities encouraged by the Community Reinvestment Act.  I am also well aware
that many in this audience generously support development efforts through
philanthropic and civic organizations.

In fact, I sometimes think that too little attention is given to the many
successes that have emerged from partnerships between business and community
groups around the nation.  There are several key elements in those successful
efforts that provide lessons for the types of involvement that the private
sector might undertake.

First, by their support and active involvement, mainstream corporations can
provide well-organized community groups with the ability to leverage the
necessary resources to initiate comprehensive community-building strategies
that will be sustainable over the long-term.

For example, the members of the South Bronx community development corporation
in collaboration with such partners as the New York City Partnership and the
Local Initiatives Support Corp., and with the support of financial
institutions and the active participation of community residents, have
transformed their part of the South Bronx from rubble-strewn lots to a vibrant
community.

Second, the private sector can provide part of the financing required for
community development, and I believe that banks can and should play a greater
role in this area.  Communities need access to capital to improve their
infrastructure, create housing, and attract the businesses that create jobs.
While financial institutions are a critical part of a comprehensive strategy
and a source of capital to communities, it is important to look to other
institutional players as well.

Third, the private sector can provide critical technical assistance.  My
institution, as most of you know, cannot provide capital to local communities.
Nevertheless, volunteers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have
provided technical assistance to community-based organizations by sharing
expertise in financial analysis, computer system design, and strategic
planning.

As another example, our Bank prepared a guide for small business owners
intended to facilitate communication between entrepreneurs and bankers, as
well as identify other sources of finance and assistance.  Over 140,000 of
those pamphlets have been distributed nationwide through our offices in the
last year.

Fourth, the private sector can play a key role in training our future work
force as well as retraining the adult population in the skills needed in
today's high wage industries.

At my Bank, we have a team that recruits staffers to serve as mentors for
local high school students and to speak in classrooms - thereby attempting to
bridge the gap between the workplace and school.  One group has had so much
success helping elementary school pupils improve their academic performance
that the students' parents have asked for a tutoring program, too.

Finally, private industry can work in partnership with established local
community groups.  These grass-roots are the people who know their
neighborhoods and know what is most likely to work or not work.  What these
groups do not need is others telling them what to do; what they do need is the
willingness of businesses and individuals to work in partnership with them.

Commercial Builder Withdraws From Soft California Market


Irvine, CA-Kitchell Contractors Inc., Phoenix, a leading commercial and
industrial construction firm, is closing its 40-person Irvine office - just as
a major U.S.  homebuilder comes roaring into Orange County from Florida.

Ranked 17th on this year's Business Journal list of commercial/industrial
construction firms, Kitchell found its Orange County revenues from operations
dropping 38% this last fiscal year, from $34.5 million to $21.5 million.  At
its peak in the 1980s Kitchell employed nearly 100 people at the Irvine
office, with annual revenues pushing $120 million.

Kitchell characterized its withdrawal from Irvine as an "office consolidation"
and said it is actually hiring additional project managers for construction
projects handled from its Phoenix and Las Vegas offices.

A Kitchell spokesman said fierce competition for a shrunken pool of Southern
California building starts has created a profit squeeze that makes other
Southwestern markets more attractive.

The spokesman said the company will retain its Sacramento office, which
manages lucrative public sector construction.  Kitchell is a leading criminal
justice construction manager, "with 100,000 prison and jail beds delivered."

Meanwhile Florida homebuilder Lennar Corp., the seventh-largest homebuilder in
the nation, has headed in the opposite direction, staking out a Southern
California toehold following a major expansion into Texas, where it plans to
build 1,000 homes next year.

Having gained control of one bankrupt Orange County builder, Lennar has been
in negotiation to take over another.  Lennar has acquired $160 million in old
debt of Bramalea of California Inc.  and is in negotiation with bondholders of
Baldwin Builders.

A U.S.  Bankruptcy Court judge has given Baldwin a brief extension on the time
it can keep its doors open by paying operating expenses out of funds earmarked
to repay a $70 million debt to its former lender G.E.  Capital.

Miami-based Lennar is known for gaining market share by buying land cheaply
and leveraging its purchasing power to get volume discounts on materials to
build low-priced entry-level homes.

SEC Eases Prospectus Delivery Requirements for MBS


New York-The Securities and Exchange Commission has reduced its prospectus
delivery requirements for mortgage- and asset-backed investments as it
re-examines its rules.

The SEC no longer requires dealers and brokers to deliver a preliminary
prospectus 48 hours before confirming a transaction as long as purchasers get
a final prospectus before or simultaneous with their confirmation.

Exemptions from the 48-hour notification only apply to investment-grade
asset-backed securities with no more than 25% of their principal balance held
in the prefunding account.

The relief from the 48-hour requirement will be available for a two-year
period while the SEC studies the rule, which it has begun to re-examine at the
request of the Public Securities Association.

The 48-hour preliminary prospectus requirement dates back to 1969 when it
originally was designed to offset "concern with perceived sales abuses arising
in connection with initial public offerings of companies with no reporting
history, many of which were of a 'highly speculative' character," according to
PSA reports.

Although asset-backed offerings "generally involved an issuer which, at the
time of the offering, has not been filing periodic reports," PSA argued that
"the absence of such reports ...  should not be construed to imply between the
asset-backed securities market that the offering falls into the 'new or
speculative' category that originally led to adoption of the rule."

RTC Auction Gets High Return on Performing SF Loans


Kansas City-The Resolution Trust Corp.  sold $577 million in performing and
nonperforming loans at its eighth and final national loan auction, recovering
$404 million or 70 cents on the dollar.

The open outcry auction included residential, commercial and consumer loans,
but residential mortgages accounted for half of the recoveries.

Bidders paid $105.5 million on the sale of $109 million in performing
one-to-four-family conventional loans or 96.6% on the dollar.

This recovery rate is slightly higher than the 90% RTC secured in the last
national loan auction held in May.

But the recovery rate on nonperforming one-to-fours dropped significantly.
RTC got 69 cents on the dollar for nonperformers in May but only 61.9% in the
December auction.

Bidders at last month's auction paid $41.2 million for $66.6 million in
nonperforming one-to-four-family conventional mortgages.

First Financial Network, Oklahoma City, conducted the May and December
auctions for RTC and in each auction the loans were divided into very small
pools and bid individually.

RTC did nearly as well in the sale of performing condominium loans as in
one-to-fours.  The auctioneer sold $29.4 million in performing condo loans for
94.9 cents on the dollar.  Some $12.9 million in nonperforming condominium
loans sold for 52.6 cents on the dollar.

The auction featured only $5.4 million in FHA/VA loans and the performers sold
for 99.8 cents on the dollar and nonperformers sold for 72.2 cents on the
dollar.

In terms of commercial mortgages, RTC sold $39.9 million in office loans and
recovered 65 cents on the dollar and $59.3 million in multifamily loans and
recovered 70.1 cents on the dollar.

Developed land credits made up $103.4 million of the loans auctioned off that
started Dec.  13 and RTC recovered $67.3 million or 65 cents on the dollar.

The three-day auction in Kansas City started Dec.  13 and it attracted 233
bidders.  There were 101 winning bidders, RTC said.

RTC Closes its Doors After Resolving 747 Failed Thrifts in 6 Years


Washington-The government's effort to deal with the savings and loan crisis of
the 1980s came to an end last week when the Resolution Trust Corp.  closed its
doors.

The agency had resolved 747 failed S&Ls and sold off $465 billion in assets.

The six-year, $90 billion effort marks the greatest liquidation program ever
undertaken and the resolution of the most costly financial crisis since the
Great Depression.

When RTC started out in August 1989, many believed it would take at least
until the year 2000 to clean up the debris of the S&L industry.

And others feared the agency would be consumed by mismanagement and
corruption.

RTC quickly became a political football for Congress as the Bush
Administration, and later the Clinton Administration had to beg for additional
funding to resolve the growing number of "brain dead" thrifts.

Each mistake the agency made was magnified in a fish bowl of constant
criticism.

Now the agency that couldn't do right in the eyes of many has completed its
mission ahead of schedule.

"In retrospect you can always say it could have been done better," Federal
Reserve Board Alan Greenspan said.

"But let me tell you, if you look at the size of what has been done, the
efficiency in which it was done, this is one of those extraordinary
achievements," Mr.  Greenspan said at the last RTC oversight board meeting.

"You have a great success on your record.  Be proud of it," former RTC chief
William Seidman told an auditorium full of RTC employees last month, many of
whom now are being laid off.

Led by then FDIC chairman Seidman, a cadre of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
executives built an asset management and sales organization that grew to 9,000
employees despite relying extensively on the private sector.  During its six
years, RTC issued 158,000 contracts to private firms worth $5 billion.

"We had a tough time getting the operation going," Mr.  Seidman admitted.  RTC
had a convoluted command structure and Treasury Department officials kept the
agency bound up in a confusing approval process.

RTC was criticized for holding assets and was criticized at the same time for
selling assets.

"For every Congressmen that told us to sell a property now there were those
who said hang on to it," Mr.  Seidman said.

The collapse of much of the S&L industry coincided with mounting bank failures
and a real estate market that was depressed and caught in a credit crunch.

To get its sales efforts going, RTC had to restart the markets and find new
ways to sell failed S&Ls.

This took innovation on the part of RTC executives, including president David
Cooke, thrift resolution chief William Roelle and asset sales chief Lamar
Kelley, who were willing to experiment and learn from mistakes.

RTC began by breaking up S&Ls franchises and selling the branches separately
from the assets.

The agency adopted a wholesale strategy for selling assets that included large
public outcry auctions of real estate and loans, securitizations of performing
and nonperforming loans and structured transactions that allowed RTC to sell
real estate or loans in $100 million multiples.

RTC entered a fledgling commercial mortgage-backed securities market in 1991
and issued $16.5 billion in CMBS over the next four years.  RTC also
securitized $23.7 billion in one-to-four-family mortgages.

What was considered risky and controversial in these areas a few years ago now
is considered standard practice.

RTC just concluded its eighth and last national loan auction where it sold
$577 million (book value) in performing and nonperforming and nonperforming
loans for $404 million or 70 cents on the dollar.

And RTC just issued its last CMBS, a $325 million offering, with barely any
mention or notice in the press.

But many of RTC's early initiatives were not as successful.

In a public relations flop, RTC had to cancel its first $300 million real
estate auction because the auctioneer failed to put up $2 million for
marketing expenses.

RTC also tried blind sales, because it had problems finding and identifying
assets for bulk sales, and creative financing schemes, like cash-flow
mortgages, so it could sell empty office buildings and hotels.

These experimental transactions evolved into bulk sales, called structured
transactions that commercial banks and insurance companies later adopted to
get rid of the problem real estate assets in their portfolios

But RTC's first structured transaction, a $180 million offering of
nonperforming commercial mortgages, raised a stink in the press because the
winning bidder Maxxam chairman Charles Hurwitz formerly owned a thrift that
failed.

Last week FDIC sued Mr.  Hurwitz for $250 million in damages, alleging he
contributed to the failure of United Savings Bank of Texas, Houston.

In most instances, the buyers who stepped up to the plate first, walked away
with the best deals.

For example, G.E.  Capital Corp., Stamford, entered into an agreement with RTC
to buy $1 billion in nonperforming commercial mortgages and share 25% of the
profits with RTC.

The RTC Inspector General estimates that GE will make an 70% gross profit
margin on its investment.

RTC learned from these transactions, however.  More buyers came to the table
and RTC got better prices once the risk takers like GE showed the way.

But political fights over RTC funding and a parade of scandals and snafus took
its toll on RTC executives.  As a scapegoat, David Cooke was forced out in a
political deal to get additional funding for RTC.

The refusal of Congress to confirm President Clinton's nominee to run RTC put
thrift resolution chief Roelle in a position of getting tarred in the
Whitewater scandal.

As the remaining executive, Mr.  Roelle briefed acting RTC chief and Treasury
under secretary Roger Altman about RTC's investigations into President
Clinton's ties with a failed Arkansas thrift, Madison Guaranty.

Revelations that Treasury officials passed this information to the White House
forced Mr.  Altman to resign from Treasury.

Mr.  Roelle was forced to take a less visible position at RTC and he returned
to FDIC.

Mr.  Kelley, who guided RTC's asset sale program, was able to leave RTC
without a cloud.  But like, Mr.  Roelle, he left quietly and with little
thanks.

One of RTC's most persistent Congressional critics has been Rep.  Bruce Vento,
D., MN.  He continues to give RTC bad marks for failing to develop an
information system to keep track of assets and contracts.

And as the chairman of an RTC oversight task force for the House Banking
Committee, he was instrumental in getting RTC to adopt many management
reforms.

Nevertheless, Rep Vento hopes the expertise RTC developed with its "on the job
training" will be transferred to the FDIC and he believes a Federal asset
disposition agency should be created to protect the taxpayer's dollars and
assets.

"The Federal Housing Administration is an example of why the Federal
government ought to have this expertise," he said.

FHA is in the process of selling off billions of dollars of nonperforming
single-family and multifamily loans and it has adopted many of RTC's sales
practices.

"They have obviously moved the assets," Rep.  Vento said.  But he cast doubt
on RTC's claim that it recovered 87 cents on all the assets it sold.

"How they come up with these figures with such a high return is sort of
questionable," he said.

The RTC figure does not take into the account the fact that the thrifts had
already written down the loans before RTC took over the institutions.

"While there will always be critics pointing to places where RTC tripped or
stumbled, anyone who looks at the whole picture will be impressed, Mr.  Cooke
claimed at the RTC pep rally.

"You successfully balanced the conflicting demands to sell assets quickly and
at the best price.  At the same time, we opened up housing opportunities for
lower-income families and provided new opportunities for minority contractors
and small investors," he said.

"Congratulations for a job well done," Mr.  Cooke said.

Lenders Expect FHA Loans to Be Covered


Washington-As the partial Federal government shutdown enters its third week,
lenders continue to make Federal Housing Administration loans with the
understanding that the Department of Housing and Urban Development will
process and insure the loans once it reopens.

FHA's handling of the first shutdown gave a lot of lenders comfort, according
to Mortgage Bankers Association staff vice president Brian Chappelle.

"But it is getting a little more nerve-racking as this shutdown goes on week
after week," he said.

However, the Veterans Affairs mortgage program becomes a bigger problem
starting Jan.  1 because Congress failed to extend lenders' authority to
negotiate interest rates.  As a result, VA officials set the interest rate at
7% late last week.

So lenders will have to make VA loans at 7%, which is a bit low and the buyer
cannot pay the points.  "It is going to raise a myriad of processing
problems," Mr.  Chappelle said.

Meanwhile, the Government National Mortgage Association continues to guarantee
securities for issuers that purchased commitments prior to the Dec.  16
shutdown.

After the first shutdown around Thanksgiving, "a number of issuers came in the
door to purchase commitment authority so they would not be caught during the
shutdown period," according to the GNMA president Kevin Chavers.

But a couple of issuers didn't make it through the door.  "There is nothing we
can do for them.  There is no commitment authority to be purchased," Mr.
Chavers said.

Meanwhile, FHA is not processing endorsements, according to Sarah Rosen
special assistant to the FHA commissioner.  "So lenders are taking some risk
if they close a loan," she said.

However, lenders can still obtain loan case numbers through CHUMs lender
access system and get credit checks electronically, she said.

Although HUD has no funding, the Senate did confirm the nominations of Mr.
Chavers to be Ginnie Mae president, John Knubel to be HUD's' chief financial
officer, Dwight Robinson to be deputy secretary for housing and urban
development and Hal DeCell 3d to be assistant secretary in charge of
Congressional and public affairs.

Brazos Fund Closes Kemper Deal


Dallas-The Brazos Fund L.P.  has completed the purchase of $1.5 billion in
distressed real estate assets this year, including a huge transaction
involving Kemper Finance Services that closed just before Christmas.

The size of the Kemper insurance company portfolio is believed to be about $1
billion and the assets have been divided between the newly created Brazos Fund
and the Argo Fund, which is another real estate investment fund managed by
J.P.  Morgan & Co., New York.

Investor Robert Bass created the Brazos Fund and its limited partners include
public and private pension funds, endowments, family trusts, commercial banks
and insurance companies.

The fund started its acquisition train in March with $140 million in capital
and Brazos has completed 13 acquisitions ranging from a $25 million
acquisition from Home Savings of America, Los Angeles, to a $1 billion
portfolio acquisition from a Canadian thrift called North American Trust Co.

Brazos had a Canadian pension fund as a capital partner in the North American
Trust transaction, according to Brazos Partners president Rob Gidel.  John
Grayken is the managing director of the fund.

Brazos also has a strategic alliance with BlackRock Asset Investors, New York,
which invests in commercial mortgage-backed securities.

Brazos is currently in the process of restructuring its portfolio to see which
assets can be sold as whole loans or in securitizations.  Mr.  Gidel expects
that the sales strategy will be set early this year.  "Our business is not to
accumulate assets under management," he said.

If they are securitized, Brazos intends to retain and service the "B" pieces
through its asset management affiliate, Brazos Advisors L.L.C., which is in
the process of being rated as a special servicer.

Brazos Advisors services all of the Brazos Fund assets, including all the
assets from the North American Trust deal and its share of the Kemper deal.

Those deals exemplify Brazos' preference for negotiated deals and why it stays
away from competitively bid transactions such as the multifamily sales by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.

"When you get into those controlled auctions it's just not going to meet out
pricing objectives," Mr.  Gidel said.  "The pricing is too rich for us."

However, Brazos participated in the last Resolution Trust Corp.  loan auction
in Kansas City and actually "picked up an asset," he said.

"We do try to understand what is going on at these controlled auctions and see
what the pricing is.  You never know, you may end up buying something after
the auction from the people that win it," he said.

Brazos also looked at the recent Sanwa Bank portfolio that the Japanese bank
sold to Berkeley Federal Bank & Trust FSB, W.  Palm Beach, FL.  The Southern
California portfolio included $160 million in performing and nonperforming
mortgages.

Mr.  Gidel expects the Japanese banks will be selling more assets this year.

"We have done three deals with Japanese banks.  We obviously think that's
going to be an opportunity for us in the future," he said.

Through the alliances with co-investors and leveraging its capital, the Brazos
fund still has $100 million to invest.

"We see some exciting opportunities up in Canada.  The dynamics up there look
very similar to what we saw in the states a couple of years back," Mr.  Gidel
said.

But he expects to see fewer sales by U.S.  banks and insurance companies this
year.

"However, there are interesting opportunities among operating companies that
are looking to divest themselves of real estate," Mr.  Gidel said.

Bank of America To Offer Fixed-Rate Prepayment Penalties


San Francisco-Bank of America plans to offer up to one-eighth or one-fourth of
a percentage discount on interest rates for fixed-rate home loans that carry
prepayment penalties, said Claus Lund, senior vice president of mortgage asset
management.

A "handful" of such loans have already been made on an experimental basis,
spurred by the success of Bank of America's adjustable rate prepayment
penalties and prepayment penalties in the commercial mortgage-backed
securities market at large, Mr.  Lund said.

"The MBS market will accept those loan types because they will be protecting
the investor and we believe the market will start paying up for that type of
asset," he said.  "I think a lot of investors in servicing will realize that
this has potential."

The Federal National Mortgage Association and Morgan Stanley & Co.  have shown
interest in the new loan, which will penalize borrowers 2% of up to 80% of
their outstanding loan amount if they prepay within the first three years, Mr.
Lund said.

So far, the collateralized mortgage obligation market is showing more of an
interest in the fixed-rate prepayment penalty loans than the mortgage
pass-through market, he said.

The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  has been less receptive to the
prepayment penalized loans, Mr.  Lund said.

Previously, banks have been adverse to affixing prepayment penalties to
fixed-rate mortgages because they look unfriendly to borrowers, he said.  But
Mr.  Lund said he believes the discount offered for the penalties will be
favorable to borrowers as well as investors.

"This is not something where we're going out and providing the borrower with
what is an unpleasant asset," he said.  "This is something where the borrower
can take advantage of a better rate if they know they are going to be in their
house for some time."

Bank of America may not be the only large lender considering making such loans
at a time when low rates and refinancings have led to "purchased assets
disappearing quicker than a snowman in July," Mr.  Lund said.  But he believes
the bank is "one of the pioneers in the field."

The move marks an increased re-emphasis on securitization concerns at the
bank.  Securitization and secondary market business have been comparatively
light over the past few years, but added that the bank is a long-time player
in the field, having issued the first private MBS in the mid-'70s.

Thus far in the 1990s, Bank of America has securitized $2 billion to $4
billion of its loans each year, he said.  This year it has done about $2.5
billion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securitizations and about a half billion
in private issues, Mr.  Lund said.

BF Enterprises Reports Income Loss


San Francisco-BF Enterprises Inc.  reported that for the three months ended
Sept.  30, net income was $80,000, or 2 cents per share on revenues of
$1,429,000.

For the same period in 1994, net income was $339,000, or 9 cents per share, on
revenues of $870,000.

The company said that the reduction in income in 1995 was due primarily to a
lower level of lot sales to builders at the company's Meadow Pointe project
near Tampa, FL, and a substantial decline in the rent being received during
1995 from the company's commercial building in Tempe, AZ.

As a result of the amendment of the original lease and the execution of a new
10-year net lease of the Tempe property, annual rental revenue from that
property is expected to decrease to approximately $350,000 in 1995 from
$505,000 in 1994, but will increase to approximately $1,450,000 in 1996.

Real estate revenue for the 1995 third quarter and nine month periods included
$804,000 from the sale of a commercial property in Edina, MN, for which the
company reported a loss of $29,000.

BF Enterprises is a San Francisco-based real estate holding and development
company.

First Union Completes Record-Setting CMBS Conduit Offering


Charlotte, NC-Increased acceptance of mixed-use commercial mortgage-backed
securities helped First Union Capital Markets Corp.  complete a record-setting
$643.7 million offering.

Michael Greco, managing director of First Union National Bank of North
Carolina's commercial real estate finance unit, said the shift in the market
recently allowed his bank to make what he said is the largest conduit-financed
CMBS deal to date.

"The mixed pools are doing better than multifamilies and that wasn't true a
year ago," he said.  Investors "have embraced the diversity of property
types."

First Union claims its deal is more than double the size of the previous
record conduit offering.  The portfolio includes $553.6 million of publicly
offered securities and $90.1 million of subordinated securities privately
placed with a real estate investment trust, Mr.  Greco said.

The securitization is a "simple" collateralized mortgage obligation structure,
secured by a geographically diverse pool of mortgages, in which the greatest
concentration - less than 20% - are located in Texas, he said.

The next two heaviest geographic concentrations are in California (16%) and
Massachusetts (8%).  More than 60% of the pool was made up of multifamily
loans, 23.5% were retail, 8% healthcare, 3% hotel, and the remainder are
office, industrial and mobile home properties.

The publicly traded securities were rated AAA, AA and A by Standard & Poor's
and Duff & Phelps and the privately placed securitizations were rated BBB
minus.  The average loan size was $4 million.

RECOGNIZING DIFFERENCES: CCUL MAY CONTEST UNITY WITH ITS STATE
REGULATOR

The California Credit Union League warned its state regulator it
will fight the merger of credit union regulatory responsibilities into the
state's banking department unless it can guarantee the industry won't be
treated like banks.
        Among CCUL's concerns are retaining specialized examiners,
increased operating fees, sustaining relations with NCUA including
protecting state authority from federal encroachment and assurance that the
new regulator will promote the league's legislative agenda.
        The State of California Department of Corporations, Business and
Transportation Agency promulgated a proposal to transfer regulatory and
supervisory duties for credit unions, presently within the DoC, to the
Department of State Banking.
        John Annaloro, the league's senior vice president of public and
government relations, told California's DoC in a Dec. 9 letter that the
league's concerns "at a minimum, would have to be resolved to our complete
satisfaction before credit unions could consider supporting any
consolidation effort."
        CCUL is fighting a battle that 44 other states tussled with and
lost--but not necessarily to their detriment. "Consolidation isn't
necessarily awful. The key is the supervision has to be credit union
specific," Doug Duerr, president and CEO of the National Association of
State Credit Union Supervisors, told NCUA Watch. He said the change can be
positive because it provides additional resources, i.e. investment product
expertise and greater access to legal counsel.
        The states that still have stand-alone credit union departments are
Alabama, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Texas and Puerto Rico.
        CCUL said the Department of Corporations is against the changeover,
but the move has the backing of powerful state legislators, including the
chairs of both the Assembly and Senate banking committees.
        While no specific legislation to advance this action in California
exists now, Robert Arnould, director of legislative affairs for CCUL, said
he will meet with California Gov. Pete Wilson's office to uncover his
intentions.
        Arnould said "the proposal is part of a broader package to
streamline and bring efficiency to state government." He said the
governor's office is very anxious to hear CCUL's concerns and it's not
really interested in moving forward unless the credit union industry has
support. "I don't think they want a big fight with the industry. They are
aware of our lobbying abilities."
        CCUL also conducted a survey among state-licensed credit unions
regarding their satisfaction with the DoC and their willingness to consider
consolidation. The study found most state credit unions would rather be
regulated by the DoC than NCUA. It also concluded most larger credit unions
opposed a merger while medium and smaller CUs supported it.
        CCUL said the merger would be detrimental to credit unions if the
new regulatory authority didn't learn the distinctions of nonprofit goals
vs. the competitive goals of for-profit banking.
        Other critical subjects CCUL broached were federal deposit
insurance and generally accepted accounting principles. The league argued
credit unions are different from other financial institutions in these
respects and warrant specialized examiners.
        California credit unions have made a substantial investment in
training and computers for the DoC credit union staff. Through the use of
operating and deposit insurance funds many millions of dollars have been
spent educating California's examiners and other officials. Therefore, the
league said, this investment would be lost if new training devices were
needed.
        CCUL also said CUs should have separate regulatory and supervisory
policies because the league and credit unions have invested substantial
resources in adopting laws and regulations that govern operations.
        The league also wants assurance that consolidation results in
reduced operating and examination fees for credit unions because they pay
for the operation of the DoC. The league also argued state credit unions
pay substantially more in operating and examination fees than their federal
counterparts.
        A consolidated regulator would have to sustain a positive
relationship with NCUA, the league said. Common examination platforms,
shared computer technology and other cooperative arrangements minimize
regulatory burdens for all parties, it argued. But the regulator would also
have to protect state authority from federal encroachment, CCUL said.
        In addition, CCUL's legislative agenda to recodify the credit union
law and seek franchise and sales tax relief would have to be maintained as
well.
        Duerr said the tax issues in California and the potential change in
the regulatory environment make the climate for state-chartered credit
unions in that state inhospitable. He said it's also important to note that
a gray area exists as each state's regulatory framework varies somewhat.
        In July 1995, a proposal was passed and signed into law by Gov.
Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin that created a new department consisting of
several divisions, mirroring what is already law in 44 states. According to
the Wisconsin League, as a result of legislative compromise, credit unions
will be one of the divisions attached to this new department for
administrative purposes, while retaining its autonomy as a separate entity
called the Department of Credit Unions.
        The change is positive for Wisconsin credit unions because they
will gain administrative and legal assistance they lacked as a separate
entity.
        Gary Gores, president of the Ohio League, said his league grappled
with a consolidation bill last year. He said a bill was approved at year-
end 1995 that included a compromise with the governor's office. The league
was able to get the Ohio government to agree to have a person on staff that
would head up credit unions.
        Gores said the league wanted to make sure credit unions wouldn't be
unduly influenced by banking and thrift regulators. "In the long run it
won't hurt us. But in the short run it will be an adjustment," he said.

DODGING THE LOAN ASSASSIN
Appeals Court Rules CU Student Loans Nondismissible

Members who owe student loans to federal credit unions can't use
bankruptcy as a way to avoid paying off the debt, a federal appeals court
has ruled.
        The 1st U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in December is significant
because for the first time, a court said that federal credit unions are
"government units" for purposes of having educational loans
nondischargeable.
        Certain educational loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy
proceedings if they are either a government agency or unit, or a nonprofit
organization.
        The ruling stemmed from a case brought by T.I. Federal Credit Union
in Attleboro, Mass., against one of its members, John Carl DelBonis.
DelBonis owed more than $32,000 in educational loans when the case went
before the bench. T.I. took the position that it fell under the definition
of both a nonprofit and a government unit and wanted payment for these
loans.
        DelBonis' counsel, Theodore J. Koban, argued otherwise.
        "We argued T.I was not a nonprofit organization because bylaws
provided that shareholders get a dividend." Koban won this point in
bankruptcy court.
        T.I., however, appealed this lower court ruling and took its case
to U.S. district court and it eventually ruled that T.I. was a nonprofit.
        The district court defined a CU as a nonprofit because, under U.S.
bankruptcy law Section 523(a)(8), it's a "democratically controlled,
cooperative, nonprofit society organized for the purpose of encouraging
thrift and self-reliance among its members'."
        The district court, however, didn't take a position on the
"government unit" status, so the case was appealed to the 1st Circuit Court
of Appeals. The 1st Circuit said federal credit unions are, in fact,
government units, so it didn't see the need to address whether it was also
a nonprofit.
        In its ruling, the 1st Circuit set out to clarify the meaning of
this section of the bankruptcy code. In doing so, it said Section 523(a)(8)
offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a FCU.
        "First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpayments
are nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifying
as a nonprofit organization. Second, the statute also makes loans issued,
insured or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable. A debtor's
loans, thus, are non dischargeable if they fall within the parameters of
either provision," the 1st Circuit said.
        Koban, reached by NCUA Watch, asked rhetorically whether this
ruling now means that every federal credit union, S&L or bank is a
"government unit" for purposes of educational loans. He suggested the law
should simply state that "student loans are nondischargeable. Period. This
ruling is counter intuitive."
        T.I. Federal Credit Union's attorney, Paul Lorincz, wouldn't
address the rhetorical question raised by Koban, but did say Congress is
the only body that can rule student loans shouldn't be dischargeable, not
the courts.
        "Congress hasn't further stated any banking institutions'
educational loans are nondischargeable," Lorincz said.
        T.I has $76 million in assets and roughly 13,000 members.
        According to the brief of the case, T.I. FCU advanced loans as part
of its special educational loan program. This program differs from standard
loan programs in that it allows for lower interest rates, gives borrowers
longer repayment periods and allows loans to be aggregated in maximum
amounts greater than those permitted under personal loan programs. The
program also enables borrowers to simultaneously borrow additional funds
and refinance outstanding balances on previous loans.
        The brief added that DelBonis turned to T.I. 16 times for
assistance and was given permission to consolidate these loans into a
single promissory note payable over 10 years. Currently, DelBonis owes
$32,618. His only avenue of appeal now lies with the Supreme Court, but his
lawyer said a petition to the high court is unlikely.
        Student loan data supplied by the Credit Union National Association
show that for year-end 1994, the latest date available, roughly one-third
of CUs offer just Guaranteed Student Loans (FFEL), one-third offer just
non-guaranteed student loans and a third offer both.
        The significance of this is reflected in the overall percentage of
credit union members who belong to credit unions offering these services.
Almost half--45.3%--of all CU members belong to a CU that lends FFELs, and
37.6% are members who are a part of a credit union that lends other types
of student loans. --Ken Reed

LENDERS TO FIGHT RISE IN 1099 PENALTIES

Representatives of the nation's lending industries are joining
together to oppose a Clinton administration proposal for what they believe
is a plan to raise the penalties for failing to file, or filing
inaccurately, so-called "information returns," the infamous 1099s.
        These forms are used by lenders to report payments of dividends,
interest and interest accrued on accounts but not precisely paid, for
example, the original issue discount on certificates of deposit, U.S.
government securities or similar instruments.
        The Clinton administration proposal is part of the budget stalemate
that closed the federal government for several weeks, among other
developments.
        The administration submitted a proposal to the Republican
leadership in Congress Dec. 7 as an alternative to the Republican calls for
deep cuts in the federal budget that calls for increases in miscellaneous
fees and closing of certain loopholes.
        The proposal, aimed more at stirring indigination from those
affected than a plan with even a small chance of winning congressional
support, included several other provisions that the administration knew
would be opposed by powerful corporate interests. For example, it calls for
requiring federal banking regulators to impose examination fees on state-
chartered banks.
        The provision at issue appeared to be limited to payments for
services that were reportable on Form 1099-MISC.
        However, according to a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Robert
Rubin dated Jan. 2, the lenders said that an explanation provided by the
Joint Committee on Taxation Dec. 15 indicated the provision had a much
broader scope.

CU AUDITING FIRM ACQUIRED BY INSURANCE CO.

A credit union auditing firm has been acquired by an insurance
company--a move the auditing firm hopes will help it break into the
insurance business.
        American Indemnity Co. Ltd., a firm based in the British West
Indies, acquired a 54% controlling interest in International Standards
Group Ltd., a Florida-based company that specializes in supervisory audits
for more than 300 credit unions through agreements with several leagues.
        "This is the first step in our overall plan to expand into the
insurance business," said Joseph Lents, president and founder of ISG, in a
recent statement. Lents said ISG will continue to focus on credit union
services.
        A source within the industry told NCUA Watch that ISG is attempting
to expand into insurance because it's not making any money from supervisory
committee audits.
        Attempts to reach ISG were unsuccessful.
        ISG is the parent company of Financial Standards Group, Boca Raton,
Fla., and the only publicly owned auditing firm in the United States.

FANNIE SET TO BOOST LOAN LIMIT TO $207,000

Fannie Mae is on the verge matching Freddie Mac's $4,150 conforming
loan limit increase and will announce the decision to raise its limit to
$207,000 sometime within the next two weeks, according to mortgage industry
sources close to the agency.
        Fannie has received numerous requests from its seller/servicers to
raise its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effect
Jan. 1. The agency, which had maintained that it would fully consider the
views of its customers before rendering a decision, may make its
announcement as soon as Jan. 15.
        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last two
weeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of
(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and the
potential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fully
discuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders, but said those
details would be made available shortly.
        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgage
companies that have traditionally directed most of their business to Fannie
Mae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to take
advantage of Freddie's higher loan limit. Freddie Mac did not return
requests for comments.
        Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddie
raised its limits. But in talks with its seller/servicers over the last
month, he said Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over the
change in the marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knew
that to be a real possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting to
Freddie, "though it's too early to see it happening--I wouldn't be
surprised."

Direct Access Gives Boost to B Paper


San Jose, CA-Innovative Mortgage Solutions, a conduit based here, said 22% of
its total November production came from its new Direct Access product.

Direct Access is a credit score-based first and second lien product.

The new product has received a better than expected reception.  IMS had
estimated that Direct Access would account for 15% of production.

Steven Skolnik, chief executive of IMS, said despite the increase over the
original projection, the quick success was not a surprise.

"The B-paper industry will increasingly embrace Direct Access because it
simplifies a traditionally cumbersome lending process.

"Our numbers are a direct reflection of the industry's demand for this type of
product," Mr.  Skolnik said.

Direct Access allows lenders to determine the loan pricing at the point of
origination and allows for simplified credit documentation.

Eligible mortgage bankers and financial institutions have delegated
underwriting authority.

IMS is currently updating Direct Access to offer more benefits, such as an
improvement in the debt ratio requirements and removing the need for income
documentation.

"Lenders using Direct Access already have the opportunity to make their
B-paper origination efforts more efficient and profitable.

"With our intended improvements, this product will make it that much simpler
for any lender to enter the high-margin, B-paper arena," Mr.  Skolnik said.

These improvements will be incorporated into Direct Access during the first
quarter of this year.

IMS was established by First Franklin, a mortgage banker here; both are
subsidiaries of DLJ Merchant Banking, LP, New York.

FHA loan limits rise to match Freddie Mac's


Washington-The Federal Housing Administration's loan limits will rise by 1.9%
on Jan.  1 to $155,250 in high cost areas and $78,660 elsewhere.

The changes were prompted by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s decision
late last month to boost the ceiling on loans it buys or securitizes by 1.9%
to $207,000, also effective Jan.  1.

The rival Federal National Mortgage Association chose to maintain its limit at
$203,150, however.  And neither company seems ready to change its mind, at
least not for the time being.

Fannie Mae is "not reconsidering," said spokesman David Jeffers.  "We made our
decision, and are very comfortable with it."

So is Freddie Mac, according to chairman Leland Brendsel.

"The decision to raise our limit was an easy decision to make," he said,
"because it is consistent with the purpose for which Congress chartered us;
that is, to increase the availability, affordability and reliability of
mortgage credit."

However, both agencies left the door ajar to the possibility that they could
change their minds sometime in the future, though they said they have not
received any pressure from either Congress or the Administration to do so.

Noting that there has been "lots of discussion in the press" about potential
operational problems and market stability issues resulting from two different
conforming loan limits, Mr.  Jeffers said Fannie Mae "will certainly listen
carefully to our customers as they describe those issues to us in more
detail."

But the vice president for corporate relations said whether or not his company
would reconsider is "way too speculative a question at this stage."

"We still need to hear from our customers," he said.

Mr.  Brendsel would not say unequivocally that he wouldn't change his mind,
either.  But he said there "is no downside" to the higher loan limit, "only an
upside for the nation and consumers."

"Nearly everyone realizes that when the secondary market as represented by
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is allowed to serve an additional group of
borrowers, they benefit from lower rates and better mortgages," he added.

The Freddie Mac chairman also called on Fannie Mae to rethink its decision,
remarking that "the market is not well served by having these two companies
operate with different loan limits."

Mortgage Bankers Association president Paul Reid invited Fannie Mae to follow
its rival, too, saying it would be "a lot easier on lenders who seek to be as
assembly-line oriented as possible" if they could place all their loans "in
one large bucket."

Mr.  Reid predicted that Fannie Mae will "give up some market share" if it
keeps the lower loan limit, as lenders who previously did business only with
the larger, older company "will have to start" doing business with Freddie
Mac.

Meanwhile, Federal Housing Commissioner Nicolas Retsinas indicated last week
that he had no choice but to raise the FHA limits, saying that the floor and
ceiling on government-insured mortgages are "by law ...  tied to the limits
established under the Freddie Mac Charter Act."

The new FHA floor, which is the basic nationwide limit and covers some 2,100
counties, will be as follows:

* $78,660 for loans on single-family homes * $100,600 for those on two-unit
dwellings * $121,600 for three-unit buildings * $151,150 for four-unit
structures.

In high cost areas, the FHA ceiling, which is set at 95% of an area's median
house price and is applicable in 122 counties, will be:

* $155,250 for mortgages on single-family homes * $198,550 for those on
two-unit buildings * $240,000 on three-unit dwellings * $298,350 on four-unit
structures.

NY mortgage brokers refund $400,000


New York-New York State regulators have forced two mortgage brokers to make
$400,000 in refunds to 234 customers as a result of an alleged illegal
referral fee arrangement between the two brokers and home improvement
contractors.

Equity Stars Inc., Elmsford, NY, will make $250,000 in refunds (of which
$100,000 has already been returned), while PGM Enterprise Inc., Merrick, NY,
refunded $150,000.

According to state superintendent of banks, Neil D.  Levin, a home improvement
contractor would aggressively solicit homeowners for work and promise to
obtain financing for them.

The contractor then contacted one of the mortgage brokers in question that the
homeowner needed a loan.  In return, the contractor received a referral fee.

There were as many as 10 contractors involved in the scheme, but most of the
problems came from two firms, a Banking Department spokesperson said.

The investigation into this matter is on-going.

Allegedly the mortgage broker contacted the customer but did not identify
themselves as a mortgage broker and did not make known the broker fee or
supply the proper disclosures.

Consumer complaints to the Banking Department charged the brokers involved
paid the contractor out of the loan proceeds before the work had been
completed to the homeowner's satisfaction.

There were four complaints made to the Banking Department about PGM, with one
involving this matter.  Equity Stars had four complaints, all stemming from
this incident.

Besides the state law violations, the referral fee payments are a violation of
Federal law, specifically the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Mr.
Levin pointed out.

Neither company has surrendered its mortgage broker registration.

Both firms were given two-year probationary periods and are required to post a
surety bond or have a pledged asset account of $25,000 for the duration.

Furthermore, both must perform community service.

HUD Reexamines Broker Fee Disclosures


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development has started a
negotiated rulemaking process to get various interests in the housing industry
and consumer groups to agree on what mortgage broker fees should be disclosed
under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.

Currently, mortgage brokers have to disclose points and fees they receive from
consumers and yield spread premiums or backend fees they receive from lenders.

Brokers claim the disclosure of backend fees on the HUD1 settlement form
places them at a competitive disadvantage with other mortgage lenders who
aren't required to disclose commissions or other fees paid by their employers.

To avoid this disclosure, many mortgage brokers have secured warehouse lines
of credit to fund loans themselves, according to Robert Lotstein, a partner in
the Washington, D.C., law firm of Buckman & Lotstein.

"This makes the mortgage broker a lender," he added, even though the broker
may sell the loan to the same lender who would have table funded it.  But a
table funded transaction triggers the RESPA disclosure.

"HUD sees two issues," according to Sarah Rosen, who oversees RESPA issues for
HUD and who also is the Federal government's representative at the negotiated
rulemaking table.

"First, does RESPA require disclosure of indirect fees and does it help
consumers to shop and compare products," she said.  And second, where does the
secondary market start, particularly when lenders have effectively sold a loan
before closing.  Secondary market transactions are exempt from RESPA.

"Brokers are looking for an even playing field," Mr.  Lotstein said.  "It
would help the industry, if this negotiated rulemaking works, for HUD to tell
us what is a secondary market transaction.  To learn what needs to be
disclosed and what does not need to be disclosed."

Mr.  Lotstein attended the first negotiated rulemaking meetings on Dec.  13
and 14.  Additional two-day meetings are scheduled for January, March and
April.

The 18 representatives are also charged with reaching a consensus on the issue
of lenders paying volume discounts to brokers.

HUD has not addressed this issue before and it has not decided whether volume
discounts are an incentive or a referral fee.  RESPA was enacted 21 years ago
to prohibit payment of referral fees to parties who do not contribute anything
of value to the mortgage transaction.

"This is a big issue," Mr.  Lotstein said.  "Lenders are saying why can't we
compensate brokers if we get a volume of business from them and take advantage
of economies of scale....  Why can't we pass on some of the savings in the
form of a discount."

But consumer representatives say this is just another way to get around the
RESPA prohibition on kickbacks and referral fees.

The Federal Reserve Board also sent a staffer to attend HUD's negotiated
rulemaking meeting because several bills now pending in Congress may transfer
RESPA rulemaking authority to the Fed.

In addition, the Fed has been wrestling with mortgage broker fees under its
responsibility to issue rules on high cost mortgages under the Truth in
Lending Act.

The Fed recently reversed its interpretation and now proposes to exclude
backend fees paid to mortgage brokers in the calculation of the high cost
mortgage test.

Later this winter, the Federal Reserve Board is expected to issue a final rule
that requires consumer fees paid to a broker to be included in the finance
charge.  This change was mandated by the Rodash bill passed by Congress in
September.

"A new statutory provision categorizes all broker fees paid by the consumer to
the broker (or to the creditor for delivery to the broker) as finance charges,
and will go into effect when the Board issues a final rule in 1996," the Fed
said recently.

The statement was made in connection with a study on finance charges the Fed
is conducting for Congress as a result of the Rodash bill.

The Fed is seeking public comments on finance charges and how accurately they
reflect the cost of mortgage credit.  The comment period ends Feb.  9.

Fannie Goes for Stock Split and Buyback Plan


Washington-In a surprise move, the Federal National Mortgage Association has
announced a four-for-one stock split and a stock buyback plan that sent the
company's stock up.

"It is a nice bundle of goodies to put under the Christmas tree for investors
at the end of the year," said Thomas O'Donnell, senior analyst at Smith Barney
Inc.

"And unlike most goodies, it is not going to be in the trash heap in January.
It is going to be something that is going to carry through 1996 and 1997," Mr.
O'Donnell said.

The surprise move accomplishes several objectives for the agency.

First, Fannie Mae will diversify its capital base by issuing $1 billion in
preferred stock and use the proceeds to repurchase common stock, somewhere in
the range of 7.5-to-8 million shares.

Second, Fannie Mae will contribute three million shares ($375 million) to the
Fannie Mae Foundation to fund its charitable and affordable housing activities
through the end of this decade.

FNMA has been contributing $40 million a year to the foundation but this
contribution will allow the foundation to increase its spending on affordable
housing to $50-$70 million a year.

Fannie Mae will take a one-time $350 million charge in the fourth quarter, but
analysts believe it will help the agency meet its Federally mandated
affordable housing goals while reducing its affordable housing expenses going
forward.

Third, FNMA's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 6% of the
shares outstanding for additional capital restructuring.  Analysts believe
these buybacks will take place in 1997.

"With these initiatives, we will maintain our capital base comfortably above
the statutory requirements, enhance shareholder value, and further expand our
commitment to affordable housing," FNMA chairman and chief executive James
Johnson said.

Unlike its competitor, FNMA does not have any preferred stock on its books.
Noncumulative preferred stock currently comprises 14.7% of the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.'s total capital base of $5.54 billion.

"The issuance of preferred stock is capital neutral, but it gives Fannie Mae a
more diversified funding base," Mr.  O'Donnell said.  "You want to have more
than one funding source," he added.

FNMA's Federal regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight,
also gave its stamp of approval.

"Fannie Mae's capital restructuring plan will not affect the company's
compliance with capital requirements so long as any common stock that is
withdrawn is replaced by preferred stock that meets regulatory requirements
for core capital," OFHEO director Aida Alvarez said.

Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are at 52-week highs and Freddie Mac
currently has a $200 million stock repurchase plan in effect.

A Freddie Mac spokesman refused to comment on the possibility of a stock
split.

Fannie Mae shareholders of record on Jan.  8 will participate in the
four-for-one split and the additional shares will be mailed Jan.  12.

Fannie Mae chief financial officer Timothy Howard commented that the split
"should make its common stock more affordable and attractive to individual
investors."

Meanwhile, Mr.  O'Donnell of Smith Barney increased his estimate of 1996
per-share earnings from $9.85 to $10.  And he raised his 12-month target price
on Fannie Mae stock from $120 to $150 on a pre-split bases.

"With the mortgage market as strong as it is right now, the stock should
perform well," Mr.  O'Donnell said.

Fannie, Freddie Stocks:  Outlook is Attractive


New York-In recent weeks, the stock prices of both the Federal National
Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  have been trading
near or above their previous 52-week highs and, according to one analyst,
should continue to trade at a high level into 1996.

Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst for Smith Barney, said, "the outlook for both
stocks is attractive and they should continue to trade highly.  The question
is whether Fannie Mae is a $125 stock that is going higher, or a $90-$100
stock masquerading as a $125 stock.  I think it's a $125 stock going higher."

Mr.  O'Donnell attributed the increased stock values of both companies to
numerous factors.

"Both stocks have done very well all year and the recent upswing could be
because a lot of people want(ed) the stocks in their portfolios by the end of
the year.  Another reason is that high-tech stocks have been in trouble while
the financials are doing very well.  Fannie and Freddie both represent
conservative financials - a good place to be.

Mr.  O'Donnell also said, "the fundamentals in the mortgage market are very
good, especially fixed-rate mortgages which can be sold in the secondary
market.  And then the monthly numbers each company puts out have been very
positive, and this attracts investors."

Another possibility for why the two stocks are trading at their 52-week highs,
according to Douglas Robinson, a spokesperson for Freddie Mac, is that the
stocks often trade in tandem with the bond market, which has been doing
reasonably well in recent weeks.

But even if the bond market falters, according to Mr.  O'Donnell, the outlook
for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock is quite good.

Fairbank has new nonconforming loan


Waterbury, CT-Fairbank Mortgage here has created a new non-conforming jumbo
mortgage loan program for its bank and mortgage broker correspondents.

These loans can be used for purchases or refinancings and for owner or
non-owner occupied properties.

Craig Cooper, executive vice president, said, "traditionally jumbo loans were
only for those with perfect credit who could verify their income.

"This new product enables banks and mortgage brokers to offer jumbo loans to
an expanded group of qualified customers including borrowers who have some
credit or income issues which could prevent them from obtaining conventional
financing."

Fairbank Mortgage does business in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island, and operates in New York under the name Colony Mortgage.

Now DLJ is Dumping Its Mortgage Unit


Washington-A few weeks after it gave up on warehousing, Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette is looking to sell a major chunk of its mortgage affiliate, First
Franklin Financial Corp., San Jose, CA.

Sources told NMN late last week that First Franklin is shopping around its
mortgage servicing portfolio which may be as large as $7 billion.

First Franklin president and chief executive William Dallas, who sold the
company to DLJ in 1994, could not be reached for comment.

Last week servicing brokers said the portfolio could be a hard sell right now.

"A lot of what they have is California-based and it's likely they will not get
a good price for it with concerns about refinancings plaguing the market," a
senior mortgage official said.

One West Coast servicing broker said DLJ's merchant banking unit - which
controls First Franklin - hopes to get as much as $100 million for the unit,
"but likely won't.

"They were shopping it around for $100 million last year (1995)," the broker
said, requesting anonymity.  "If they can get $90 million, I think they'd take
it."

The broker said that DLJ likely will take a loss on the company.  "DLJ bought
the company at the top of the market," he said.  "Ultimately, this isn't going
to look good."

One source said, "this deal is going to hurt them (DLJ)," he said.  "I think
the merchant banking unit has a lot to explain to its investors."

First Franklin is the result of a merger between itself and Franklin Mortgage
Corp., Irvine, CA.  In 1994 Franklin also bought the Jacksonville, FL,
servicing operation of Ryland Mortgage Co., Columbia, MD.

In early December it was revealed that DLJ was exiting the warehouse/gestation
repo business, a line of products it had a strong presence in.

DLJ gets out of repos


New York-Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a major player in gestation repos and
warehouse lending, is getting out of the business.

Late last week a handful of warehouse lenders said they had received telephone
calls from worried mortgage bankers who were told by DLJ that it no longer
would extend credit facilities.

DLJ senior vice president James Walsh, and Rod Ennico, who runs the gestation
business for the securities firm, could not be reached for comment.

Meanwhile, several large warehouse lenders were busy celebrating the news.

"I don't want to sound too happy but this means one less competitor for us and
more business," said one bank executive who is active in lending money to
mortgage bankers.

What exactly went wrong at DLJ, if anything, remains unclear.

One New York competitor said DLJ was an aggressive pricer that wasn't always
particularly careful with its underwriting.  "They may have taken a few hits
on their lines which caused this to happen," the warehouse executive said,
requesting anonymity.

One DLJ customer who is not happy with the news is Monument Mortgage Corp.,
Walnut Creek, CA.

"We hear they're getting out," said Monument executive vice president Jim
Umphryes.  "They have told us they will not be increasing our lines.  We have
a long-term commitment with them that we believe will be honored."

However, Mr.  Umphryes said he has been told "getting an increase or a new
line is out of the question."

Monument used DLJ's gestation repo products but also had warehouse lines with
the company.

Many large warehousers - mostly banks and large thrifts - compete directly
with Wall Street firms to fund the mortgage pipeline of home lenders.

During the past three years, warehousers have lost business to gestation repo
firms but have been fighting back with new products and pricing.

Besides DLJ, Wall Street firms that dominate the gestation repo business
include Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Nomura Securities, and PaineWebber.

Colonial mortgage has a new joint venture


San Diego-Southwest Colonial Mortgage here has formed a joint venture with
Western Pacific Housing, El Segundo, CA, to provide funding for the latter's
new home sales.

The controlled business arrangement will operate under the name Pacific
Colonial.

This is the fifth such arrangement Southwest Colonial has entered into.

The others are Koll Colonial Mortgage, Orange County, CA; Pioneer West
Mortgage, Las Vegas; North Star Mortgage, Sacramento, CA; and Liberty
Mortgage, San Diego.

Steven R.  Buehler, president and chief executive of Southwest Colonial, said,
"through the strategic alliance created, we will be able to provide one-stop
shopping to Western Pacific Housing's homebuyers and added control of the
mortgage process to the builder."

The CBA is structured in such a way to allow the builder to receive financial
benefits from the mortgage process, and is set up as a separate entity that
originates, process and closes loans for individual homebuyers.

Craig Manchester, Western Pacific's vice president, said, "the joint venture
makes good business sense because it offers a win-win situation for both
companies.

"Southwest Colonial will receive added revenues, and Western Pacific Housing
will play a much greater role in the home buying process, which translates
into an increased level of customer service for our homebuyers."

Wholesaler changes guidlines


Woodbury, NY-Delta Funding Corp., a non-conforming wholesale lender here, has
created a program with more liberal guidelines.

Loans with a minimum annual income of $25,000 can get a 55% debt-to-income
ratio for a 50 basis point add-on.

Where the total annual income is less than $25,000, a 50% debt-to-income ratio
is available with a 50 BP add-on.

Until now, such loans were subject to a 45% debt-to-income ratio.

However, there are a number of loan types not eligible for the liberalized
guidelines, including Section 32 mortgages (loans subject to the high cost
mortgage act) and those that require an 80% loan-to-value ratio on non-owner
occupied properties.

Separately, Delta has completed the public offering of $150 million of
asset-backed certificates.

The certificates are backed by home equity loans.

The underwriters of this securitization were Lehman Brothers and Natwest
Capital Markets.

Both Moody's and Standard and Poor's gave all five classes of this
securitization a "AAA" rating, based on a 100% insurance guarantee from MBIA
Insurance Corp.

This offering consists of $50.7 million of Class A-1 certificates; $37.1
million of Class A-2; $15.9 million of Class A-3; $11.3 million of Class A-4;
and $35 million of Class A-5 certificates.

Editorial:  A Pivotal Year


1996 will be a crucial year in many respects.

By year-end we will have decided who will lead the nation (and by extension
the civilized world) into the next century.

We should have in place a long-term plan to deal with the cancer of repeated
huge budget deficits that have sapped the economic energy of the country.  If
the proponents of a disciplined fiscal policy are correct (and we think they
are) this should mean a long period of lower interest rates and general
prosperity.

But there will be dislocations.  If a crackdown on entitlements is to succeed,
there must be action to slow the rapid increase in Social Security payments,
as well as other Federal payouts.

With a huge segment of the population (the Baby Boomers) headed into its 50s,
the demands on Social Security as we hit the second decade of the new
millennium will be beyond anything that could have been imagined in the early
years of the pension program.

If our society is to stay solvent and our working-age population is to have
the same standard of living (or higher) that we enjoy, we have to assure the
preponderance of the society's wealth is not poured into retirement plans,
while making certain that out senior citizens are given the "golden years"
they will have earned.

But these "global" issues are on the periphery of this paper's interests.  We
focus, in order to keep your interest, on third-party mortgage lending.

And, in our view, 1996 will be the defining year for the industry.

With an increasing number of mortgage bankers getting out of wholesale at
least temporarily, the supply/demand balance could change the next time
originations move up strongly.  The broker, who has been king in the last few
business upturns, may find that he needs his wholesale lender's good graces
more than ever before.

Mortgage investors have begun to differentiate between loans originated at
retail and those generated by brokers.

The largest of those investors, the Federal National Mortgage Association, has
warned that the quality of third-party lending must improve.

In issuing that strong caution, Fannie Mae chairman James Johnson did not
threaten two-tier pricing.  Nor did he forecast a time in which the secondary
market giant might close the window on broker-originated mortgages.

But both of those solutions are distinct possibilities.  And make no mistake,
Fannie Mae and its competitor the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  make the
rules in the mortgage market.

If they decide they no longer can afford the default rate on third-party
product, there will be no outlets for these loans at prices that would allow
brokers to continue functioning.

Should this happen, the broker community could find itself back in the role of
a hard-money lender seeking private sources for financing of its financially
strained clientele.

This obviously would be an extreme result.  But to prevent things from moving
in that direction, brokers must commit themselves to insuring the quality of
the loans they bring to the system.

The industry must weed out not only those originators willing to falsify
applications, but also those that take advantage of market conditions to earn
fees by initiating transactions which roll over borrowers quarterly or even
more often, without any inquiry from the customer.

The industry now has an important function:  to lead the mortgage borrower
through the maze of competing products and competing lenders to the right loan
for each customer.

It would be a major loss to the home-buying public if a few bad apples are
able to ruin the business for everyone.

Lockbox technology now is automated


SouthBend, IN-Data-Link Systems here has automated the final step in
processing mortgage payments.

That step - closing out a mortgage account - is the only one which mortgage
lenders have not traditionally outsourced, explained Sadu Thinakal, vice
president of the Fiserv subsidiary.

Lenders typically outsource mortgage payment processing to lockbox operations,
to which homeowners send their monthly checks directly.

The lockboxes, which usually are owned by big banks, handle all routine
payments.

That excludes the final payment, which is somewhat complicated.

"There are many extra steps involved in processing the final payment," Mr.
Thinakal said.

"Lenders thought the lockbox couldn't handle the final check because of the
extra steps involved:  balancing the account, sending letters to the county
office, the tax collector etc.," he continued.

Consequently, nobody had approached the lockbox operators to see if there was
a way for them to handle non-standard payments.  (Any so-called exception
payment, meaning it does not meet lockbox expectations, also gets routed back
to the lender.)

Data-Link, which is believed to be the nation's second-largest provider of
servicing software, recently did.

It created a system to automate all the functions associated with paying off a
mortgage, so that the lockbox need only be set up for what to expect.

Once the lockbox posts the account, the system handles tasks such as triggered
release of escrow funds and issues a triggered request to the document
custodian to release the file.

Ultimately, the system deletes the loan file from the servicing system and
saves a record on microfiche.

Data-Link's so-called payoff-through-lockbox feature should allow lenders to
maintain just a skeleton staff in payoff, Mr.  Thinakal said.  By contrast, a
large lender, with at least $20 billion in servicing, would probably have
between five and eight full-time staff manually handling payoffs today, he
said.

Besides labor savings, lenders will benefit from increased float and reduced
interest payments on mortgage-backed securities, Mr.  Thinakal said.

By eliminating the typical delay involved when the lockbox facility (to which
homeowners send their mortgage payments directly) has to send the final check
on to the mortgage company, the company should be able to deposit its money a
day or two sooner, he said.

Quicker processing should also ensure that the company meets the deadlines
imposed on mortgage servicers by mortgage-backed securities investors.

Unless the servicer tells the investor on time what mortgages backing an MBS
have paid off, the servicer is obliged to make the standard interest payments,
(as if the mortgages were still current).

"And they never recoup those payments," Mr.  Thinakal said.

The new service is "essentially free," he said.

Data-Link customers pay a $25 "transmission charge" for communicating to the
lockbox operator what to expect when the mortgage is being paid off.

Prior to this advance, Data-Link says, the closest anyone had come in
automating the payoff area was having a voice response unit tell customers how
much they owed to close out their mortgage loan.

Data-Link is also in the process of automating the procedure of establishing
whether a mortgaged property requires flood insurance and, if so, placing it.

The firm works through a third-party vendor of flood certification services.

Now servicers can manually update their systems when flood zone status
changes, but this will be done automatically by "early 1996," Mr.  Thinakal
said.

Recent emphasis on flood insurance follows the coming into effect late this
year of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, plus related
requirements from the secondary market agencies.

Lenders 'not getting results' from CLOs so far


Arlington, VA-Lenders are not getting results from their involvement in
computerized loan origination systems, speakers told a conference here.

Robert Meceda, chairman of the electronic mortgage lending conference run by
AIC, said it is a fallacy that real estate agents steer consumers to lenders
participating on a CLO.

"Thirty-five percent of homebuyers are coming to the transaction with the
lender identified in advance," said Mr.  Meceda, who is managing director of
the Stratmor Mortgage Finance Group Inc.

After his presentation, the head of the Alexandria, VA, investment and
mortgage bank said he was citing research done by the National Association of
Realtors.

Mr.  Meceda added that "230 of the 250 largest Realtors surveyed have a
captive mortgage bank, by way of a controlled business arrangement."

Even apart from CBAs, he said afterward, "real estate agents typically view
themselves as entrepreneurs, regardless of who employs them."

In an attempt to avoid any problems associated with the mortgage rebounding on
them, they often avoid recommending any lender, CBA or otherwise, he said.

Another speaker, Larry Walker, director of the real estate and mortgage
industry group with EDS, echoed Mr.  Meceda.

"CLOs are not producing the business - that has been shown by several
studies," he said.

He listed involvement with CLOs as evidence of the "sheep mentality" which
begets the mortgage industry.

"One of the biggest problems with CLOs is that Realtors aren't interested,"
the representative from the Plano, TX, technology giant added.

Additionally, some say that Realtors' lack of technical knowledge often means
that a CLO is a waste unless lenders employ some sort of facilitator to assist
customers.

Still others say that lenders themselves resist the CLO concept because it
leads toward mortgages being viewed as a commodity, making price the only
difference.

HFS buying Century 21 regions


Parsippany, NJ-HFS Inc.  here has agreed to purchase the six regions of
Century 21 real estate franchise master licensees that it does not already own
for a total of $140 million in HFS common stock.

The regions involved in the sale are:  the Southwest, central California,
south Florida, the Mid-Atlantic states and eastern Pennsylvania.

There are more than 1,000 offices involved that generated more than $440
million of real estate commissions over the last 12 months.

Robert W.  Pittman, managing partner and chief executive of Century 21 Real
Estate Corp., said, "with the acquisition of these non-owned regions, Century
21 will have a direct franchise contract with all of the real estate brokerage
offices in our United States franchise system.

"We are excited about the prospects of further utilization of the only
national brand in residential real estate to the benefit of Century 21
franchisees and HFS shareholders."

HFS management has previously announced it is exploring the possibility of
using a preferred vendor system for mortgage finance suppliers.

Burnet Realty, Minneapolis, has acquired The Prudential Preferred Properties
of Chicago.

The combination will have an estimated $6 billion in sales in 1995, up from
$5.3 billion for 1994, and revenues of just over $200 million.

Burnet plans to provide a complete range of home ownership services to
Prudential Preferred, including title insurance and closing services, and
expanded relocation services.

Great Lakes Mortgage, First Security Title, Burnet Relocation Management and
Burnet Insurance all operate as part of the Burnet Financial Group.

In Hawaii, four real estate companies announced plans to merge to create the
largest company in the state, Coldwell Banker Pacific Properties.

The four firms are:  Dolman Associates, Conley Dew Ltd., Bradley Properties
Ltd.  and Coldwell Banker McCormack Real Estate.

This combination will have a market share of 19% in Hawaii, and will be the
top company in number of sales associates, offices, total listings, sales
volume and gross commission income.

Southern Energy Homes, Addison, AL, has acquired Imperial Homes Corp., a
manufactured housing company based in Hegins, PA, for $2.4 million.

The purchase price was divided between $942,000 cash and the assumption of
$1.4 million of liabilities.

Imperial had revenues of $10.5 million for 1994 and $9.1 million for the first
nine months of 1995.

Home Equity Provides Boost for California Lender


Irvine, CA-Preferred Mortgage is capitalizing on home equity lending to expand
the company's presence nationally.

In October, loan applications at Preferred Mortgage exceeded $100 million,
fueled in large part by a surge in demand for home equity loans.  While
primarily a California lender at the moment, Preferred is expanding into other
western states and plans to open shop on the East Coast in the first quarter
of 1996.

More than 80% of Preferred's 1,976 loan applications in October were for home
equity loans.  In September, the company received 1,400 loan applications.

During calendar 1995, Preferred's income increased ten-fold from the previous
year, said Todd Rodriguez, CEO.  He attributed the company's growth to its new
niche serving home equity borrowers with strong credit ratings but little
equity in their homes.  It is a market that will allow the company to continue
growing, he said.

"Our primary purpose is to lend to people who have A quality credit but little
equity in their homes," Mr.  Rodriguez said.  "We're not necessarily looking
for the collateral but more for the character."

In October, Preferred raised its maximum loan amount for home equity loans
from $50,000 to $100,000.  Preferred introduced home equity loans just over a
year ago.  Preferred offers home equity loans with a loan-to-value ratio of up
to 100%.

Preferred offers both closed-end loans and home equity lines of credit.
Currently, almost all borrowers are choosing closed-end loans, Mr.  Rodriguez
said.

Congressmen ask a rollback on limit


Washington-Two key Congressional leaders have called on the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.  to rethink its decision to raise its conforming loan limit to
$207,000 effective Jan.  2.

But Freddie Mac has "no plans to change" its mind, according to a spokeswoman.

"We are sticking to our original position," she said.  A higher loan-limit
"makes more low-cost mortgage credit available to more families."

Republicans Rick Lazio, NY, chairman of House subcommittee on housing and
community opportunity, and Richard Baker, LA, who chairs the subcommittee on
capital markets and government sponsored enterprises, don't see it that way.

In a letter to Freddie Mac Chairman Leland Brendsel, Reps.  Lazio and Baker
said the decision to boost the limit flies in the face of Congressional
intent.

And they threatened to ask the "appropriate authorization committees to
explore" the issue "if Freddie Mac in unclear" that Congress wants "the
conforming ceiling (to) follow as closely as possible the long-term pattern in
home prices."

Noting that Freddie Mac "declined" to adjust its conventional mortgage
purchase limit when the index to which it is tied showed lower housing prices
in 1994 and again in 1995, they said "a ceiling which reflects only increases
 ...  cannot be reconciled with this Congressional intent."

If annual price decreases are not taken in the year they occur, Reps.  Lazio
and Baker said, "they should at least be recaptured before any subsequent
increases may raise the limit," Reps.  Lazio and Baker said.

"Since this year's increase does not offset the prior years' decreases, your
ceilings should remain at their earlier levels.  This is the only logical
conclusion, and the only result consistent with the intent of the statute."

That's the position taken by the rival Federal National Mortgage Association,
which was commended by the two congressmen for deciding to maintain its loan
limit at $203,150 for the coming year.

However, Freddie Mac argued that higher loan limits are necessary to bring
lower rates and better terms to homebuyers in high-cost areas.  But Reps.
Lazio and Baker disagreed.

Noting that prices actually have "declined dramatically" in "many high-cost
areas," they said the present Freddie Mac ceiling already encompasses a
significantly larger percentage of the market "in the very areas you claim
need the increases."

And in a letter to Fannie Mae Chairman James Johnson, they said the private
sector has developed a viable market for the 10% of all mortgages that are
above the two agencies' purchase limits.

Reps.  Lazio and Baker also told Mr.  Brendsel that at a time when the
allocation of government assistance "is undergoing intense Congressional
scrutiny," now is not the time to expand Federal subsidies.

The expansion of Federal credit guarantees can only help families with incomes
over $100,000, they said.

And because the Federal Housing Administration's loan base limit and ceiling
are tied to Freddie Mac's limit, they said, it also would "consume resources
that could maximize homeownership opportunities for low-income families."

Fleet will sell mortgages


Boston-Fleet Financial Group's strategy for acquiring NatWest Bank will put
billions of dollars in securities and residential loan assets on the market as
it sells off large portions of NatWest's loan portfolio as well as its own to
fund the move.

Fleet plans to sell off $18 billion of its holdings (mostly mortgages and
securities) and $13 billion of NatWest's to finance the $3.26 billion deal.
About $1 billion is to be used to fund the transaction while the rest goes to
retire debt.

"We were able to realign our balance sheet fairly dramatically in terms of
certain assets being replaced by loan assets," said president and chief
executive Terrence Murray, who said at a recent press conference that he was
pleased that Fleet was "selling no stock to complete this transaction and
financing largely internally."

Fleet's vice chairman Jay Sarles will become chairman of the new combined
Fleet Bank of New York, that includes the NatWest holdings.  NatWest chairman,
president and chief executive John Tugwell will become Fleet Bank of New
York's president and chief executive.

Most of the loan assets being sold will be residential mortgages that the bank
plans to replace with other loan types, said Fleet executive vice president
Eugene McQuade.

"In terms of the balance sheet restructuring, what we're talking about doing
both at Fleet and Natwest is to eliminate mostly low-yielding assets, mostly
investment securities and residential mortgages," he said.

"Essentially, we will make room on the balance sheet for higher-yielding
assets which we'll get from NatWest, which essentially are commercial and
industrial loans and consumer loans."

Officials at Fleet could not immediately be reached for further comment about
the composition and amount of mortgages and securities they would be selling
to finance the acquisition.

But Sept.  30 earnings reports from the companies indicate that billions of
dollars of loans from each bank's portfolios must be involved.

Fleet had $51 billion in net loans and NatWest had just $19 billion.  Loans at
that time made up about 60% of each bank's total assets.  A spokesman said
that Fleet's figures included the loan assets of the recently acquired Shawmut
National Bank.

Securitizations potentially involved $4.757 billion of mortgage-backed
securities Fleet classified as available for sale Sept.  30.  Shawmut had
$3.28 billion on its books at that time, most of which were classified as
held-to-maturity, according to earnings reports.  At both banks the MBS
represented about 40% of their total securities holdings.

Other funds involved in the deal include about $200 million that will be saved
when Fleet lays off about 1,800 employees and closes 30 of NatWest's 300-plus
branches, Mr.  McQuade said.  Most branch closings are expected to be in Long
Island, NY, where the two banks have the most overlap, and most staff cuts
will be corporate finance, technical and back-office jobs.  About half the
positions are expected to be lost through "attrition."

After $2.7 million in cash is raised for the deal, to be paid at closing
slated to occur in the second quarter of 1996, Fleet will have up to eight
years to pay NatWest's London-based parent the remaining $560 million in
payments linked to the acquired bank's earnings.  These will be annual
payments equal to about 50% of NatWest's earnings each year.

Fleet also plans to issue $600 million in preferred stock equity and $400
million in securitized debt, Mr.  McQuade said.  National Westminster Bancorp
has agreed to buy $300 million of the preferred stock issued, he added.  The
British company also agreed to keep $375 million of NatWest's problem loans
and repossessed properties in the deal, according to ratings agency reports.

Ratings agency analysts have primarily given the deal good reviews, but a few
have expressed concerns about how the sale will affect company in the next few
years.

In addition to putting more MBS on the market, the acquisition also could
potentially affect $1.8 billion in securities, according to Moody's Investors
Service, which has revised its rating outlook for these credits upward to
"positive" from "stable."

"While FLT's leverage will increase initially, creditors should benefit from a
better earning asset mix, a lower reliance on purchased funding, enhanced
revenues and expense reductions," Moody's reported.

The rating agency also reported that Fleet will benefit from strengthening its
market in the Northeast, strengthening its presence in New York and New
Jersey.  But Fleet's decision to acquire NatWest so soon after merging with
Shawmut may "present a significant challenge for FLT's management."

Because of this, analysts at Thomson Financial Services believe the
acquisition could potentially have negative implications for the company's
credit in the next one to two years until it can prove its ability to rebuild
capital.

"The increase in risk of the new asset mix will likely put a strain on reserve
coverage," Thomson's BankWatch, Inc.  reported.  "Although the acquisition
reduces FLT's reliance on purchased funds and pro forma, FLT's balance sheet
clearly has a higher risk profile."

Thomson viewed the bank's longer-term and shorter term credit more favorably.

First Mortgage Announces Expansion


Diamond Bar, CA-First Mortgage Corp., predicting that it will achieve new
originations of $100 million per month in 1996, announced plans for expansion
and a new operating structure.

Bruce G.  Norman, chief operating officer, will become the company's new
president, with Clement Ziroli remaining as chairman and CEO.

Under the direction of Mr.  Norman, the company will be restructured as two
operating groups - production headed by Abby Hedengran, and finance headed by
Pac Dong.

Until 1995 Mr.  Hedengran was a senior vice president at North American
Mortgage, Santa Rosa.  Mr.  Dong has been CFO at First Mortgage since 1976.

Mr.  Ziroli said the company's "aggressive growth plan" will capitalize on
affordable housing opportunities in the company's markets.

"We are planning multi-branch expansion, opening 10 new offices in the next
two years, in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Utah, and New
Mexico," Mr.  Ziroli said.

Mr.  Norman said homes in California are more affordable than at any time in
recent history.  "We believe housing prices are reaching lows in the current
cycle of our markets, with rents at a parity with mortgage payments," he
added.

First Mortgage projects a stable interest rate environment in 1996 that will
enable the company to reach "at least $700 to $800 million in originations,
with earnings per share of about 90 cents to $1 for our fiscal year ending in
March 1997, and at least a billion in annual originations the following fiscal
year," Mr.  Norman said.

First Mortgage is a mortgage banking company that currently operates through a
network of 12 offices in California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

New Jersey Bank Targets Home Improvement Loans to Low-Mod


Washington-United Jersey Bank, Princeton, is targeting home improvement loans
to low and moderate income residents of Morris County.

The program, which will offer HUD-insured Title One Home Improvement Program
loans and the bank's own "Signature Loans," is a model and may be expanded to
include other areas, the bank said.

The Title One loans are special fixed-rate loans of up to $25,000, with up to
20-year terms.  The loans are currently offered at a 10.4% interest rate, or
9.9% with automatic withdrawal from a United Jersey checking account.

Title One loans are available for eligible home improvements to owner
occupants of a one-to-six-family home.  United Jersey Bank is offering the
loans through its Spectrum Mortgage division.

The "Signature Loan" is a home improvement loan of up to $3,000 available to
homeowners and renters that is currently offered at interest rates of 13.5% or
13% with automatic withdrawal.  The product is designed to include renters and
borrowers who may have little credit history.

"It is basically an unsecured home improvement loan," said Barbara Horn,
public relations manager for United Jersey Bank.

Possible uses of a Signature loan include purchase of appliances, carpeting,
or furniture.  The mortgage company offers terms of up to 60 months.

The pilot program is being offered through a United Jersey Bank branch in
Dover, NJ.  Ms.  Horn said the initiative is targeted to serve low- and
moderate-income borrowers.

"The idea is to use the pilot as kind of a test of our outreach to the low-
and moderate- income community.  We are seeking to refine our outreach
methods," Ms.  Horn said.

United Jersey Bank is the principal subsidiary of a holding company with $15.5
billion in assets.  The bank has 290 branches in New Jersey and eastern
Pennsylvania.

for owner occupied properties and LTVs between 60% and 65% for non-owner
occupied properties.

Currently Parkway is offering the program in three states:  New York, New

Wholesalers see 1996 in an optimistic light


New York-Despite the name of wholesale lending being dragged through the mud
at the end of last year, mortgage bankers are optimistic about what 1996 holds
for the third-party originations market.

Great Western Bank, Chatsworth, CA, is happy with its wholesale production and
would like to do even more, said Sam Lyons, senior vice president of mortgage
banking.

Right now 25% of its production is from wholesale.

In the latter part of 1995, a number of participants in the industry
complained about the quality of loans originated by mortgage brokers.

Mr.  Lyons declared, "we don't share that opinion here."

Great Western underwrites its loans from the beginning and those loans
originated by mortgage brokers look similar to a retail origination when the
process is finished.

To get the volume of originations desired, a lender has to be involved in all
production channels, he added.

There are a lot of lenders that have money to lend and to be successful, they
need "all arrows in the quiver," and that includes wholesale, Mr.  Lyons said.

Burton Horwitz, director of marketing for Oceanmark Bank, FSB, North Miami
Beach, FL, said the question mark in his mind is whether a loan originated on
a retail basis is better than one originated wholesale.

Oceanmark deals with brokers of a very high quality.  Those that aren't are
weeded out right away, he said.

Mr.  Horwitz reviews the application of every mortgage broker, and the vast
majority have good credit and are of good character.

"I am 100% supportive of mortgage brokers," he declared.

Oceanmark is a wholesaler in both the "B&C" (over 10 years experience) and
conforming marketplaces.

A number of wholesalers have entered the "B&C" area recently.

The big question, Mr.  Horwitz said, is how many of them will be able to
survive.

To do so, these lenders will need to provide a consistent level of service to
their customers and make loans that will perform.

Those companies that don't have the experience "may drop the ball," Mr.
Horwitz said.

Oceanmark is continually expanding its presence in the wholesale market,
recently opening up an office in Reston, VA, to serve Maryland, Delaware, the
District of Columbia and Virginia.

It has also expanded its Atlanta office and now has representatives all over
the eastern seaboard.

Rates will have an effect on the wholesale market in 1996, said Joe Harvey,
executive vice president of Countrywide Funding Corp., Pasadena, CA.

Currently the industry is in a refinance market, and that will help the
mortgage broker.

But, he added, brokers have learned their lesson from the last refi boom and
have spent the last year and a half developing relationships with Realtors and
builders.

Mortgage brokers will not forsake these relationships for refinancings, Mr.
Harvey said.

If rates stay where they are or move up or down slightly, 1996 will be a good
year for the mortgage broker, he said.

Mr.  Lyons predicted there will be consolidation among mortgage brokers with
the stronger ones surviving and the weaker ones falling away.

Laura Kenda, marketing manager for Delta Funding Corp., a "B&C" wholesaler
based in Woodbury, NY, predicted that wholesale will continue to be strong in
1996, but legal issues will have an impact on the industry.

The stronger mortgage brokers will survive, but some of the larger ones will
think about becoming lenders with their own warehouse lines, because of
litigation and laws that favor lenders over brokers, she said.

Wholesalers feel impact of stricter variance rule


New York-Small originators and wholesalers are the segment of the mortgage
industry most likely to be affected by new, stricter guidelines for the amount
of variance allowed by Wall Street in the cash value of loans pooled for
delivery.

The stricter guidelines, set late in 1995 after months of study by a Public
Securities Association task force, decreased the variance recommended to 1%
from 2%.

Wholesalers that deal with a large number of smaller correspondents will face
a difficult task in trying to enforce the stricter guidelines down the food
chain, said a spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association.

The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  also opposed the stricter variance on
the grounds that smaller originators may be hurt by it.

Despite this, PSA officials have said they had to go forward with the change
in guidelines because demands of technology and standardization have made a
stricter variance necessary.

"A number of things have led to (the new guidelines)," said George Miller, the
PSA's vice president and assistant general counsel.

"Primarily there have been a tremendous amount of technological advances in
poolings and settlement advances in recent years, in particular, very
sophisticated TBA and optimization systems."

Mr.  Miller said he believes the technology has become accepted enough to
accommodate the majority of those involved in trading in TBA securitizations
by government-sponsored agencies.

He said that the automation was "at one time the province of dealers and very
large mortgage originators but now is available and used by just about all
participants in the market."

Mr.  Miller added that mortgage bankers are not bound by the bond trader
group's guidelines and counterparties are free to negotiate deals outside the
suggested variance.  But MBA officials said the industry's standard practices
make such exceptions rare.

"Dealers trading MBS from the interdealer trading screens cannot specify a
lower variance," said MBA vice president Warren Lasko, in a letter to the PSA.

"In our discussions, dealers have expressed a reluctance to carve out a
special variance rule for original issue transactions."

RESPA Guidance on Joint Ventures Coming Soon


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development is developing
guidelines to distinguish bona fide joint ventures between real estate brokers
and mortgage bankers from shams.

HUD is concerned that the structure of these joint ventures may not qualify as
controlled business arrangements under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
Act, and the fees paid to Realtors may be illegal.

"The issue is whether you have a bona fide controlled business arrangement or
whether you have a business arrangement that is designed as a sham intending
to disguise referrals," according to Sarah Rosen, special assistant to HUD
assistant secretary Nicolas Retsinas.

RESPA permits the payment of referral fees to affiliates in a CBA so long as
disclosures are provided to consumers and profits are distributed based on a
return on equity.

In a presentation to a Mortgage Bankers Association compliance conference, Ms.
Rosen characterized a sham CBA as one where a real estate brokerage firm and a
mortgage banking company set up a joint venture to take mortgage applications
from customers in a Realtor's office.

Each party invests $50 in the joint venture, which includes one employee who
is the former loan officer of the mortgage company.  The employee's desk in
the Realtor's office is rented by the mortgage company.  And the venture
contracts all back-office work with the mortgage company except for taking the
initial mortgage application.

"Essentially, this is an entity that is not performing any work, yet
collecting significant fees with an extraordinary return in capital," Ms.
Rosen said.  "That scheme seems to be on its face designed to avoid the
prohibition on referral fees."

The guidelines will not set capital standards or work rules for joint
ventures, but should provide some clarity to the industry, she said.

Phillip Schulman, a partner in the Washington, D.C., law firm of Kirkpatrick &
Lockhart, said the industry is looking for this kind of guidance and he hopes
HUD addresses such issues in joint ventures as the paying of rent and the use
of part-time employees.

But to show that a joint venture has a real business purpose, Mr.  Schulman
advises clients not to sell 100% of the mortgages to the joint venture
mortgage company.  "A real mortgage broker sells to the highest bidder," he
said.

Meanwhile, HUD continues to struggle with the issue of whether employers can
pay fees to employees who refer business to affiliates.

And the agency has convened a working group of private sector experts to
reexamine HUD's approach to computer loan origination systems.

As HUD's point person on RESPA issue, Ms.  Rosen did not indicate that the
agency is even close to finalizing the RESPA proposal it issued in June for
public comment.

However, HUD intends to issue guidance on joint ventures "relatively soon
because we think it is important," she said.

Third of CA homes were sold at loss


La Jolla, CA-Surveys of public records by DataQuick Information Systems show
that 31.6% of all California homes sold during the first 10 months of 1995
were sold for less than their original purchase price.

That percentage of loss sales continues to decline from a 42.7% peak in
September 1993.

Because of low prices, "a lot of homeowners have put off selling during the
past few years" said DataQuick CEO Donald L.  Cohn.  As a result, a higher
percentage of homes on the market "were put there because the owner was under
the gun to sell."  Many of these "have-to-sell" situations resulted in sales
at a loss, he said.

The median loss was $21,800 on a house sold for $199,000, originally purchased
for $221,000.  The hardest hit areas were those, like Orange County, which
experienced the fastest appreciation in prices during the late 80s.

In 1994, 51% of Orange County resales were at a loss, down to 45.5% through
November 1995.

Meanwhile a Chapman University study predicts existing Orange County homes
will begin to appreciate 1.4% in value next year, after a 1.3% decline for
1995 and falling prices every year since 1990.

Despite rising prices, says Jim Doti, Chapman's president and chief economist,
higher incomes and lower interest rates will combine to boost Orange County
affordability - possibly beyond the national average next year.

That increase in affordability and employment in the county should create
conditions favorable for housing starts, which presumably explains the
decision of the homebuilder Lennar, based in Miami, to begin setting up shop
in Orange County.

Norwest Mortgage value aids rating


Chicago-A recent report on Norwest Corp.  by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.
here cites the banking company's "flexibility to recognize the significant
off-balance-sheet values housed" in its mortgage banking subsidiary as a
reason for comfort in its capitalization levels.

This was cited as one of the justifications for DCR assigning an "AA" rating
to a $200 million medium term note issue from Norwest Corp.

Des Moines, IA-based Norwest Mortgage was the top originator in the country
during the third quarter, with volume of $10.7 billion for the three-month
period, and has the fourth-largest servicing portfolio in the industry, at
$100.1 billion as of Sept.  30.

The mortgage operation is one of several "well-diversified" sources of revenue
for Norwest Corp.

"The efficiencies of scale have become apparent in Norwest Mortgage's reported
profitability over the past year.

"Positively, application volume and the level of unclosed loans are at high
levels, suggesting that performance should remain strong through the
seasonally slow winter months," DCR said.

NJMIC expands in states of Florida, Ohio and New Jersey


Roseland, NJ-New Jersey Mortgage and Investment Corp.  here has appointed
James V.  Hall to the newly created position of national director of branch
operations.

Among his responsibilities will be to ensure consistent service for the
company's wholesale clients in new market areas.

Mr.  Hall is directly responsible for the development and supervision of
NJMIC's new satellite branch offices and will recruit management personnel for
the offices.

Joel Furst, senior vice president of NJMIC, said, "Jim Hall has proven to be a
fantastic operations and sales administrator throughout his career.

"His attention to detail and valuable experience will insure that our
full-service branch offices are able to provide clients with an incomparable
level of personal service."

Most recently, Mr.  Hall was underwriting supervisor for ContiMortgage,
Horsham, PA.

NJMIC has been expanding lately, opening two new offices in Florida, and one
each in Ohio and southern New Jersey.

The company has opened a Florida regional operations office in Boca Raton to
service wholesale and retail customers in the Palm Beach-Broward county areas.
In addition, it opened a wholesale and retail production office in the Tampa
Bay area.

Dale Koch has been named Florida regional director of services and will work
out of the Boca Raton office.

Most recently he was vice president/national retail division of NationsCredit,
Charlotte, NC.

The Tampa office will be managed by Janice McFadden.  She previously held
similar positions with ContiMortgage and Independence One Mortgage, Farmington
Hills, MI.

This office will also deal with mortgage brokers in the Orlando area.

"With the growth and development of Florida's west coast and central regions,
as well as a need throughout the state for our unique mortgage loan products
and services - this is the best time for NJMIC to emerge as a viable
alternative source of funding in the outstanding Florida market.

"All processing and closing activities will take place at our offices in the
Sunshine State, so our wholesale and retail clients will be able to enjoy the
best possible attention to their specific needs," said Mr.  Furst.

In Canton, OH, NJMIC opened an office to serve wholesale and retail clients in
Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Kentucky.  The office is managed by Marty Lang,
director of business development, Ohio/Midwest region.

Most recently, Ms.  Lang was manager of NationCredit's office in Canton.

The new office will process and close loans from the region.  Those not closed
in Canton will be done in closing offices in the region.

Salvatore A.  Pappalardo, South Jersey regional director, is in charge of the
new Shrewsbury, NJ, office, where he will concentrate on the wholesale side,
seeking to develop new sources of business from mortgage brokers who serve
customers with credit problems.

Previously, he worked for PNC Bank, Pittsburgh, where he was able to establish
a retail mortgage banking relationship with a number of South Jersey Realtors.

June Fourth Corp.  starts wholesale


Boca Raton, FL-June Fourth Corp., which develops mortgage products and other
proprietary investment products for small community banks, has created a
wholesale division with the goal of providing first and second mortgage
financing for buyers in single-family home developments.

The genesis of the program, a company spokesperson said, is the trend of
corporations to contain costs by moving to the suburbs and rural areas.

"The resultant employment has created unprecedented opportunities for
single-family home developers.

"Unfortunately, many prospective purchasers do not qualify for conventional
mortgage financing," the spokesperson said.

"Our program will enable a developer to offer a variety of first and second
mortgages custom tailored to just about any borrower.

"What we hope to accomplish is a partnership between our local bank
correspondent and the developer," explained the spokesperson.

In areas where June Fourth does not have a community bank correspondent, it
will arrange for qualified developers to be able to originate and close these
loans on their premises.

The spokesperson added "the whole idea is to make homeownership a reality for
as many families as possible, regardless of the pitfalls placed in the way by
an economy in transition."

Countrywide boosted '95 wholesale volume


New York- Nearly three-quarters of Pasadena, CA-based Countrywide Funding
Corp.'s November 1995 volume was produced by third party channels, according
to data released by the company.

For the month, the firm had volume of under $3.1 billion, with the
correspondent channel accounting for $1.8 billion and wholesale recording an
additional $639 million.  Retail contributed the remaining $653 million.

This is compared with November1994 production volume of $2.2 billion, of which
$1.2 billion was correspondent, $635 million was wholesale and $420 million
retail.

Increased business at Countrywide led to an increase in employees.  The
correspondent lending system went from 214 employees in November 1994 to 277
12 months later, while for the same period the number of employees in the
wholesale system increased from 393 to 517.

Countrywide's pipeline of loans in progress stood at $4.49 billion at the end
of November 1995, versus $4.41 billion for the same day the year before.

North American Mortgage Co., Santa Rosa, CA, saw a 73% increase in loan
fundings between November 1994 and 1995, from $459 million up to $794 million.

John J.  Farrell, Jr., chairman and chief executive, declared "as interest
rates approach the historic low levels set in 1993, the potential for
substantial growth in refinance activities increases.

"Historically, the company's telemarketing division and network of wholesale
brokers have been successful in capturing increased market share during
periods of high refinance activity."

The number of new applications made at North American increased from $830
billion in November 1994 to $1.24 billion one year later.

Another wholesaler from Santa Rosa, Allied Bank, FSB, saw its origination
volume increase more than threefold during the one year period, from just
$35.6 million in November 1994 to $124.4 million this past November.

For the first two months of the fourth quarter, total volume was up 161% from
the year before, $94.9 million versus $247.8 million.

Patrick W.  Kilkenny, president and chief executive, said "we are pleased with
the growth of our loan originations at Allied Bank which is being spurred by
the long bond rally.

"We expect the volume of loan originations to remain strong as we continue our
effort to maximize our wholesale lending activities in Northern California."

The number of loans originated by Bay View Capital Corp., a thrift holding
company based in San Mateo, CA, fell off sharply, from $61.3 million to just
$16 million between November1994 and 1995.

Bay View's fully indexed origination rate for new loans may tell part of the
story.  The rate for loans indexed to the monthly COFI increased from 6.41% on
Nov.  30, 1994 to 7.74% one year later.

However, the rate for loans indexed to the one-year Treasury decreased during
the period from 9.05% to 8.07%, while the rate on 30-year fixed loans went
from 9.13% to 7.75%.

Standard Federal Bank, Troy, MI, had volume of $797.9 million in November, up
from $278.8 million one year earlier.

Portfolio loans made up only 12% of production volume during the month, versus
61% for November1994.

The percentage of adjustable-rate mortgage loans fell from 51% in November
1994 to 35% in the most recent November; during the same period the total
volume of fixed rate loans (both 15- and 30- year) went from 30% to 37%.

As of Nov.  30, 1995, Standard Federal had a pipeline of $1.19 billion, of
which 88% was fixed rate and 12% ARMs.  On the same day in 1994, the pipeline
was $633.9 million, and split 70% FRM to 30% ARM.

Celtic flavor to US mortgage deal


New York-In a deal with a Celtic touch, Citizens Financial Group, Providence,
RI, which is owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland, will acquire First NH Bank,
Manchester, NH, which is owned by Bank of Ireland.

Under the terms of the agreement, Bank of Ireland will receive a 23.5%
interest in the combination, while Royal Bank of Scotland will retain a 76.5%
interest.

Besides the interest in the new company (which is valued at $435 million),
Bank of Ireland also will receive $245 million in cash and notes.

This combination will give a nice increase to Citizens mortgage servicing
portfolio, said Jack Karaszewski, president of Citizens Mortgage Corp.,
Atlanta.

Citizens currently services $8.7 billion, while First NH has a $3 billion
portfolio.  Plans are for the portfolios to be serviced at Citizen's platform
in Columbus, GA.

First NH has average originations of between $50 million and $60 million per
month, of which 60% is wholesale and 40% retail.

The combination will have the second-largest market share in New Hampshire,
behind Norwest Mortgage, Mr.  Karaszewski said.

There is some but not much overlap of the wholesale channel of the two
companies.

Citizens has some outstanding portfolio products, especially on the adjustable
rate mortgage side, he added.

Consolidating its hold on the San Francisco market, First Nationwide Bank has
agreed to pay $70.6 million in cash for Home Federal Savings and Loan
Association.

Home Federal has deposits of $625 million and assets of $735 million.

Carl Webb, president and chief operating officer, said, "this merger
represents another very important step in our strategic expansion in
California.

"We feel the state will continue to gain economic strength as the population
grows."

Meanwhile, First Nationwide has completed its purchase of all the California
assets of CSF Holdings Inc., Miami.

This consists of four branches in the Santa Rosa area.

Because of the sale, CSF recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.2 million.

As it grows in California, First Nationwide is getting out of other states.
It has agreed to sell 21 Detroit area branches to Charter One Financial,
Cleveland, parent of First Federal of Michigan.

The branches have $765 million in deposits, for which Charter One will pay a
premium of $55 million in cash or 7.18%.

Independence Savings Bank, Brooklyn, NY, is buying the two First Nationwide
branches on Staten Island, which have deposits of $285 million.

Pending is a deal where Independence buys three Brooklyn branches from First
Nationwide.

Westcorp, the Irvine, CA-based holding company for Western Financial Savings
Bank, FSB, has purchased 80.1% of the Hammond Co., a Newport Beach, CA,
mortgage banker.

Thomas T.  Hammond, president of Hammond, controls the rest of the company.

Hammond had volume of $375 million for fiscal year 1995 (almost all of it
retail) and a $500 million servicing portfolio.

Western Financial had volume of $268 million (mostly wholesale) for the first
three quarters of 1995, and has a $4.5 billion servicing portfolio, of which
$3.2 billion is for other investors.

Plans are for Western Financial to acquire the Hammond servicing and combine
it with its own, a spokesperson said.

But the two companies will remain separate for origination purposes.

American Industrial Loan Association, a non-conforming wholesale mortgage
banker, based in Virginia Beach, VA, has agreed to purchase at least 87% of
the stock of First Security Federal Savings Bank Inc., Annandale, VA.

If 100% of the outstanding stock is acquired, the maximum premium is $150,000.

First Security's primary focus is the origination of conforming loans in the
Maryland-District of Columbia-northern Virginia region.

Allen D.  Wykle, chairman and chief executive of American Industrial, said,
"First Security is a good fit for American Industrial.

"It will provide us with access to the conforming mortgage business in a
geographic market for which we have many years of profitable lending
experience."

Standard Federal Bank, Troy, MI, has agreed to purchase Bell Bancorp Inc.,
Chicago, for $354.1 million in cash.

Bell's subsidiary Bell Federal Savings and Loan Association has deposits of
$1.6 billion and assets of $1.9 billion.

After the deal is closed, Bell will operate under its current name.

Thomas R.  Ricketts, chairman, president and chief executive of Standard
Federal, said, "our goal is to capitalize on our retail mortgage loan and
fully automated branch delivery systems to increase Bell's market share in the
Chicago area."

Robert G.  Rowen, president and chief executive of Bell, said that low and
moderate income borrowers will benefit from this merger because of Standard
Federal's many special credit-related programs.

"It has also received an 'outstanding' Community Reinvestment Act rating from
the Office of Thrift Supervision, and it has won many local and national
awards for its community lending activities," Mr.  Rowen said.

Marine Midland Bank, New York, has agreed to buy East River Savings Bank from
River Bank America, New Rochelle, NY, for $93 million.

East River has 11 branches with $1.2 billion in deposits; Marine Midland will
also acquire $1.1 billion in assets.

NY broker wants to educate borrowers


New York- Fidelity National Mortgage, a mortgage brokerage operation that
specializes in making affordable loans, has as its goal educating borrowers as
well as mortgage brokers.

John Boxman and his partner Kenneth P.  Warner, an attorney, started Fidelity
National three years ago "with the intention to house everyone," said Mr.
Boxman.

He said one of the greatest obstacles to homeownership in addition to not
having a downpayment is not knowing the homebuying process.

Mr.  Boxman said "35% of people who do not purchase a home do so not because
of lack of a downpayment but because they don't know the how to start the
process."

To address these obstacles to homeownership, an in keeping with its aim to
house everyone and as the company discovered, to meet the unmet needs of low
and moderate income and minority borrowers, Fidelity National has instituted a
couple of themes that underly its origination process.

For this year, 1996, Fidelity National will have as it theme 'Knowing How to
Get Started'.  As part of that theme $20 from each loan originated will go to
Habitat for Humanity.

Its first theme was House New York, where in 1995 $10 from each loan was
donated to Habitat for Humanity.  The House New York program allowed for three
percent downpayment on a single family house and five percent downpayment on a
two family house.  Mr.  Boxman said a check for $1,000 was donated to the
organization, created by former President Jimmy Carter, which builds housing
through donations such as this and sweat equity for low and moderate income
individuals across the nation.

Mr.  Boxman said "structuring the loan is key."  He said brokers need to be
educated on how to structure loans, particularly affordable loans.  "Here in
New York people do not have savings.They seem not to have the downpayment, but
most borrowers have jobs and incomes but somewhere they had a credit glitch
that was never fixed.," he said.

"Sure you need to spend a little more time with them and sometimes you need to
convince them they can buy the house," he said, but "we need to get them into
conventional mortgage programs where they can make the payments" and are not
charged excessive interest just to get a loan.

One example of structuring a deal would be to use the Federal National
Mortgage Association's Community Homebuyer program or any 97% program which
allows for a seller's concession of three percent which in effect allows you
to raise the purchase price three percent, have the sellers concession.  This
allows 100% financing for the borrower who must only pay closing costs.

Educating borrowers takes the form of weekly seminars which are attended by
approximately five to seven people and hosted by Mr.  Boxman's partner Mr.
Warner.

Mr.  Boxman said Fidelity National uses materials from private mortgage
insurance companies particularly United Guaranty Residential Insurance Corp.,
and the Federal National Mortgage Corp.'s homebuyer education materials "which
are very simple to digest."  Mr.  Boxman added that Fiedlity national in its
use expands on the materials.

Additionally, Fidelity National's 10 loan officers meet with clients of
clients of realtors on an individual basis to education them on the homebuying
process.

Mr.  Boxman said the mortgage brokerage makes between 50 to 60 loans per month
and approximately 800 loans per year.  Approximately 75% to 80% of loans
originated are mortgage loans made to low and moderate income and/or minority
borrowers.  The other 20% or so are conventional loans.

Fidelity National is completely computerized and everything is explained to
the borrower from application, verification, credit report and appraisal.

The company began using laptops from its inception.  Mr.  Boxman said
technology is the future of the business.  This year, perhaps later this
month, the mortgage brokerage operation will have a page on the world wide
web, expanding its reach onto the internet.

The mortgage broker has a number of relationships with mortgage bankers
including Prudential, Loan America and Countrywide to whom it sells its loans.
On average its sell 20 to 25 loans to each.

The mortgage brokerage operation, which makes loans in the five boroughs but
focuses on Staten Island and Brooklyn primarily, found when it entered the
community that low income and minority borrowers were a neglected clientele.

One way it reaches out to such clientele is by working with Neighborhood
Housing Services, a community organization which refers potential borrowers.
"NHS may have clients interested in purchasing a house.  We interview them and
set them on a course or plan to get them into homeownership.  if they follow
that plan in maybe eight months they can purchase a house," said Mr.  Boxman.

CA home sales up 4th month


La Jolla, CA- Home sales in southern California increased for the fourth month
in a row in November when looked at on a year-to-year basis, according to a
report from DataQuick Information Systems here.

However, on an overall basis, for the first 11 months of 1995, home sales in
the region were down over 9% when compared with the same period in 1994.

Between January and November 1995 170,703 houses were sold in the six county
area, versus 188,137 the year before.

In November itself, there were 15,983 houses sold, up 2.1% from November
1994's 15,655 houses sold.

This is down 2.1% from the 16,320 houses sold in October 1995, but DataQuick
said a decline between October and November is normal, and in fact, this was
the best November for home sales so far in the 1990s.

"The sales surge is coming in the entry-level part of the market.

"Because of low prices and low interest rates, a lot of people who couldn't
afford to buy a home before can afford to now.

"We're watching the numbers carefully, the increase in buying activity should
spread into other home categories in 1996," said Donald L.  Cohn, chief
executive of DataQuick.

Entry-level sales account for the bulk of the transactions taking place today,
unlike five years ago, when sales were distributed across all categories, from
entry-level to prestige homes.

This can be seen in the median sales price, which for November was $161,000,
down from $164,000 in November 1994.

For the first 11 months of 1995, the median home price was $160,000, down 4.8%
from the $168,000 median home price for the same period in 1994.

The six southern California counties studied are:  Los Angeles, Orange, San
Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura.

A second DataQuick study found that statewide in California, fewer homes are
being sold at a loss to the previous owner.

Between January and October 1995, 31.6% of sellers said they received less for
their property than the amount the purchased it for, a decline from 34.7% for
the same time frame in 1994.

The amount of sales made a loss began to climb in California starting in early
1991, and peaked at 42.7% in September 1993.

In October 1995, it was 31.2%.

Mr.  Cohn said "a lot of homeowners have put off selling during the past few
years because of declining prices.

"So a higher percentage of the homes that were put on the market, were put
there because the owner was under the gun to sell for one reason or another.

"Many of these 'have-to-sell' situations resulted in a loss.

"We may find it shocking that three in ten sellers lose money, but we need to
remember that it still means most people are making money."

Hardest hit were the areas where prices appreciated the greatest during the
boom period in the 1980s.

For example, 45.5% of home sales in Orange County in the first 10 months of
1995 were done at a loss; this is still an improvement over the 50.9% that
were done at a loss in 1994.

Ventura County, which had 52.8% of home sales in 1994 at a loss to seller, saw
that percentage drop to 40.9%.

Another area were sellers were impacted was San Diego, where 41.4% of homes
sold in the first 10 months of last year were for a loss, down from 42.2% in
1994.

On the other hand, Madera County had the best results; just under 10% of homes
were sold at a loss between January and October of 1995, up from 9.5% for the
same months in 1994.

Washington state is on the cutting edge for mortgages


Seattle-About 80 wholesale lenders are currently doing business in Washington
state, says John Porter, president elect of the Washington Mortgage Brokers
Association and an owner of Mortgage Master Service Corp.  in Kent.

Mr.  Porter, who is both a mortgage broker and banker and a correspondent with
more than one wholesale lender, says the state is "one of the most popular
places in the country with wholesalers right now, because of the stable
economy - which is more diversified and less dependent on Boeing - and home
prices, which are still appreciating at a rate of 3% to 6%."

Fleet is coming back into the Northwest market, he says, as is Home Savings of
America (now in the process of locating a regional branch office in Bellevue
and expected to begin production in the first quarter 1996).

He expects Chase "will be coming in big," once it finalizes the merger deal
with Chemical Bank.  These wholesalers will be looking for players -
correspondents with experience who can close in their own name, he said.

Mr.  Porter, who funds in his own name, said most wholesalers expect a
correspondent to put up $500,000 cash to be a player.

But he also sees the industry shifting to accommodate the small, independent
players who are handling 60% to 70% of the nation's mortgage originations.

"Small, independent mortgage brokers can move fast and make it at 1.5 points,"
he said, while the big lenders, who need a 1.75 loan fee to break even, will
increasingly move toward providing back-up services for the independents.

Evergreen Money Source, Bellevue, is reaping the benefits of that strategy.

Gary Winslow, president and marketing director, correspondent lending division
for Evergreen, says his company "has increased business by 100% since he came
aboard in July, primarily by providing good service to correspondent brokers."

"Our goal is to turn around and fund a correspondent's submission within 24
hours and we rarely do it in less than 48 hours," he said.

Prior to this year, the company mainly handled retail nonconforming loans, but
its growing correspondent lending division is in an expansion mode.

"We're looking for quality mortgage brokers with experience, who have been in
business a long time.  We want to deal with the most professional mortgage
broker we can find.  We're not so heavy on net worth and financial strength as
we are on professionalism and experience.  We like them to be members of the
state mortgage brokers or bankers associations," he said.

A past president of the Washington Association of Mortgage Bankers, Mr.
Winslow says the most active mortgage lending areas in Washington and Oregon
are Puget Sound and the Vancouver-Portland market.

"The Puget Sound area has rebounded nicely from last year.  It's not the
refinancing boom of '92-'93, but it's very active and it could be the start of
a flood," he said.

Rick Merlino, who heads the nonconforming wholesale division of Evergreen
Money Source, said the company primarily handles A and B paper in Washington
and Oregon and just started in Idaho's Coeur d'Alene and Boise markets.

The company does "a fair amount of stated income product," for nonresident
aliens who have no documentation, often Russian or Saudi citizens, he said.

"We've built our business in the niches," some 40% of it based on credit
issues like a lack of documentation, higher LTVs, or no paper trail of a down
payment, he said.

The company also funds manufactured housing loans.  While it's not yet big, it
is growing, Mr.  Merlino says.

The company's average loan size is around $135,000 and Puget Sound is its
strongest market.

Evergreen's nonconforming loan division is accepting new mortgage brokers and
bankers.

What the company looks for in a mortgage broker or banker, says Mr.  Merlino,
is "a quality shop with professional people concerned with getting good
service at a good price, with no prepayment penalties.

"We strive hard to be professional and to give the professional broker the
service they need.  We understand relationships.  We know they are hard fought
and hard won.

"We want the broker to know we'll protect their relationships, that they can
depend on us to do what we say we'll do," Mr.  Merlino said.

Kendall Frazier, wholesale account executive with Metropolitan Federal Savings
and Loan, said the company's "Make Sense" portfolio loan program is popular
with brokers.

The program is designed for conforming loans that deviate from the normal
guidelines of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae but are not bad credit risks.  She is
also seeing a lot more refinancings because of the current low interest rates.
Strong mortgage origination centers in the state, she said, are King, Pierce
and Snohomish Counties.

Joe Ebner, vice president of mortgage production at Washington Mutual, says,
"production has been marvelous for Washington Mutual, which has been the
number one mortgage lender in Washington for 28 years and just took over as
first in Oregon."

Mr.  Ebner said the company holds a 10% market share of the
Portland-Tri-County area, over 13% of the market share in King County, 14% of
Spokane County, and 13% of Pierce County.  The company's average loan size is
$115,000 in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Utah.

Its most popular loan is the 30-year at 15-year fixed, he says, and "the
purchase market is extremely strong in both Washington and Oregon."

The company funds both conforming and nonconforming loans.  On the
nonconforming side, the issues are usually less than perfect credit or an
unusual property.  The average loan size ranges from $200,000 to $300,000 and
is limited to $400,000.

The company has been a leader in manufactured home loans since 1969, he said,
and is now extending 25- and 30-year loans with land valued in hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

Washington Mutual is doing a number of speculative construction loans for
homebuilders and investors in the City of Seattle, he said.  "The market is
strong, not overly heated up but very stable, very strong," with loans of
$500,000 moving well, he said.

Continental Savings Bank has never been in the wholesale business except as a
master servicer of loans across the state for the Washington State Housing
Finance Commission's (WSHFC) bond program.  But according to Rick Bennion,
vice president in charge of Residential Mortgages for Continental Savings
Bank, the company now has "an embryonic wholesale division."

The start-up wholesale division is the result of Continental's leadership in
helping to develop, promote and originate the FHA 203k in the state.

When Mellon took over U.S.  Bancorp, it agreed to originate the 203k loan
product but it did not want to handle the contractor part of the loan deal.
Yet, the 203k was one of the loan products offered in a special city housing
program partnered by the City of Seattle, WSHFC and U.S.  Bank, designed to
increase city residency of police and fire personnel.

The program offered lower mortgage rates, lower down payment requirements and
lower loan and escrow fees.  It was immediately popular and quickly expanded
to include all city employees.

Continental, which was already a strong pipeline for the 203k, had it's
contractor inspection system in place, and knew all the players involved with
the city program, agreed to buy the product.

"We have never been in the wholesale business," Mr.  Bennion said.  "But when
the Mellon opportunity came along, we saw this as a great opportunity to put
our toe in the water, to invest in the infrastructure and to grow it.  We
might consider doing it with other institutions."

As the master servicer for the WSHFC's bond loan program, Continental works
with some 250 mortgage bankers and thrifts across the state.  It's own 203k
program has nearly 200 homes under construction and over 200 more loans in
process in Snohomish, Kitsap, King, Pierce and Spokane Counties and Vancouver,
Washington as well as Portland.

The benefits of making 100% loan-to-value mortgages


by Marianne Arbulu Vice President, National Lending Center Inc.

National Lending Center, Deerfield Beach, FL, is a mortgage wholesaler doing
business in Florida, Georgia, Illinois and North and South Carolina.  It
operates, according to its own promotional literature, "within the confines of
even the most forbidding credit history."  Ms.  Arbulu has written an article
about when 100% financing is appropriate, which is presented as our Viewpoint.

A while back, I read an article in a national publication about the risks of
100% financing.  While the article pointed out some very valid issues, I was
concerned that it didn't address any of the benefits, nor did it point out
ways to mitigate the risks.

With the advent of high LTV loans in the marketplace, we all need to
understand which borrower benefits from this product and how to reduce or
eliminate risk.

Full 100% financing offers several benefits to borrowers that brokers can
market to full advantage.  The program provides an opportunity for new
homeownership to clients who haven't had the ability to accumulate a down
payment.

On a refinance or second mortgage, clients can improve their cash flow by
consolidating debts, or minimize the interest they are paying on consumer debt
versus a second mortgage.  They may even gain tax advantages in this scenario
or find themselves able to use equity which was previously unavailable to
them.

Risk-wise, this product is truly the last stop for the consumer.  In most
scenarios, tapping out equity renders most customers non-lendable for years to
come.  So it is crucial to understand the type of customer for whom this loan
works to full advantage.  Primarily, borrowers who fit the 100% profile have
AA credit and have never had a problem paying their bills.

Let's take the case of the couple who is looking for either a full refinance
or a stand-alone second mortgage, utilizing 100% of the equity.  The ideal
borrowers, in this case, are people who, while they have revolving and
consumer debt in addition to their mortgage, don't need that revolving debt to
survive on a month-to-month basis.

They haven't used the consumer debt to supplement their income; therefore,
they have available credit and make payments in a timely manner.  So why would
this couple tap out their equity?

Primarily, the loan would give them the opportunity to further improve their
cash flow and reduce their overall monthly expenses.  It would bring down
their interest expense and may give them some tax benefits through interest
expense deductions by using the equity in their home as security.

This customer, who prior to debt consolidation had a 45% debt ratio, now has a
35% debt ratio post-consolidation.  Even with all the equity tapped out, if
they come across unexpected monthly expenses, this couple can handle it.

Now let's look at the borrower for whom this loan is not appropriate.  We have
a husband and wife, salaried individuals who simply don't make enough money to
meet their monthly needs.  They have children, school expenses, car repairs,
and have historically used credit to supplement their income.

They are heavily indebted with both revolving and unsecured debt.  They pay
their bills on time and their credit looks spotless, but they have probably
used one set of credit cards to pay existing credit card bills.  Today they
are sitting in a difficult cash flow position with 50% or more debt ratio.

If we consolidate these customers, tap out all the equity in their property,
squeak them into an acceptable debt ratio, they could be headed for trouble.
Now, if they need car repairs, tuition, anything we don't routinely think of
as household operating expenses, they must incur more consumer debt.

They have taken themselves totally out of any lendable position.  They are now
back to using debt to supplement their income, and with the loss of their
equity, they have no remedy.  For obvious reasons, the 100% product does not
benefit these clients; in fact, it disables

The 100% purchase, when marketed to the appropriate customer, is a golden
opportunity for brokers.  Again, the ideal borrowers are a young couple, both
working, paying a rent similar to what a new housing payment would be, using
credit moderately with debt ratios that are reasonable without having to
consolidate.  Their only difficulty has been in saving toward a down payment.

For this kind of client, with their careers ahead of them and expected
increases in income, the 100% loan is a prime opportunity.  It gives them the
ability to buy property today, at today's prices, get available tax benefits,
and effect no major change in household operating expenses.

The key to a successful 100% purchase loan is the term.  Most 100% loans are
really a combination 80% first mortgage and 20% second.  The 80% first is a
standard 30-year amortization with a 180-month balloon.

The second mortgage, however, is structured to be fully amortizing over the
shortest term possible, ideally, somewhere between five and seven years.
Assuming a 0-3% appreciation, the property alone will not improve the equity
position.  The only way to improve the equity position is to pay down the loan
in the quickest period of time.

A short-term second is almost like forced savings.  The borrowers apply a
tremendous amount of principal every month back to the property so that at the
end of a loan with a five-year term, they could be back to a 20% equity
position.  It's as if they saved the down payment after they got the house.

If these customers comfortably meet a 40% debt ratio, have moderate income
growth and experience moderate appreciation, they will be in good shape within
a three-to-five-year period and in a position to refinance into a conforming
loan, further reducing their monthly expenses.

To summarize, the 100% loan is not for everyone.  It's not for the person
who's strapped.  It's not for the person who doesn't expect moderate income
increases over the next three to five years, and it's not for people who
haven't been able to manage their debt.  However, the broker who targets the
right customer stands to do a considerable amount of business with this
product.

HUD Sells Title One Loans


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently sold 2,707
defaulted Title One loans to Sagres Co.  Inc.  in a Nov.  7 auction.  Sagres
is located in La Jolla, CA.

In what has been described as an effort to sell "the worst of the worst," HUD
offered a package of defaulted, unsecured Title One loans made for home
improvement and manufactured housing purposes.  In most cases the loans
defaulted more than five years ago and have already been through extensive
collection efforts.

As a result, HUD got what was expected from the sale:  very little.

The winning bid was 0.66% of the total outstanding debt.  HUD sold about $25
million in outstanding debt.  Since HUD was ready to write the loans off, the
low price they fetched was not much of a disappointment.

"The lesson is that you don't sell the worst of the worst alone," a person
familiar with the sale said.

But HUD still has about 40,000 Title One loans with a total outstanding debt
of over $300 million, many of which make more promising candidates for sale.
HUD is currently evaluating that portfolio, which is managed by debt
management centers in Albany, Chicago and Seattle, to try to determine if it
makes sense to sell the loans to the private sector.

Mellon buying big wholesaler


Farmington Hills, MI-Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, will be purchasing Source
One Mortgage Services Corp.  here from Fund American Enterprises Holdings
Inc., Norwich, VT, industry sources confirm.

The sales price is set at a premium of $65 million over the company's adjusted
book value at the closing date.  The adjusted book value was $285 million at
the end of the third quarter 1995, according to a Fund American spokesperson.

Lehman Brothers served as Fund American's adviser in this transaction.

Fund American would not disclose who the purchaser was other than to say it
has signed a letter of intent with a "significant financial institution."

The buyer is a "first rate organization" that is a "good match" for Source
One, the spokesperson said.

Mellon said it had no comment.

A definitive agreement will be signed before the end of this month.

Source One, which currently services $33 billion, is a low cost servicer, with
excess capacity available, which makes it attractive for an organization
growing its servicing, added the spokesperson.

During the refinancing boom of the early 1990s, Source One was subject to
severe run-off problems with purchased mortgage servicing rights.  To make up
earnings, the firm later sold portions of its servicing portfolio.

Fund American placed Source One on the auction block in August 1994, but
failed to get its price and pulled the company.  Lehman Brothers had also
served as adviser in that attempt.

Source One's servicing portfolio dropped from $40 billion at the end of the
third quarter of 1994 to $28.6 billion at the end of the third quarter last
year, a 28.5% decline, according to data from a National Mortgage News survey.

But the company has been growing the portfolio again, the Fund American
spokesperson said.

The same survey has Mellon Bank as the nation's 11th-largest servicer, with a
portfolio of $45.67 billion.

On a pro-forma basis (and including the pending Chase Manhattan/Chemical
merger), the Source One/Mellon combination would constitute the industry's
seventh-largest servicer, at more than $78 billion.

What was not a factor in Fund American's decision to sell was fears about
run-off in a declining interest rate environment, coupled with a new rule that
equalizes the accounting treatment between originated and purchased mortgage
servicing rights.

"Portfolio run-off is a difficulty for the entire industry.

"But that is not a major consideration here.

"In the mortgage business, especially with FAS 122, you have to accept that
(servicing) is volatile," the spokesperson said.

Source One had originations of $3 billion for the first nine months of 1995,
of which 60% was retail and 40% wholesale.

Mellon has been an active buyer of mortgage servicing as of late, with its
most significant deal coming in September, when it purchased Metmor Mortgage,
Overland Park, KS, from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, for
$165 million cash.

In that deal it acquired a $13 billion residential and commercial servicing
portfolio.

Back in 1994, it acquired U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage Co., Portland, OR, a $4.3
billion servicer.

Mellon also was a bidder in a bankruptcy court-ordered rebidding for Lomas
Mortgage USA, Dallas, but was not the winner.

Separately, Mellon announced it has named Ronald E.  Stroble national retail
production manager for Mellon Mortgage Co.

He joined Mellon as part of the U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage deal (where he was
production manager), and will remain based in Portland.

Mr.  Stroble is responsible for Mellon's 107 retail production offices
nationwide.

California brokers expecting a banner year


Mortgage lenders doing business in California expect good news for a change.
California Association of Mortgage Brokers president Virginia Ferguson told
Origination News that 1996 is likely to be one of the biggest years for
purchase loans California has ever seen.

Analysts are saying the state with the world's sixth largest economy is
finally putting quakes and base closures behind it to resume good health.  The
Southern California real estate market is bouncing off its bottom, and the
state again outpaces the nation in job growth.  UCLA economists say California
will generate about 820,000 new jobs through 1998.

James Chapman, president of First Security Loan Corp., one of the largest
mortgage brokerages in the nation, told ON, "California is going into the year
with a tax surplus, more businesses moving in than out, and interest rates
seeking historic lows.  We're looking forward to a great year."

Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of California,
said the California recovery is being led by foreign trade, hi-tech industries
and the entertainment business, with gains in income and spending outpacing
inflation.

The only real weak spot Mr.  Levy sees has been construction activity, and
some major builders like Lennar and Catellus are positioning themselves for a
building recovery in the very counties, like Orange, that have most been in
the doldrums.  Mr.  Levy expects Orange County employment figures released in
January and February to show dramatic improvement.

Has Orange County -- notorious for its county bankruptcy following a $1.2
billion loss in the derivatives market and its plummeting real estate prices
-- bottomed out?  Clement Ziroli, Chairman and CEO of First Mortgage Co., says
so.  "We think that because we have a very substantial book of loans there,"
Mr.  Ziroli told ON.  "We've definitely seen a stabilizing of homes in
foreclosure."

TRW REDI analyst Nima Nattagh is not so sure:  "What we see is the declining
trend continuing."  But Mr.  Nattagh, who sees no connection between Orange
County's bankruptcy and its falling home prices, does note that "for the first
time since 1990 we have seen foreclosures decline there."

Ian Wong of Mortgage Information Corp.  in San Francisco cited statistics
showing Southern California delinquency rates declining, though remaining
worse than those for the nation as a whole.

A Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.  report says mortgage insurance losses
"attributable to California reached 39% of all mortgage insurance losses in
1994," but have since stabilized.  "DCR believes that housing prices are at or
near lows in Southern California."

Mr.  Ziroli said the good news is that contracting prices have boosted home
affordability in many parts of California, with interest rates down far enough
to make mortgage payments compete favorably with rents.

Mr.  Ziroli agrees with Stan Ross, managing partner of real estate consultants
E&Y Kenneth Leventhal, that California's primary home buyer in 1996 will be a
first timer -- probably a member of an ethnic minority and/or a recent
immigrant.

Were it not for foreign immigration, California's population would be
declining, largely because of out-migration to other Western states.

Given that profile of a typical California borrower, Ms.  Ferguson said the
GSEs' pushing FICO credit scoring "is the most serious issues facing our
industry today.  FICO scoring is not going to put a great deal of borrowers
into homes.  The likelihood that they are going to meet the Congressional
mandate is not very great."

Ms.  Ferguson, a partner in Heritage Valley Mortgage, says her company is very
active in working with low-to-moderate lending and first-time buyers,
utilizing "numerous county MCC programs in tandem with both conventional and
FHA/VA loans" to get those borrowers into homes.  She agrees that modification
of Fannie and Freddie underwriting guidelines for "vanilla" product will have
to be made in order to meet Congressional lending mandates.

Ms.  Ferguson said improvements in the real estate move-up market for
high-priced areas are being slowed by lagging state allocations for MCC bond
programs, a situation that CAMB will target for lobbying.

Though California real estate prices have fallen, they still remain higher
than in most parts of the country.  California Association of Realtors
president Rick Snyder says thousands of moderate-income Californians will
benefit from the recent HUD and FHA raises in loan limits for high cost
states.

"Refis will be substantial but not the engine that drives the train," Mr.
Chapman said, joining Ms.  Ferguson and North American Mortgage president
Terry Hodel in predicting a healthy mix of purchase loans and refis for
California in 1996.

Mr.  Chapman disagrees with Mr.  Ross' prediction that technology and the
Internet will make a big impact on real estate lending in1996.  "Those things
are here to stay," said Mr.  Chapman, "but it's not as pervasive as some
people think.  A lot of loan officers are still resistant to computers.
Nothing of real substance has happened on the Internet that affects the
mortgage industry because there hasn't been a need for it.  It may be as long
as another two to three years before that happens."

He said mortgage lending is too technical and intricate to be mastered by the
software available on the Internet.

Controlled business arrangements, on the other hand, have arrived to stay, Mr.
Chapman said.  First Security has loan representatives in the offices of Frank
Howard Allen & Co., a leading Northern California Realtor.

"CBAs are part of the mixture that will make us successful," he said.  "We're
probably going to do a capture rate of 25 to 35%."

B and C loans pose 'unique challenges'


Houston-EquiVantage president John Smith said he felt pressed but confident
about the ways his B&C business manages risk during the busy month of
December.

In fact, the unique challenges of B&C lending are exactly what Mr.  Smith said
he likes about the work.

"I find (nonconforming lending) attractive because its not as cookie-cutter as
conventional lending," he said.

Mr.  Smith is president of both EquiVantage and servicer Transworld Mortgage
Corp., a legally separate business that EquiVantage was originally a division
of.  Transworld recently completed its second securitization, totaling $75
million and consisting of three classes of fixed-rate HEL certificates backed
"predominately by first-liens due to current interest rate environment."

Its first, similarly structured $65 million securitization was completed
earlier in 1995, he said.

The issues have traded "at a slight discount, 99 30/32 - effectively at par
when priced off the yield table," and were bought by "various institutional
investors," Mr.  Smith said.

EquiVantage has a $15 million net worth and combined the two companies have
assets totaling $65 million that Mr.  Smith is charged with overseeing.

Standard & Poor's has recently reported that it is concerned with the credit
quality of HEL and B&C paper, and many players in the market are dropping out
after failing to rise to the challenges of the business.  But with insurance
from Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.  and underwriting from CS First Boston,
EquiVantage's recent issue has received AAA ratings from both S&P and Moody's
Investors Service.

Mr.  Smith added that he is confident that his experience, combined with
strong staffing, marketing and capitalization that keeps the market from
becoming too crowded, will sustain the company as a player.

"We will be in the business long-term," he predicted.  "It's highly capital
intense, so there are substantial barriers to competitors entering the
marketplace.  You need $25 million to $50 million just to get involved."

Mr.  Smith's background in the nonconforming business includes five years
working with "programs for acquiring and securitizing" at United Financial
Companies and previous work as a savings and loan officer.

"We worked with B&C loans then, only we didn't call them that," he said.  "We
called them loans with delinquencies."

The secret to making such credits profitable comes from "evaluating your
borrowers' willingness and ability to pay over time, value of property, and
pricing - charging a higher interest rate, although our rates go as low as
8.5%," he said.

WA gets assisted living units


Seattle-Proceeds from an $8.3 million tax-exempt bond will finance the
construction of five assisted living facilities in Washington state to be
purchased by LTC Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust company that
provides financing to the health care industry.

The projects are being developed by Assisted Living Concepts, a for-profit
company that serves low- and moderate-income elderly in Washington, Oregon,
Texas and New Jersey.  The company will lease the completed facilities from
LTC Properties and manage and operate each of the projects.

The Washington State Housing Finance Commission (WSHFC) publicly sold the
bonds backed with a letter of credit by U.S.  Bank of Washington.  The bonds
were issued through the Commission's Housing for the Elderly Program, which
provides tax-exempt financing to develop the full range of living options for
the elderly.

The projects are in Grandview, Walla Walla, Kennewick, Vancouver and Camas.
Total cost of the project is estimated at $11.18 million, with $8.8 million
coming from the bond proceeds.

"Washington state has one of the fastest growing populations of senior
citizens in the nation," said Busse Nutley, WSHFC chair.  "Because our state
expects to more than double the number of elderly residents between now and
the year 2020, facilities such as this are vital."

Each of the five projects now under construction has 36 assisted living units,
with the exception of Lexington House in Vancouver, which will offer 44
assisted living units.  Occupancy for the projects is expected from December
1995 through March 1996.

"The tax-exempt financing allows Assisted Living Concepts to lower the cost of
living for the elderly," said Steve Gordon, chief administrative officer, ALC.
"Assisted living is more economical and less invasive than a nursing home and
it enables seniors to maintain their independence and privacy in a homelike
setting."

Fifteen percent (28) of the total new units will be dedicated to residents at
or below 50% of the median income of the county in which the project is
located.  Five percent (nine) of the total units will be dedicated to
residents at or below 35% of the median income.

An assisted living community bridges the gap for seniors between active
retirement communities and nursing homes.  An assisted living facility
provides elderly senior citizens with more independence than a traditional
nursing facility, while still providing necessary nursing care and support
services.

A $5.815 million tax-exempt bond issue for a 120-unit apartment building for
the elderly was also issued by the WSHFC.  Proceeds of the bonds will be used
to construct Pacific Crest Apartments in Everett.  The project is also
eligible to receive some $3.7 million in Federal low-income housing tax
credits allocated to the Commission.

"Good health starts with good living facilities," said Thomas Gray, executive
director of Bethany of the Northwest, one of the developers of the project.

"With adequate housing, elderly people can sustain themselves for a longer
period of time," he said.

The tax-exempt financing and low-income housing tax credits, he added, enables
Bethany to offer both housing and personal services to lower-income elderly
residents who want to live independently as long as possible.

The bonds were sold publicly, backed with a loan guarantee from Bethany.
Seafirst Bank provided a 30-year letter of credit.  The City of Everett and
Snohomish County helped Bethany fulfill its part of the financing agreement.

The bonds were issued through the WSHFC's housing for the elderly program.
Total cost of the project is estimated at $8.8 million, with nearly $6 million
coming from the bond proceeds.  The balance will be financed primarily through
low-income housing tax-credits.

The project includes 108 one-bedroom and 12 two-bedroom independent living
apartments for seniors.  The seven-story apartment building will offer
residents panoramic views of the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges and is
conveniently located within walking distance of a senior center, public
library, post office and other services.

All units will be affordable to elderly (aged 55 or older) residents at or
below 60% of the Snohomish County median income.

Joint venture starting up for Edina, AmerUs


Edina, MN-An investor group which includes the management of Edina Realty here
has purchased the company as well as Equity Title Services and First Edina
Mortgage from First Bank Systems Inc., Minneapolis.

First Edina Mortgage immediately entered into a joint venture with AmerUs
Mortgage, Des Moines, IA.

Bradley D.  Childs, president of First Edina, and executive vice president of
the new holding company Edina Financial Services, said the mortgage company
brings relationships with Realtors, its sales team and staff to the joint
venture.

He explained that the mortgage operation is a restructuring of a going
concern, rather than a start-up operation.

These joint ventures are happening more and more frequently between Realtors
and mortgage lenders, added Fred Moore, president of The AmerUs Group, AmerUs
Mortgage's parent company.

In structuring this venture, the parties were careful to make sure it is in
compliance with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, both men said.

AmerUs has similar ventures with Iowa Realty and Carol Jones Realty, both of
which it owns, and is a partner with Mel Foster Realty.

These ventures give AmerUs a substantial amount of volume, but Mr.  Moore did
not specify what percentage.

AmerUs will provide the joint venture with table funding capability, working
capital and technology.

First Edina will rent space at market rates at Edina Realty offices.

Mr.  Childs said the company will be a "focused Realtor service organization."

Technology was one of the keys to this joint venture.

AmerUs was the first mortgage originator to use the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.'s Loan Prospector system and the first to have it interface with the
Gallagher front-end origination management system.

Ron Peltier, chief executive and president of Edina Realty, said, "we talked
to a number of mortgage joint venture partners and AmerUs was the obvious
winner due to their commitment to state-of-the-art loan processing and
commitment to quick response to homebuyers."

Edina Financial Services is actively looking for other services and products
to provide to homeowners.

AmerUs decides what will happen with the servicing rights created by the joint
venture, Mr.  Childs said, and it will retain some but sell most in bulk, Mr.
Moore added.  It has approximately $1 billion in servicing.

Edina Realty was sold to Metropolitan Financial Corp., Fargo, ND, in 1988.
MFC subsequently was acquired by FBS.

The acquisition group is made up of Mr.  Peltier; Mr.  Childs, the president
of Institutional Capital Services Inc.  here; David E.  Wilbur Jr., the former
owner of PolyTech, Bloomington, MN; Phillip L.  Hendershott, chairman of
Altair Ventures Inc.  here; and Arne Rovick, senior vice president of Edina
Realty.

TAX LEGISLATION:  The Budget Bill Battle Puts Tax Planning On Hold


The tax provisions being considered run the gamut and will substantially
impact every one of your clients, if enacted.

The one thing I've learned from dealing with tax legislation for over 20 years
is that you never know the path it will take.  This year's budget bill proves
the point once again.  As we went to press, the budget bill (HR 2491) had been
vetoed by President Clinton.  There are talks going on between Congress and
the White House aimed at reaching a compromise budget bill acceptable by all
sides.

Without a crystal ball, it is impossible to predict what will happen-if
anything.  However, to alert you to the possibilities, here is a summary of
the major proposed tax changes that were contained in the vetoed budget bill.

Family tax relief.  The budget bill contains a nonrefundable tax credit of
$500 that would be allowed to a taxpayer for each qualifying child under 18.
The credit (subject to a phaseout) would be effective Oct.  1, 1995.  There
would also be a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $5,000 in qualified adoption
expenses.  An above-the-line deduction would also be provided for interest on
qualified education loans and expenses for the custodial care of certain
elderly family members.

To combat the marriage penalty for couples filing joint returns, the ratio of
the standard deduction for joint returns relative to single returns would be
increased annually from 1.68 in 1996 to 2.00 in 2005.

Retirement provisions.  The budget bill also provides that an individual would
no longer be considered an active participant in an employer-sponsored
retirement plan merely because his or her spouse is an active participant.
The $2,000 IRA contribution limit would be indexed for inflation (for taxable
years beginning after 1996) and the phaseout income limits would be increased.

Also, the budget bill would create an "American Dream IRA" with no income
phaseouts for contributions.  Withdrawals would not be includable in gross
income if the withdrawal is made after at least five years and the withdrawal
is for a special purpose (i.e., first-time homebuyer (up to $10,000); higher
education; catastrophic medical expenses and distributions to unemployed
individuals), or made after the individual reaches age 59 1/2 or becomes
disabled.

A new simplified retirement plan would be available for small businesses-the
savings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE) retirement plan.  SIMPLE
plans would mean an end to new simplified employee pension plans after Dec.
31, 1995.  There are also provisions aimed at tax simplification of the
pension rules.

Capital gains.  Practitioners will recognize the individual's capital gains
change-a return to a capital gains deduction.  Under the budget bill,
individuals would be allowed a deduction of 50% of net capital gain.  The
maximum 28% rate would no longer apply.  For a taxpayer with a marginal rate
of 39.6, the effective rate would be 19.8%.  Special rules would apply for
collectibles.  The budget bill provides that two dollars of long-term loss
would offset only one dollar of ordinary income.  The changes would generally
apply to taxable years ending after Dec.  31, 1994; however, the capital loss
rules would apply to losses arising in taxable years beginning after Dec.  31,
1995.

Indexing of capital gains is coming under the budget bill as it would allow
taxpayers, other than a C corporation, to index the basis of certain assets
for determining gain on the disposition of any property for the holding period
which begins after Dec.  31, 2000.  There is a provision that would allow
other assets to be treated as being required on Jan.  1, 2001 (with gain
recognized).  Another provision helping individuals is a modification and
liberalization of the existing 50% exclusion for the sale of certain small
business stock (would be subject to maximum rate rather than an exclusion).

A particularly helpful provision would allow individuals to deduct the loss on
the sale or exchange of a principal residence after Dec.  31, 1994.  Also,
gain could be rolled over more than once within a two-year period and a safe
harbor is added in the case of rollovers in the case of divorce or separation
for purposes of Section 1034.  The budget bill would also liberalize the
Section 121 exclusion rules.

Corporations.  The budget bill would add an alternative rate of 28% on the net
capital gain of a corporation if that rate is less than the corporation's
regular tax rate.  It also would add a special alternative rate of 21% on the
gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock.  Both
changes would generally apply to taxable years ending after Dec.  31, 1994.

Alternative minimum tax.  The depreciation adjustment for purposes of
computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations would
be repealed effective for property placed in service after Dec.  31, 1995.
Also, corporations will be able to use the AMT credit to offset a portion of
the corporation's minimum tax in excess of its regular tax in limited
circumstances.

Cost recovery.  The maximum amount that may be expensed would increase from
$17,500 to 19,000 for taxable years beginning in 1996 and $1,000 annually
through 2002 (to $25,000 for taxable years beginning in 2002 and thereafter).
The budget bill would clarify that a lessor can adjust the basis of certain
improvements upon termination of the lease.

Partnerships.  A simplified flow-through method for computing the taxes of
partners of electing large partnerships would be available.  The budget bill
also provides that the taxable year of a partnership would close for a partner
whose entire interest in a partnership terminates, whether by death,
liquidation or otherwise.

S corporations.  Generally effective for taxable years beginning after Dec.
31, 1995, a number of changes would be made that directly benefit those
choosing S corporations as way of doing business.  Among the many changes
would be an increase in the maximum number of shareholders to 75.

Health-related provisions.  The budget bill would make significant changes to
the tax treatment of long-term care expenses and insurance.  Also, to help
alleviate the high costs of medical expenses, the budget bill also would
introduce a tax-advantaged Medical Savings Account.  And the deduction for
health insurance expenses for the self-employed would increase gradually to
50% for taxable years beginning in 2002.

Estate and gift taxes.  The budget bill would increase the estate and gift tax
unified credit by an exemption equivalent amount of $25,000 annually from 1996
through 2001 to a maximum equivalent of $750,000.  It also would index for
inflation after the year 2000, the unified credit, annual gift tax exclusion,
the $750,000 reduction limit on special use valuation property, the $1 million
generation-skipping transfer tax exemption and the $1 million ceiling on the
value of a closely held business eligible for the special 4% interest rate
under Section 6166.  There also would be a new estate tax exclusion for
qualified family owned business interests for estates of decedents dying after
Dec.  31, 1995.  There are a number of other estate and gift taxes changes.

Extension of expiring provisions.  As with most major tax legislation, there
are a number of tax provisions that are given added or limited life or are
even reinstated.  They include:  (1) a work opportunity tax credit (similar to
the prior law targeted job credit), (2) an income exclusion for
employer-provided education assistance, (3) a research and experimentation
credit, (4) the special rule for contributions of qualified appreciated stock
to private foundations, and (5) the sunsetting of the low-income housing
credit.

Tax-exempt organizations.  The budget bill would add for intermediate
sanctions that the IRS may invoke against certain tax-exempt organizations.

Miscellaneous provisions.  There are a number of miscellaneous provisions
aimed at tax reform.  Some of the provisions would:

* Generally repeal the Section 936 credit for taxable years beginning after
Dec.  31, 1995.

* Clarify the exclusion for damages received on account of personal injury or
sickness.

* Provide that there will be no rollover (Section 1034) or exclusion of gain
(Section 121) for depreciation deductions attributable to principal
residences.

* Generally deny Section 1034 rollover treatment to non-U.S.  citizens for
non-U.S.  principal residences.

* Substantially modify the rules for foreign trust tax compliance and
treatment as well as the income estate and gift tax treatment of individuals
that lose U.S.  citizenship.

The budget bill, effective for contracts completed in taxable years ending
after the date of enactment, also would modify the look-back method for
long-term contracts.  It also would extend the luxury excise tax on
automobiles through Dec 31, 2002, correct the inflation adjustment and
decrease the rate of tax by 1% per year beginning after 1996.  The budget bill
also would increase the tax return preparer penalties, add a new set of
taxpayer bill of rights provisions and reform the earned income credit.

Jury Still Out

The only certainties are death and taxes.  But will there be a new tax law?
If there is one, what will it contain?  The answers to both questions must
wait for the smoke to clear from the budget battle that still rages on in the
nation's capital as we go to press.

Practitioner's Update


Can Your Work Papers Come Back and Haunt You?

Work papers, traditionally the dry stuff of an accountant's audit work, have
become a target for clients out to grab any evidence they can to back a
malpractice claim against their accountant.

Accounting firms, therefore, are closely reviewing work papers and often
making changes to more clearly show they followed the proper procedures in the
audit.  In most cases, work papers are altered routinely and without incident.
Accounting firms usually follow their own internal policies for recording,
signing and dating any changes.  There are no official guidelines on
maintaining work papers.

"There are no auditing standards that prescribe a methodology and maintenance
of work papers, only the fact that they need to exist," said Edmund (Randy)
Noonan, chairman of the AICPA's Auditing Standards Board and a partner with
KPMG Peat Marwick.

Slipping from firm policy

But when firms slip away from their own policies, they can find themselves in
a bind trying to explain why papers were altered in a way that might appear to
mitigate a charge of malpractice.  That's what happened to Coopers & Lybrand
in a recent case brought by Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  of Japan, which is
accusing C&L of altering the work papers for the 1989 audit of Value
Rent-A-Car Inc., which Mitsubishi acquired in 1990.

As reported in the lead story of the Nov.  2 Wall Street Journal, Mitsubishi
said it learned after the acquisition that Value had a $10 million negative
net worth, which was $4 million further into red ink than indicated in the
1989 financial statement audited by C&L.  It contended that C&L erased words
and figures and inserted new information in its work papers in an attempt to
protect itself from charges of negligence.  Mitsubishi said the changes, which
were not dated or signed, included a note saying that C&L had received
assurances from Value that certain liabilities didn't exist, such as
distributed customer coupons Mitsubishi now claims are worth $4 million.

Mitsubishi, which obtained C&L's final work papers as part of the discovery
process in its lawsuit against the accounting firm, had the unusual
opportunity to compare them with the original work papers, which had been
photocopied by the accounting firm it hired to replace C&L shortly after it
had acquired Value.  But C&L insists that the changes to the audit work papers
were "totally immaterial" to a bad investment decision by Mitsubishi, which
C&L claims ignored the numbers in the financial statements that showed a 1989
loss of $14 million as well as a negative worth of $6 million.  "Changes to
the work papers were made to reflect decisions made later in the audit
process, which was reflected in the financial statements," said Patrick J.
McDonnell, vice chairman of C&L's business assurances practice.

Still, the fact that C&L's auditors made the changes without following firm
policy fuels the skepticism over its intentions.  Indeed, McDonnell admitted
that any deviation from work paper policy was rare.  "Our policy is to leave a
trail," he said.  "Erasing is not something we normally would do, and it's
rare when work papers are not dated or signed."

Precautions

To help prevent future incidents, C&L is rolling out a new Notes-based
paperless audit system.  Called "CLASS," for C&L Automated Support System, it
enables auditors to prepare all work papers in a Windows-based computer
notebook.  The system, which is expected to be in use for all C&L clients by
the end of next year, is designed to make it easier for auditors to follow the
firm's policy for preparing and changing work papers.  The dating of changes,
for example, will be done automatically.

Such precautions, whether automatic or otherwise, will likely become more
common in all firms.  The controls firms use in preparing or altering work
papers should be made with the assumption that the work papers might later be
examined for proof of malpractice.-Paul Demery


Illinois Restricts Punitive Damages Award

Plaintiffs seeking financial recourse from accountants under Illinois law will
have a tougher time proving their case.  Under a new state law that restricts
punitive damages awarded against accountants, plaintiffs are saddled with a
stiff requirement to prove that their accountant acted far outside of standard
ethical procedures.

Tougher standards

"Perhaps the most important part of the new law is the standard set to justify
an award of punitive damages," Tom Wetzler, director of Government Relations
for the Illinois CPA Society, said in a recent Society newsletter.  "The
statute requires a plaintiff to prove the CPA acted with evil motive or
reckless and outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of harm,
and with a conscious indifference to the rights and safety of others."

Wetzler added that by requiring plaintiffs to prove the justification for
punitive damages with clear and convincing evidence, the law, which became
effective last year, demands a greater degree of proof than the ordinary
preponderance of evidence required in most civil lawsuits.

Other elements of the new law limit punitive damages to three times the value
of economic economic damages and allow punitive damages to be awarded only in
cases where compensatory damages are awarded.

Proportionate liability

Illinois also passed and made effective last year a law that abolished the
principle of joint and several liability and replaced it with proportionate
liability, under which accountants cannot be held liable for wrongful acts
committed by other partners of their firm.  -P.D.


Expect More State Tax Audits

Businesses may have a growing need to call on their accountants:  to minimize
the onslaught of efforts to collect state taxes.

Rather than impose politically unpopular tax increases to balance their
budgets, state revenue departments are increasing their numbers of auditors,
according to a survey of states by the Atlanta-based State Taxation Institute.
The survey found that individual state auditors assess on average more than $1
million each year.

Targeting out-of-state businesses

"Companies doing business in multiple states are particularly vulnerable
because auditors specializing in out-of-state companies post higher
assessments than their counterparts based in the home office," the Institute
said.  It noted that businesses based out-of-state are likely audit targets
because they have less political clout, are less familiar with rules on how to
comply with state tax laws and because many businesses don't realize they
should file returns under a state's nexus law.

The Institute also noted that some states have unusually large staffs of
auditors, such as mostly rural Alabama, whose 342-auditor department is the
nation's sixth largest.  Other states are extremely aggressive in out-of-state
operations.  The Institute said Florida, for example, keeps more auditors in
Atlanta (43) than the total number of auditors employed by Rhode Island (40).
-P.D.


CPA Exam to Become Non-Disclosed Because of Computerization

As of May of this year, question booklets and answers to the Uniform CPA Exam
will no longer be available after the exam is given.  The change, breaking a
tradition followed since the exam's inception in 1917, is one of the first
major steps toward a planned computerization of the exam by 2000.

The computer-based exam will enable CPA candidates to take the exam at any
time at hundreds of testing sites and provide for faster processing of test
results.  According to the AICPA and the National Association of State Boards
of Accountancy, which co-administer the exam, computerization will also make
it possible to create more complex questions, though essays will likely be
left out.

To prepare a large enough bank of questions to be used in computer-based
tests, which could be differentiated for each candidate, exams given as of May
will include questions that will not be included in the test taker's score but
stored for later use.  This will also enable the AICPA to judge the difficulty
of the questions before using them in exams.  The future use of these test
questions necessitates the non-disclosure of the exam materials.

In addition, non-disclosure will enable the AICPA to re-use questions
statistically proved to be a good measure of candidates' knowledge and skills.
And it is expected to increase grading fairness by providing for statistical
comparisons between different exams.

The AICPA said it will continue, however, to issue to candidates exam
preparation materials, including the unofficial answers to questions that will
no longer be used in exams.  -P.D.


CCH Acquired by Dutch Publisher

With three years of costly rebuilding finally behind it, legal and tax
publisher CCH Inc.  was expecting to begin showing some hefty profits in the
third and fourth quarters of this year.  "We'll see some dramatic earnings
growth in the last quarter," said spokeswoman Mary Dale Walters.

The projection of dramatic earnings growth is pale by comparison to Riverwood,
Ill.-based CCH's announcement that it had agreed to be taken over by Dutch
publishing giant Wolters Kluwer NV for $1.9 billion - more than three times
CCH's expected 1990 revenue of $600 million.  Wolters' offer of $55.50 per
share caused CCH's Class A shares of stock to nearly double in value to
$54.62.

The two companies said the acquisition would not cause any major changes in
CCH's operating philosophy or management structure, which will continue to be
headed by CEO Oakleigh Thorne.  The Thorne family, which owns 57% of CCH, has
indicated it will tender its shares to Amsterdam-based Wolters, a major
business-to-business publisher of legal, tax, medical and scientific
information with operations throughout the U.S.  and Europe.

Positioned for growth

CCH said it will be in an even better position to continue investing in new
technologies, building on its successful efforts in recent years to develop
CD-ROM-based research materials and its ProSystem fx tax software.  Indeed,
CCH said its technology was a big factor in making it attractive to Wolters,
which is just beginning to develop electronic publishing products in Europe.
Wolters also expects CCH to boost its efforts to expand its U.S.  operations.

One area the two companies expect to further explore is how they will deliver
products, particularly electronic ones.  CCH has already taken its initial
steps along this course by working with AT&T and MSN, the new on-line network
of the Microsoft Corp.  Traditionally, CCH has distributed its products using
its own Access technology platform.  Now, it is interested in seeing how it
can meet customer needs by catering to their preferred distribution channels.

"Wolters Kluwer shares [our] philosophy," said Thorne, adding that CCH's new
parent is "committed to expanding technology leadership and dedicated to
delivering products via the most desired proprietary and non-proprietary
media."  CCH's product line includes The Standard Federal Tax Reporter, The
U.S.  Master Tax Guide, CCH Federal Tax Guide, and various guides on human
resources and health care.-P.D.

California Passes LLP Law

California has joined the ranks of states with laws allowing accountants to
establish their firms as limited liability partnerships.

The California law, which created a new form of legal entity for the state
called a registered limited liability partnership, passed both houses of the
state legislature with few negative votes, largely due to strong support from
the state's accounting and legal professions.  The law also covers attorneys.
It became effective immediately when signed by Governor Pete Wilson in
October.

Like other states' LLP laws, California's offers LLP partners limited
liability protection while continuing the tax advantages granted to
partnerships.  It limits the professional liability of individual partners to
their own actions, protecting them from any tort or malpractice liability of
other partners.

Gale Case, president of the California Society of CPAs, said he expects many
small as well as large accounting firms to form as LLPs, since small firms
usually can't afford as much insurance.  He added that small firms that do
form as LLPs will probably begin to re-enter practice areas such as auditing
that they had considered too risky due to exposure to liability.

The law stipulates that partners of an accounting firm LLP must be either a
CPA, a public accountant or an accountancy corporation.  It precludes enrolled
agents because they are not licensed by the state.

Minimum insurance requirement.  To form as an LLP, an accounting practice must
satisfy one of three insurance requirements:  malpractice insurance coverage
not less than $100,000 per licensed person, whether or not the person is a
partner; at least $100,000 in trust or escrow cash, bank certificates of
deposit, U.S.  Treasury obligations, bank letters of credit or insurance
bonds; or a net worth of at least $10 million confirmed annually in a filing
with the California Secretary of State.  -P.D.


New Privity Law In New Jersey

Among the many bills on tort reform making their way through the halls of
legislative bodies, those up against the toughest obstacles usually include
measures on privity, which set the bounds in which accountants or other
targets can be sued by third parties.  Third parties, such as investor groups,
are often the biggest source of claims against accountants resulting from the
actions of the accountants' clients.

But privity laws have been making some headway.  Although bills in such states
as Texas, which has passed other tort reform measures, were derailed by the
aggressive lobbying of trial attorneys, efforts in New Jersey have been
successful in establishing strict privity standards.

In New Jersey, the privity statute enacted and made effective in 1995 states
that accountants can be liable for negligence to only two classes of potential
plaintiffs:  clients and non-clients who meet certain criteria.  The criteria
for non-clients requires the following situations:

* They must have been "specifically identified to the accountant in connection
with a specified transaction," and the accountant must have agreed that the
accountant's report would be provided to the non-client;

* The accountant must have known that the non-client "intended to rely upon
the professional accounting service in connection with that specified
transaction";

* The accountant must have "directly expressed" to the non-client, by words or
conduct, an understanding of the non-client's intended reliance.  -P.D.


Insurance For The Accountant

The Singer Insurance Group began in 1958 and more than 90% of its business
comes from CPAs who refer their clients to them.  They set up a Complete
Accountants Program whereby they give seminars to accounting firms on what
they should know about insurance for their clients.  They also do CPE seminars
where they discuss the respective roles and responsibilities of CPAs and
insurance agents.  According to David Singer, vice president of the firm, CPAs
are in a rather awkward position today.  Although they have professional
liability coverage which covers errors and omissions and although as
accountants they should be involved in the insurance process, he feels that
they should not, however, be involved as insurance experts.  Singer believes
the accountant's primary role is to be a catalyst and to bring up ideas to
think about and then they should shift the E&O exposure to the insurance
agent.

By the same token, Singer warned that accountants have to consider their own
involvement with business interruption insurance.  He pointed out that if an
accounting firm has a fire, there is a reasonably good chance that they
wouldn't need such coverage because their business isn't really being
interrupted.  Instead, they would incur additional expenses to get back into
business right away.  That's known as extra expense insurance.

Depreciation:  Courts Turn Thumbs Down On Irs's "Collectible" Stance


It's hard to believe.  Fourteen years after Congress adopted the ACRS and then
MACRS statutory cost recovery systems, the IRS is still fighting taxpayers in
court over what can and cannot be depreciated.  In three recent cases, the IRS
has been told, enough is enough.

The victorious included two professional musicians who used valuable, antique
instruments in their work.  These cases, decided under pre-'87 law, received
much attention in the media, presumably because of the inherent human interest
factor.  But an even more recent Tax Court case, involving "exotic" cars, has
apparently expanded the result of the musician cases by making it applicable
under current law.  These cases, taken together, clarify the basic law of
depreciation and seem to show that it is still evolving.  These cases may also
justify practitioners reconsidering their understanding of this area to be
sure they are not overlooking potential deductions-either for themselves or
for clients.

Musicians Redux

Brian Liddle, a professional musician, purchased a 17th century Ruggeri bass
violin (or viol) in 1984 for $28,000.  He insured it for its then-appraised
value of $38,000.  He used it to practice at home, at rehearsals and for
performances.  The bass suffered physical deterioration from this use and
eventually lost its value for performance purposes.

On his 1987 tax return, Liddle claimed a deduction for $3,170 under Section
168's accelerated cost recovery system (ACRS) then in effect.  The IRS
disallowed the deduction initially claiming that the viol would appreciate in
value.  Later abandoning that theory (see cases such as Noyce1), the IRS
argued before the Third Circuit that Liddle could claim the ACRS deduction
only if he could first establish that the viol had a determinable useful
life.2 The IRS said this could not be done in light of the fact that the viol
was over 300 years old and still appreciating in value.

It also argued that the viol, as a work of art, did not have a determinable
useful life.  Generally, works of art that hang on a wall or works that are
considered to be museum pieces are not depreciable because the Service has
ruled that such items do not have a determinable useful life.3

The Court reviewed the basics of depreciation both before and after 1981.
Before 1981, Section 167 governed the allowance of depreciation and required
that the property have a determinable useful life.  See Regs.  1.167(a)-1(a)
and (b).  This life was related to the asset's usefulness to the taxpayer's
trade or business and could reflect economic as well as possibly physical
considerations.  In 1981, the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) replaced this
approach with ACRS as part of a plan to stimulate the economy.  ACRS allowed a
deduction for "recovery property" under Section 168.  Recovery property was
tangible property "of a character subject to the allowance for
depreciation"-used in a trade or business or held for the production of
income.  Recovery property was assigned five categories for determining the
actual amount of the deduction.

The IRS argued that ACRS, then in effect, did not eliminate the pre-'81
requirement that tangible personal property used in a trade or business must
also have a determinable useful life to qualify as property of a character
subject to the allowance for depreciation.

The Third Circuit disagreed with the Service and held that only the following
two pre-'81 requirements had to be met:  (1) the asset must be subject to wear
and tear or obsolescence and (2) the asset is used in a trade or business or
held for the production of income.

The Court allowed Liddle the depreciation deduction because the viol was used
in his trade and did suffer wear and tear in that use.  The Court also
rejected IRS's attempt to classify the viol as a nondepreciable work of art
because in Liddle's hands, the "bass viol was a tool of his trade."

Richard Simon and his wife, professional violinists, purchased two 19th
century Tourte bows which they used in their work.  The bows suffered wear and
tear as a result of such use.  Although purchased in 1985, the tax year in
controversy was 1989 when the Simons claimed ACRS deductions of almost
$11,000.  The same issues were raised here as in Liddle and the Second Circuit
also disagreed with the IRS, holding that IRS's argument (i.e., having to
first show a determinable useful life) contradicted Congress's intent when it
enacted ERTA.4

The Court distinguished Browning5, a case involving a musician who sought to
depreciate three antique violins, in which the Ninth Circuit upheld a denial
of depreciation.  In Browning, the Ninth Circuit held that the musician failed
to establish a useful life for the violins but Browning was a pre-ERTA case
and there was no evidence indicating that he used the instruments in his
professional work.

Both Liddle and Simon were decided under the ACRS system that applied to
property placed in service between Jan.  1, 1981 and Jan.  1, 1987.  After
1986, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 replaced ACRS with a modified ACRS system
called MACRS which eliminated the concept of recovery property.

Exotic Cars

Bruce Selig purchased in 1987 and 1988 "exotic" automobiles to exhibit at car
shows for a fee.  Exotic cars are state-of-the-art, high technology vehicles
with unique design features or equipment.

The cars were not set up for use on the street; they were not driven and were
used exclusively for shows or promotional photography.  Between 1987 and 1990,
Selig claimed various deductions for depreciation on the cars.  The IRS
challenged whether cars maintained in pristine condition and shown for a fee
could be depreciated.  The Tax Court held for Selig because the cars were
subject to obsolescence (due to the unique high-tech features), and the fact
that he failed to show the useful lives of the cars was irrelevant.6

The Court reviewed the history of depreciation in the tax law and the Liddle
and Simon cases which had been decided under prior law.  The Court concluded
that in enacting the current version of Section 168, applicable to property
placed in service after 1986, Congress did not intend to reimpose the pre-ERTA
requirement that a taxpayer must show a determinable useful life of the
property.  The Court said it is following Liddle and Simon in interpreting
Section 168 as restated.

Richard J.  Sapinski, partner in Sills Cummis Zuckerman Radin Tischman Epstein
& Gross in Newark, NJ, was Bruce Selig's attorney.  He agreed that Selig seems
to be carrying forward the result of the musician cases (Liddle and Simon)
under the post-'86 law.  In fact, Sapinski was surprised that the Selig
decision was a Tax Court Memo decision rather than a reported decision.  I
expected that the results of Liddle and Simon would apply under MACRS, said
David L.  Segal, sole practitioner in Philadelphia and the attorney who
represented Brian Liddle, the bass violinist.

The Selig Court listened to testimony indicating that new and improved
features for the cars would come along within a few years and held that the
cars had a limited useful life as show cars because of obsolescence.  It noted
that a precise useful life did not have to be determined to establish that the
cars were depreciable.  It also said that the cars were not museum pieces of
indeterminable useful life.  In doing so, it distinguished Harrah's Club7, in
which the Court of Claims did not allow a depreciation deduction for the cost
of restoring antique automobiles to a casino that maintained a car museum to
attract business.

The Selig Tax Court clearly stated that the fact that the show cars might
become museum pieces did not matter since it was satisfied that the exotic
cars were show pieces and not museum pieces.  Sapinski explained that it was
irrelevant whether the exotic cars might become museum pieces or appreciate in
value.  "Our argument was that is irrelevant; that it's the asset's usefulness
in the taxpayer's trade or business [that is relevant]," said Sapinski.

Sapinski also doesn't believe IRS will appeal Selig because it is appealable
to the Third Circuit which already decided Liddle.  But he added that he
thinks the IRS will still argue the basic issue.  "I would think this is a
case-specific thing and I think they'll keep that option open.  If I were on
their side, I would be looking for a lawyer with Louis 14th furniture to make
an egregious case," said Sapinski.  Dr.  William Raby, CPA and editor of The
Raby Report, said, "I'm sure it's going to be appealed."  He thinks Selig
might be vulnerable as to applying Liddle and Simon to post-'86 law.

Implications and Irksome Questions

Selig should focus a new light on certain valuable assets that may be
nondepreciable collectibles or works of art in some circumstances but
depreciable business assets in other circumstances.  Some commentators believe
that assets such as these may now be depreciable if they are used in a
business in a manner that results in physical wear or tear or economic
obsolescence.  Passive use in a business such as hanging on a wall may not be
enough.  But what about assets such as antique furniture or carpeting that are
part of an office?

In 1996, can practitioners say they understand depreciation?  These cases
raise fundamental questions:  Is useful life necessary to depreciate an asset?
If an asset is depreciable, is it always clear how to calculate the amount of
the deduction?  "I think a lot of people were surprised that after 14 years,
there was still a fundamental concept that hadn't been resolved," said Ada
Rousso, senior manager at Price Waterhouse in Washington, DC.

Segal said, "Let me tell you what's at stake here, the depreciation deduction
has nothing to do with accounting...It is the primary tool for encouraging or
slowing down capital formation.  The IRS thought there's lots more law to it
than in fact it turned out to be."

Sapinski said the decision might mean depreciation has been overlooked for
certain assets such as classic furniture used in a trade or business.  He
pointed out that "Judge Halpern who decided this [Selig] case was a dissenting
judge in the Liddle and Simon cases.  He felt this would open the door to
depreciation of Louis 14th furniture in a lawyer's office or other property
that would otherwise not be depreciable because they are collector's items."

Raby said, "I guess you'd have to ask yourself what it is people have that
they are not now depreciating [which could be items being overlooked for
depreciation]."

Sapinski added that practitioners should evaluate whether the assets they have
are properly classified and perhaps take a second look at what they may have
considered nondepreciable in light of these cases.  Segal said, "if people are
genuinely using their products in business in a way that subjects them to
obsolescence, or wear and tear, then they should get a deduction because
Congress wanted them to employ that equipment."

Investment implications.  Segal, who is also president of the Philadelphia
Youth Orchestra, suggested that the musician cases might provide an
opportunity to refinance America's symphonies by placing musical instruments
into leasing partnerships.  Segal explained that orchestras have millions of
dollars' worth of great instruments which could be turned into cash for needy
orchestras through a sales-leaseback.  An investor can buy the instruments for
full value and then lease them back to the orchestra for say a 1% per year
rental stream.  The investor can get seven years' of depreciation out it.  The
orchestra takes the purchase money and can invest part of it in an annuity and
use the rest for operating expenses.  The orchestra has no use for the
depreciation so it can pass it to investors; Liddle says as long as a
professional musician is using it, the instrument is depreciable.

How Much to Deduct?

Under the current MACRS rules, among other provisions, depreciable assets
other than buildings can fall into one of six categories, i.e., three, five,
seven, 10, 15 or 20-year class life.  The rate of depreciation depends on the
method, recovery period and whether the half-year or mid-quarter convention
applies.  Tables are available to simplify the actual computation.  Congress
intended to "deemphasize" the application of useful life and salvage value
when it reformed depreciation in 1981.

While the decisions discussed in this article did not directly deal with
computing a specific useful life, the Selig case raises a potential
difficulty.  In Selig, the Tax Court held that the cars were depreciable
because they were subject to obsolescence.  Sapinski said, "We didn't have to
prove an exact period for useful life.  The accountant used the rates for
cars, five years."  In Selig, the Court said, citing Columbia Malting Co.8 and
Reg.  1.167(a)-9, that a taxpayer could recover the cost of business property
over a period shorter than the ordinary useful life of the property if the
taxpayer could show that the assets would become obsolete in the business
prior to the end of such ordinary useful life.  Selig had testified that
within three or four years, the cars' state-of-the-art technology could
change.  An associate of Selig testified that the cars had a life of one or
two years before something better came along.  Yet Selig's accountant used
five years, the normal MACRS category for a car.

Sapinski said, "It is my feeling that it would not be right [to write off the
cars over a shorter period] because I think the whole premise is that you
don't have to get into these determinations because Congress has already
chosen your slot."

Raby said the issue is whether these assets (collectibles) are eligible for
depreciation under Section 168.  "That's a yes or no question.  Once you've
decided the answer is yes, then the question is into what category do they
fall which then determines the useful life," said Raby.  He said MACRS
eliminates arguments about useful life.

One commentator, however, went so far as to say that in citing the Columbia
Malting decision, Selig suggests that a taxpayer in a situation that is
similar to Selig should be prepared to show the period over which property
similar to the property in question has become obsolete.  This approach,
however, seems inconsistent with the flow of logic indicated above.

Ultimate Lesson

"The main thing that you need to learn from [these cases] is that it pays to
challenge what are more or less 'received truths,'" said Raby.  He noted that
people had accepted that collectibles, whether they were antique cars, violins
or french desks, were not depreciable.  "I wonder how often, how many times in
our daily work things come to us and we know you can't do something, and so we
never try doing it.  So, maybe practitioners have to stand back occasionally
and say 'why can't we do it?'," added Raby.

BUSINESS CONSULTING:  Protecting Business Clients With The Right Insurance


Woody Allen, in his classic film, "Take The Money And Run," put his lead
character in a prison's solitary confinement cell, which consisted of his
descent into a hole in the earth and then being locked in under a metal
grating.  Allen didn't think that was enough.  He had an insurance agent
accompany the prisoner.

Granted that didn't seem to play well with the insurance crowd but it strikes
a rather interesting chord today primarily because many accountants are taking
a proactive role as business consultants to their clients.  As a result,
accountants are paying increased attention to the insurance carried by their
business clients.

Why is this so?  Why is the accountant doing so much of the work and not the
insurance broker or company?  And what's actually happening?

Getting Involved

Businesses today want their accountants to get involved because to them most
insurance brokers and companies appear to be glorified salesmen, only trying
to sell them more and more insurance.

Alvin Goldberg, a furrier in New York City, pointed out that "most brokers
don't tell you that you're overinsured.  If anything, they tell you that you
may be underinsured."

So, what is going on today is that business clients are seeking out their
accountants to ride herd on exactly what insurance they need and what they
don't need.

Add to this the fact that many businesses have little appreciation for the
casualty and liability risks to which their companies are exposed.

Peter Berlant, partner in Anchin, Block & Anchin, an accounting firm based in
New York City, said that accountants today are more intimately involved with
the client's business than the broker, the insurance company or any other
adviser.  Why?  "Because we as accountants can very often identify risks that
other advisers can't.  For example, I have a client who is extremely dependent
on a particular supplier.  We have advised them to obtain contingent business
interruption insurance covering that supplier.  If the supplier has a problem
such as something going wrong in the warehouse and can't deliver, then our
client is protected against claims from his own customers."

Berlant also believes that typically the insurance broker may not ask the
questions to get a real understanding of what the business is all about.
That's where he feels the accountant can come into this.  "We don't replace
the broker but we are a resource for our clients in understanding the
business."

Berlant illustrated this by recounting the case of a client, a wholesale
glassware importer who questioned the extent of her liability coverage.  "We
felt that she had to have product liability insurance.  It's not an expensive
policy but all she needed was for one glass to go from the factory to the
customer with a chipped rim and all of a sudden even though she may not be
liable, she's going to get sued."

Berlant said that the accountant can also reduce costs by a simple review of
the policy and the client's business operation.  For example, he noted that in
the workers' compensation area, the client many times overspends for insurance
because of the classification of workers.  "It is vitally important that the
worker is classified properly because that classification impacts considerably
on the ratings and charges."

He pointed out that the accountant also has to know how the policy is written.
"The policy is subject to audit.  The auditors that the insurance companies
send in may not fully understand how the client's bookkeeping or business
works.  For example, in most policies, the risks in workers' comp depends on
the number of hours the particular employee worked at a certain function.  It
is not supposed to be based upon wages; yet the premiums many times are based
on wages.  Most policies also exclude bonuses and overtime payments from the
wage base in determining premiums.  Often, insurance auditors overlook these
things and take the gross payroll figure instead.  Those numbers, when
translated into premiums, can be rather significant."

Nature of the Review

Victor S.  Rich, senior partner in New York-based Edward Isaacs & Company,
CPAs and financial consultants, said that the job is to make sure the areas
are covered and that the insurance is adequate.  "How often we do it depends
on how large the client is and how large an internal staff the client has.
And, of course, what they are paying us to do or not to do."

Rich explained that too often accountants jump into reviews before they know
what they are being asked to do.  "Are we doing an audit, a compilation, or
what?"  he said.  "What's the nature of our engagement?"

He added, "If our engagement is simply a compilation, we should not be looking
at insurance because we may be liable for not picking up something.  We look
at it when the client specifically asks the question."  He cautioned that by
doing the reverse, an accountant is extending the engagement beyond what was
anticipated when the engagement letter was signed.  "Are we compiling figures?
Are we involved in a certification?  The levels of responsibility increase
depending on the nature of the engagement."

How often then should these reviews be conducted?

"Every time we go to a client," said Berlant.  "No matter how often or on what
basis, insurance is part of our program.  Sometimes we will simply look to see
that they are maintaining coverage but typically once a year we go through the
coverages with the chief financial officer or the other principals of the
company, looking not only for amounts of coverage but for the types of
coverage."

Theodore S.  Levy, partner and vice president in the accounting firm of
Kamenitz Uhlfelder in Baltimore noted that his firm reviews the insurance
needs of their clients when they do their year-end financial statements.
"It's part of our procedure to look at their insurance coverage.  We
scrutinize all the policies and we see if the coverage they have makes sense.
This includes their limits of liability and how much inventory they are
insuring.  Sometimes, the clients say, same as last year.  We don't accept
that because the client many times doesn't even look at their own inventory
levels."

Kamenitz Uhlfelder orchestrates an administrative retreat which is a
comprehensive, full-day planning session with the client's key personnel and
advisers.  Levy said, "we bring in their insurance people and we request that
they give us a complete analysis of all the client's coverage."

David Marcus, partner in the accounting firm of Paneth, Huber & Zimmerman in
New York City, said that his firm works closely with their clients' insurance
brokers and insurance companies.  "In effect, we act as the overseer in that
regard so that we are able to evaluate properly each proposal and compare one
against another."

Marcus noted that his firm volunteers insurance reviews at least on a two-year
basis, depending on the client.  He said that the reason for the two-year
spread is because of the proliferation today of multi-year (usually three)
insurance policies.

Marcus said that normally, unless something out of the ordinary happens such
as a major purchase, a change in the business, the addition of new principals
or something dramatic like an increase in premiums, they don't necessarily go
into a big review every year.

Erwin Petschauer, principal in the brokerage firm of John Petschauer, Inc.  in
Ridgewood, N.Y., corroborated what Marcus detailed with respect to multi-year
plans.  He said that in the area of property casualty insurance, many large
companies are writing three-year plans rather than on an annual basis.  "To
insurance companies, it serves as a method of retention while to the business
customer, its fixes the premiums at a set amount for a period of time without
any increase."  He cited General Accident Insurance Company as one company
that is using three-year plans.

However, insurance brokers tend to favor an annual review.  Gerald L.  Tobias,
principal in the Westchester, N.Y.-based Richwood Brokerage Company,
emphasized that his firm reviews insurance religiously.  "We look at changes
in exposures or limits and we review annually based on the expiration of a
client's insurance.  Most clients who are paying a lot in the way of premiums
may even want insurance reviews more frequently."

What to Look For

Having business insurance doesn't necessarily mean that the business is
protected but having the right insurance is what it's all about.

"Basically, we try to stay ahead of the times," said Levy.  "For example, one
policy that is becoming more and more popular these days because of the law
suits now proliferating is employment-related practices liability insurance."

He stressed that people don't realize how easy they can get sued for
harassment or wrongful dismissal, even if they haven't done anything.  "This
kind of insurance protects them in a number of ways:  it pays for legal fees
and gives them the necessary liability coverage."

Another area that companies overlook is employee benefit omissions.  "For
example," Levy said, "if you forget to cover somebody in your group plan,
you're liable if it's a benefit."  He added that "we can see the cost of
insurance generally coming down a lot recently so we encourage our clients to
protect themselves to take advantage of this."

Levy specifically noted that it is surprising how many businesses have
inadequate coverage.  For example, he pointed out an instance where employees
drive their own cars for a business purpose.  "If there is an accident," he
said, "they may not be covered because the car is being used for business and
is insured instead for personal use.  The policy to protect this is called
"Business Use of Owned Vehicle" and it is relatively an inexpensive
endorsement."

Levy said that the partners in his firm constantly talk with their brokers and
insurance companies so that we are always on the alert for new products and we
pass them on to our clients."

Rich added that the real value an accountant brings to the table is to
understand exactly what the insurance covers and whether it is adequate.
"Suppose you have a client with inventory covered at a public warehouse and
the client changes warehouses but doesn't amend the insurance to cover the new
location?  Then it's clear what will happen and it happens more frequently
than we would like."

Rich pointed out that business interruption is important today.  "You must
make sure that the loss coverage is sufficient.  You may have a growing
company and your original insurance is for half a million dollars in
inventory.  Now look at the company three years down the road where the
inventory is running at $3 million.  But, you only have a half million in
coverage.  You've got to expand the insurance with the expansion of the
business."

He said that what he looks for is a risk reward analysis where you have to
determine what you are willing to pay for what you are willing to accept.  "In
effect, it comes down to what's the deductible and what's the coverage?"

Tobias said that he works with accountants on ways to lower premiums by
raising deductibles.  "A client generally appreciates it when an accountant
says that they can save them money by raising the deductible.  If the loss can
be $4 million, is there a big difference in having a $1,000 or $5,000
deductible?  Clients like this and are appreciative of accountants looking at
this to save them money."

Picking the Right Coverage

According to David J.  Singer, vice president of the Singer Insurance Group in
Teaneck, N.J., there are some basic policies that accountants should review.

1.  Regular General Liability.  Accountants should be looking for businesses
having umbrella policies that cover a wide range of areas.  For example, many
insurance companies will advocate a general insurance but will fail to
recognize risk management.  "Insuring your computer is one thing," said
Singer, "but making backups and taking them offsite is even better.  It should
be coupled with a disaster plan.  Insurance then is just a part of risk
management."  2.  Fire & Theft Insurance.  Most clients have this but do they
have any disaster recovery plans?  Singer believes that accountants must
advise clients about this aspect.  "We know you have insurance but will it
really make you whole?  You still have to recover from the fire.  It's not
just a question of money here."  3.  Business Interruption.  This type of
policy will provide reimbursement for a major loss of income caused by an
insured catastrophe.  Singer notes that this is standard coverage.  "Almost
everybody writes it."  Two of the leaders offering this policy are the Wausau
Insurance Companies and the St.  Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company.  4.
Employment Practices Liability.  This is a relatively new area to explore and
it covers areas such as sexual harassment, discrimination, wrongful
termination and the like.  Many accountants working hand-in-hand with
employment practices attorneys will advocate the preparation of an employee
handbook or manual.  5.  The coverage here is not yet mainstream.  Only a
limited number of companies such as Chubb, American International and Pen Ex,
to name a few, are writing this policy.  Some insurance companies will only
look at it if the business has a minimum number of employees.  6.  Employee
Benefit Liability.  This is coverage that protects the employer from the
liability in the administration of the Employee Benefit Plan.  It is becoming
more and more popular today with the increase in such plans.  This policy
would include improperly counseling plan participants, improperly interpreting
coverages, handling records carelessly and failing to enroll or terminate plan
participants.  7.  Employee Dishonesty Coverage.  This is highly important
today, insisted Singer.  "As we know, when someone steals, the client sues the
accountant because the client thinks that the accountant should have been
Sherlock Holmes.  We advise accountants to encourage all their clients to have
this type of coverage."

Singer also recommended that accountants be aware of specialty-type coverages.
For example, if the client is in a particular business, such as the travel,
entertainment, advertising or computer industries, insurance coverage should
be provided for professional liability or errors and omissions.

There is also the multi-peril policy that is a combination policy including
property, liability, bonding, valuable papers, business interruption and other
coverages.  The advantage here is that there are often discounts available for
such a combination package policy.

In addition, products liability is important and is usually made part of the
general liability policy.

The so-called umbrella policy is another layer of liability coverage on top of
basic liability policies such as automobile and general liability.  This
policy offers broader coverage and picks up exposures such as excess coverage
under specific personal policies (e.g., personal liability and automobile)
that might not be covered in the basic policy.

Key-person life insurance coverage should also be considered.  Robert Rudolf,
managing partner of Richwood Brokerage, estimated that only about a quarter of
today's businesses have key-person insurance .  "Key-policy coverage pays cash
directly to the company as the policy beneficiary when the key person either
dies or becomes disabled.  For example, you can insure someone for $50,000 or
$50 million.  The idea is to peg it to that person's worth to the company,"
concluded Rudolf.

There are a wide range of other policies to consider such as deferred
compensation indemnification that applies to officers and directors of
companies, disability insurance and of course, group health insurance which is
becoming more and more involved.

Part of any accountant's job is reviewing the insurance schedule.

Traditionally, accountants review an insurance schedule, said Marcus.  "For
example, with plants and equipment, we want to be certain that the coverage is
adequate and to be sure it's the right type such as replacement cost versus
original cost.  We also check the inventory on hand to afford the client a
full review of what they require to cover their inventory properly."

However, when reviewing such a schedule, Singer mentioned some concrete
cautions.  "Take the business interruption policy.  There is generally a
worksheet involved and that worksheet is very often filled out by accountants.
It should not be!  What the client is doing is making a projection of what
their profits will be and if they have a fire and they are underinsured, they
will sue the accountant if the accountant filled out that worksheet.  The
accountant can help the client but the client is the one making the
projections.  In fact, the engagement letter the accountant has with the
client must have a disclaimer that those numbers are the client's and not the
accountant's."

Picking the Right Broker

When it comes to finding a broker, Singer believes that the accountant should
be looking at the following areas:

1.  Departmentalization within the insurance group because personal insurance,
commercial, life and group health should be handled by different people.  2.
Affiliation with at least a half dozen major insurance companies.  3.  A
specific claims department because claims people are a special breed and they
know how to deal with insurance companies.  4.  Ability to put together a risk
management program.  The broker shouldn't be just an order taker.

Verifying Adequate Insurance

In today's economic climate, many businesses look to the accountant to protect
their interests.  There are few conditions that can reverse the fortunes of a
successful company as quickly as the lack of adequate insurance coverage.

According to Robert L.  Gray, executive director of the New York State Society
of CPAs, one of the most important services accountants can provide to protect
themselves and their clients is to verify that adequate insurance is being
carried that will cover the most common and in some cases even remote
casualties.  Gray said that "This requires that the accountant have a
functional knowledge of the types of insurance available and the ability to
determine if the client is adequately covered."

Gray added that "the accountant need not be an insurance specialist but must
be able to work with and feel confident in the ability of a client's insurance
agent."

INSIDE THE IRS


Providing Direct Deposit of Refunds to 1040 Paper Filers Instead of your
clients waiting for their refunds to come via the postal worker, they can now
see them directly deposited in their checking or savings accounts.

The IRS has released Form 8888, Direct Deposit of Refund, which can be
completed and attached to Form 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ, 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ.  The
Service will then send the refund directly to the client's financial
institution provided, of course, it is one that will accept direct deposits.

The Service said that the form cannot be used if the taxpayer is filing
electronically.  In that instance, there must be a specific request for direct
deposit by using Form 8453, 8453-OL or 8453-NR.

It also does not apply to Form 1040PC (since direct deposit election can be
made with that form) or if the taxpayer is filing a tax return for a prior
year; Form 8888 can only be used for the current year returns.  In addition,
it doesn't apply to a deceased taxpayer or where a joint return is being filed
as a surviving spouse.

The IRS said that it has not yet made any provision for notifying the taxpayer
when the direct deposit has actually been made.  For now, it will be up to the
taxpayers to check with their own financial institutions to determine if the
money has been received.  Finally, the Service said that it will only make
direct deposits to accounts in U.S.  financial institutions located in the
United States.


Surprisingly, IRS Unhappy With $13 Million Allocation

The IRS gets $13 million under an appropriation bill signed by the President
and is not terribly thrilled with it.  The problem is that the money is
earmarked for a program that would use legal firms and private collection
agencies to collect unpaid taxes.

In a letter sent to Sen.  David Pryor (D., Ark), Margaret Milner Richardson,
the IRS Commissioner, said that she had "concern" regarding the language in
the appropriations bill that would mandate the Service to spend $13 million
"to initiate a program to utilize private counsel law firms and debt
collection activities."

She added that she had "grave reservations" about using private contractors to
contact taxpayers on their delinquent tax debts without Congress having a
thorough understanding of the costs, benefits and risks of embarking on such a
course.

Questions abound

In her letter, Ms.  Richardson set forth a number of areas to be considered
such as the impact private debt collectors would have on the public's
perception of the fairness of tax administration and the security of the
financial information provided to the IRS.

She also expressed concern about how taxpayers' rights would be protected and
their privacy guaranteed as well as whether privatizing collection of tax debt
was really a good business decision for the federal government.  She cited the
fact that presently the IRS telephone collection efforts yield about $26 for
every dollar expended compared with more complex and difficult cases that
yield only $10 for every dollar spent.  Accordingly, she doubts whether
private collectors will be able to obtain the same successful return as the
IRS.

The matter is still up in the air because Sen.  Pryor (a key opponent of the
bill) isn't entirely clear on whether the IRS will be required to spend the
money.  Right now the Service is studying how best to proceed.


Updated Electronic Filing Procedures for 1996

The IRS has issued Rev.  Proc.  95-49 setting forth the various requirements
for electronic filing for the 1996 tax season for those who participate in the
program with respect to Form 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ.  It updates and
supersedes Rev.  Proc.  94-63.  The effective date was Nov.  22, 1995.

Under the new changes, the Service noted that Form 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ
cannot be electronically filed after Oct.  15, 1996, even if the taxpayer has
been granted an extension to file a return beyond that date.  It also pointed
out that an amended tax return cannot be electronically filed nor can returns
with foreign addresses or those for a decedent.

Furthermore, the new Rev.  Proc.  details the procedures that applicants must
follow to be accepted into the electronic filing program including their
responsibilities, the penalties that could be applied, advertising standards
and administrative reviews, to name a few.

With respect to such applicants, the procedure makes it easier for a certified
public accountant to be accepted into the program by dispensing with the
submission of a fingerprint card along with the application and requiring
instead evidence of the individual's professional status.


The Latest IRS Audit Techniques Guides

The IRS keeps pumping them out.  The Market Segment Specialization Program
(MSSP) audit techniques guides help IRS examiners focus on the significant
issues in a particular industry or class of taxpayers.  According to the
Service, they are designed to make audits more efficient and to ensure the
uniform application of tax laws.  Here is what's in the three latest guides:

Beauty and barber shops.  The IRS noted that the salon industry is cash
intensive, that the majority of the work force had a high school education and
were graduates of a cosmetology school.  The Service often found that the
books and records provided were rather limited and that the examiner would
have to conduct a very good initial review by utilizing various questions in
order to determine income.  The guide contains more than 50 potential
questions.

The IRS said that additional considerations were in reconciling the reported
tax return income to the taxpayer's financial status, evaluating the intensive
cash situation to determine the extent of the income probe and designing a
test to determine income from a reported or known reliable variable directly
related to that income.

The Service emphasized that an important examination step, of course, was to
compare the type of services and the number of appointments to the amount of
income reported.  It provided specific audit techniques to the industry that
can be used including how to calculate unreported tips.

Auto body and repair industry.  The almost 100-page guide explained that most
auto body shops were small to medium sized businesses operated as sole
proprietorships, small partnerships or closely held corporations and they
ranged in size from the corner shop to large franchises with many locations.
It pointed out that body shops were particularly interesting because they
combined a service-type business with retailing aspects.

The IRS noted that although they provide labor and skill, they must also
purchase and resell the needed parts.  Accordingly, this, they maintained,
often created conflicts in determining whether shops were required to maintain
inventories.

The guide stated that the industry was extremely competitive as a result of
the influence that insurance companies exerted and inasmuch as insurance paid
for many claims, they looked for the most cost-efficient businesses.  Thus, a
shop that was willing to use less expensive parts as opposed to factory
originals would be preferred.

The Service called attention to the fact that because inventory adjustments
had been consistently made in the auto body-repair industry, the examiner
would find it necessary to become acquainted with procedures for making a
change in the accounting method.  For example, for a taxpayer on the accrual
basis, the change will be limited to the inventory itself.  For a cash basis
taxpayer, the change will include the sales and purchases.

Also, the Service pointed out that with the advent of Rev.  Proc.  92-20, the
examiner needed to consider the possibility of allowing the taxpayer to spread
the adjustment over several years.

The guide contains 26 sample questions that may be used in the initial
interview, pointing out what would indicate an underreporting of income as
well as specific audit tips and special employment tax issues that might
easily arise.

Reforestation industry.  The comprehensive report was the work of a team from
Examination Collection and the State of Oregon Revenue Department.  Their
basic goals were to determine if compliance was a problem in this industry, if
the contractors were filing all required federal and state returns, if the
returns were substantially correct and then to make recommendations to the
proper governmental agencies in order to strengthen voluntary compliance
within the industry.

The IRS said a major concern was that many transactions between contractors
was done with cash, thereby creating little or no audit trail.  Those payments
also reduced the likelihood that a Form 1099 was filed or that the contractors
even deposited the cash into their business accounts.  The Service noted that
a possible indicator of unreported income could be illustrated by the
contractor who produced receipts for business expenses paid in cash but not
previously deducted on the return.

A detailed guideline for interviewing contractors along with suggested
questions is included.


Time for Action Regs Proposed

In proposed rulemaking IA-36-91, the IRS has issued a document that contains
proposed regs relating to the time for performance of acts by taxpayers and by
the Commissioner, a district director, or the director of a regional service
center, where the last day for performance falls on a Saturday, Sunday or
legal holiday.  In particular, the proposed regs would remove the list of
legal holidays and other outdated material.

The list of holidays would be replaced by citations to the law (legal holidays
in the District of Columbia is found in D.C.  Code Ann.  28-2701) from which
the holidays would be discerned.  In this way, said the IRS, future changes in
the law regarding holidays would not require amendments to the regs.


Practicing Before the IRS Doesn't Get Any Easier

The Office of Director of Practices has outlined four specific scenarios that
illustrate the types of conduct that would warrant disciplinary action on
those who practice before the IRS.

Coming under Circular 230, the Service said that these represent composites of
matters coming to the director's office and do not constitute precedent in any
one matter.  They are as follows:

* Practitioner A makes estimated tax payments exceeding his personal tax
liability but doesn't file corresponding income tax returns.  He gives the
excuse that he had no time because of a busy schedule.  He could get suspended
or disbarred.

* Practitioner B represents a client whose return has been selected for audit.
The practitioner calls the revenue agent who will be conducting the audit but
he is unavailable.  They go back and forth, each missing the other's call.
Finally, Practitioner B telephones claiming it's a medical emergency,
whereupon the alarmed agent takes the call.  The practitioner's action
constitutes what is called "disreputable conduct."

* Practitioner C cancels conferences with an appeals officer on five different
occasions leaving messages on his answering machine that he had scheduling
problems.  Conduct constitutes "unreasonable delay" and could warrant
suspension or disbarrment.

* Practitioner D pleads guilty to making false statements in obtaining
federally insured mortgage and winds up with a felony conviction.  The
director can impose a suspension on the practitioner based on dishonesty.


IRS Briefs

* Mediation to resolve Tax Court cases.  In a memorandum to field
administrative officers, the IRS has outlined a procedure for the use of
mediation to resolve certain docketed Tax Court cases.  Any agreement reached
through mediation would then be submitted to the court as a stipulation of
settled issues.

* Appointments to international posts.  The IRS has appointed John Lyons to
assistant commissioner, Thomas Smith to deputy assistant commissioner and
Michael Danilack III to associate chief counsel, all in the international
area.

* Federal-State reference guide.  The IRS has issued a special guide book for
state and local government employers that contains information on Social
Security and Medicare coverage and employer-tax-withholding requirements as
they pertain to government employees.  A free copy may be obtained by calling
the IRS at (800) 829-3676.  Ask for Publication 0963.

PROFIT STATEMENT:  The Writing Accountant


What do you do for an encore when you've spent six years at a Big Six
accounting firm and 21 years teaching graduate and undergraduate courses in
accounting, taxation and real estate at three major universities?  How about
opening a small consulting firm where your client base comes from what you
write?  Write?

The accountant with the proclivity for reducing thoughts to the printed page
is Jack P.  Friedman, a transplanted New Yorker now living in Dallas, who over
the years has written and published 21 books and more than 200 articles.
Along the way, he has also accumulated an extraordinary string of degrees and
designations including CPA, Ph.D., MBA, BBA, MAI, SREA, ASA and CRE, to name a
few.  In effect, what Friedman has done is build first a foundation based on
his unique experience and interest and then construct an accounting practice
from there.

He is primarily a consultant in matters concerning real estate but also in
some areas that have a more general business orientation.  Friedman noted that
much of his current work is in litigation support, for several reasons.
"First, attorneys prefer a published author as an expert witness.  Publication
of a book or professional article lends credibility.  Second, litigation
support offers a fairly high hourly compensation rate.  Also, the mix of
assignments that I receive in litigation support present challenges and
prevent boredom."

Writings=Client List

Friedman's books are extensive ranging from consumer guides to graduate school
textbooks and professional references.  They include The Dictionary of Tax
Terms (Barron's),The Encyclopedia of Investments (Warren, Gorham & Lamont),
Income Property Appraisal and Analysis (Prentice-Hall) and Keys to Investing
in Real Estate (Barron's).

His client list includes Champion International Corporation, the City of
Dallas, Simon Property Group, Exxon and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.

Where does he get his clients?  They generally come to him because of what he
has written.  For example, a law firm in Kentucky involved in the condemnation
of a public utility found themselves faced with three appraisals from the
condemnee relating to the market value of the property.  The firm sent for
educational materials of professional appraisal associations, found Friedman's
name and credits and called him to review the appraisals.  He did and said he
found them deficient.  "Based on my testimony at the hearings," he pointed
out, "the trial judge precluded any of the appraisal testimony from the other
side.  I have since assisted the firm in other matters."

Friedman also related the story of a prominent real estate broker in Dallas
who was interested in selling her own firm.  "It was a substantial business,"
he said, "with a unique market niche."  The broker visited his accountant to
gain an understanding of the ramifications of the sale and to enlist the
accountant as an ally in marketing the business.  The accountant researched
the business literature on the sale of a real estate brokerage firm, came
across Friedman's name as having prepared articles and monographs on the
subject and then brought him in to counsel the owner.

"All discussions," noted Friedman, "had to be absolutely confidential because
leaks of a possible sale could cause injury to the firm's value."  The firm
was sold in less than two months at a price and on terms suggested by
Friedman.

Project orientation.  Friedman believes that his course of practice is
something that can be done without the ongoing burden of a bigger professional
staff.  In fact, he keeps a lid on having a lot of people running around his
office.  He works primarily with one full-time administrative assistant and
three part-time people, all of whom have extensive experience in real estate
accounting, appraisal analysis and investment analysis.

The firm's personnel philosophy is to have relationships with others as staff
for potential assignments, but not to take on the obligations or overhead of
full-time staff.  "Therfore," he pointed out, "people with various specialties
may be brought in to work on a complex project, on an as-needed basis."  He
said that this modus operandi provides greater freedom and flexibility.

Getting Into Print

Friedman noted that his first five articles grew out of the work he was doing
as a CPA, which was in helping a real estate developer package FHA 236 housing
projects for sale to investors as a tax shelter.  Most of his subsequent
articles have been in response to a current business problem or have grown out
of research needed to shed light on a particular issue.

What does it take to get things written and published?  Friedman offered these
tips:

* Write what you are most interested in.  * Start with an article 10 to 40
double-spaced typewritten pages.  Don't begin by tackling a full-length book
project.  * Prepare an outline.  That will provide a path to follow and more
importantly will allow you to work on it over a period of time-in free moments
between what should be more pressing activities.  * Send it in even if the
editor declines interest in the topic.  The editor may like it when he or she
sees it.

Friedman also offered a tip on manuscript preparation.

He points out that almost all the publishers will edit the manuscript, some
more than others.  "Still, although editors can make a silk purse out of a
sow's ear, they're more likely to decline an obviously substandard piece (such
as one that is replete with typos), so seek out a typist who can prepare a
presentable manuscript."  In fact, Friedman goes a step further and insists
that you proofread your manuscript carefully before submission because "even
the best typist may have misunderstood you."

He said that even if you can't find a publisher, "a well-thought out,
beautifully typed and printed manuscript can be used in your own firm's
promotional material."

Friedman emphasized the fact that "manuscripts don't write themselves.  It
takes real work."  Also, you must be realistic.  "Don't expect immediate
results.  The payoff after publishing may take months or years."  To him, it's
paid off not only in accounting fees but in book royalties, as well.

He believes that there are many benefits to publishing.  "It brings prestige
to your employer or client and highlights you as an expert on a subject,
making your name valuable both inside and outside your firm."

Friedman's writings corroborate this and prove the point that putting the pen
to the paper can pay off handsomely.

TAX ALERT:  ESTATE AND GIFT TAXES


Minority Discount Is Part of Special Use Valuation Reduction

Hoover died owning a 26% interest in a limited partnership that operated a
cattle ranch.  In determining its estate tax liability, the estate first
determined the fair market value of her interest and then subtracted a 30%
discount of $819,000 to reflect lack of marketability and control.  The estate
then determined the special use valuation of that interest.

The estate's pro-rata share of the special use valuation was more than
$750,000 less than the discounted fair market value.  As a result, the estate
then reported the discounted fair market value less an additional $750,000 for
the interest in the partnership under the special use valuation election.

The IRS argued, and the Tax Court agreed, that the fair market value of the
interest for this purpose should not have been reduced by the 30% discount
since the estate was also taking the $750,000 special use valuation reduction.

Law:  Under Section 2032A, an election can be made for estate tax purposes to
value property according to its qualified use rather than at its highest or
best use.  But the maximum reduction in valuation is $750,000.  By Section
2032A(g), the election applies to interests held in a partnership.  In Estate
of Maddox, the Tax Court did not permit a subtraction for a minority interest
discount against the special use valuation itself.

Held:  For the estate.  The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that
the true fair market value for Section 2032A purposes is not modified in any
way and so it was proper to subtract the discount.  Neither the statute nor
the legislative history suggest that Section 2032A is designed to modify the
definition of fair market value.  An accurate determination of fair market
value must involve the use of the minority interest discount.The special use
valuation reduction of $750,000 can then be applied.  Estate of Hoover, 76
AFTR 2d 95-7305, (CA-10, 1995).


PROCEDURE

Transferee Bound by Transferor's Closing Agreement

Harvey Pert is married to Kathleen Pert who was previously married to Timothy
Riffe.  For four tax years, Kathleen, as representative of Riffe's estate and
in her own behalf signed closing agreements to settle tax liabilities asserted
against her and Riffe and penalties asserted against Riffe.  She also agreed
to a stipulated decision of the Tax Court to settle liability for another tax
year.

The IRS asserted transferee liability against Harvey Pert as both transferee
of Kathleen and successor transferee of Riffe.  Harvey claimed that he could
litigate the underlying tax deficiencies despite the signed closing
agreements.

Law:  Section 7121 authorizes written closing agreements which cannot be
reopened unless there is a showing of fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation
of material fact.  It also says that a closing agreement may not be annulled,
modified, set aside or disregarded in any suit, action or proceeding.

Held:  For the IRS.  Pert could not relitigate any of the liabilities that
Kathleen settled in the closing agreements or the stipulated decision.  A
closing agreement binds a transferee of the party to the closing agreement in
a manner analagous to the way res judicata binds a transferee to a prior
judicial decision in which the transferor was the party.  Also, there is no
basis for distinguishing between a transferee and a successor transferee for
this purpose.

Res judicata, under which parties and their privies to a prior action that
concluded with a final decision on the merits, are bound as to all issues that
were or might have been decided in the prior action, also applies to persons
in privity with the taxpayer (e.g., as a transferee and transferor).

Thus, res judicata bars a transferee from relitigating the income tax
liabilities of a transferor once a final decision has been entered by the Tax
Court in the transferor's case if the decision was stipulated.

The Tax Court refused in this case to reconsider the principle that a Tax
Court decision entered pursuant to the stipulation of the parties is
considered to be judgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata.  Pert,
105 TC No.  24.

TAX BRIEFS


Substitute tax forms procedure.  Rev.  Proc.  95-46 provides general
requirements and conditions for the development, printing and approval of

Foreign tax credit.  Final regulations (TD 8627) deal with certain limitations
on the use of deconsolidation to avoid foreign tax credit limitations under
Section 904(i).  They will affect the sourcing and foreign tax credit separate
limitation character of income for purposes of the calculation of the foreign

Nurses were independent contractors.  Corporation that operated nursing
registry established reasonable basis under Section 530 of the Revenue Act of
1978 for treating its nurses as independent contractors.  The facts satisfied
many of the common-law factors indicating that the corporation did not control
how the nurses performed their work.  It could get refund of employment taxes.

The Art of Sharing Data

A feature in software programs much ballyhooed by vendors these days is
integration, the ability to share data among different software applications.
One way to accomplish this is through software suites that provide several
programs, sometimes from different vendors, on a CD-ROM.  Another way is to
use tax and accounting programs available from the same vendor, so that the
different programs all speak the same language.  A third way is to use a
third-party bridge product that provides data conversion between different
software programs.

For example, the Audisys Corp.  of Portland, Ore., said its TAXi tax import
bridge is capable of transferring data from virtually any accounting
application into several popular tax return software programs, including CCH
ProSystem fx, Lacerte, Pencil Pushers, CLR Fast/Tax and TenKey's Tax Shop
Entities.  It said TAXi is set up to automatically convert data from several
accounting and write-up packages, including ACCPAC Plus, ATB, Creative
Solutions ws-2, TAASC Easy ACCT and UniLink Write Up Plus.  And because it's
capable of reading DOS and ASCII formats, TAXi can convert data, though
probably at a slower pace, from other packages as well.  TAXi has other
advantages, too.  It can prepare reports in either a book or tax basis, it
maintains and updates tax code dictionaries in accounting software and it
enables users to switch from an accrual to a cash basis accounting method.

To be sure, Audisys has its work cut out for it.  "Data conversion has its own
set of problems ...  there's always something missing," said James Metzler, a
frequent lecturer in computer technology and a partner of the Buffalo,
N.Y.-based accounting firm Gaines Emhoff Metzler & Kriner.

Indeed, CCH and TAASC, two of the vendors whose tax software can receive data
via TAXi, say they are not directly cooperating with Audisys and recommend
their own bridges to users.

TAXi's ability to maneuver quickly also raises some questions.  Pencil Pushers
CEO Harvey Stein, who said he supports Audisys's efforts, said, however, that
the time and effort it takes to code each account being converted with TAXi
seems to negate the advantage of using it.

But others say TAXi is the only vehicle available that enables users to
integrate virtually any tax, accounting and writeup packages of their choice -
even from among competitors.  "It allows the user to make the choice of whom
they want to bridge with," said Greg King, vice president of marketing for
Lacerte Software, adding that TAXi "breaks down some walls set up by competing
vendors."

Even though Lacerte has its own bridges with certain accounting and writeup
vendors, King said it supports TAXi as a way to give users complete freedom in
designing their own connections.  He added that TAXi's critics overlook the
fact that, after its initial set-up of codes, it requires only typical
maintenance to update data.

TAXi's price is an initial $279 with a $129 renewal cost.-Paul Demery

ESTATE AND GIFT TAXATION:  DISPUTES OVER MINORITY DISCOUNTS CONTINUE


Value, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder.  Unfortunately, in the
case of transfers of closely held businesses, the owner of these businesses
and the IRS don't always see eye-to-eye.  Over the years, the IRS has been
enmeshed in many battles over the valuation of minority interests in closely
held businesses.  In 1993, the IRS appeared to have given up when it issued
Rev.  Rul.  93-12, which allowed minority discounts for a parent's gifts of a
20% interest in a closely held business to each of five children.  However, a
close examination of later Technical Advice Memorandums (TAMs) indicates that
the IRS is still fighting over minority discounts.  A review of the seeds of
this controversy makes it easier to understand the current battle lines.

It's Worth Much Less

Because of the lack of market transactions, the valuation of a closely held
business interest must involve a review of the corporation's intrinsic worth;
which includes its earning capacity, the book value of its stock, its dividend
paying capacity and goodwill.  The IRS provided an analysis of these factors
in Rev.  Rul.  59-60.  One factor mentioned is the size of the block of stock
transferred and the block's inherent degree of control.  Although the Service
administratively recognizes this concept, it has repeatedly challenged the
taking of minority discounts in valuing closely held businesses for both
estate and gift tax purposes.

A minority discount is based on the fact that the minority shareholder cannot
unilaterally control the corporate decision making process including the
payment of dividends, the election of directors and officers and the
liquidation of the corporation.  The range of the minority discount that is
claimed usually varies from about 20% to as much as 50%

Generally, ownership of less than 50% of the voting stock of a closely held
corporation will constitute a minority interest.  However, if the governing
state law requires greater than 50% of the voting stock in order to affect
corporate action, then the transferred block, if less than that greater
percentage, will be a minority interest for discount purposes.  For minority
discount purposes, it is only voting control which is relevant and not the
value of the transferred shares.

Breaking It Up

Owners of majority interests in closely held businesses often look to take
advantage of the minority discount by giving stock to a number of
beneficiaries so that each receives a minority interest.  In the case of
lifetime transfers, courts have generally allowed each block to be valued
separately.1 However, they also hold that if the transfer occurs at death,
aggregation is required.2 The fact that a block of closely held stock which is
included in the gross estate is divided among several beneficiaries is
irrelevant for valuation purposes.  The imposition of the estate tax, unlike
the gift tax, is based on what the decedent owned at death and not what was
given to each beneficiary.

On the flip side, courts have held that a transfer, either by gift or at
death, remains a transfer of a minority interest subject to a possible
discount even if the transferee already has control of the corporation or will
achieve corporate control as a result of the transfer.3

IRS Pulls Back

Until recently, it was the IRS's position that a minority discount would not
be allowed with respect to the transfer of stock among family members when
that family controlled the corporation at the time of the transfer.

In Rev.  Rul.  81-253, the Service concluded that where the family owned a
controlling interest, the stock would be valued as if all of it were held by
one person.  The result was that each share transferred would be considered
part of the controlling block.

Example:  Alpha Inc.  has 100 shares of voting common stock outstanding.  John
and Betty Smith each own 40 shares while Bob and Wendy, their two children,
own 10 shares apiece.  John and Betty transfer to Bob and Wendy one share each
of their stock, which clearly is a minority interest.  However, since the
family controlled the corporation at the time of the transfer, the IRS would
deny the minority discount.

Generally, the courts have rejected the IRS's application of family
attribution as being inconsistent with valuation principles clearly stated in
the regulations.4 According to these regs, the transferor should be viewed as
a hypothetical willing seller who is independent of the other shareholders.5

Rev.  Rul.  93-12 revoked Rev.  Rul.  81-253 using the example of a parent who
transferred all of the shares in a wholly owned corporation by making gifts of
20% of the shares to each of his five children.  The IRS ruled that the shares
should be valued in the hands of the donees without regard to the shares held
by other family members.

The IRS has recently issued two TAMs further defining its position with
respect to this type of minority discount.  In TAM 9432001, the decedent owned
48.59% of the stock with the remaining 51.41% of the stock owned by his son.
Decedent's will provided that all of his stock would pass to his son.  The IRS
concluded that the minority discount would not be lost merely because the son
owned the remaining shares in the corporation.

In TAM 9449001, the Service addressed the issue whether simultaneous gifts to
family members would be valued separately.  The donor, who owned 100% of the
stock in a closely held corporation, gave simultaneous gifts of the stock to
each of his 11 children.  The IRS ruled that each gift would be valued
separately.

Unfortunately, Rev.  Rul.  93-12 and the two TAMS might only be a short-term
concession.  It appears that the IRS still has an arsenal of weapons that it
is using against a claim of a minority discount.

Substance-Over- Form Salvo

The IRS will aggregate minority stock as components of a single control block
when it perceives a tax avoidance motive for the transaction.  In Estate of
Murphy,6 an individual, pursuant to a general power of appointment, controlled
a 51.41% block of stock in a closely held corporation.  Eighteen days prior to
her death, she transferred .88% of the stock to each of her two children,
leaving her with a 49.65% interest.  The estate claimed a minority discount
for (1) the two .88% stock gifts and (2) the 49.65% block of stock owned at
death.

The Tax Court ruled that the minority discount did not apply to either.  It
concluded that the attempt to reduce the ownership interest below 50% by
gifting 1.76% of stock prior to death constituted tax avoidance.  According to
the Court, the transfer "lacked substance and economic effect."  The court
aggregated both the gift and testamentary transfer for valuation purposes.

But it is clear that the IRS and the Court failed to recognize that a
substantial change did occur.  Implicit in the court's reasoning is that the
decedent retained control over the corporation until her death.  But, this
ignores the legal significance of the decedent's stock transfer which
effectively stripped her of control over the corporation.

The court's conclusion would be acceptable if there was some sort of an
agreement that the children were required to vote the gifted stock in
accordance with their mother's wishes.  However, no such agreement existed, so
the decedent's 49.65% stock interest should have been considered a minority
interest.7

Recently issued TAM 9504004 further shows the IRS's propensity to apply
substance over form.  In this TAM, the decedent, 19 days before he died from
terminal cancer, sold one-half of his 60% interest in the family corporation
to child A, who at the time owned 20% of the corporation prior to the sale.
This increased child A's interest to 50%.  The decedent's two other children
collectively owned 20%.  Simultaneously with the sale, the corporation
redeemed the decedent's remaining 30% interest.  The redemption increased
child A's stock ownership interest to 71.4%.  The estate stipulated that the
principal purpose of the simultaneous stock sale and redemption was to
transfer decedent's controlling interest in the corporation to child A.

For valuation purposes, the decedent's estate treated the sale and redemption
as involving two separate transfers.  However, the IRS concluded that for
valuation purposes the sale of decedent's 30% stock sale to Child A and the
simultaneous redemption of decedent's remaining 30% interest must be viewed as
a single integrated transfer of a controlling corporate interest to child A.

Swing Vote Attack

A portion or all of the minority discount may be lost if the transferred stock
is determined by the IRS to have a swing vote characteristic.  Minority stock
is considered as having such a characteristic if it may enable another
minority holder to achieve majority control.

Example:  Two shareholders own 49% of the stock and a third shareholder owns
2%.  The stock owned by the 2% shareholder is perceived as possessing a swing
vote potential; it arguably may be able to command a premium in excess of its
pro-rata value.

The adverse effect of the transferred stock with swing vote attributes is
illustrated in the following example based on TAM 9436005.

Example:  John owns all of the 100 outstanding common shares of Beta
corporation.  On Dec.  18, 1994, John gifted 30 shares to each of his three
children.  He also transferred five shares to his wife.  In valuing the
transfer, John discounted the value of the transferred shares by a minority
discount of 25%.  According to the IRS, John would not be entitled to a
minority discount for any of the three 30% blocks since each had a swing vote
characteristic.  Any of the three children could join with another and control
the corporation.

This is inconsistent with case law which recognizes that where a donor makes
simultaneous gifts of stock to different donees, each gift is valued
separately in determining the fair market value for gift tax purposes.8 The
IRS disputed donor's argument that if it had not been a simultaneous transfer,
the result would have been different.

Although the Service agreed that at the time of the transfer of the first
block it would not reflect a swing vote attribute, it contended the value of
the second 30% block transferred would reflect a swing vote characteristic.
According to the IRS, the transfer of the second 30% block would also result
in an increase in the value of the first block transferred since the first
block would belatedly acquire possible voting control in the form of swing
vote.  The IRS reasoned that this increase in the value of the first block
would constitute an indirect gift to the first block recipient at the time of
the second transfer.  The IRS concluded that even if the transfers were made
at different times, the total value of the gifts would ultimately be the same
as if they were made simultaneously.

The IRS's decision that the second transfer constituted an indirect gift seems
to stretch unduly the concept of an indirect gift.  Only the value of the
property which passes at the time of the gift should be subject to the gift
tax.  The second transfer carried out the donor's intent to transfer 30 shares
of stock to a particular donee.  It was not the donor's intent to transfer
value to another shareholder.  Furthermore, the IRS's position is built upon
the principle that any increase in the value of one family member's stock
constitutes a gift to that shareholder.  In essence, what the IRS
characterizes as an indirect gift is a phantom gift.  Consider the following:

Example:  Family Inc.  has 100 shares of voting common stock outstanding which
is owned by three sisters:  Linda (46 shares), Sally (30 shares) and Betty (24
shares).  Linda is bored with corporate life and decides to gift her shares to
her two sisters.  It is her intent to treat her sisters equally, so she gives
23 shares to each.  After the gift, Sally is in control of the corporation
with 53 shares while Betty owns 47 shares.

Under established case law, Linda would be entitled to a minority discount
with respect to both transfers.  The value of Linda's gift to Sally is limited
to the value of the shares actually transferred.  There is no basis for
finding an additional indirect gift to Sally.

Assume the same set of facts, except that Linda decides to have her shares
redeemed from the corporation in a transaction which does not have as its
intended purpose the objective of transferring control of the corporation to
Sally.  There is no question that the redemption would result in increasing
the value of Sally's shares.  However, it would be an unintended stretch of
the gift tax rules to suggest that Linda has made a gift to Sally as a result
of the redemption.  That would only be the result if one extends the IRS's
perception of an indirect gift.  It should be noted that the courts have
rejected similar attempts by the Service in the past to create phantom income
in the form of a constructive dividend to the remaining shareholders.9

In support of its swing vote position the IRS primarily relies upon Estate of
Winkler.10 In that case the IRS contested the amount of the minority discount
for a decedent's 10% ownership of a corporation with two different
families-the Winklers and the Simmons-each owning 45% of the stock.  The IRS
denied the minority discount for estate tax purposes claiming that the owner
of the 10% block could effect control over the corporation by joining with
either family.  According to the Tax Court in this case, a willing buyer would
pay a premium for this 10% stock interest.

The court's rationale here is inconsistent with the regulations' concept of a
hypothetical willing buyer and willing seller.  It invites an unintended
subjective and very speculative inquiry into the feelings, attitudes and
anticipated behaviors of the recipients of the stock, other shareholders and
potential purchasers.

The IRS's position would then result in the minority discount being either
eliminated or reduced whenever the minority block of stock being transferred
would provide control if coupled with any other minority blocks.  Except in
Estate of Winkler, the courts have generally not embraced this position.  In
fact, the Ninth Circuit in Propstra11 rejected such an approach and allowed a
minority discount for an estate.  It reasoned that inquiries into the
anticipated behavior of the surviving co-owners was logically inconsistent
with the regulations and would require subjective assessments that might prove
to be groundless.  In Estate of Bright12, the Fifth Circuit did not consider
the swing vote characteristics of a 27.5% stock interest.  At the time of the
transfer, the decedent's wife owned 27.5% of the corporate stock and an
unrelated party owned 30%.

Query?  Is swing vote potential limited to those situations where only one
minority block shareholder could achieve control?  In TAM 9436005, the
minority block which could achieve control by aligning with the transferred
shares was owned by one person.  However, in TAM 9449001, the IRS implied that
minority stock could possess swing characteristics even if the benefitting
minority block was owned by more than one shareholder.

Section 2704 Threat

Prior to the passage of Section 2704 in 1990, family business interests were
often structured so that voting and liquidation rights would lapse upon a
transfer resulting in a reduced estate or gift tax.  Use of lapsing rights
would then result in a closely held business being valued at its going-concern
value, which very often is less than its liquidation value.

In Estate of Harrison,13 a decedent was both a general and limited partner in
a family partnership in which his sons were also limited partners.  Pursuant
to state law, the decedent, as general partner, possessed the power lapsing at
death to liquidate the partnership and to receive the liquidation value
attributable to both his general and limited partnership interest.  The
limited partners did not possess such power.  The estate valued his limited
partnership interest at its going-concern value of $33 million instead of at
its higher liquidation value of $59 million that the IRS contended.  The value
of the general partnership interest was not in dispute.  The Tax Court
concluded that the value of the limited partnership interest was $33 million
since the liquidation right lapsed at death.

Congressional concern regarding perceived valuation abuses as a result of
using lapses to artificially reduce transfer tax value resulted in the passage
of Section 2704.  It overrules the result in Harrison by eliminating the
disappearance of value caused by a lapse in either the voting or liquidation
rights (defined in Reg.  25.2704-1(b)) of the transferred interest.  It treats
the lapse of either a voting or liquidation right as a taxable transfer if the
holder of the right and members of the family (as defined in Section
2704(a)(1)) control the partnership or corporation, both before and after the
lapse.  The drop in value triggered by the lapse is recaptured as an
additional transfer.  The value of the transfer is equal to the excess of (1)
the total interest value (including voting and liquidation rights) held before
the lapse, over (2) the value (without the lapsed right) immediately after the
lapse.

Example:  John owns 70% of the outstanding common stock of Alpha corporation
while his daughter Betty owns the remaining 30% interest.  John's voting stock
is automatically converted to nonvoting stock at his death.  The pre-lapse
value of the 70% interest, which possesses voting rights, is valued at $1
million.  The post-lapse value of John's 70% interest, without voting rights,
is reduced to $400,000.  The amount of the Section 2704 transfer is valued at
$600,000, the difference between the value of the stock as voting and
nonvoting stock.

Section 2704(b) addressed similar perceived valuation abuses regarding
intra-family transfers of corporation or partnership interests where the right
to liquidate is restricted.  It provides that applicable restrictions14 on the
ability of a corporation or partnership to liquidate are disregarded when
valuing an interest in such entity.  Section 2704(b) applies if there is a
transfer of a business interest to, or for the benefit of, the transferor's
family and members of the transferor's family control the entity immediately
before the transfer.

Example:  Sally owns all of the preferred stock in Profit Corporation.  The
stock carries a right to liquidate which cannot be exercised until 1999.
Sally's two children, Bob and Betty, own all of the common stock, which is the
only voting stock.  In 1994, Sally gifts the preferred stock to Bob and Betty.
Under Section 2704(b), the value of the gifted stock is determined without
regard to any restriction because it is not a restriction which by its terms
will never lapse.  Because the restriction lapses subsequent to the transfer,
it is disregarded.  Therefore, the Profit preferred stock is valued as though
the restriction on liquidation did not exist.

It has been suggested that strict application of Section 2704 may preclude the
application of the minority discount.15 Consider the following:

Example:  John owns all of the 100 outstanding common stock of Beta
corporation, which is the only outstanding class of stock.  On March 1, 1995,
John gives 30 shares to his son, Bob, and 30 shares to his daughter, Betty.
The voting rights attributed by the corporation's bylaws to such stock lapse
upon the transfer.  The value of the corporation on the date of the gift was
$1 million and the per-share value prior to the gift was $10,000.  The
post-lapse value of each share of gifted stock is $7,500.  Assume that the
recommended minority discount would be 25%.  Since the right to vote the
transferred shares lapses upon the stock transfer, there is a potential
Section 2704(a) transfer equal to $2,500 per share.  Thus, the per-share value
subject to gift taxation would be $10,000 per share.  Such a result would
eliminate the minority discount.  But for Section 2704(a), the per-share value
subject to gift taxation would be reduced to $7,500 as a result of the
minority discount.  However, Section 2704(a) creates a transfer equal to the
value of the lapsed voting rights.

Congress considered including in Section 2704 a provision that the minority
discount would not be allowed.  Despite the challenge, the committee reports
provide that Section 2704 currently is not intended to affect minority
discounts or other discounts.  Reg.  25.2704-1(d) appears to be consistent
with this point.  According to the reg, when valuing a gifted interest with a
lapse, the starting point for determining the amount of the 2704 transfer is
not the value of all interests owned by the holder immediately before the
transfer.  Instead, it is the value of all such interests determined
immediately after the lapse as if the lapsed right was nonlapsing.

Example:  At his death, D owned all of the preferred stock of Alpha
corporation and his child, Betty, owned all of the common stock.  The
preferred stock possessed 60% of the total voting power with the common stock
possessing the remaining 40%.  Pursuant to the corporate bylaws, the voting
rights of the preferred stock terminated on D's death.  The value of D's
interest immediately prior to his death was $100,000.  The value of that
interest immediately after death would have been $90,000 if the voting rights
had been nonlapsing.  The decrease in value reflects the end of D's
involvement in Alpha.

The regulations recognize the $10,000 discount attributable to the loss of a
key person.  Therefore, under Section 2704(a), the beginning value of the
transferred stock is the post-transfer value after application of the key-man
discount.  The same analysis should also apply with respect to the minority
discount.  If so, then the starting point for determining the amount of the
Section 2704 transfer should be the post-transfer value after application of
the minority discount.

Example:  John owns 80 shares of the total of Money Corporation's 100
outstanding shares of common stock.  He gifts 40 shares to each of his two
children.  Per the corporate bylaws, the voting rights of John's common stock
terminated upon the stock transfer.  The per-share value of the transferred
stock prior to the gift was $1,000 per share.  The value of that interest
immediately after the gift would have been $750 per share if the voting rights
had been nonlapsing.  The decrease in value reflects a 25% minority discount.
Assume that as a result of the lapse the per-share value of the transferred
stock drops to $600 per share.  If we assume that the beginning value for
Section 2704(a) purposes is $750 which incorporates a 25% minority discount,
the value of the 2704(a) transfer is $150 per share ($750 minority discount
value less $600) and not $400.

Final Legislative Offensive

We understand that the IRS is pursuing a legislative attempt to eliminate the
minority discount.  This would not be the first direct legislative threat to
the minority discount.  In 1987, the House version of Section 2036(c) provided
that absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the deemed value of
stock in a corporation is its pro-rata share of all the stock in the class.
The Senate version of Section 2036(c) did not contain a similar provision.
The House provision on minority discounts was dropped from the final Section
2036(c) bill.

Historically, the minority discount has played a significant role in many
estate plans.  Although the IRS has reversed its position with respect to
family attribution in Rev.  Rul.  93-12, it has established significant
positions elsewhere to regain any perceived lost ground.  As the battles
continues, the concern is that the IRS might ultimately win the war.  n

LLOYDS BANK MAY SELL OFF MAJOR SHAREHOLDING IN SMH

LLOYDS BANK has refused to comment on reports that it will sell its
majority shareholding in Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst (SMH), the leading
German private bank.

Eberhard Weiershauser, one of the managing partners at SMH, also denies
the reports. He believes the current surge of speculation about a sale
was triggered by the leak of a confidential study from Merrill Lynch,
which last month made an unsolicited presentation to Lloyds Bank
advising on the possible divestment of SMH. "We have to contend with
these rumours every three months," Weiershauser said.

Although it is not the first time Lloyds has apparently considered the
sale of its 75 percent of SMH, on this occasion various circumstances
suggest that the time is right.

According to the Merrill Lynch presentation report, there are a number
of international banks which could be considering the sale of their
German private banking subsidiaries in the short and medium term.

Germany's new regulations on capital adequacy and capital backing for
derivatives business, and in particular the new rules on minimum
volumes for trading business, all place the viability of smaller German
banks in question, Merrill Lynch said.

The additional work and expenditure necessary to tackle these
challenges would induce many banks to seek a strong parent bank to
finance the necessary investments in edp and personnel, or else to
withdraw from certain businesses.

Another dilemma is that some of the exclusive and confidential services
which are the hallmark of German private banks can no longer be
provided under the new legislation. German banks are now obliged, for
instance, to pass on suspicions of insider trading.

But the crucial argument of Merrill Lynch's presentation was that SMH
is better placed than most to tackle these difficulties. SMH is
particularly attractive to potential purchasers, according to Merrill,
because of its above-average financial performance, excellent market
reputation and highly professional management team.

The bank has operated its own international capital markets business
for some years and has the expertise to comply with the new capital and
trading regulations without any real difficulty, Merrill added.

Nevertheless, Lloyds will be aware that several other big banks have
suffered losses and embarrassment from their German private banking
subsidiaries. Barclays' Merck, Finck, lost substantial sums over
several years and humiliated its shareholders by publishing profit
figures for 1993 before having to admit that the bank had made a loss
after all.

Recently it has been rumoured that Grunelius Privatbankiers, the tiny
private bank owned by Deutsche Bank, will also be sold off or even
disbanded. In 1994, Grunelius' assets shrank by nearly 14 percent to
DM206 million ($143 million). Commissions income fell while
administrative expenses rose, culminating in a net loss of DM1.8
million. Managing Director Gerd Schmitz- Morkramer left several months
ago and has not yet been replaced.

But if Lloyds is indeed considering a sale of SMH, which it acquired in
1984, the reasons would probably lie with its own strategy.

It is telling that Lloyds, which has never been a major international
investment house, has always operated SMH at arm's length as a
non-consolidated subsidiary. But Lloyds has recently amended its
strategy and foreign capital markets subsidiaries no longer seem to fit
in at all.

Lloyds is now aiming to focus on the mass market at home and hopes to
become the strongest and most profitable institution in UK retail
banking. The recent merger with the TSB retail bank followed takeovers
of the Cheltenham & Gloucester building society and the insurer Abbey
Life. Rather than retaining SMH which is engaged primarily in upscale
German private banking and capital markets business - Lloyds could sell
and use the proceeds of sale to pursue its new strategic aims.

In the light of Lloyds' new strategy, it is clear that the profitable
shareholding in SMH which could be divested to another large financial
institution without stiffening competition in Lloyds' core UK market.

Traditionally, Lloyds has included in its core business any subsidiary
which generates return on equity of at least 15 percent. SMH achieved
net return on equity of more than 27 percent in 1993, but slipped back
to 3.3 percent the following year as a result of depleted commissions
income. Weiershauser indicated that commissions income had made a
"respectable" showing in 1995, but declined to give details.

However, the sale - if it does happen - may not occur for months.
Lloyds' profits are so good - indeed, the bank is considering a share
buy-back - that it need not accede to the first bidder. If it does
sell, Lloyds can almost certainly afford to wait until an advantageous
price is offered.

NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS

PRIVATE BANKING is one of the most troublesome terms in the financial
services lexicon. Consider the number of definitions.

Ask a mainland European to define the term and, in all probability, a
private bank will be described as a banking institution not owned by
the government. Probe a little harder, especially in Switzerland, and
the respondent may qualify his answer by pointing out that a private
bank tends not to be incorporated, is structured on the partnership
model, and is totally reliant on the partners' resources for bank
capital.

Go to the UK or the US and a more familiar definition will be given.
Private banking is concerned with the provision of banking services for
high net worth individuals. However, as innumerable articles in PBI
have pointed out over the years, this definition is not without its
drawbacks.

The first problem is that no one has yet come up with a definitive
description of "high net worth". To judge from the plethora of "private
banks" coming into existence, the high net worth threshold is falling
by the day. It will surely not be long before the whole of the retail
banking sector will be subsumed by the private banking market.

A second problem is that most of the services provided by "private
banks" are not concerned with banking, i.e. the collection of deposits,
the making of loans and the provision of payment services. Asset
management, tax planning and the establishment and administration of
trusts, inter alia, are the essence of private banking, or more
accurately, of wealth management.

Although the possession of a banking licence can be advantageous in a
number of respects - it facilitates offshore and international "private
banking" as well as providing an aura of greater security - it is not
critical to the business of wealth management.

In fact "private banks" are probably responsible for only a small
proportion of the total stock of wealth owned by "high net worth"
individuals, although it is likely that they dominate the international
and offshore markets.

This poses a considerable dilemma for the editor of PBI. It may be
possible to identify a discrete target market in terms of wealth
management institutions that possess a banking licence. The problem is
that they constitute a small sector of the market within which private
banks compete.

Clearly a way around this impasse is to redefine "private banking".
Henceforth, as far as PBI is concerned, private banking will be defined
as "the provision of financial services and wealth management
facilities for affluent customers".

ONE CONSEQUENCE of this definition is that the scope and content of PBI
will be extended. From time to time previous editors have dabbled with
other institutions active in the wealth management sector such as legal
and accountancy firms, broker dealers and the plethora of institutions
contained within the "independent financial adviser" umbrella. Although
we do not intend to cut back our coverage of institutions active in the
international private banking sector - indeed we intend to expand both
the depth and breadth of our coverage - the "non-bank" private banks or
wealth management institutions will assume a higher profile.

This is at it should be. Last year a study produced by PSI of Tampa
Florida showed conclusively that US banks were losing market share in
the private banking sector to broker-dealers. The losses were not
confined to "middle-income affluent", a market segment which might be
considered particularly vulnerable. Perhaps, more worryingly, they
included the "elite private banking" segment, or clients who had on
average $1.2 million of investible assets and who contributed over
$10,000 in annual revenue.

The dynamism exhibited by non-bank sectors of the wealth management
sector makes it a natural for coverage in PBI. In the US, for example,
the investment companies and broker dealers are having a profound
effect on the evolution of the financial services sector. They have
often been a hothouse of new product developments, many of which can be
usefully taken up by "conventional" private banks.

BOOM IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

BY COINCIDENCE, according to statistics published by the Association of
Solicitor Investment Management (ASIM), it appears that the investment
management activities of UK legal firms are currently booming. Not only
did funds managed by its members double during 1995 but there has been
a substantial increase in the number of firms active in the sector.

It is no surprise to find that the firm with the biggest involvement is
an Edinburgh-based firm, Murray Beith & Murray, which has #180 million
($280 million) under management. Many of the firms currently active in
the Scottish fund management sector can trace their origins to the
legal and accountancy professions. This is especially the case with
Baille Gifford, Scotland's largest specialist fund manager. For the
record it still maintains a partnership structure.

There are two sets of factors responsible for the increased involvement
of solicitors in the wealth management sector. Like retail banks, they
have seen margins on their traditional business areas tumble as a
consequence of new entrants and increased competition. On the other
hand, they already had some of the core capabilities required for
successful involvement in the sector. They appear to be more than
willing to buy in what they lack.

BROKERS POST HIGHER EARNINGS THAN BANKS

IN THE last four years, brokerage houses serving individual investors
have posted consistently higher profits than investment banks,
according to research by the Security Industry Association (SIA) in New
York. The trend marks a sharp reversal from the 1980s, when investment
banks dominated Wall Street earnings by posting profits that were more
than twice those reported by "full-line" brokerage firms catering to
individual investors.

In 1994, which saw a global correction in the bond market, Wall
Street's investment banks were thrown for a loss, while the full-line
brokerages remained firmly in the black. And in 1995, a stockmarket
rally pushed the brokers' earnings some 60 percent over those of
investment banks (see chart).

"The securities industry has been turned upside down," said SIA
research chief Jeffrey Schaefer. In the 1990s, he explained, profits
grew due to three factors: the success of capital raising activities;
the booming business of money management both for institutions and
individuals; and the phenomenal growth of mutual funds. While the first
factor has helped investment banks, full-line brokerage houses have
taken advantage of all three factors, with retail investment services
giving them a strong edge.

"The biggest difference [from the 1980s] has been the role of mutual
funds, which I call the financial intermediary of the 1990s," Schaefer
explained."Long-term mutual funds, which only became attractive to
individuals in fixed-income markets in 1985, have allowed individuals
to participate in the equity and bond markets of the 1990s and still be
able to diversify."

The performance of full-line brokers in 1995 is particularly impressive
given the strong performance of investment banks, due to last year's
merger and acquisition boom and the surging revenues from the issuing
of securities. Investment banks have also benefited from 1995's bond
rally, which has greatly enhanced the value of their large bond
portfolios. Investment banks' fees from underwriting new stocks and
bonds have recently begun contributing from their bottom lines again.

In 1995, full-line brokerage firms have benefited far more from the
year's record stockmarket trading volume and price appreciation.
Excluding new stock issues, market activity has increased the value of
stocks by $2.1 trillion, or 33 percent, to a total of $8.4 trillion.
Last year was one of only three in the past 21 years when stock prices
increased more than 30 percent.

Brokers have also been better positioned to exploit the explosion of
stock mutual funds, which are far more profitable for retail brokerages
than bond funds. In 1995, an astonishing 87 percent of net cash flow
into long-term mutual funds went into equity instruments, according to
the SIA.

FORMER CHASE OFFICIAL NAMED TO HEAD AMEX BANK

IN EARLY January, American Express Bank appointed John Ward, a senior
executive at Chase Manhattan, as its new chairman and chief executive.

Ward served most recently as executive vice president at Chase and
chief executive of Chase Bankcard Services. His resignation from Chase
came two months before the scheduled closing of the bank's merger with
Chemical Banking, which will create the largest US commercial bank. In
the competition to fill the position of the new Chase's chief cards
executive, Ward was edged out by his opposite number at Chemical,
Charles Walsh.

A 27-year veteran at Chase Manhattan, Ward served in the 1970s as the
bank's credit and marketing officer for Japan and then Chase's chief of
trade and export finance in Europe and the Middle East.

In 1987, he was named credit policy officer of Chase's Individual Bank
based in New York, and became president of Chase Personal Financial
Services in 1991.

At Amex Bank, Ward will replace Steven Goldstein, who informed Amex
officials of his desire to resign when discussions concerning a
possible sale of Amex Bank were concluded in October.

American Express had tried to sell its international private bank, an
Edge Act institution chartered only for offshore operations, for $1
billion, or 1.25 times book value. The bank has performed poorly in
recent years, reporting a return on assets of 0.58 percent on assets of
$13.39 billion in 1994.

CREDIT SUISSE TARGETS TREPIDANT GERMANS

CREDIT SUISSE has extended its CS Direct Invest fund broking operations
to Germany, attempting to capture German private investors who are
worried about the implications of the European single currency and who
mistrust client confidentiality at German banks while at the same time
avoiding charges of aiding and abetting tax evasion.

Romeo Lacher, project manager at Credit Suisse in Zurich, said CS
Direct Invest is not competing on price, but will attempt to beat the
competition with superior customer advice, a 24-hour telephone service
and a twice-yearly personalised newsletter. He hopes to attract between
30,000 and 40,000 customers within four to five years.

This is the first time that German retail investors have been offered
Swiss investment products by direct marketing routes. The marketing
campaign has begun with large full-colour advertisements in the German
business press, and, from next month, will branch out into direct mail
aimed at high-income private investors - particularly those deemed to
have an interest in Switzerland as vacationers or owners of holiday
homes.

In most markets, an advertising campaign of this kind would be
unremarkable. But in Germany, Credit Suisse's advertisements are
reminiscent of the mood three years ago, when the German banks made
frenzied appeals to investors to avoid tax by transferring their
savings to accounts in Luxembourg. Some banks, particularly Dresdner
Bank, are still being "punished" for this, with regular police raids
and confiscation of confidential client records in branches suspected
of assisting tax evaders.

Lacher is resigned to criticism from competitor banks and the German
authorities. But he points out that the Credit Suisse advertisements
avoid the innuendo employed by some German banks during the Luxembourg
campaigns. Indeed, Lacher is playing so safe at present that the
current campaign does not even stress the advantages of the Swiss franc
as a reserve currency. However, the next set of ads may do, he said.

Moreover potential tax evaders will not be given any new opportunities
by CS Direct Invest. In fact, since the transfers will not be made in
person (often the case with Luxembourg accounts in 1993) investors have
less chance to evade tax.

Investments in the funds from German clients are transferred first to
Credit Suisse's Frankfurt offices, and then en masse to Switzerland.
Foreign money transfers of more than DM2,000 ($1,400) must be
registered with the local branch of the Bundesbank, and the names of
each investor must be supplied on request. "These transfers leave
footprints in Germany," Lacher said.

Customers have an incentive to use this automated route because Credit
Suisse waives the usual bank fees for foreign payment transfers.

Nevertheless, Lacher concedes that "the border region is a problem".
Germans living near Zurich, Basel or Schaffhausen prefer to drive into
Switzerland with cash in a briefcase and deposit it in a Swiss custody
account. By that means, they can escape the attention of the
Bundesbank, and, possibly, the German tax authorities too.

CS Direct Invest was launched in Switzerland last May and has attracted
25,000 enquiries. The bank declines to say how many have so far become
CS customers.

GRIEG MIDDLETON SUES DEFECTORS

GRIEG MIDDLETON, which claims to be the UK's largest private client
stockbroker, has issued writs claiming breach of contract by nine
ex-directors of Allied Provincial, another private client brokerage
company it acquired in 1995.

Following completion of the deal, 47 Allied Provincial staff located in
the company's Birmingham and Glasgow offices attempted to defect to
rival broker Brewin Dolphin (see PBI 88).

Grieg Middleton allowed 38 of the former Allied Provincial staff to
leave, but insisted that the nine most senior adhered strictly to the
terms of their contracts, which required the executives to serve a
six-month or 12-month notice period. Last month, however, the nine told
Grieg Middleton that they intended to start work at Brewin Dolphin.

ALBERT SHARP TAKEOVER FORMS POWERFUL NEW UK STOCKBROKER

ALBERT E SHARP, an independent stockbroker based in Birmingham, has
purchased the private client stockbroking business of Brown Shipley
from Guinness Peat Group for #7.4 million. This will create one of the
UK's largest independent firm of stockbrokers.

"The ambitions of both companies in the private client service market
are identical," said Trevor Cooke, Brown Shipley Stockbroking's chief
executive.

"Comprehensive investment services of the highest quality delivered
efficiently and with the greatest level of security are what private
clients need. Together Brown Shipley and Albert E Sharp will be able to
meet the challenges presented to our clients by an international
marketplace driven increasingly by high technology. The personal
service traditions inherent in both companies, which combine investment
skills and systems capabilities, will create a major new force in the
UK stockbroking industry."

Brown Shipley Stockbroking has 14 offices spread thoughout the UK. It
currently manages around #2 billion ($3 billion) of funds, mainly for
private investors, mostly on an advisory basis. It also has an
institutional presence in Scotland.

In 1994 the brokerage made pre-tax profits of #532,000. Profits are
expected to be down in 1995 as a result of falling stockmarket volumes.

Albert E Sharp has offices in Birmingham, Bristol, London and
Manchester. It manages #2 billion for private investors, pension funds
and charities, half of which is managed on a discretionary basis. It
also has around #115 million in its own family of proprietory unit
trusts (mutual funds).

Guinness Peat Group, which encapsulates a number of subsidiaries
involved in banking and asset management, describes itself as"a
strategic investment business". It is better known as the investment
vehicle of Sir Ron Brierley, a New Zealand entrepreneur.

Brown Shipley Stockbrokers has turned out to be a very good investment.
The company was acquired by Guinness Peat in 1993 for #5.6 million. It
then sold off Brown Shipley's unit trust and asset management
businesses for #2.7 million. The sale to Albert E Sharp of the
remaining businesses will result in near doubling of its investment.

QUILTER GOODISON TO MERGE WITH FOSTER & BRAITHWAITE

THE COMBINED effects of competition and new technology have resulted in
yet another merger in the UK private stockbroking sector. Quilter
Goodison, the private client stockbroker owned by Commercial Union
(CU), a leading UK composite insurer, is to merge with Foster &
Braithwaite, a stockbroking subsidiary of Credit Commercial de France
(CCF).

The combined company will be called Quilter & Co. CU will own around 75
percent of Quilter's shares, and CCF the remainder. John Vincent, who
is currently Foster & Braithwaite's managing director, will head the
new business.

The merger reflects recent changes within the UK stockbroking and
investment management sector. With the arrival of the Crest settlement
system later this year, the UK stockbroking sector is likely to
experience further segmentation.

The execution of stockmarket trades is likely to become a commodity
business usurped by discount brokers and banks.

RBC PROVES POPULAR CHOICE WITH EXECUTIVES

EXECUTIVE PLUS, a private banking product offered by Royal Bank of
Canada, has proved to be a popular choice for globetrotting business
executives. Offering an instant access deposit account with tiered
interest rates, the product offered by RBC's Jersey-based Global
Private Banking Unit (GPB) has attracted new deposits in excess of #10
million ($6.5 million) since it was relaunched in August of last year.

Executive Plus, which commenced four years ago, embodies a number of
enhancements. "A number of improvements were made," says Chris Blampied
of RBC (Jersey). "American Express and Visa Gold Cards are now
available to account holders. We also expanded our range of currencies
to include the Canadian dollar, American dollar and sterling." Designed
for the global and wealthy executive, a wide range of banking services
is available to clients maintaining a minimum balance of #10,000 in
funds. The improved product was relaunched in August of this year.

"Executive Plus is targeted at high valued clients with income and
assets above the retail thresholds," explained GPBs Chris Blampied.
"The client base is very international, ranging from the Middle East
and the US, as well as from the UK. We attract many existing clients.
Since the re-launch we have experienced an awful lot of growth from
within the network. We have seen a number of French clients going into
the product. However, we cannot discern a definite trend.

"We have in excess of $21 million in Executive Plus, with an average
balance of #70,000 per customer. Due to our success we have recently
opened an office in the Isle of Man and are planning another in
Guernsey."

Royal Bank of Canada, is one of North America's largest banks, with
C$405 billion ($300 billion) in assets under administration. Royal Bank
of Canada Global Private Banking, a Jersey-based operation, offers
private banking and investment services to customers in more than 130
countries. GPB currently has C$29 billion in assets under
administration.

Looking ahead into 1996, Blampied is buoyant."Between Jersey and the
Isle of Man, the two offices providing Executive Plus, our objective is
to obtain #50 million in deposits by the end of the year."

MONTANA EVALUATES SECRET BANKING FACILITY

A SANTA BARBARA entrepreneur has proposed the establishment of a
Swiss-style secret banking unit in the state of Montana. The proposal,
which has attracted the anxious attentions of federal banking and tax
authorities, is now being actively studied by Montana regulators.

While the proposal appears far-fetched at first sight, Montana
authorities said it could lead to the establishment of an innovative
offshore deposit facility in the mountain state.

In late 1995, Robert Svoboda, a former banker and Montana resident now
living in Santa Barbara, asked Montana regulators to commission a
feasibility study to investigate the possibility of establishing a
Swiss-style secret banking facility in the state. Such a bank would be
state-chartered, and would not benefit from federal deposit insurance
and the federal regulation that goes along with it.

The unit would provide highly confidential deposit services to
foreigners through the use of numbered accounts. Svoboda's most
aggressive scenario would allow non-resident aliens to deposit funds in
a Montana bank, which could then put the funds in trusts that could
deposit the money in non-taxable investments or transfer them to other
banks and countries. Depending on clients' investment and deposit
needs, the bank could provide varying "levels of privacy."

"This isn't for money-laundering or helping people to keep from paying
taxes," Svoboda told American Banker in December. "It's a safe haven
for money, and it's private."

According to state authorities, Svoboda described his initial
motivation as "philanthropic" - secret banking facilities could provide
his former home state with significant revenue in state-levied fees on
assets and possibly escheatment revenues, where funds in secret
accounts might revert to the state treasury if they are not claimed by
heirs of deceased depositors.

Such an institution might also benefit from Montana's relatively
unregulated financial environment and the Montana state constitution's
unusual privacy provisions.

Responding to Svoboda's proposal, Montana's legislature formed an
interim committee late last year to study the idea. The committee has
met four times and will meet next in late January, when it will hear
presentations from federal authorities, including representatives of
the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of the Treasury and the
Federal Reserve Bank.

"No precedent exists for this anywhere in the country," said Chris
Olson, Montana's deputy banking commissioner, who freely admits that
state banking authorities currently lack the legal and regulatory
background to evaluate such a novel plan. Outside the state, banking
experts have greeted the Svoboda proposal with incredulity or derisive
laughter.

"The people who haven't laughed are the Feds," said Steven Maly, a
legislative aide who is co-ordinating the state legislature's interim
research effort. "Knowing that we do a lot of fishing up here, the Feds
have warned us that we would be bottom-fishing attracting the worst
criminal element - with this sort of activity."

Maly said he was surprised by the level of concern expressed by federal
authorities. "Without saying as much, they seemed to be telling us,
`This could happen, and we're not going to help you do it.'"

Disregarding the wrath of the Feds, Maly believes a Montana secret
banking facility is simply not practical, given existing US law and
regulation. For example, he sees no way to circumvent the federal
requirement that all deposits in excess of $10,000 must be reported to
the US Treasury Department.

But Maly is evaluating the possibility of minimizing federal
supervision of a state-chartered depository for offshore funds which
have no tax liability and which waive the requirements for federal
deposit insurance.

A state-chartered foreign funds depository might provide offshore
clients a higher degree of privacy than other US banks, and it might
provide some non-taxable investment services as well. In particular, a
significant level of federal oversight could be avoided where funds are
deposited but not transferred out of the depository.

"We're thinking about something that is much simpler and more primitive
than a secret banking facility," Maly explained."We're not planning to
compete with existing offshore facilities. Instead, we're looking at
creating a new and different way of attracting legitimate flight
capital. One angle we're looking at is tying deposits to precious
metals, especially platinum, which is produced in Montana."

The cost advantages of in-state production and storage of precious
metals, coupled with new financial technology and reduced regulation,
could create a commercial opportunity to establish a new kind of
offshore depository in Montana, Maly said.

He believes that such a facility might be attractive to rich families
in Taiwan, for example, who are looking for secure and relatively
secret international deposit facilities, and who already hold a
significant amount of their wealth in precious metals.

BARRIERS TO INTERSTATE BANKING REMOVED

IN LATE December, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
issued an interpretive letter designed to lower the barriers to
interstate trust banking. The OCC's letter comes more than a year after
Congress passed the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching
Efficiency Act, which ushered in a new era for national banking in the
US.

The OCC's action aims to "level the playing field" for US banks wishing
to extend their trust business to states where they have no trust
charters. According to the OCC, trust banks can now ignore state laws
requiring them to have operations based in those states. Moreover,
national banks need not apply for special permits if state-chartered
banks are exempt from them.

Banks have long complained that state regulatory requirements, which
generally stipulate that trust departments must have in-state
headquarters to obtain special exemptions, have contributed to
inefficiency by preventing consolidations. However, the OCC's ruling is
likely to face resistance from state regulators uncomfortable with
further intrusions from federal banking authorities.

The OCC's letter came in response to an inquiry from Midwest
super-regional Banc One, which is eager to centralise its 11-state
trust business under a single national banking charter.

US TRUST UNITS FACE NEW FEDERAL REGULATION

FEDERAL REGULATORS have completed a new rule which will require trust
departments of large US institutions to disclose new profitability
information for 1997.

According to the new regulation, trust departments must report salaries
and employee benefits, as well as other direct expenses such as the
cost of equipment. Trust departments must also report instances where
surcharges or the cost of settling customer disputes have caused an
account to lose more than $100,000.

Up until now, trust departments have reported only the size of
discretionary and non-discretionary assets by account type. The new
rule applies to 2,819 trust departments that manage more than $100
million in assets. These units control 99 percent of the over $11
trillion held in trust at US financial institutions.

The new regulation was drafted by the Federal Financial Institutions
Examinations Council, an inter-agency group of federal regulators that
supervises federally insured depository institutions.

The rule will permit examiners to produce uniform measurements of the
performance and risk management policies of trust departments, and to
get a fuller picture of their solvency and profitability.

Regulators have called for new scrutiny of the US trust industry, as
the gathering and managing of trust assets has gained momentum in
recent years. In the five years ending in 1993, US trust assets grew 61
percent to $10.6 trillion.

The American Bankers Association in Washington has protested against
the new regulation as a violation of confidentiality. Bankers are
concerned that the information may be used to gauge the profitability
of competitors, and that such information may become public as the
result of litigation, as happened recently in a suit filed against the
derivatives activity of Bankers Trust.

Regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank have responded that the
profitability information it collects on trust departments will remain
confidential, although the central bank will release composite
profitability data which will be of use to the industry.

Bankers have responded that little benefit will come from such data, as
profitability benchmarking services are already offered by private
consultants. The Financial Services Association of Niles, Michigan, for
example, currently sells a service called Trust Compare, which allows
trust departments to benchmark their profitability against that of
other institutions using the service.

SPAIN:  SPANISH BANK ENDS ALLIANCE

THE JOINT private banking venture launched last year by Banco Popular
and Bankers Trust (see PBI 76) has proved short-lived. Banco Popular
recently ended the collaboration agreement on the grounds that there
was too much competition between the two institutions.

"After six months in operation we came to the conclusion that for a
bank such as ours, well positioned in the domestic market and with a
substantial branch network there were few advantages to be gained from
such an agreement. We realised that basically all we were doing was
presenting our clients to Bankers Trust. As a result, we decided to end
the agreement," Fernando de Soto of Banco Popular told PBI.

Last year Banco Popular chose to develop its private banking services
in close collaboration with Bankers Trust, as a means of giving an
international dimension to its existing service and product offer. Each
bank opened its own specialised private banking branch in Madrid.

Bankers Trust was to be responsible for managing client assets but each
bank had separate relationship managers and was responsible for
marketing its services. For Bankers Trust, whose presence in Spain has
been mainly geared towards foreign customers, the agreement with Banco
Popular was seen as a means of drawing closer to the domestic market.

Banco Popular is adamant that competition was the only motive for
ending the relationship, but with its reputation for tight risk control
and prudent investment practices, Banco Popular can hardly have been
pleased by Bankers Trust's loss of prestige.

The US bank's reputation has taken a severe battering over the last 18
months as a consequence of its derivative-related activities and the
lawsuits brought against it by disgruntled clients such as Proctor &
Gamble.

In the meantime, Banco Popular will continue to deal with its high net
worth clients through the branch network."This system worked very well
in the past and there is no reason why it shouldn't continue to do so,"
said de Soto.

RBOS JERSEY TARGETS EXPATRIATES

EXPATRIATES ARE the main beneficiaries of the worlds first offshore
telephone banking service. Launched by Jersey-based Royal Bank of
Scotland International, the new service, is accessible on a 24-hour
basis, offering clients full banking facilities with comprehensive
security measures and the highest degree of confidentiality.

The banks Premium Account will be available to customers who deposit a
minimum of #2,000. It can be opened in a variety of currencies.
Customers can transfer money between different RBSI accounts, set up or
make changes to standing orders or direct debits, pay bills and deal in
currencies and shares. "It makes sense for customers living overseas,
in whatever time zone, to be able to make personal contact with their
bank whenever it is convenient for them", says Peter Sherriffs director
of the Offshore Banking Division.

So far, the new service has attracted considerable interest, especially
from expatriates in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the bank reports. Further
interest has come from as far afield as Australia, Singapore and Hong
Kong, from expatriates and overseas nationals, as well as residents
with second homes outside the UK. Among European clients, Scandinavians
showed a particular interest in the new service.

FINDING THE MOST FAVOURABLE TAX REGIME

A study published by the Adam Smith Institute, a UK-based think-tank
shows a surprisingly wide disparity in tax burdens between members of
the OECD. Ian Orton reports

JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the US are the best countries for tax-averse
individuals to be domiciled. According to Tax Freedom Day 1996, a
report which attempts to compute the number of days an individual has
to "work" for the government, these three countries demand far less
from their citizens than other OECD members, especially constituents of
the European Union.

In 1994 a Japanese worker had, on average to work only 119 days - or
until April 29 to pay off his or her tax bill (see chart). Australian
workers had to work a day longer. It took US workers another six days
to work off their annual tax load.

Onerous as these requirements were, however, they were much lower than
those faced by Europeans, especially members of the European Union. Tax
Freedom Day would have arrived in the European Union on June 14, or
after 165 days, compared with June 7 or 158 days for the OECD.

Some European countries fared relatively well. In Portugal a worker
would "only" have had to work for 132 days or until May 11 to meet his
or her tax obligations. In the UK the equivalent date was May 17 or 138
days.

Conversely, however, Scandinavian workers would have had to work well
into the second half of the year to clear their tax obligations.
Norwegians and Finns would have had to work for 185 days, Danes 200 and
Swedes 208 - or until July 27 - to achieve tax freedom.

As always, with any international comparison, there are considerable
methodological problems and, as a consequence, the tax freedom days
calculated for each country are not necessarily a"true" reflection of
the time needed to work-off the annual tax obligation.

To some extent they reflect the methodology used by Gabriel Stein, the
report's author. As such, the figures give only a rough approximation
of where Tax Freedom Day might occur in each country.

For each country shown in the chart, total tax revenue as a percentage
of GDP at market prices has been compared to the equivalent UK figures.
The difference between the two figures has then been translated into
days of the year, and this has then been added to - or subtracted from
- the British Tax Freedom Day.

In 1996, the average UK employee will have to work 142 days, that is
until Tuesday May 21 to pay off his or her tax bill, the same number of
days as last year. The 2p reduction in the standard rate of income tax
announced in the November budget has been offset by increases in other
areas, such as excise duties on tobacco and petrol.

Nonetheless, the situation is still an improvement on the 1970s and
early-1980s when the tax burden was much higher. The 1980s and early-
1990s saw a continuous fall in the tax burden with Tax Freedom Day
moving earlier and earlier from June 6 in 1982 to May 17 in 1993. It
then shot back five days in 1995 and shows little sign of reverting to
the 1980s trend.

The situation would be even worse if government borrowing was taken
into account, however. Stein argues that this should be added to the
total burden of taxation, since it eventually has to be paid for by
future taxpayers. This would mean that the UK taxpayer would not be
free of both burdens until Monday June 3. Nonetheless, as a result of a
fall in government borrowing, this would be an improvement on the
situation in 1993 when the relevant day was June 13.

For much of the European Union, where many countries have much heavier
debt burdens than the UK, the situation would have been even worse.

As tax burdens rise, as governments attempt to conform with the
Maastricht criteria before 1999, this should mean that there should be
substantial opportunities for private bankers, especially those which
place emphasis on tax-planning.

LOOKING AHEAD TO A PROMISING FUTURE

Following a turbulent period of restructuring in the 1970s, Trinkaus &
Burkhardt's management is confident, that their integration into the
HSBC Group will ensure a rosy future. Ulrich Sutter talked to Dr
Sieghardt Rometsch

THE PAST year produced outstanding results for Trinkaus & Burkhardt,
one of Germany's oldest private banks. Net profits increased by 24.9
percent to DM92.9 million ($64 million), an all-time high.

Interest income leaped to DM177.7 million, an increase of 23,7 percent
on the previous year, while commission income was marginally down by
3.4 percent at DM160.6 million. Since flotation in 1985, Trinkaus has
seen its total asset base jump by more than 260 percent.

Operating from their Dusseldorf headquarters overlooking the
prestigious Konigsallee, Trinkaus has experienced its fair share of ups
and downs especially during the 1970s and early 1980s, admits Dr
Sieghardt Rometsch, a partner responsible for corporate banking.

"The bank was caught up in the aftermath of the Herstatt banking
collapse. Despite performing well, we were forced to look for outside
help to rebuild our capital base, and this resulted in Citibank
acquiring a controlling stake. This produced a change of strategy and
we abandoned retail banking," said Rometsch.

"The Citibank connection was relatively short-lived, and in 1980 the
bank was acquired by Midland Bank. Our fortunes changed rapidly,
largely as a result of Midland Bank's decision to give us a large
degree of autonomy. It surely was paramount to the success we have
achieved so far", he said with pride. "Reducing Midland's shareholding
from 90 percent to 70 percent subsequently helped strengthen our
position with our customers as an independent private bank."

A former general manager with Chase Manhattan Bank, Rometsch argues
that most foreign banks have failed to be profitable in the German
market, as a consequence of adopting relatively short-term strategies.

"The exception, of course, is Citibank which has successfully
established itself in the retail banking sector. The vast majority of
banks, however, do not understand that private banking is predicated on
relationships and has to grow organically. It will sometimes take years
for a relationship to create the trust necessary to sustain profitable
business. Once we have crossed this line, they accept us as partners.
Only then will the typical private banking client entrust larger sums
to us."

Rometsch is also critical of many foreign banks management systems.
"These often reduce the individual's creativity and his overall
performance. Matrix management is still very common especially with US
banks. From my own experience, I have found this style a handicap to
the successful private banker."

Since Trinkaus & Burkhardt abandoned retail banking to concentrate on
asset management, securities and corporate banking, its performance has
improved significantly. The bank now has some DM35 billion of assets
under management of which DM18 billion comes from private banking
clients.

Contrary to the industry trend, which has resulted in a reduction of
minimum thresholds, private banking clients must have at least DM1
billion in free assets of which they must place DM250,000 with
Trinkaus.

"As soon as profit margins were being squeezed, we decided to set
rigorous benchmarks, to avoid getting involved in price competition. We
analysed our markets and came to the conclusion that we had a franchise
in the regional Mittelstand market, especially in companies with a
minimum turnover of between DM100 million-DM200 million. I think you
need a certain minimum size to be able to stay in the business and to
deliver good performance."

"A typical account manager at Trinkaus will look after between 40-60
clients. Training has been made a priority since the mid-1980s. Our
staff spend an annual average of 60-90 hours on in-house training.

"As a small private bank we are fully aware that we must be available
for our clients from 9 am to 5 pm. So our approach is somewhat
different from other institutions. We just don't think it is
justifiable to send them on seminars in training centres. After all,
our clients should expect excellent performance and this means that we
should be working all the time".

International expansion has so far been on a modest scale. Besides five
domestic offices, representative offices were set up in Luxembourg and
Zurich in the late-1970s. Overall, business expansion has largely
concentrated on the affluent region of North Rhine Westphalia.

"The Mittelstand is our main business focus", explains Rometsch.
"Although they have always been very export-oriented, they simply have
not achieved much penetration in Far Eastern markets, although we hope
this may change.

"The Hong Kong of German industry is eastern Europe. They are more
comfortable with the distance and culture and a majority speak the
German language. Today our natural market also includes Luxembourg and
parts of the Netherlands, where we are experiencing good results. When
HSBC decided to close their Luxembourg banking activities it was only
natural for Trinkaus to look after their clients. Through this
connection we maintain an Asian client base".

The integration process within the HSBC Group has been smooth. "Our
link with HSBC is a strong selling argument", he claims. "We have
introduced a substantial number of clients to HSBC. Nevertheless, we
have to be aware, that operating as a private bank within a group
network requires enormous sensitivity on our part. It is almost like a
walk on a razor blade - as independent private bank operating within
the network of one of the world's largest banks."

European expansion plans, however, are far off the agenda at Trinkaus.
"We have no plans to become a global player in the private banking
market. We are a truly German private bank with strong roots in the
Mittelstand. This is our strength on which we have built our expertise
over centuries".

Rometsch concluded: "If clients within the HSBC Group need advice on DM
products, they certainly find them at Trinkaus & Burkhardt."

BACK TO THE FUTURE?

Midland Bank, a UK subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation (HSBC), established a domestic private bank in 1993 which
eschewed much of the conventional wisdom associated with the sector.
Ian Orton spoke to Peter Renn, its first managing director, about the
philosophy behind the initiative and the progress achieved to date

OF ALL the new domestic private banks established by the large UK
financial institutions during the 1990s Midland Private Banking has
undoubtedly attracted the most interest, not least because of its
decision to use staff drawn from the commercial bank.

Purists could argue that Midland's initiative is yet another instance
of the private banking moniker being devalued. For Peter Renn, however,
the establishment of Midland's private bank, is a natural consequence
of the changes affecting the UK banking sector generally.

"The UK retail banking sector has experienced rapid change over the
last ten years. This is particularly the case as far as service
provision has been concerned. New technology is making it easier to
service retail customers through remote media. There are far fewer
branches. However, there is still a demand for personal service,
especially from the more affluent segment of the customer base. Hence
the decision to establish the domestic private bank."

According to Renn, in some respects the establishment of domestic
private banks by the large UK banks is a throwback to an earlier era.
The UK banks only became mass market institutions during the 1960s.
Before then their customer base had an element of exclusivity. In this
environment it was possible to provide a relatively high level of
personal service, albeit in a much more narrowly defined market.

Thirty years on, the new private banks are attempting to re-establish
an aura of exclusivity and personal service - and generate high quality
fee and commission income as a consequence.

"It is also a natural consequence to an increasingly competitive
environment. Product differentiation and market segmentation are
logical responses to increased competition," said Renn.

The HSBC UK strategy

The domestic private bank was an outcome of a global review of its
interests in this sector conducted by HSBC following its acquisition of
Midland in 1992.

At that time, Midland had two operations which catered for the
financial services requirements of the affluent. Samuel Montagu catered
for very high net worth individuals. Midland Personal Asset Management
catered for the needs of private clients with more modest means.

The review resulted in the pooling together of the group's
international private banking operations under the umbrella of HSBC.
Each of the component banks would retain or operate with its own name
in order to capitalise on existing reputations and ensure that staff
and relationships were country-focused rather than legal
entity-focused.

This meant that in the UK Samuel Montagu and the British Bank of the
Middle East would continue to cater for the financial elite from a
joint office in Hill Street, London. It was also decided to establish a
domestic private bank based on Midland Personal Asset Management.

"It was a natural outcome. The Personal Asset Management business had a
number of private banking elements such as a brokerage, fund management
and trusts. What it didn't have were the human resources or the brand
recognition to communicate a quality service image. The establishment
of a private bank provided an opportunity for these attributes to be
provided," said Renn.

The importance of personal service

The provision of a high level of service was perceived from the outset
as the key to enabling Midland to differentiate itself from other
institutions.

"There is no shortage of definitions of private banking or, for that
matter, private banks. I think the term private banking should really
be used to describe the market rather than the nature of the products
or services provided. Private banks can trace their origin to a number
of sources - legal and accounting firms, fund managers, stockbrokers,
even commercial banks.

"Although each institution will attempt to follow a different strategy
there is often one basic similarity between them - they will tend to
emphasise one particular product. This will often reflect their
origins. Private banks which evolved out of legal or accounting
partnerships will emphasise their trust and tax planning capabilities,
asset management specialists their fund management skills and so on. In
other words, the nature of the service will be product-orientated.

"At Midland we had to decide whether to go down a similar route and, if
so, what type of products we should offer. After conducting a lot of
research we decided to go down a different route by making the
provision of high quality service the keystone of our strategy".

Customer preferences

Midland's research suggested that prospective clients were looking for
advice and an ongoing relationship from a private bank. "There is a
definite gap in the market as far as the provision of advice is
concerned. Although people are becoming more affluent there is no
shortage of financial worries. There is less certainty of unbroken
unemployment. People are living longer. Meanwhile, the government is
reducing health and welfare provision. No matter how affluent they may
be now, people are being forced to address long-term financial planning
issues and they need advice."

The research also showed that potential clients were not particularly
interested in being sold a plethora of banking or investment products.
Nonetheless, they were appreciative of a broad range of product
offerings drawn from a variety of suppliers.

They were also looking for specific - or rather seamless solutions to
their financial problems. It was clear from the outset that "packaged"
solutions would not generate much enthusiasm.

The emphasis placed on advice and the preference for a "bespoke"
private banking service was critical in a number of respects. Despite
the fact that an organisation the size of HSBC is in a position to
provide from its own resources all of the products and services
traditionally associated with private banking, it was felt that the
private bank should function as an independent intermediary. It would
therefore have the freedom to buy in - on the client's behalf - any
relevant product or service.

Second, given the nature of the "product" offered, considerable
emphasis was placed on the ability of relationship managers to provide
service of a quality that would satisfy prospective clients.
Relationship managers in this environment have to encapsulate a number
of skills and functions and must develop an almost encyclopedic
knowledge of the banking and financial services sector. They also have
to be readily accessible.

Staffing the private bank

Midland decided to staff the bank with people drawn from the commercial
bank supplemented, where necessary, by outside recruits. These were
often drawn from the IFA sector. Although this decision has been
greeted with some surprise by outside commentators - not to mention
competitors - Renn is unrepentant about the efficacy of the approach.

"The first point to make is that in the current UK regulatory
environment it is virtually impossible for unqualified personnel to be
let loose in the private banking market. All of our people were
rigorously trained and are in receipt of one of the qualifications
recognised by the Personal Investment Authority.

"We also used very stringent selection criteria to identify potential
relationship managers. We understood quite clearly that wealthy
customers will only deal with experienced people with the authority to
take decisions and act on them."

The commercial bank was in a position to meet this requirement. "A bit
of grey hair does you no harm in this particular environment. At
Midland, we had quite a large pool of very experienced bankers to draw
on. Many of the bank's more senior personnel could look back on 20 or
25 years of banking experience. We were very keen to encourage these
people to come and work for us."

It was also decided from the outset to provide the bank with a local
focus. "We thought it was of critical importance to ensure that our
people were locally based - not located in a remote City office. You
can't develop significant relationships if the customer has to travel
to London every time he, or she, wants to see a private banker."

There are over 30 Midland Private Banking branches located throughout
England and Wales. They share a common location with the commercial
bank branches.

Tied versus IFA status

Midland's strategy meant that the new private bank's "natural"
competitors would be the IFA sector. "These are the institutions which
most closely match what Midland are trying to do.

"The decision to go down the IFA route or to concentrate on selling
Midland or HSBC products was a tough one to make. We rejected the tied
option. We knew that customers might feel compromised by being offered
only Midland or HSBC-branded products. Their options are limited.

"We also decided to stay clear of packaged products and services.
First, a package will not necessarily address the specific customer
requirements. Second, customers may feel that they are having to pay
for something they do not really need. A `bespoke' approach is much
more efficacious. It is cost effective - customers only pay for what
they need - and it is much more flexible. It doesn't cost much more to
select and manage a customised portfolio of stocks and shares than unit
trusts, for example."

Pricing was something that Midland Private Banking was conscious of
from the outset. "Although the customer base was comfortably off, we
were conscious of the fact that, in many instances their money had been
hard earned. They did not expect to be ripped off."

Positional advantages

Renn maintains that the bank had two important positional advantages
over the IFA sector, however. The first was that it had a
well-recognised brand name. The second was that it could rely on the
commercial bank for potential customers.

"On the whole, IFAs do a very good job in the financial planning and
wealth management market. Nonetheless clients are sometimes put off by
a relative lack of security. There have been a number of
well-publicised cases involving IFAs where probity - and the security
of the client's assets - has been severely compromised.

"Clients do run a notional risk assessment of institutions. One of the
perceived strengths of the Midland Bank name is that we are a large,
safe and well-run institution. Size is important in this market as, I
think, the aftermath of the Barings crash showed."

The bulk of the private bank's customers have been generated by
internal referrals. The customer threshold is income or free assets of
#100,000, although this is more a guideline figure rather than a strict
eligibility criterion. "Midland Private Banking targets the
`comfortably off' portion of the market rather than the very affluent".

Renn admits that a customer recruitment strategy which relied very
heavily on referrals from the commercial bank could have been
problematic. This is especially the case in the new sales culture which
is permeating retail banks. A customer lost to the private bank may
mean the loss of potential sales revenue for the retail bank.

"There is always scope for a potential conflict of interest unless you
make sure you have the right organisational structure in place. We were
helped by the fact that local private bank branches were structured as
part of the General Manager's department. As such, a referral amounted
to an internal transfer within a single arena, not a transfer from one
department to another. We were also fortunate in that when the bank was
being set up, the Midland branch network was in the process of
upheaval. Very senior bankers were being put back into the branches and
this probably eased the transition."

In practice, the strategy has worked well with the commercial bank
generating a substantial proportion of Midland Private Banking's
customer base. "In most cases, we have had an almost seamless transfer
of an old relationship". During the first half of 1995, for example,
the retail branch network generated 3,500 customers.

The future

Renn maintains that the future for the UK private banking sector is
very good. The market is opening up and many of the old cliches are no
longer relevant. There is a lot of "new money" about. Senior company
executives, entrepreneurs, media people, athletes - even lottery
winners are domestic private banks' natural constituency. Midland
Private Bankers is well placed to take advantage.

UNITED STATES:  AT&T CUTS APR TO DRUM UP BUSINESS

AT&T UNIVERSAL Card has cut the APR from 18.15 percent to 13.9 percent
for a selected swathe of its customer base in an effort to transform
convenience users into borrowers - at least during the holiday season
and in time to affect the 1996 bottom line.

"We have a significant number of transactors who have the potential to
become revolvers," said Robbie Kolakowski, vice-president of portfolio
marketing for AT&T Universal, based in Jacksonville, Florida. "We want
to become the card of choice in our cardholders' wallets."

The move comes at an especially important time for AT&T, both
corporately and in the card unit itself. AT&T Universal suffered a
charge-off rate of 6 percent, adding up to a $39 million loss, during
the third quarter of 1996. It was largely in anticipation of this
disappointing result that unit president David Hunt resigned late last
summer (see Cards International 163).

More recently, and on the heels of Universal Card's disappointing third
quarter, AT&T chairman Robert Allen named John Walter president, chief
operating officer and chief executive of the telecommunications giant.
The appointment prompted renewed industry speculation that AT&T will
seek to spin off or simply sell the Universal Card portfolio.

"It is certainly not going to surprise anyone if it does go on the
block," said an industry observer. As for the rate cut itself, few
think other issuers will respond.

"It has that sort of scent to it; a desperation move," said Bruce
Brittain, president of Brittain Associates, an Atlanta-based market
research firm. "It has just not been terribly successful in getting
revolvers."

According to Brittain, the industry average for revolving a balance
from one month to another is 60 percent, while on the AT&T card it is
39 percent. "And it was 39 percent in the third quarter of last year,
so it hasn't seen any improvement," he added.

"It is true that we have a large share of transactors," Kolakowski
said, "but we can rely on our AT&T relationship to make that a
profitable relationship." Speaking of the rate cut, she said, "We do
expect it to have a positive effect in 1996."

Kolakowski expected more aggressive marketing from AT&T Universal in
the near term, and described the card unit's strategy as twofold.

"We are aggressively pursuing strategies to control our losses, and all
our marketing programmes are going to concentrate on getting a greater
share of cardholders' wallets." Controlling losses, she said, would be
mainly a matter of tightening credit standards: "We have sliced
acquisitions in 1996."

While AT&T Universal is the world's third largest card issuer in number
of cards in circulation, behind Dean Witter, Discover and Citicorp with
24 cards and 18 million accounts respectively, it is seventh in
receivables.

UNITED KINGDOM:  RETAILER MOVES INTO BANKING

UK SUPERMARKET group Sainsbury has announced it plans to set up a bank.
Sainsbury's Bank will be 55 percent owned by the UK's second-largest
retailer and 45 percent owned by the Bank of Scotland.

The move into financial services by the retailer will be led by the
issuance of credit cards in early 1997. "The first phase will see the
launch of both classic and gold Visa cards, as well as attractive
additional account and card-based services providing broad customer
appeal," Sainsbury said in a statement.

The new 24-hour banking operation will be telephone-based and will
operate out of the Bank of Scotland's call centre in Edinburgh,
alongside the Scottish bank's own Banking Direct service, rather than
as part of it.

"We have the necessary infrastructure in place, but the products
offered will differ. They will be genuine Sainsbury products," said Ian
Fiddes, the bank's director of marketing services.

Sainsbury said it would be the first supermarket retailer to enter the
consumer banking market. The only other UK retailer to possess such a
licence is Marks & Spencer, which launched its charge card back in
1987.

The move has wrong-footed its main rival, Tesco, which, until
Sainsbury's announcement on October 25, had led moves by UK supermarket
groups into the financial services market.

Tesco launched its own budget account in June, offering 5.12 percent
interest on deposits, ten times some bank and building society deposit
rates. This, however, is operated by NatWest, which possesses the
banking licence. One leading UK banking analyst said the Sainsbury's
move was "one big step on from that".

Tesco, which has recently taken over from Sainsbury as the UK's biggest
supermarket group, refused to say whether it would respond by setting
up its own bank. "We do not comment on the activities of our rivals," a
spokeswoman said.

But other retailers have not discounted such a move. Kevin Hawkins,
Safeway's head of communications, said: "We have not ruled out the
provision of financial services should it fit with our customer
proposition."

For some time now, UK banks have had problems with their public image
and are becoming increasingly concerned with the activities of the more
"consumer-friendly" retailers. Bankers and analysts alike are promoting
collaborative joint ventures, like the Sainsbury venture, as the way
forward.

Tony Surridge, head of co-branding at NatWest UK, who was behind the
bank's joint venture with Tesco, said if the UK banks did not set up
alliances with retailers, US credit card operators would. "We would
rather be inside the goldfish bowl than looking in from outside," he
said.

Recently, British Gas, a major UK utility, and HFC Bank, a subsidiary
of the US Household Financial Corporation, teamed up to form Goldbrand
Development to manage its new Goldfish credit card. The Goldfish credit
card offers a loyalty point scheme whereby customers can save up to #75
on their gas bills.

British Gas and HFC said the Goldbrand joint venture company was aiming
to"rewrite the rules in financial services".

THAILAND:  BANK AND INSURER LAUNCH AFFINITY CARD

THAILAND'S LARGEST bank, Bangkok Bank, has launched an affinity card
with associate company Bangkok Life Assurance, just six months after
establishing a similar deal with Bangkok Insurance.

The three companies have a web of cross-shareholdings in a group
controlled by the country's influential Sophonpanich family.

The latest credit card, the BLA-BBL card, is being launched to mark
Bangkok Life Assurance's 45th anniversary and is being offered with
Bt200,000 ($8,000) of insurance cover which pays off any outstanding
credit card balance on the card of up to that amount if the holder dies
or is permanently disabled.

The promotion also offers a 10 percent discount on life assurance
policies and unspecified discounts on comprehensive motor insurance
policies with Bangkok Insurance, which also has a stake in its life
assurance affiliate.

Bangkok Bank has around 400,000 cards in issue, and is aiming to add
another 10,000 from the latest card in the next six months. The card is
being offered to all Bangkok Life Assurance clients with individual or
group life policies.

The affinity card is being offered as a blue or gold proprietary card,
and with classic and gold Visa card and standard and gold MasterCard
options.

The joining fee has been waived for applications before the end of the
year, as has half of the annual fee for the first year.

Otherwise, joining fees are Bt300 and Bt400 for local blue and gold
cards respectively and Bt600 for the international options. Full annual
fees are Bt600 for the blue cards, Bt900 for the local gold cards,
Bt1,000 for the classic/standard card and Bt1,500 for the international
gold card.

In April, Bangkok Bank launched a similar card with Bangkok Insurance
offering two alternatives - Bt500,000 cover or Bt300,000 insurance
against death or illness at a monthly premium of Bt235 to Bt2,510 and
Bt140 to Bt1,506 respectively. The cover is limited to cancer
diagnosis, a disease which is one of the biggest killers of Thais.

The scheme was targeted at all Bangkok Bank cardholders aged between 21
and 59 years, although applicants were required to fill in a health
form.

MALAYSIA:  BANK SIGNS SCHEME WITH ENGINEERS

MALAYSIA'S 30,000 engineers will be eligible to join Southern Bank's
Direct Access credit card and banking scheme following the signing of
an affinity programme in October.

The bank signed an agreement with the Institution of Engineers (IEM)
which will give its members special privileges on the bank programme.

The scheme offers IEM-Direct Access Visa and MasterCard affinity cards
bearing the IEM logo, the three-in-one current, savings and money
market accounts and the Direct Access/Maestro ATM and debit card.

IEM members will have their joining and annual fees waived for life and
will be subject to interest on outstanding balances of 1.49 percent a
month, the lowest rate in the country, according to Southern Bank.

The bank has signed similar affinity deals with the Medical Association
of Malaysia, the Malaysian Dentistry Association and Compaq computers.
The Direct Access programme is run as a standalone part of the bank and
is expected to see positive earnings in the next few months, having
been launched a year ago, said the division's head K Muganthan.

He is now working on another affinity programme with an unnamed mutual
fund company, aimed at encouraging high-net-worth clients to open
Direct Access accounts.

When Direct Access was launched a year ago, Muganthan said he was
aiming for 30,000 to 40,000 new customers a year. That target still
remains, he said.

The bank spent around M$10 million ($4 million) on computer software
and hardware last year to launch Direct Access, which features 24-hour
direct banking.

CARD REWARD DEALS REMAIN POPULAR

THE CONTINUING popularity of co-branding and reward deals is based on
solid business considerations. A little more than half of US consumers
who own a co-branded airline card say that owning the card influences
their choice of carrier, according to a new study by Brittain
Associates, an Atlanta-based research firm.

"Airline frequent-flier programmes have a lot of appeal to a fairly
narrow segment, but it's a viciously loyal segment," principal Bruce
Brittain told Cards International.

According to the study, about 6 percent of all US households claim to
own a credit card that provides air travel rewards linked to card
usage. Of these programmes, ten are co-branded card issues bearing
either the MasterCard or Visa marque, along with a bank's. Four of the
programmes generate points that can be redeemed for travel on any
airline.

"The majority of owners tell us that they use the card both for airfare
and other purchases," Brittain said. "And compared to other co-branded
cards we study, airline card owners use these cards much more
frequently."

It was such loyalty that American Express and Advanta hope to break
with their Rewards Accelerator Card that enables users to earn points
on their Amex membership rewards programme through a bank card (see
pages 1 and 6).

Among the surprises in the study, Brittain said, was the rapid growth
of the Delta SkyMiles Optima portfolio. "It's really vaulted up there,"
he said, and now rivals United's programme. Amex was careful to forbid
balance transfer from any Optima card to the new Rewards Accelerator.

Brittain added, however, that"the American Airlines AAdvantage
portfolio with Citibank is still the 800lbs gorilla among these
programmes, with twice as much business as its nearest competitors."

SUIT FILED AGAINST VISA

WAL-MART STORES, the world's largest retailer, and The Limited have
filed suit against Visa USA, charging that Visa's "honour all cards"
policy regarding debit and cheque cards is illegal.

Visa immediately responded in a statement saying it would fight the
suit.

The court action alleges that Visa's rule that each of its merchant
members accept all Visa cards, whether they be credit, online debit or
cheque card instruments is in violation of US anti-trust laws.

The suit hinges on the differing costs to retailers of processing
Visa's online debit cards versus banks' ATM cards with debit functions
attached and routed over local POS networks. According to the suit, the
merchants' profitability may erode when customers are allowed to
present online Visa debit cards.

Visa, according to its statement, "will vigorously defend this action
and believe that we will prevail".

The grounds on which it will defend itself hinge on two points,
according to Stephen Theoharis, senior vice-president and director of
litigation with the card association.

First, he said, Visa successfully defended itself against a similar
suit brought in 1983 by upscale retailer Nordstrom's. Second, it
regards the "honour all cards rule" as fostering rather than stifling
competition worldwide.

"If I can go into one of 13 million establishments worldwide and
present any Visa card for payment, we believe that encourages
competition," he said.

Regarding Visa's use of Nordstrom's precedent, the only difference
between 1983 and 1996, Theoharis said, is the enormously-enhanced
number of debit cards, offline and online, in circulation.

"Clearly, the debit card has been embraced by consumers," Theoharis
said. "But the number of cards has nothing to do with the issue
legally." There are about 35 million offline, or "cheque" cards
currently in circulation in the US.

Theoharis added: "They seem to be arguing that the debit transaction be
processed over regional POS networks. But what they don't seem to
understand is that one half of the bank ATM cards that are also debit
cards are Visa cheque cards.  "I think there is a misperception on Wal-
Mart's part. We have no rules for routing transactions. The merchants
are free to route that transaction as they see fit."

Curiously, MasterCard International, which has a similar rule, was not
mentioned in the suit. Industry speculation centres on Wal-Mart's
reluctance to sue MasterCard, its partner in a recent agreement to
offer the retailer's first-ever co-branded credit card in association
with Chase Manhattan and FDR.

BRANDING MEANS BONDING

In an increasingly-competitive cards market, a co-branding programme
can provide issuers with a keen edge

OVER THE past year co-branded and affinity products have outperformed
all other card products in the market place. As competition becomes
more fierce and brand loyalty decreases, co-branding is taking on a new
significance, Virlea Mays, president of the Mays Marketing Group told
delegates at Lafferty's International Retail Financial Services
Conference for Southern Africa in October.

"If we want the customer to want, use and keep our products, the way we
structure strategies and go to the market with our card products is
critical," she said.

"The credit card business is intensely competitive. It is expensive to
market, especially in the US, and by combining the marketing resources
and marketing expertise of two major organisations, you get more
muscle."

Co-branding offers significant benefits and enhancements to both
parties. Marketing expertise is shared by the issuer and co-brander, as
is the revenue.

The co-brander is typically profit-driven and usually has a recognised
brand or logo, merchant outlets and sales volume, often through a
proprietary card. Solicitation is done primarily by or through the co-
brander.

But the co-branding process is fraught with difficulties. Finding the
right partner and working out the relationship may seem
straightforward, but it is often not the case.

"The associations are important but the co-brand partner and the issuer
are the most critical component. And as they develop the partnership,
the most important thing is to define the contractual relationship and
the product and the value proposition of that product," said Mays.

The partners must start with an equitable contract and establish mutual
objectives. The two sides should design the product, value proposition
and packaging, and define credit approval criteria and credit limits.

A marketing plan should be developed and quality service standards
defined. While the ongoing relationship should be formalised, decision-
making and conflict/resolution processes and a termination agreement
should also be defined. But for the issuer, negotiating revenue and
expense sharing details is crucial.

"The ability to forecast how the revenue is shared can make the
difference for the issuer in terms of complete and total profit and
loss," explained Mays. "A lot of contracts were written so that the
issuer ends up with all of the responsibility and takes the full brunt
of the loss if the product fails or the programme simply doesn't work."

The time spent developing the partnership and working on the contract
is a key factor and one that is often overlooked, according to Mays.

"This is where the time needs to be taken and in most cases is not.
Everybody is rushing to get to the market and the correct length of
time is often not taken in the development of the contract," she said.

The length of the contract also has to be worked out and Mays advised
delegates to settle for a contract of between seven and ten years.
"Nobody is down in the three-year range, except maybe some affinity
programmes. There may be some five-year contracts out there, but there
is just too much riding on this, so contracts should be in the
neighbourhood of seven to ten years," she said.

When working out the rebate and reward structure, the co-branding
partners should be careful to make the product easy for the customer to
understand.

"Some rebate and reward structures work very well, some are way too
complicated for a consumer to really get caught up in to use the card,"
said Mays.

She cited a survey conducted by Visa in the US where consumers
indicated they wanted something that is simple and easy to use.

"We are all customers and we don't want a ten-page book to figure out
how to get our reward," she said. "We want reasonably easy
gratification and no tricks, no restrictions, no caps and no fine
points.

"The process is attempting to create a connection with the customer and
create some sort of emotional connection, even if that emotion is
greed."

When the product is designed, the next piece of the equation is to
define the marketing plan. This involves developing strategies for:

* Acquisition - acquire new accounts and appeal to customers to want
the card.

* Activation - generate a balance and induce activity so the cardholder
will use the account.

* Retention - become the "card of choice", so profitable customers keep
accounts.

"Many of the programmes designed in the US and in other parts of the
world, such as AT&T, do a great job in acquiring but they do not do the
best job possible at activation. The activation today in AT&T is still
only about 49 percent and the industry average is 65 percent," said
Mays.

100-YEAR ISSUE FROM MALAYSIA

Tenaga Nasional Berhad's proposed 100-year issue via the 144A market
has been rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service.
      Tenaga, which plans to issue $150 million of the notes, is the
dominant producer of electricity in Peninsule Malaysia with approximately
80% of the total market. It is 78% owned by the Malaysian government.

NEW YORK CITY PLANS TO SECURITIZE TAX LIENS

The nascent movement among municipalities to securitize delinquent
property taxes took a major step forward last week when New York City
stepped into the fray, requesting proposals from investment banks on how
best to securitize $200 million to $250 million of tax liens. It would be
the biggest such securitization ever.
     The city has approximately 250,000 properties with tax arrears
totaling over $2 billion, according to a request-for-proposal document; and
it is looking for a team of two to four bankers to underwrite the senior
notes, expected to receive an investment grade rating.
     Although the document states that an objective is to complete the
transaction by April 15 -- a timetable one source described as "pretty
tight" -- the letter also cautions that the implementation and completion
of any transaction is subject to the New York City Council's enactment of
pending legislation to permit bulk lien sales. WR Lazard & Co. is the
city's advisor.
     A source at City Hall said one of the main goals of the pending
legislation and securitization is to "enforce taxes" and remove the city as
the lender of last resort, which is what it essentially becomes when
someone falls behind on their property taxes. The proposed issue will be
backed by the better-quality of these tax liens, mostly commercial real
estate with a high likelihood of repayment.
     One of the basic principles behind these transactions is that the
pooled tax liens will eventually generate cash in one of three ways: the
property owner will pay the back taxes, the bank will foreclose and pay the
back taxes, or the municipality will itself foreclose and sell the
property.
     According to the city, the proposed and subsequent securitizations
will accomplish four things: to increase the cashflow from delinquent tax
liens; provide an efficient real property tax enforcement mechanism;
increase the current property tax collection rate; and reduce the need for
the city to assume ownership of properties in tax arrears.
     "The sale of liens represents a faster, cheaper, and more efficient
method to enforce property tax collection than the ... foreclosure process
the City currently uses. Tax lien sales will enable the City to restore
fairness to the property tax collection system, maintain and improve
collection rates, generate additional cash for operations, and relieve
upward pressure on property taxes. Key to the success of a long-term sale
program will be the initial securitization," the request for proposal
states.
     The issue will be sold to institutional investors, but unlike a
traditional private placement, the issue will be fully underwritten by the
investment banks, which will assume some risk. It will not be a best-
efforts transaction, the source at City Hall said. The raised capital will
be funneled into the city's operations fund.
     The deadline for bankers to submit proposals to the city was last
Friday, and a team of underwriters is expected to be chosen in about two
weeks.
     Which underwriters the city will choose is anyone's guess, but one
question in the document does ask bankers to describe their experience
implementing new products such as tax lien securitizations. And the list of
those with specific tax lien securitization experience is quite short.
     Most recent was Smith Barney, which priced a $19 million issue for the
City of New Haven, Conn., in the fall. The issue has a two-year average,
seven-year final life, priced at 220 basis points off the curve, and had
$25 million of collateral. Fitch Investors Service rated it BBB and The
Principal Finance Group scooped up the entire offering.
     New Haven sold its liens into a trust, which then issued the taxable
notes. There will be no recourse to New Haven and in this way is similar to
a deal in the fall of 1994 from Jersey City, N.J., which was agented by CS
First Boston.
     Other tax lien deals are due to follow soon. Breen Capital Group is
about to launch a $50 million securitization backed by a diverse pool of
tax liens, culled from its own portfolio. The deal, which will be placed by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is currently structured with a four-year final,
two-year average life. The deal will likely be overcollateralized.
     Price talk has not been heard yet, but because the portfolio is "hand-
picked" and will not carry the concentration risk of a single-city deal,
BZW will aim for a tighter spread than New Haven, a source said. Both Fitch
and Standard & Poor's are expected to rate the transaction.
     Meanwhile, Philadelphia is expected to make its securitization plans
public soon. The city is rumored to be planning a $150 million issue.

ELKEM FROM LAND OF REINDEER

Barclays de Zoete Wedd was roadshowing a $60 million issue last week
for Elkem A/S, a Norwegian metals company with sales last year of
approximately $1.4 billion.
     The company, considered a mid-BBB, is reportedly looking for 10- of
12-year money in the form of senior unsecured notes. Price talk was 130
over Treasurys. Bids were expected this week.
     One investor expressed concern about the company's cyclicality, noting
that Elkem is coming off its best earnings in six or seven years. "I think
it's on the fence between an NAIC-2 and 3," the investor said.
     Last fall ABN-AMRO brought a $20 million deal from Elkem's U.S.
subsidiary. Those senior notes, considered an NAIC-2, had a 10-year final,
seven-year average life and priced at 125 off the curve.
     Elkem is one of Norway's largest companies and a worldwide leader in
the production of silicon metals and aluminum, to name a few.

IFC-LINKED DEALS MAKE ROUNDS

Chase Securities is in the market with a $200 million issue from
Edelsur, an Argentine gas utility. The deal would be just the third under a
new program by the International Finance Corp., an arm of the World Bank.
     The deal comes on the heels of another IFC-linked deal. Just before
Christmas, J.P. Morgan and ING Securities placed a $100 million issue with
institutional investors for Grupo Industrial Bimbo, S.A. (Gibsa), which
owns a popular Mexican bread sold under the brand name Bimbo (PPR Nov. 13,
p. 1).
     Under the program, the IFC extends a loan to the company and keeps a
small portion for its own account. It then sells the remainder to a
Delaware trust in form of participation interests subsequently issued to
investors.
     As a division of the World Bank, the IFC can ensure certain payment
guarantees that generally yield an investment grade rating.
     Details about the Edelsur deal were sketchy at press time, but sources
said it was apparently divided into floating- and fixed-rated tranches that
would be filled out according to demand. Price talk was reportedly Libor
plus 200 for the floater and the equivalent spread for the fixed.
     On the Gibsa transaction, more details were available. The 10-year
bullet priced at 305 off the curve and was popularly referred to by
investors as the Bimbo deal. The structure did evolve somewhat since it
first hit the market mid-November. At that time it had a 12-year final,
seven-year average life and the notes were being talked at 275 to 285 off
the curve.
     Gibsa, with sales last year of $1.25 billion, was founded in 1945 and
makes such products as breads, cakes, potato chips, and tortilla chips,
among others. Besides a 90% market share in much of Mexico, the company has
plants in Argentina, Chile, Guatemala and El Salvador. It has also started
to make some acquisitions in the U.S. tortilla market.
     A source pointed out that the company's distribution network is so
extensive and well respected that Gibsa currently has a distribution
agreement with Mars, and until recently also had one with Wrigley's.
     The new program is part of the IFC's attempt to tap the U.S.
institutional market -- such as insurance companies and pension funds.

ABN-AMRO PAVES WAY FOR ROGERS

ABN-AMRO recently found circles for a $25 million issue from Rogers
Group, one of the largest aggregate companies in the nation. The materials
it produces are used in road construction.
     The issue from the Nashville-based company was four times
oversubscribed and purchased by three investors. The issuer decided not to
expand the offering, which was divided into two tranches, 10-year and 20-
year bullets.
     Although no pricing was available, initial price talk was 110 to 120
over the 12-year Treasury.

AIRBUS CIRCLES MARKET

Salomon Brothers was in the market last week with a $52 million issue
from Airbus Industrie, sources said.
     The secured loan certificates were reportedly broken into two
tranches, a 17-year final, 11-year average life with price talk at 70 to 75
off the curve; and a 21-year final, 20-year average life with price talk at
105 over Treasurys.
     One buy-side source said those spreads offered some decent value.
French-based Airbus Industrie, an equipment manufacturer, is considered a
double A minus credit.
     Last January Salomon led a  $108 million leveraged lease transaction
for Airbus broken into two tranches. Final pricing was not available. But
the 10-year average life strip started at 85 basis points over the curve;
while price talk on the 20-year average life tranche started at 115 basis
points over Treasurys.
     The raised capital from the 1995 deal financed the purchase of four
A320 aircraft. Although the planes went to United Airlines, the deal was
based on Airbus' credit.

BANKS EXPLOIT WIDENING SPREADS

After being unable to come to terms with investors on a $75 million
proposed issue via BA Securities, Empresa Nacional deMineria opted for bank
financing late last year. But is Enami's fate indicative of what will
happen to similar issues in 1996?
     When Enami, Chile's second largest copper producer, hit the market in
late October, price talk was a tight 95 off the curve for the seven-year
paper. But the BBB+ paper quickly widened to 120.
     "The market was demanding much wider spreads than was initially
anticipated," a source said.
     Unfortunately for Enami, its entry into the market coincided with a
general widening of emerging market spreads, particularly those "quasi"
emerging markets whose sovereign rating is investment grade, such as Chile,
Malaysia and the Czech Republic, sources said.
     For instance, a recent public Chilean deal from Celulosa Arauco y
Constitucion SA also had to swallow a wider spread than initially
anticipated. An eight-year tranche that started at 80 over Treasurys got
done at 105 and has since traded even wider.
     "It's not a dramatic shift, and it's not just Chile, and it'll still
be a good year," a source said. "But you'd expect it to be a runaway year
for issuance given that long-term interest rates are at a 20-year low. But
with banks so aggressive, I don't think you'll see the amount of issues in
the private market you might expect. The few basis points (the banks will
give over institutional investors) do matter."

COBHAM LOOKS FOR U.S. INVESTORS

Schroder Wertheim was circulating a $50 million issue last week for
Cobham plc., a U.K.-based aerospace company.
     The 12-year final, 10-year average life notes were being talked at 80
off the curve, though a source said New York Life had offered to take a $15
million portion at a spread of 85.
     Cobham, considered an A- credit, is a private company with 1994 sales,
the last year a figure was available, of $278 million.

SCHMIT EXITS MUTUAL OF OMAHA

Thomas Schmit has resigned from Mutual of Omaha. He had been at the
insurance company for 26 years, all of that time in the realm of private
placements. For the past six years he was head of the department.
     Schmit, 52, is currently pursuing options both in and outside the
Omaha area.
     Mutual of Omaha has not yet appointed a replacement, and is reportedly
considering whether to hire a junior or senior person. In 1994, the insurer
did $650 million of private placement volume.

THE DEUTSCHE BANK SHUFFLE

Joe Rowan resigned as head of private placements at Deutsche Bank as
of the end of last year, sources said.
     A spokesperson for the bank declined to say whether Rowan would be
replaced or to comment on the future of the private placement department.
     However, sources said Rowan may have been a casualty of Deutsche
Bank's decision to bring several Merrill Lynch people into its fixed-income
department.

PUERTO RICAN BANK ISSUES 144A

After eying the market throughout 1995, FirstBank of Puerto Rico
became the second bank from the island to issue subordinated debt in
December.
     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100 million offering
of 10-year subordinated notes that priced at 200 basis points over
Treasurys for a coupon of 7.625% at 99.277 to yield 7.730%. The notes,
which carry a split rating of Baa3/BB-plus, carried 144A language, enabling
a public-style execution of the offering without registration at the
Securities & Exchange Commission. The relatively rich spread resulted from
Standard & Poor's rating the issue just below investment grade, said Annie
Astor, chief financial officer.
     The need for Tier 2 capital and the exceptionally low rates in
December, dropping below 6%, were the key factors prompting FirstBank to
issue the bonds, according to Astor. The deal represents the bank's first
independent bond offering.
     Jefferies & Co. captured the lead underwriting position on the deal
because of its relationship with the bank, and Smith Barney Inc. acted as
co-manager. The private notes were purchased by about 15 insurance
companies.
     Investors were attracted to the offering in large part by the bank's
phenomenal growth over the last five years, in which it has had an average
return on assets of 8% and a return on equity of 25%. Since the bank's
initial public offering in January 1987, the stock has appreciated in value
by 1200%, Astor said. Headquartered in San Juan, the $2.4 billion asset
bank switched from a thrift charter to a commercial bank charter last year.
     The deal for FirstBank follows a first-time subordinated offering by
another Puerto Rican bank that was completed earlier in the month. BanPonce
Corp., rated Baa2/BBB, originally offered $100 million in 10-year
subordinated notes, and later increased the public offering to $125
million. That deal, which priced at 105 basis points over comparable
Treasurys, was underwritten entirely by CS First Boston. --John Hintze

ALVEY TO FINANCE ACQUISITION

Alvey Systems, Inc. plans to issue a $100 million 144A of six-year,
senior subordinated notes to help fund an acquisition and a buyout of an
equity partner. Moody's Investors Service has rated the notes B3.
     Alvey designs, engineers and produces materials flow equipment and
software.
     The rating reflects Alvey's high leverage as a result of a quasi-
management buyout/acquisition in conjunction with this note issue, which
follows numerous debt-financed acquisitions in the past seven years; its
limited track record as a fully integrated company; and the subordination
of the notes to a $30 million secured bank facility and any future senior
debt.
     These risks are moderated, however, by the company's broad and
innovative product offerings; its stable cash flows from a diversified
customer base; and the growing demand for the kind of complex, custom-
designed material handing systems that Alvey assembles.

A.P.S. ISSUE GETS JUNK RATING

A.P.S.' proposed $100 million issue of 10-year senior, subordinated
notes has been rated B2 by Moody's Investors Service.
     The company is an automotive replacement parts manufacturer and
distributor. Most of the raised capital will be used to acquire Parts, Inc.
for $80 million and to repay A.P.S. bank debt.
     The rating reflects A.P.S.'s high financial leverage, short
profitability history, intensely competitive business environment,
vulnerability to weather conditions, short operating history with its mini-
warehouses and high supplier concentration. It also considers uncertainties
relating to the purchase of Parts, Inc. and future acquisitions as well as
the subordination of the notes.
     Mitigating factors include improving profitability prospects, positive
demand fundamentals, good industry position, limited risk of obsolete
inventory, adequacy of capital for attracting additional sales locations,
and substantial benefits provided by Parts, Inc.

MARKET RADAR


     Traditionals'
     ABN-AMRO priced a $70 million issue recently from Uniboard Canada. The
NAIC-2, senior notes have an eight-year final, six-year average life and
priced at 145 over Treasurys. The company makes fiberboard and particle
board.
     BOT Financial was in the market with a $40 million issue from United
Healthcare Corp. The notes have a 12-year final, 10-year average life.
     Daiwa Securities has reportedly received a mandate for an issue from
Compania Vale do Rio Doce, more popularly known as CVRD, a Brazilian mining
company.
     ING Securities and UBS Securi-ties have reportedly received a Mexican
mandate for a $75 million deal securitized by steel.
     Robertson Stephens reportedly placed $10 million of subordinated notes
for Individual Inc.
     Chilgener, which recently issued a $110 million private placement, has
just had a proposed, 10-year public deal of $150 million senior notes rated
Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service.

     144As'
     Goldman Sachs is reportedly bringing an investment grade issue from
Enterprise Rent-A-Car. No other details were available at press time.
     Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley were on the road last week with a $75
million, high-yield issue from B.E. Aerospace, which makes commercial
aircraft interiors. The 10-year senior subordinated notes are noncallable
for five years.
     Mexico's Nacional Financiera launched a $100 million Euro/144A via
Salomon Brothers that some market insiders considered too expensive. The
three-year notes carried a 9% coupon for a spread of 375 basis points over
U.S. Treasurys. The deal was popular with European retail investors, but
some U.S. investors were not impressed. "You can get Nafinsa paper with the
same spread for shorter maturities," one said.
     Smith Barney and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette are bringing a $150
million 144A for KCS Energy, a New Jersey-based exploration and production
company. The seven-year issue, noncallable for four years, has been rated
B1.

MOODY'S RATES BRAZILIAN ISSUE

Moody's Investors Service has assigned a B1 rating to the notes of
Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras SA (Telebras). Approximately $720 million of
debt is affected.
     The rating is supported by Telebras' established position as the
monopoly provider of Brazil's telecommunications services. Although the
Brazilian government has begun to liberalize the telecommunications market,
it will likely do so very gradually and will take steps to make Telebras
more competitive.

U.S. INVESTORS INHALE ELM

Timing was everything for Mexican cigarette company, Empresas La
Moderna, which increased its long awaited Euro/ 144A to $125 million last
week.
     ELM's three-year issue, joint led by ING Securities and J.P. Morgan,
was oversubscribed by a two to one margin and enlarged from $100 million.
ELM was to launch the deal last November but backed out due to a difficult
market environment. That was not the case this time, though, as the bonds,
carrying an 11.38% coupon, were equally distributed in the U.S., Asia and
Europe.
     "The deal went real well. We bought $10 million worth of bonds," says
Steven C. Merrell, manager of IDS' Special Income Fund. "It was relatively
attractive in relation to other things offered in Mexico and is well priced
and valued."
     Merrell was one of many investors who turned away from the ELM issue
last November as the Mexican peso swooned, but was swayed back by the
changing sentiment toward Mexico.-- Dan Levine

NBD, 1ST CHICAGO EXPECT EASY COMPLIANCE MERGER

The fact that National Bank of Detroit and First Chicago both had
line management compliance systems before they merged Dec. 1 will ease the
future merging of their compliance departments, NBD's general counsel told
RCW.
        The compliance program at the new holding company, First
Chicago/NBD Corp., will probably be run in a similar way, Dan Lis said.
Only the holding companies have currently merged; the only banks that will
merge are in Illinois--NBD Illinois and First National Bank of Chicago--
which will merge at mid-year. At that time NBD will fold into First
National.
        So far, the plan of how to structure the new compliance program
hasn't yet gone to senior management or been implemented, but according to
bank executives this is not a problem.
        "There was no danger in not having a compliance program completely
set up in time for the merger, because our functions and the way the two
banks approached compliance were very similar," said Lis. "We will not have
any gaps in coverage because of this."
        How to merge CRA functions, which are separate from compliance,
also wasn't considered until after the merger. According to M. Chris Snow,
NBD's CRA officer, before Dec. 1 the CRA department was just making sure it
got through the approval process, which included a couple of protests.
"When we sat down to combine our offices, we realized that our public
affairs divisions both held CRA (departments), but were different in other
ways," said Snow. "So far we've only had two meetings to integrate the
departments."
        Lis said that like the pre-merged institutions, First Chicago/NBD
Corp. will probably have corporate compliance officers in each line of
manufacturing business, who will have corporate-wide responsibility. There
will probably also be distribution compliance officers in charge of each
state, since each state operation serves as a distribution arm of products
and services, speculated Lis. Those officers will report to the bank
president of that state.
        Those officers, together with certain executive officers, including
those of the law and auditing departments, will comprise a corporate
compliance committee. The auditing and law departments will serve as
support for the line management.
        Lis said the manufacturing arms of the bank take up such retail
banking functions as mortgage, consumer banking, deposit services and
marketing. Distribution involves the sale of the bank's products.
        "The most significant difference between the new compliance
department and the old ones is that before, at NBD, there was a single
corporate compliance officer. Now we will use the corporate compliance
committee structure, similar to the one First Chicago had," said Lis.
        "There will also be some decrease in personnel due to redundancy as
a result of the transition, not as a result of the new structure. For
example, before we downsize there may be two lawyers who study the same
reg, two compliance officers who monitor it, etc."
        There won't be many problems combining the bank's CRA departments
either, said Snow.
        "Even though First Chicago was a larger bank, its market was small
compared to ours, and its CRA was focused more in their public affairs
group, out of their downtown Chicago office, since they didn't have many
branches," she said. "By contrast, NBD's CRA efforts were spread over five
states, each with a state coordinator. Each state was also broken up into
regions, with a part-time regional person.
        "I think we will move the centralized CRA to Chicago, like the
centralized lending analysis, since our corporate headquarters will be
there, and keep the information flowing back and forth from the regions,"
Snow continued. "We still need to keep the regional efforts because the
needs of each state are different--CRA has to be much closer to the
customer and geography. Before, we had to rely on a local person to tell us
why a trend was the way it was, but the new reg lends itself more to
centralized data.
        "Right now we're not worried about who will be in what job, but
that whatever data analyzer we purchase will be flexible enough to accept
data from any operating system, be it consumer or commercial loan
information. We'll have small business reporting from five different banks.
        "Our CRA department is responsible for choosing the data base
analyzer, and senior management and our technology task force is in charge
of hiring a geocoder and purchasing loan collection systems, since
marketing will also use the information. We'll have some say in the latter,
but not a lot of input."
        "Then we'll make (CRA) lending decisions based on what the numbers
tell us. We would be doing the switch to data collection regardless, but
the merger will make the switch go faster, since we'll already be in a
change mode."
        "We might be hiring a couple of new people to do lending analysis
for the new CRA reg, the number will depend how much we can automate," said
Snow. "Our plan is not to grow our CRA department, since our CRA philosophy
is to keep the authority with the local state bank president or regional
director. We hesitate to hire too many CRA people because it is too easy to
offload the responsibility to them."

LARGE BANKS FACE RISK-BASED EXAMS

By the end of the first quarter, large national banks can expect to
be examined against nine risk factors identified by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency.
        The agency's new Supervision by Risk program, released Jan. 4 by
way of its "Large Bank Supervision Handbook," is for national banks with
total assets of at least $1 billion and for banks that are part of multi-
bank holding companies with at least one bank with assets of $1 billion or
more.
        Banks smaller than $1 billion in assets will be treated as
community banks and their new risk-focused exam guidelines are expected by
June.
        Intending to help banks manage risk to capital and earnings,
examiners will focus on credit, interest rate, liquidity, price, foreign
exchange, transaction, compliance, strategic planning and reputation.
Examiners will then put together a customer-tailored profile for each bank.
        While the OCC has been examining banks based on a variety of risks
for several years, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said, the new
handbook marks the national standardization of this process.
        "By delineating and defining each risk, bankers and examiners will,
for the first time, be able to use the same terminology when discussing
risk-related issues, and examiners will be more consistent in their
approach to similar institutions," said Ludwig.
        Supervision by Risk, announced by Ludwig last September, will be
part of banks' annual on-site safety and soundness exams and might also
occur throughout the year in various target examinations.
        If a risk is identified as an unwarranted problem, banks will be
expected to take steps to correct the problem, and examiners will monitor
their progress.
        The OCC has also provided a Risk Assessment System within the
handbook--a checklist within the nine risk categories, for banks' self-
assessment regarding the quantity of risk, the quality of risk management,
the level of supervisory concern, and the direction of risk.
        Within each risk category, examiners will identify whether risk is
increasing, stable, or decreasing in each bank. The new handbook also
emphasizes two-way communication about bank risk between bankers and
examiners.
        According to the handbook, each bank's individualized risk
management program should include identification, measurement, control, and
monitoring of risks.
        The OCC defines the nine risk categories as follows:
         Credit: The risk from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of
any contract or fail to perform as agreed. Credit risk also arises in
conjunction with selecting investment portfolio products, derivatives
trading partners, or foreign exchange counterparties; through country or
sovereign exposure; and through guarantor performance.
         Interest Rate Risk: The risk from movements in interest rates.
Should consider risk from both an accounting perspective (the effect on the
bank's accrual earnings) and the economic perspective (the effect on the
market value of the bank's portfolio equity). In some banks, interest rate
risk is captured under a broader category of market risk.
         Liquidity Risk: The risk from a bank's inability to meet its
obligations when they come due, without incurring unacceptable losses.
Includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding
sources; and the failure to address changes in market conditions that
affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in
value.
         Price Risk: The risk from changes in the value of portfolios of
financial instruments. This risk arises from market-making, dealing, and
position-taking activities in interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, and
commodities markets.
         Foreign Exchange Risk: The risk from movement of foreign exchange
rates, found in cross-border investing and operating activities. Market-
making and position-taking in foreign currencies should be captured under
price risk.
         Transaction Risk: The risk from problems with service or product
delivery--a function of internal controls, information systems, employee
integrity, and operating processes.
         Compliance Risk: The risk from violations or non-conformance with
laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards. Also
arises in situations where the laws or rules governing bank activities may
be ambiguous or untested. Compliance risk exposes the bank to fines, civil
money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts.
         Strategic Risk: The risk from adverse business decisions or
improper implementation of those decisions. This risk focuses on more than
an analysis of the written strategic plan; it focuses on how plans,
systems, and implementation affect the bank's franchise value.
         Reputation Risk: The risk from negative public opinion, affecting
the bank's ability to establish new relationships or services, or continue
servicing existing relationships. This risk can expose the bank to
litigation, financial loss, or damage to its reputation. Banks that
actively associate their name with products and services, such as with
fiduciary services, are more likely to have higher reputation risk
exposure.
        Copies of the Large Bank Handbook can be obtained by sending $6 per
booklet to the OCC, P.O. Box 70004, Chicago, Ill. 70673-0004. o
Mortgage Reg OKs Endorsements
        HUD-approved lenders participating in the Home Equity Conversion
Mortgage program can now process these loans without approval from the
department. HUD published its final rule Dec. 21 authorizing its approved
lenders to process HECM, or "reverse mortgage," loans under its direct
endorsement program.
        Lenders have been authorized to do so since Nov. 17, but the final
rule, which appears in the Federal Register, makes the change official; it
also completes one of many streamlining procedures HUD has initiated over
the last several months.
        The HECM interim rule was issued Aug. 16. Under the rule, any HECM
that lenders haven't issued a conditional commitment for is eligible for
direct endorsement. However, lenders with fewer than 50 HECMs insured
before Sept. 15, 1995, must submit five HECM test cases to the local HUD
office for pre-closing review prior to endorsement for insurance. If HUD
deems the underwriting of those test cases satisfactory, it will give the
lender unconditional authority to participate in the HECM-DE program. o
Fannie Joins Plan For American Indians
        Lenders will be able to begin offering mortgages to certain
American Indian tribes without the anxieties traditionally associated with
lending on tribal trust lands.
        Starting in January, Fannie will begin taking part in the Rural
Housing Service's Rural Housing Native American pilot, but will limit its
initial participation to 10 tribes.
        Fannie, which agreed to participate last summer and has committed
$20 million to the pilot, said these tribes were selected because they have
a good working relationship with the Rural Housing Service and the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, although it noted that 15 additional tribes may be added
later in the pilot.

FLORIDA TO REQUIRE CONTINUING ED. FOR SECURITIES

Mark up Florida as the first state to follow national continuing
education requirements. The Southeastern hotbed for bank securities
activities has become the first state in the nation to require continuing
education for securities dealers.
        A new administrative rule will go into effect for approximately
130,000 securities sales, trading, and investment banking personnel
registered in Florida who have direct client contact, and their immediate
supervisors.
        The rule requires Florida dealers and associated persons to comply
with the same requirements as members of all the national exchanges, the
National Association of Securities Dealers, the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board and the commodities regulatory agencies.
        The rule also exempts registered representatives with 10 years
experience and a flawless disciplinary history from the regulatory
requirements. Reps with the flawless disciplinary records make up about 17%
of Florida's securities sales industry, according to the state securities
regulator. However, all companies will be required to have a written plan

to develop and administer training programs tailored to specific training
needs regarding product lines and sales practices. The program went into
effect at the start of the new year.

BRIEFS


Fed OKs Chase Merger
Before Ending CRA Check
        The Federal Reserve on Jan. 5 approved the merger of Chemical
Banking Corp. with The Chase Manhattan Corp., a $10.4 billion deal that
will create the country's largest bank.
        Despite numerous complaints by community groups under the Community
Reinvestment Act, including two days of hearings in New York City in
November, the Fed didn't include any conditions in its order, other than
requiring the bank to fulfill an $18 billion CRA commitment it announced
last fall.
        The Fed said that both banks meet the credit needs of their
communities, citing Chemical's lead bank's two consecutive "Outstanding"
CRA grades and the Chase lead bank's recent "Satisfactory" ratings.
        Activists were especially angry that the Fed didn't wait for the
OCC to complete its CRA review of Chase before acting on the application.
Instead, it relied on a 1993 exam.
        The merger still has to be approved by the New York State Banking
Department. o
OCC To Relax Rules
On Community Work
        The OCC has proposed streamlining its CRA regulations in order to
spur more community investment by banks. Instead of the four-part test now
required of banks to prove that a community investment is in the public
interest, the OCC would only require banks to self-certify that investments
will benefit LMI families or small businesses.
        The proposal is in the Dec. 28 Fed Register; comments are due by
the beginning of March.
        "The proposed changes encourage national banks and community groups
to work together by allowing them the flexibility to determine how best to
structure their own partnerships in support of community development," said
Comptroller Eugene A. Ludwig.
        According to the OCC, national banks and their community partners
have invested a combined total of $2.16 billion in CDCs and community
development projects since December 1993, when the Community Development
regulation was adopted.
        The proposed revisions preserve the community development focus,
but would:
         Allow national banks greater flexibility to determine if
investments promote the public welfare by modifying the current public
welfare test;
         Retain the requirement that the investment primarily benefit LMI
persons, families, or small businesses, but make it clear that this benefit
can be provided in a variety of different ways;
         Simplify the self-certification and prior approval processes by
eliminating a current five-day OCC review period for investment proposals
that the OCC has previously approved for another bank;
         Eliminate the reg's list of eligible investment structures to
allow bank management flexibility to determine appropriate structures for
its investments.
        Also, the OCC adopted a final rule Dec. 27 allowing banks to
reinvest proceeds from these investments in any way they choose instead of
being required to reinvest in the community. o
Regulators Clarify
CRA Transition
        Federal banking regulators have clarified that once an institution
chooses or is forced to comply with the performance tests and standards of
the new CRA, it must comply with all of the requirements of the new rule.
(See Fed Register Dec. 20 and RCW Jan. 8 issue, p.2)
        The regulators gave this example: Small institutions will be
evaluated under the small bank performance standard beginning on Jan. 1,
1996. But for examiners to properly evaluate a bank, the institution must
also comply with other provisions of the new reg, including delineating an
assessment area, maintaining a public file and providing proper public
notice--requirements that don't under the transition rules, become
applicable until Jan. 1 or Jul 1, 1997.
        In another example, if a large bank elects to be evaluated under
the lending, investment and service tests before being required to do so in
July 1997, the bank would be required to comply on Jan. 1, 1996, with the
rule's other provisions.
        The regulators also intend to provide banks with guidance on CRA
strategic plans--the types of information to include and when and where to
file the plans--and how to qualify for wholesale bank status. OTS, for
example, plans to issue a CEO letter in the near future. o
Management Interlocks
Changes Proposed
        The financial institution regulatory agencies published a proposed
rule in the Federal Register Dec. 29 that revises their regulations on
management interlocks. Comments are due Feb. 27.
        In order to remove unnecessary obstacles faced by small banks
seeking to attract qualified management, the agencies propose to eliminate
the provision in the current rule that prohibits management interlocks
between an institution under $20 million in assets and a bank with assets
of $20 million or more that are both located in the same MSA. This change
is intended to provide small banks with a larger pool of qualified
candidates for management positions.
        The agencies aren't proposing any changes in the way the management
interlocks regulation is applied to banks in the same community, a smaller
geographic area than an MSA.

FANNIE SET TO BOOST LOAN LIMIT

Fannie Mae is on the verge of matching Freddie Mac's $4,150
conforming loan limit increase and will announce the decision to raise its
limit to $207,000 sometime within the next two weeks, according to mortgage
industry sources close to the agency.
        Fannie has received numerous requests from its seller/servicers to
raise its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effect
Jan. 1. The agency, which had maintained that it would fully consider the
views of its customers before rendering a decision, may make its
announcement as soon as Jan. 15.
        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last two
weeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of
(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and the
potential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fully
discuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders, but said those
details would be made available shortly.
        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgage
companies that have traditionally directed most of their business to Fannie
Mae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to take
advantage of Freddie's higher loan limit. Freddie Mac did not return
requests for comments.
        Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddie
raised its limits. But in talks with its seller/servicers over the last
month, he said Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over the
change in the marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knew
that to be a real possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting to
Freddie, "though it's too early to see it happening--I wouldn't be
surprised."

1996: YEAR OF THE US INVASION?

AT THE start of the new year it is perhaps appropriate to consider what
1996 will bring to the world of retail banking.

The year 1995 will probably be remembered for the extraordinary wave of
mergers and acquisitions in the US and, to a lesser extent, in the UK.

In the US, wholesale consolidation of branch networks is under way,
accelerated by the revolution in retail delivery systems. Increasing
liberalisation of interstate branching laws also means that truly
national banks are emerging in that country - something beginning to be
reflected in the marketing campaigns of major banks.

State barriers have not proved an obstacle to the major credit card
banks in the US, which have seen their sophisticated marketing
techniques rewarded by extraordinary returns in their home market.
Latterly, these banks have become increasingly visible abroad,
particularly in Europe, where the credit card market remains full of
potential compared with the saturated US scene.

While, in the short-term, some major conventional US banks may be
preoccupied with effecting mergers in their home market, the
indications are that once the domestic scene has settled down they and
other organisations will surely turn to foreign markets. Already names
such as Citibank, Fidelity Investments and Merrill Lynch International
Bank have accumulated substantial foreign business.

US investment banks have for decades followed their corporate clients
abroad; 1996 may be the year when the revolution in delivery systems
will enable their retail brothers to begin to emulate them in selected
markets and sectors.

NYCE MOVES INTO HOME BANKING

NYCE WILL become the first US regional ATM network to announce a full-
service platform for electronic home banking and bill payment. NYCE's
announcement in late December follows a year of new home banking
launches by some 30 large banks, most of which are using personal
finance manager home banking packages from Microsoft and Intuit as a
home banking interface. In addition, Chicago-based regional ATM network
Cash Station has recently announced an outsourcing alliance with
processor EDS for the provision of home banking services.

NYCE, which is based in Hackensack, New Jersey, plans to build its own
home banking processing platform within the NYCE processing system,
which will support home banking and bill payment transactions conducted
over touch-tone phones. Calling its approach "home banking `lite'",
NYCE will offer a low-cost plain-vanilla home banking service for
customers who do not need advanced graphical and consultative functions
that PC personal finance manager (PFM) software packages now provide.

But NYCE's system will also accommodate more sophisticated PFM- driven
home banking programs now offered by many large US banks. NYCE also
plans to pursue state-of-the-art home banking features, like electronic
presentment, which would allow utilities to deliver bills
electronically, as well as alliances with other financial services
providers like insurance firms.

NYCE's technical platform will be based on Tandem fault-tolerant
processing hardware, similar to the system NYCE now uses to run its
core ATM and POS networks, which processed some 350 million
transactions in 1995. Vicorp, a Connecticut-based technology provider,
has already installed "device-independent" software that will manage
interactions, via telephone, screenphones, ATMs and PCs.

The payments infrastructure and experience of regional networks like
NYCE may allow them to offer more cost-efficient services to smaller
institutions, with start-up costs as low as $10,000. Intuit has
recently announced its intention to team up with regional networks to
provide smaller institutions with affordable home banking services. For
its part, NYCE has begun negotiations intended to bring on other
regional networks as equity partners into its new home banking venture.

BANK INSURANCE REFORM STYMIED

AN IMPASSE over new bank insurance legislation has all but killed
prospects for repeal in 1996 of the Glass Steagall Act, the legislation
which imposed "fire walls" between the US commercial banking and
securities industries in 1933. Although an agreement is still possible,
repeated attempts to bridge the conflicting interests of the commercial
banking and insurance agents' lobbies failed in 1995, as they did in
1991, leaving further deregulation of US bank insurance in the
uncertain hands of courts and regulators. The result may be that, while
the Supreme Court and the Office of the Controller of the Currency
(OCC) may achieve some piecemeal deregulation of US bank insurance in
the next few years, US banks will still have to cope with a complex and
difficult regulatory climate.

In December, House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach floated a new
amendment that would strip the "retirement CD" of federal deposit
insurance, which insurers are demanding, if they would agree to abide
by the upcoming decision by the Supreme Court on the right of Barnett
Banks to sell insurance nationally. If Barnett won, all banks would be
able to follow its example, but if Barnett lost, Congress would impose
a five-year moratorium on the expansion of US bank insurance powers.
Both the American Bankers Association and the Independent Insurance
Agents of America opposed Leach's latest compromise.

The Supreme Court's decision on Barnett - which is expected this spring
- could lead to significant deregulation in its own right. The court is
widely expected to uphold Barnett's right to sell insurance nationally
from small towns of under 5,000, owing to a peculiar "small-town
exemption" found in the US Banking Act of 1865. But US bank insurance
would still be regulated at the state level, where local insurance
lobbies are extremely influential. A favourable Supreme Court decision
could also spur the OCC to extend national bank insurance powers beyond
annuities the OCC sanctioned in 1991, to life and other insurance
products.

BANNER YEAR FOR US MERGERS

NINETEEN NINETY five closed out with two significant US bank mergers,
Fleet Financial's acquisition of Natwest Bancorp and Bank of Boston's
purchase of BayBanks (see below). The deals highlighted the rapid
consolidation of the US banking industry. Five years ago, five major
institutions vied for market share in New England, but today just two
banks dominate the region. Fleet and Bank of Boston now control a third
of all deposits in New England, and account for 37 percent of deposits
in Massachusetts and 55 percent in the Boston metropolitan area.

The two deals brought the total value of 1995 US banking mergers and
acquisitions to $73.2 billion, more than the totals for the three
previous years combined, according to SNL Securities in
Charlottesville, Virginia. As a result of 1995 merger activity, the
combined assets of the top 10 US retail banks increased 23 percent to
$1.6 trillion (see chart). The top ten 1995 deals, which involved such
institutions as Chase Manhattan, First Union and First Chicago, were
valued at $47.5 billion, or nearly two- thirds the year's total.

Analysts listed three developments which drove 1995's merger boom:
national banking and branching legislation passed in 1994, flat
industry revenues which spurred large players to pursue technology-
driven consolidation, and a bull stock market which boosted bank shares
and allowed banks to pay for acquisitions with their own stock. All
three factors are still very much in force, and analysts expect bank
mergers to continue, especially as large acquiring institutions like
NationsBank and Bank of America enter the merger arena.

BANK OF BOSTON ACQUIRES BAYBANKS

IN A stock deal valued at $2 billion, Bank of Boston agreed to acquire
cross-town rival BayBanks, creating the 15th-largest US commercial bank
with $57.7 billion in assets, and the second- largest New England
institution, after Providence-based Fleet Financial, with $90.0 billion
in assets.

The acquisition will combine BayBanks' consumer business with Bank of
Boston's extensive commercial operations, giving it a 27 percent retail
share in Massachusetts and strengthening its regional position against
Fleet. The deal will also balance the international businesses of Bank
of Boston, a quarter of whose revenue now comes from volatile Latin
America, with an expanded US regional retail franchise.

In an unusual move, all Bank of Boston retail branches will now use the
name of BayBanks, which Bank of Boston chief executive Charles Gifford
called "the top consumer bank in the country", while the holding
company, with its commercial and foreign subsidiaries, will use the
Bank of Boston name. BayBanks' chairman, William Crozier, will become
Bank of Boston's chairman and will continue to direct retail operations
until his retirement in 1998, while Gifford will become chief executive
of the new institution.

Bank of Boston said that the acquisition, which is priced at 2.2 times
BayBanks' book value, will save $190 million in expenses, or 11 percent
of the two banks' combined cost base. Bank of Boston, which will take a
one-time restructuring charge of $140 million, expects to see $50
million in additional annual revenue, or 7.7 percent of current
earnings, after 18 months. The merger will eliminate some 2,000 jobs,
or 8 percent of the banks' combined work force, half by attrition and
half by lay-offs.

FLEET BUYS NATWEST USA

IN LATE December, Fleet Financial of Providence, Rhode Island, agreed
to acquire NatWest Bancorp, the US commercial banking operation of
National Westminster PLC, in a deal valued at $3.3 billion.

The deal will expand Fleet's operations beyond its bastion of New
England, by adding 310 branches that will strengthen Fleet's presence
in New York State and give it a foothold in New Jersey. While many
analysts praised the deal's geographic logic and its low price of 1.1
times book value, others questioned Fleet's ability to absorb NatWest
following its acquisition in early 1995 of Shawmut National and its $36
billion in assets (see RBI 321). Fleet will now become the ninth-
largest US commercial bank with $90 billion in assets.

National Westminster had originally put its US unit up for auction in
September, asking $4 billion in cash, a difficult hurdle for US banks,
which almost always finance large acquisitions with stock. Fleet solved
this problem with an unusual deal structure: Fleet will pay $2.7
billion in cash up front, and another $560 million in "earn-out" from
NatWest New York's revenues over the next eight years. Fleet will also
issue $600 million in preferred stock, half of which will go to
National Westminster, and $400 million in debt securities.

The deal marks the end of National Westminster's 25-year attempt to
establish a beachhead in the volatile US banking market. Before the
deal, NatWest Bancorp had become the largest foreign- owned commercial
bank in the US, with $31.1 billion in assets ($13 billion of which will
be sold by Fleet to finance the acquisition). But the bank failed to
create sufficient scale, and blundered into buying several New Jersey
banks before the US real estate market collapse in the early 1990s.
National Westminster ended by spending a total of $3.3 billion buying
its US franchise and then bailing out its loan losses. National
Westminster is expected to use the cash from the sale to acquire a US
asset management firm.

BRANCHES STILL PROVIDE MOST REVENUE

NEW RESEARCH by First Manhattan Consulting Group suggests that most US
retail banking profits come from customers who do all their business at
branches and that retail customers who rely exclusively or primarily on
remote delivery still represent a small, if strategically significant,
segment.

Culling data from five major US retail institutions, First Manhattan
found that 40 percent of retail customers rely exclusively on branches,
48 percent use branches and self-service systems, 8 percent use
branches for deposits only, 2 percent use mostly self-service, and the
remaining 2 percent conduct all business through remote delivery
systems.

But the 40 percent who only use branches contribute 60 percent of
retail earnings, while the 10 percent who use self-service except for
deposits contribute 20 percent of profits. The "mixed channel users"
are the least profitable group, representing 50 percent of all retail
accounts but only 20 percent of retail profits.

"We had better be careful in any attempts to radically downsize the
branch system," First Manhattan president James McCormick told an
audience of retail bankers at the recent Retail Delivery Systems
conference in Atlanta. The branch system continues to offer commercial
banks a strategic stronghold in their struggle against non-banks, he
said.

McCormick noted that "mixed-channel" users are the toughest to serve
profitably, and that the best solution is to push these customers
toward remote systems in a way that assures that"self- service
substitutes for branches, not complements them". A number of US
institutions, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Keycorp, have
pursued this goal by offering low-cost ATM accounts to customers who
agree to use only remote media for routine transactions. But McCormick
said this approach should be evaluated carefully, lest banks forfeit
valuable transaction revenue.

THE BENCHMARKING IMPERATIVE

Richard McManus explains the rationale behind benchmarking and suggests
that bankers have much to learn from both within and outside their
industry

RETAIL BANKS facing increased competition from both traditional and new
rivals are looking for methods to improve the value proposition that
they present to current and prospective customers. As competition
ratchets up those that do not keep pace are doomed. Discriminating
customers will take flight, opting for providers that devise product
and service combinations which more closely match requirements.

In an increasingly competitive environment it is crucial to have a
clear vision of the future and a sure touch in managing change.
Benchmarking can help in both regards if it is properly undertaken.

It helps an organisation shape its future strategy and build necessary
capabilities on the basis of an understanding of what has worked for
other successful organisations. It involves learning from the
experience of others, rather than solely by doing and making one's own
mistakes.

`Piggy-backing' on the success of others makes particular sense when
agility gives an edge in the marketplace. Customers spoilt for choice
are demanding, and winning their support is the aim of each market
participant. But with the pace of change increasing `time-to-market'
also matters. And to create motivating customer propositions more
quickly there is merit in systematically trawling for best practice
both within and outside the financial services sector.

Benchmarking can support step-change improvements in the customer value
proposition. One of the most significant barriers to innovation is past
success. This gives rise to organisational arrogance which takes the
form "we always do things in such and such a way" or "we know best".

Innovative ideas may be dismissed with an assertion that current
success confirms there is no need to change. Or, equally, inflexible
employees may suggest a new approach `invented elsewhere' simply will
not work.

Benchmarking, at the activity level, can highlight organisational
arrogance. But, at the same time, it can kick-start innovation by
generating concrete examples of best practice. Such examples show
innovation to be the prerequisite of survival rather than unnecessary
or infeasible.

Retail banks committed to learning from others can look for creative
approaches which build customer value advantages vis-a- vis competition
without sacrificing speed. The senior management team, armed with an
acute appreciation of evolving customer needs and changing competitor
capabilities, should seek out proven approaches which can be adapted.
The customer-driven retail bank cannot afford either to stand still or
waste time re-inventing the wheel.

Inevitable popularity

It is not surprising that businesses `catch the benchmarking bug' in
competitive marketplaces. In essence, properly undertaken benchmarking
gives senior management the wherewithal to overcome organisational
inertia. It entails the adaptation of demonstrable success to sustain a
customer proposition which is preferred over and above the alternatives
offered by local competition. It generates information which helps
management improve customer value and create defensible advantage.

Benchmarking output is, therefore, an essential raw material of
successful competitive strategy. And in an increasingly international
marketplace the scope of a benchmarking study must be global.

In Strategic Benchmarking, Gregory Watson has charted the evolution of
benchmarking as a developing science. He argues that there are five
generations.

In the `first generation' it is nothing more than reverse engineering.
This reflects the fact that benchmarking became popular initially in
the fields of civil engineering and computer hardware and software. The
challenge was to better the functionality offered by a competitor
product.

In the `second generation' `competitive benchmarking' involves moving
beyond product-oriented examples to include comparisons of the
processes that lie behind the products. The point is that a successful
competitor needs to know both what the market requires and how to
provide it cost effectively.

In the `third generation' `process benchmarking' represents a natural
progression. Enlightened organisations come to realise that the how is
often more important than the what. Product innovation can give
competitive advantage but this can be easily and rapidly copied. But it
is often far more difficult to identify and replicate the processes
which the innovator has pioneered. These processes are not in the
public domain.

In the `third generation' Watson asserts "quality leaders recognised
that they could learn more easily from companies outside their industry
than from competitive studies".

There are two reasons for this claim. The first is that it is often
difficult to share information within an industry without prompting
concerns over anti-competitive behaviour or stalemate competition. The
second is that information from outside an industry often provides more
insight because it forces management to think from first principles
rather than implement incremental improvements. In summary, those
looking outside their immediate industry can expect a willingness to
share information and a freshness of view.

In the `fourth generation' `strategic benchmarking' represents a
further increase in sophistication. Watson suggests it is"a systematic
process for evaluating alternatives, implementing strategies and
improving performance by understanding and adapting strategies from
external partners who participate in an ongoing business alliance".

In essence, it involves a commitment to learn how the business can be
re-engineered to support better customer value propositions. It entails
root and branch change rather than minor improvement and, as a result,
it is likely to give a competitive edge.

Watson argues that the `fifth generation' will be `global
benchmarking'. This will entail businesses scouring the world for best
practices which can valuably be applied to improve their own customer
value propositions. Leading-edge businesses already adopt this
approach.

In planning a global consumer financial services strategy a few years
ago, GE Capital decided to benchmark (among others) American Express,
Citicorp, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, MasterCard, Barclays Bank and AIG. The
point is that a parochial perspective leaves an institution vulnerable.
It is ill-prepared for competition from powerful traditional and non-
traditional rivals in other geographic areas.

The popularity of benchmarking today probably in part reflects the way
in which this practice has evolved. In Watson's `first generation' it
represents nothing more than straightforward competitor analysis. And
no business in a competitive marketplace can argue against this.

But by the `fifth generation' benchmarking has become something quite
different. It is all about trawling internationally to establish which
best practices will underpin motivating customer propositions. It takes
account of the fact that customers are the arbiters of commercial
success. And it recognises that a parochial orientation will not prompt
necessary innovation.

In spite of the way in which benchmarking has evolved, however, there
can be no doubt that even institutions new to the practice need to come
to terms with the fifth generation. It is futile to plan a gradual
migration from first to fifth generation behaviour. An institution
following this course in a competitive market will not survive long
enough to complete it.

Activities and Processes

Benchmarking is predicated upon the notion that all businesses,
including the retail banking business, can be broken down into a series
of activities and processes. This is significant for two reasons. The
first is that some activities and processes, are more important than
others. The second is that comparative measurement both within and
outside an industry sector is possible at this level.

The critical activities and processes are those that add most customer
value. Superiority in undertaking these will lead to significant
comparative advantage in a competitive marketplace. And an organisation
learning from international best practice at the activity and process
level will be capable of world class performance.

So what are the activities and processes that make up the retail
banking business? One possible diagrammatic representation of the
activities is shown in Figure 2. But the processes that lie behind
these activities are necessarily in a state of flux as customers'
tastes change, new technology becomes available and competitor
innovation makes an impact.

In the product management area, for example, design and packaging used
to be all that was required. When a competitor came out with a new
product that met with success in the marketplace others moved quickly
to copy it. But this is where the problem lies.

It is impossible to build a worthwhile advantage vis-a-vis competition
when emulation is relatively easy. And, to use Watson's terminology, as
first and second generation benchmarking became prevalent, product
management needed to evolve. It is now more a question of targeting
particular customer segments by devising a suitable mix of products.

The optimum mix reflects the long-term mission of a retail bank rather
than the recent market success of a local rival. This is important
because it demonstrates that a product range which suits one
institution may be completely inappropriate for another which has a
different customer focus. And as the European enthusiasm for allfinanz
spreads throughout the world it is wise to question whether it is
necessary to add insurance to traditional retail banking products.

The answer depends on the customer focus and whether the retail bank
committed to allfinanz is in the vanguard or merely copying successful
local rivals.

In essence, some but not all customers will buy a comprehensive range
of financial products from one supplier because they lack the
confidence or inclination to shop around. And allfinanz first-movers
will tend to win these customers leaving late converts with the
unenviable task of trying to change the buying behaviour of other
customer segments.

Against this backdrop, it must be wise to benchmark product management
in allfinanz first-movers and to review critically the market response
to late converts.

So much for product management. The marketing and sales activity is
similarly in a state of flux. In the past, this required little more
than some corporate image work and the dissemination of product
information. But enlightened retail banks are now making sure their
marketeers focus on building meaningful customer brands.

As previous issues of CEO Confidential have argued this involves
positioning products and services in such a way as to ensure they are
preferred by customers. Effective brands improve profitability because
the associated benefits of increased market share or superior price
realisation outweigh the costs of brand creation. It is worth noting
that the most profitable retail banks often achieve this position by
charging high prices. This may reflect an uncompetitive market or the
marketeers earning their keep.

It seems that marketing and sales will be more about sophisticated
customer segmentation and carefully tailored communication in the
future. The segmentation will compartmentalise customers on the basis
of buying behaviour and motivation.

It is possible to address such coherent groups in a persuasive way
because they act and think alike. The marketing and sales initiatives
which result from this approach are a far cry from the general
corporate positioning statements on which too many retail banks
currently rely.

When it comes to benchmarking there is no shortage of organisations
that are committed to sophisticated customer segmentation and the
associated tailored communication. In the finance sector, the credit
card companies embracing affinity group marketing lead the way. But the
airline and automotive industries, among others, can also provide
valuable insights.

Distribution management is probably one of the most critical activities
for retail banks today. This reflects the fact that convenience so
often underpins the financial institution selection decision. And
convenience implies ease of access.

In the past, retail banks with a comprehensive branch network were
preferred because branch-based distribution was the norm. Where
alternatives existed either few customer were aware of them or most
were disinclined to use them. But this is all changing.

Direct delivery channels, particularly those using the conventional
phone, are in the ascendancy. And, as traditional retail banks launch
their telephone banking operations, they legitimise and promote this
change in delivery emphasis. This is all well and good but, in a sense,
retail banks with extensive branch networks are playing into the hands
of non-bank rivals without a bricks and mortar heritage.

This is not to say that turning one's back on direct delivery is a
rational choice. But the key distribution management issue facing
traditional retail banks is how to ensure a smooth transition from the
delivery emphasis of the past to that suitable in the future.

The critical concern for the branch-reliant is how to achieve a high
branch utilisation while focusing attention on new delivery channels.
Natural pressure to justify the overhead of new delivery channels can
lead to existing customers being encouraged to migrate from branch
delivery. As a result, an unchanged branch overhead becomes more
burdensome. New efficient costs are overlaid on inefficient costs. But
the net result is a worsening cost position, particularly when
cannibalisation is the norm and, therefore, capacity utilisation in
each channel is poor.

Against this backdrop it is wise to benchmark those institutions that
prove themselves skilful in both managing capacity utilisation and
matching delivery channel to customer segment.

Wells Fargo is an example in the finance sector of a retail bank that
has become more reliant on ATMs and supermarket branches without being
encumbered with the costs of the traditional branch network. But there
are also lessons from other retail businesses.

Some department stores have embraced the shop-within-a-shop concept
where concessions are given to specialist retailers in order to bolster
sales per outlet. Other retailers have built complementary mail order
businesses without wholesale outlet closure. And there are examples in
the restaurant and leisure business of one operator running competing
concepts with distinct delivery formats.

In the finance sector it is wrong to think about delivery as being
completely separate from the product proposition. Quite the reverse is
the case. There must be a fit between the customer segments, the
product and the delivery channel. But the same is true for other retail
concepts that seek to build a brand image.

The delivery approach is an integral part of the brand. And more and
more retail banks will come to realise that different delivery channels
are best targeted at different customer segments.

In the long term, it is probable that many will seek to make different
product and delivery combinations into distinct brands. They will
follow a trail blazed by businesses in other sectors and as a result
benchmarking will help.

In the customer service area the transition which will be important for
most retail banks is from uniform service to customised service. The
emphasis in recent years has been upon introducing and policing higher
service standards. Many banks have recognised that failing to make the
grade in customer service is an unforgivable failing in the service
business. But the desire to improve service has led to inflexible and
sometimes inappropriate standards. Service means different things to
different people and, worse still, it means different things at
different times.

Bearing in mind this and the cost of service provision the astute
retail bank will strive to match service performance to the customer
and the occasion. Those adopting this approach are treating customer
service as a profit rather than a cost centre.

From a benchmarking point of view it is likely that in the financial
services sector the direct providers will make the running. They are
able to make the notion of the `segment of one' an operational reality.

But outside financial services there will be valuable lessons from the
hotel, airline and restaurant business. Each of these grapple with the
problem of treating different customers in different ways within the
same delivery channel. And each suffer from the difficulty faced by
retail banks where the delivery channel is an integral part of the
overall proposition.

In processing and administration the retail bank emphasis is going to
shift away from securing back-office efficiency towards tasks which
improve customer information and facilitate risk management. It is not
that efficiency is a bad thing. It is a prerequisite, but it is also
insufficient for success.

The challenge facing retail banks is not only to do things efficiently
but to do the right things. And the learning organisation realises that
day-to-day interactions with existing customers can provide a wealth of
information to help in customer retention and customer acquisition
initiatives.

Not to put too fine a point on it, failure to build a `feedback loop'
from arrears management to marketing is pure folly unless the aim is to
keep the arrears department busy!

From a benchmarking point of view it is likely that the credit card
companies will pioneer state-of-art processing and administration in
the finance sector. They already ensure that prospective profitability
drives marketing initiatives and they are sophisticated in risk
management.

But outside the finance sector there will be valuable lessons to be
learned from direct response marketing companies and the mail order
industry. And it is possible that government bureaucracies facing
pressures to cut costs may also give some pointers to retail banks. In
many countries the tax authorities, for example, have simplified
administrative tasks and shifted much of the burden onto their clients.
Those embarking on re-engineering of the back-office should take note.

In customer information the retail bank emphasis is going to be upon
garnering the information which is necessary for customer segmentation
and marketing purposes. This will certainly represent far more than
basic demographic information and details on who holds which products.

Information will include the kind of data which enables a retail bank
to cluster customers into groups which are homogenous both in terms of
products purchased and motivating factors. And it will involve an
assessment of profitability by customer and segment.

The key point is that it is such customer information which will help
senior management determine the long-term strategy for the retail bank.
As a result, customer information helps shape the other activities
which make up the retail bank and redefine the important processes. In
company jargon, the organisation becomes customer-driven.

From a benchmarking point of view retail banks and credit card
companies that have got to the bottom of customer profitability will be
well worth studying. And, as with processing and administration, direct
response marketing companies and the mail order industry will provide
some pointers.

In conclusion

Benchmarking on a global basis provides valuable input to the strategy
formulation process. It is not done once and for all but should rather
be a continuous process. This reflects the fact that rivals will
undoubtedly copy success.

A key task for senior management is to set for the organisation
challenging objectives that stand the test of time. This involves
striving for superiority and not purely in those activities and
processes which have the greatest impact upon customer value. The
emphasis selected will reflect the customer focus, the organisational
heritage and the anticipated competitor approach. The benchmarking
questions to be answered are quite simply:

What do we benchmark?  Who do we benchmark?  How do we act on the basis
of benchmarking insight in our organisation?

HONG KONG: COUNTDOWN TO DESTINY

As the year 1997 approaches Andrew Moody assesses the sentiment among
Hong Kong's retail bankers

LIKE MANY other sectors in Hong Kong, retail banking has thrived on the
colony's seemingly never-ending era of economic growth. Over the past
ten years the economy has sustained annual GDP growth of 6 percent.

The main consequence of this - the colony's 6 million people growing
ever wealthier and more middle class - has proved a rich seam for Hong
Kong's retail banks.

These banks, which make up around 30 of the 180 licensed banks in Hong
Kong, have enjoyed levels of profitability which their western
counterparts could only dream of.

Banking profits have been sustained even against a background of zero
real interest rates (the prime rate of 9 percent remains identical to
last year's annual inflation) and narrow spreads.

But as 1997 looms large, uncertainty over Chinese intentions is having
a damaging and uncertain effect on the market. A report to be published
later this month by the Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that
growth will fall dramatically from 4.5 percent in 1995 to 3.5 percent
this year and just 1.7 percent in 1997.

This could prove damaging for retail banks which, so far, have managed
to avoid large-scale branch closures and panic consolidation which now
so pre-occupies western banks. It may also bring with it bad customers -
 a rarity in Hong Kong where getting into financial difficulties
involves Chinese "loss of face".

Alex Au, vice chairman and chief executive of Hang Seng Bank, the
second largest locally incorporated bank with 138 branches, recognises
the problem.

"The general impression in Hong Kong is that the industry is confronted
by a less favourable trading environment," he says. "The feeling is
that a period of high growth has passed and that a period of
consolidation will follow. But let's not forget that, although growth
may be slowing in the industry, banks in Hong Kong are still among the
most profitable in the world."

If ever the idea meeteth the man then retail banking and the people of
Hong Kong are one of life's happy coincidences. Unlike in the west,
where single bank relationships are the norm, Hong Kong residents have
on average 2.4 accounts in 1.9 banks. This is a territory in which even
little old ladies play the currency markets with their nest egg and
expect their bank to provide them with foreign exchange deposit
accounts with which they can swap currencies at a whim.

Another headache for the banks is the almost frenetic use of the system
by individual customers. The Hongkong Bank estimates its customers
interact with it on average an astonishing 16 times a month.

The precise size of the retail banking market is difficult to gauge,
but $HK 2.1 trillion ($290 billion) is held as deposits with licensed
banks of which savings deposits comprise $HK 418 billion and current
accounts just $HK 115 billion.

Current accounts play a relatively insignificant role in Hong Kong
retail banking with banks regarding deposit accounts and mortgages as
the core product on which to initiate a relationship with a customer.
The newspapers, both Chinese and English, are full of advertisements
for the latest interest rates on deposit account and mortgage products.

"What you want is someone to come in and take a mortgage from you. You
have then got them for at least nine or ten years," says David K.P. Li,
deputy chairman and chief executive of the Bank of East Asia.

"They would typically be a young couple in their late 20s or early 30s
borrowing between $HK1.5 million and $HK1.8 million to buy a 900 square
foot apartment, the repayments on which would set them back around 60
percent of their income. You can then sell them decoration loans,
credit cars, overdrafts and help them with hire purchase for a car," he
adds.

Ironically, in a city brimming with local entrepreneurial talent, the
main product innovators in Hong Kong retail banking are the foreign
banks.

Inextricably linked to the colony, Hongkong Bank and Standard Chartered
wear thin the definition of foreign, but they dominate the market along
with Citibank and the Hang Seng Bank, the latter part of the Hongkong
Bank since the mid-1960s but separately listed and, perhaps to a lesser
degree, the Bank of East Asia.

They have led the way with smart cards, foreign currency deposit
accounts (targeted at mid-range customers in Hong Kong) and tax loans,
a very popular product in a territory where there is no PAYE.

This is something readily conceded by smaller local banks such as the
Dah Sing Bank, a traditional trade finance bank which only moved into
retail in the last few years.

"Basically, I would agree that the bigger foreign banks have dominated
the market. It has been difficult for the smaller banks because of lack
of resources and the cost of technology, but I sense that things are
beginning to change," says Derek Wong, Dah Sing's head of retail.

A yet to be proven catalyst to greater competition could be the slow
but still partial demise of the Hong Kong interest rate cartel which
began two years ago.

Under the cartel, all deposit interest rates used to be fixed weekly by
the Hong Kong Association of Banks. In October 1994 time deposits fixed
for more than one month were deregulated and in January last year it
was left to individual banks to set their rates for deposits over seven
days.

The larger banks remain unhappy about the break-up. According to recent
analysis, it has led to a 5 percent drop in deposits as a result of
falling interest rates.

Hang Seng's Au is worried it has created another uncertainty in the run-
up to 1997. "Although the industry is not against deregulation there is
a concern it has affected bank profitability and that some banks may
compensate by writing more risky loans," he says.

The smaller players believe it has brought much needed competition to
the market, allowing them to buy market share by setting their own
interest rates.

"The status quo ante made no sense really. Deregulation offers more
opportunity to the medium-sized banks. We can offer lower interest
rates as a way of competing against the bigger players. I believe we
can also react faster than the local banks," says Sergio Rial, the
Brazilian general manager of Dutch bank ABN AMRO in Hong Kong.

Western banks have a lot to learn from the luxurious and airy design of
many of the branches in Hong Kong. In a place where land is more
expensive than anywhere else in the world there is no point in building
a shed. Customers too are treated with great courtesy in the banks,
something not typical in the retail business across the whole of Hong
Kong.

"In the UK if you go into a branch to make a transaction, say deposit a
cheque, all you will get is a stamped stub. It astonishes me how people
will deposit large sums of money and virtually have no proof of doing
so. In Hong Kong, the customer will get a printed out receipt precisely
recording the transaction," says Eric Tai, senior executive, retail,
marketing and planning, Hongkong Bank.

The ATM is king in Hong Kong with many more machines per 10,000 of the
population than in the US or the UK. You cannot, in fact, pass an ATM
in Hong Kong without seeing a large gathering of people, many seemingly
not queuing to use it, but perhaps taking time out to worship Mammon,
surely Hong Kong's truest god. Customers not only draw money out at
ATMs but also pay their utility bills with the use of a swipe card.

The love of gadgetry of all kinds would seemingly make Hong Kong ripe
for a direct banking revolution. The fall-off in economic growth would
also seem to necessitate that the banks move faster towards automation
in order to cut costs and retain profit margins. Yet Hong Kong's moves
towards direct delivery are perhaps more primitive than their western
counterparts.

The leading banks have offered telephone banking since 1990 but it is
still very much an in-branch service. The nearest one gets to a UK-
style First Direct operation is a voice response computer at the other
end of the line.

A key reason why the direct banking has not swept the colony is the
problem of getting phone operatives in a land of virtually full
employment.

As Sergio Rial of ABN AMRO explains: "The real barrier to telephone
banking developing in Hong Kong is that professional people don't want
to sit behind a phone all day and in this place they have a right to
choose. Skilled people want to do creative jobs, not pay people's
utility bills and check passwords," he says. "It is one of those things
that has not really caught on and it is presenting real difficulties
for the banks.

"I think what will happen here is that there will be a sudden quantum
leap from ordinary branch banking to PC home-based banking, largely by-
passing the telephone banking stage. This will satisfy the enthusiasm
for gadgetry among Hong Kong people and solve the cost headache for the
banks."

Citibank insists its telephone banking operation has been a success
with its customers. "We have achieved 90 percent satisfaction from our
customers compared to 82 percent from our normal branch banking
business," says Peter Wong, the bank's vice president of global
consumer banking in Hong Kong.

Many of the banks have not as yet embarked on major branch closure
programmes. Hongkong Bank has closed just 20 in the last two years
bringing its total down to 220; the Dah Sing Bank has reduced its
number over the same period from 53 to 43; Citibank has closed mainly
smaller branches, and most of the other banks have only made limited
cutbacks.

There have, however, been moves to segment the market by developing
specific branches for different categories of customers.

The most marked move in this direction has come from the Hongkong Bank,
which now has three different types of branches - select branches for
upmarket customers, standard branches for regular customers and day and
night automated branches.

"Competition for profitable retail customers in the territory has
rarely been keener. We have responded by introducing a strategy that
involves segmenting the way we serve the market," says Hongkong's Eric
Tai. "The select branches will guarantee that we can provide our valued
upmarket customers with the highest quality of service."

The Bank of East Asia services its upmarket customers by delivering
services direct to a customer's office or home. "It is a far more
subtle way of dealing with major clients and, I believe, just as
effective," says Dr Li.

One of the most controversial aspects of banking in Hong Kong is the
stranglehold the larger banks have over the Hong Kong Association of
Banks (HKAB).

It is chaired in rotation by Standard Chartered, Hongkong Bank and now
the Bank of China (which began its first term of office this year).

Many other banks have restricted rights of membership to its committee
and yet the HKAB is all powerful, still setting regulated interest
rates, policing the system and acting as a clearing house.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the supposed central bank, does not
even issue notes (still done by the major banks) and is not even a
banker to the Government.

Dr Li, who apart from running the Bank of East Asia is the sole
financial institution representative on the colony's main law making
body, the Legislative Council or Legco, insists the system must change.

"The whole system is very colonial. It is what Singapore was like 45
years ago. The Hong Kong Association of Banks is an old boys' club with
the chairmanship running between three banks," he says. "The Governor
Chris Patten talks about democracy, but we have one of the most
undemocratic institutions on our own doorstep. The whole system
encourages `yes' people. I certainly thought the cartel worked against
the interests of the consumer."

It is a view echoed by Peter Wong, banking director of Citibank, which
does not always get its own seat on the HKBA committee: "It is not a
level playing field. The HKBA should incorporate more players so the
flow of information can be better."

Li also insists that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is
still the lender of last resort and, as such, exerts too much control
over the system. He wants the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to assume
that role officially.

"The colony must have an official lender of last resort. At present,
the smaller banks may have a credit line of say $HK30 million from the
Hongkong Bank and if it exceeds that it may get charged 3 percent above
prime which is very steep," he says.

Hong Kong unlike other banking centres has not yet seen a period of
major consolidation between banks.

The main highlights have been the purchase by the Dah Sing Bank of the
Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Bank from the Hong Kong government
and then three years ago its acquisition of the Wingon bank from the
Hang Seng Bank. The Dao Heng, the third largest local bank, bought the
Hang Lung Bank in 1989 and the Overseas Trust Bank in 1993.

Opinion is divided as to whether harsher economic conditions will lead
to a spate of more substantial mergers.

 Dr Li again: "I think consolidation will come. I think there are two
or three banks here that would benefit from merger, although I believe
there is a cultural resistance to it. A lot of the local banks are
family controlled and Chinese people don't like to lose face by seeing
their family's heritage being taken over."

Banks, which have stayed clear of retail for generations, are now
moving into the market.

The Dah Sing Bank, traditionally a trade finance bank, has come up with
some of the most aggressive retail products in the marketplace.

One is a credit card which has a generous cash bonus point scheme that
effectively reduces the monthly rate of interest on borrowings to 1.5
percent, significantly less than the 2 percent to 2.5 percent market
average.

Competitors say the card has flopped and is losing money, something
which Derek Wong head of retail denies. "We have built up a lot of
business over the past 18 months with this card. We had a lot of
initial free advertising because it was such a revolutionary new
product," he says.

ABN AMRO, one of the oldest established international banks in Hong
Kong, has also been a late entrant to retail, although it is perhaps
the first non-British European bank to do so. It has also gone in hard
on price undercutting other banks, particularly in mortgages.

General manager Rial insists the strategy has worked, claiming that
retail banking had grown from nil to 30 percent of profits of the bank
in Hong Kong in three years: "It has proved to be a very good move. We
have a leaner structure than many of the other banks and we do not have
the costs of a large staff branch network. We are also an AA bank, so
we can fund ourselves better than many of our competitors," he says.

But the biggest issue in Hong Kong retail banking as in the colony as a
whole has to be 1997. It creates an uncertainty that perhaps only a
financial centre as strong as Hong Kong could withstand. There is a
feeling in the banking community that those who were going to leave
have left and that capital outflows over the coming 18 months will not
be that significant.

"The current situation is no good for business. The name- calling
between the various political interest groups only makes people
nervous. It will be better when the 1997 deadline passes," says
Randolph Sullivan, managing director, Dao Heng Bank.

And ABN AMRO's Rial believes stories of Hong Kong's death as a
financial centre have been greatly exaggerated."Shanghai will not
replace Hong Kong as a regional financial centre in my lifetime at
least. To be a financial centre, the market has to accept that you are
a financial centre and whole infrastructure and framework has to be
there. Hong Kong will continue to be pivotal in Asia," he adds.

BANKING ON THE LONG HAUL

Eric Tai, senior executive, retail marketing and planning with Hongkong
Bank speaks to Andrew Moody

ERIC TAI is senior executive, retail, marketing and planning for
Hongkong Bank, the leading international bank in Asia outside of Japan.
It has 500 offices in 19 countries in Asia and boasts one of the
largest global proprietary ATM networks in the world with 170,000
machines. The bank's earnings have expanded by a compound rate of 22
percent over the past 25 years. Tai began his career in insurance and
had a spell working for Commercial Union in the UK. Before joining
Hongkong Bank, he worked for Citibank and ANZ.

RBI: Retail banking margins in many countries in the west are now very
narrow and there are pressures to cross-sell higher margin products.
Are there similar pressures in Hong Kong?

Eric Tai: Retail banking is more profitable in Hong Kong than in the
UK, for example, on virtually every ratio you want to talk about. This
is partly to do with serving a smaller geographical area and having
customers with a higher savings ratio, around 30 percent compared to 9
percent in the UK. This means you can do things in a more cost
effective way without the same pressures to cross-sell.

But although we are not driven to sell other products to supplement our
retail banking income we do so because people want to buy these
products from the banks, which they trust. The fact that we also make
money out of this is just a win-win situation. We are moving into
derivative products and we have just launched a universal life product
which we haven't sold before.

RBI: Why is banking in Hong Kong so profitable?

ET: It is not because of margins, which are actually narrower than in
the UK or US. Rather, it is lucrative because of Hong Kong's huge trade
flows, because GDP has grown at 7 percent annually since 1980 and
because Hong Kong is the world's largest forex centre and seventh
largest stockmarket. Per capita income now exceeds that of Europe. And
very, very few bank loans go bad.

RBI: Which product do you have to sell a customer in Hong Kong in order
to build a long-term relationship?

ET: We don't have the situation in the UK or the US where everyone is
chasing the cheque account. The market is very different here and they
are not something we chase, although they are free funds. We have
people with heaps of money who don't have cheque accounts.

The coat hanger product and the one we chase is the deposit account
and, to some extent, AssetVantage and PowerVantage. These lock the
customer in on a much more all-round basis than mere transactional
banking. Our strategy works in that we have a relationship with 60
percent to 70 percent of the bankable population.

RBI: What is your view of the partial break up of the Hong Kong
interest rate cartel?

ET: It has certainly put more pressure on margins and has freed up
competitive forces in the marketplace. It has added extra uncertainty
in the marketplace and reduced the predictability and stability of the
economy in the run-up to 1997.

RBI: A number of your rivals are trying to compete heavily on price.
How are you responding to this?

ET: The deposit interest rates offered by some of our competitors could
sometimes be as much as 20 percent higher than ours. There has been
some market buying and market share purchasing, but we have no
intention of being a price driver.

We do a lot of things sufficiently well to reduce the impact of this
and segmenting the market is also a way of coping with the competition.

RBI: How much emphasis has Hongkong Bank placed on providing direct
banking services to its customers?

ET: We have been in direct banking since 1990 in one form or another.
We can do telephone, we can do fax. We are not doing home banking yet
but we are coming along with it. We are currently working with Hongkong
Telecom jointly to do TV banking. All the different interfaces which
are possible technologically are being looked at to find the most cost
effective and most customer receptive forms of direct banking to
implement.

Most banks in Hong Kong have some direct banking offer but it is still
offered within the bank itself rather than by setting up a separate
entity such as First Direct.

RBI: Has the move towards direct banking been driven by cost
considerations?

ET: Retail banks, like all businesses, in Hong Kong, face staff
shortages. Unemployment has held steady at under 3 percent for years,
which has led to a steady rise in personnel costs. At Hongkong Bank,
with our big branch network, the staff shortage has been so acute at
lower levels that we now employ several hundred bank tellers from
China.

The positive aspect of this staff shortage is that we have been forced
to introduce a high level of technology in our branches. We have put in
place machines that automatically provide up-to- date balances on
passbooks, as well as automatic deposit machines which count a
customer's cash deposit and credit it instantly to his or her account.

RBI: Hongkong Bank has taken the somewhat unique step of creating three
distinct types of branches for different grades of customer. What is
the logic behind this?

ET: We believe creating three distinct type of branches is the best
method of delivering the right products and services to the right
customers. So we have what we call select branches for our high grade
customers, standard branches, which are just normal branches, and
automated branches, which operate day and night.

To be a customer at a select branch you have to be invited by a branch
manager or be a user of a particular product. The automated branches
currently have two people in them and with more investment in
technology they will be taken out.

A product which would gain you access to a select branch is
AssetVantage, which is a bundled collection of products sold as a half-
way point to private banking. This is similar to first class service on
an airline. You need to have a minimum deposit of $HK200,000 ($25,900)
and for this you are able to have savings accounts in 30 different
currencies and also gold trade.

We have also launched PowerVantage which is more like business class.
It is intended for younger high-earning customers. We have also
launched a special kind of account aimed at small business operators
called BusinessVantage.

Although we segment the market, however, banking is banking is banking
and you can't really offer a significantly different service to one
customer compared to another.

Banking in Hong Kong is often a social activity and since you are
offered coffee and chocolates at the select branches people often bring
their friends to the bank to do their transactions.

RBI: Are you pandering to the notion that banking in Hong Kong is tied
up with status?

ET: I have a very good friend in the UK and he says to me that he
cannot stand the high street banks because they don't look after him.
They don't treat him as someone special and this is something we try to
avoid here.

RBI: What pressures are there on you to close branches and reduce
staffing to rationalise costs?

ET: We have streamlined branches from around 240 two years ago to 220
now. We will continue to look at cutting the number of branches, but
the actual network remains unchanged.

Essentially what we have done is to close some of the smaller branches
and consolidate the bigger branches. Some of the closures have been
made for safety reasons because we had a fire in one of our branches
and needed improved safety facilities.

We are reducing staffing by using more part-timers so we have the
appropriate number of staff in the branches according to how busy we
are. The more flexible use of people has enabled us to cut staff costs
significantly. We want to find more efficient ways of doing things but,
at the same time, we don't want to reduce the service we provide to
customers. In fact, we set a minimum service standard for a particular
product and work to those benchmarks continually checking our customer
satisfaction levels.

RBI: How much pressure comes from the fact that bank customers use
their banks more regularly in Hong Kong than in other parts of the
world?

ET: Yes, essentially it does. It puts a lot of peak load requirement on
our network, particularly when salaries and social security are paid
into customer accounts.

We have customers in our mid-market sector who will interface with the
bank up to 16 times a month, which is more or less every day, if you
ignore the weekend. The number of transactional interfaces is indeed a
problem and we can only deal with it by having efficient systems.

RBI: How big an impact do you think 1997 will have on the retail
banking market in Hong Kong?

ET: As far as we are concerned we are here for the long haul. If we
didn't believe in China we would not be opening branches there. The
change of sovereignty will naturally have some effect. But I think the
potential is still there to carry on doing business the way we think
best. If some of our customers decide to place their money abroad then
we hope our global network will capture some of it.

RBI: How much Chinese money is coming into Hong Kong?

ET: Heaps. We estimate that China has invested $US20 billion in the
territory.

RBI: How much benefit have you derived from the link up with Midland in
the UK?

ET: I believe it has added to our global presence. These things are
often difficult to quantify. Our customers, however, now have access to
ATM machines in the UK, which can often be very useful.

RBI: How much competition do you face from non-banks?

ET: This is certainly on the increase. It is a big issue for us.
Property developers and retailers are providing their own credit cards.
I think if we don't take them seriously they will become big.

RBI: What is your view of the Hong Kong economy?

ET: It has come off since the property boom of 1993/94 which generated
a lot of income. The credit squeeze in China to reduce inflation there
from 30 percent to around 20 percent has had some effect over the past
12 to 18 months. US demand for Hong Kong goods has also subsided. These
seem to be the main factors behind the fall off in growth.

RBI: How much of a presence do you have in other Asian countries?

ET: The bank's greatest success is in Hong Kong itself but we do have a
significant presence in other countries in the region. We are the
largest foreign bank in Singapore, where we play a role in running the
cheque clearing system. We also have a key presence in India, where we
have 21 branches.

We are constrained from expanding in many countries but have been
helped recently by market liberalisation. In the Philippines, we are
taking advantage of this and are expanding our network from two to
eight branches. We have also been allowed to add two new facilities in
Thailand and are growing steadily in Indonesia.

Indochina is becoming increasingly important for us. We have just
opened an office in Burma and are in the process of upgrading our rep
office in Ho Chi Minh City to a branch.

REGULATORY DISCUSSION A MUST FOR ELECTRONIC BANKING

     Confront home banking regulatory issues now or risk losing your
ability to influence lawmakers, said speakers at last week's  Emerging
Law of Cyberbanking conference here.
     Unless bankers are proactive and cooperate with regulators now to
solve issues, such as whether chip-card transactions are cash or check
exchanges, "it will be decided when a member of Congress loses a chip
card or stored value card with $1,000 on it," warned Karen Petrou,
president of ISD/Shaw Inc. consultancy in Washington, D.C.
     Although the industry ignored legislators last year, when asked
for suggestions about regulating electronic banking, a few rulings,
opinions and real life experiences exist to guide you.

SFNB Operates Within Existing Law

     Banks could copy Security First Network Bank (SFNB) of Pineville,
Ky., without a major investment in regulatory applications or
challenges, said Stuart Stein, a partner in the financial institutions
practice group with Hogan & Hartson law firm in Washington, D.C. 
Stein's firm advises SFNB on banking law applicable to its new
business strategies.
     SFNB found that it could be the first to offer Internet banking
without applying for a new charter or filing a separate Federal
Reserve application, he said.
     Initially, Cardinal BancShares, SFNB's parent company, received
approval to consolidate and sell five branches to spin-off SFNB.  But
it did not need Regulation Y approval from the Federal Reserve.  Reg Y
applies to bank and non-bank holding company expansion, Stein
explained.
     After the spinoff, SFNB changed its business from traditional
thrift activities to soliciting deposits and purchasing loans over the
Internet, Stein said.  The bank opened its Internet doors last year
and recently expanded its offerings to include joint checking
accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposits and check
imaging to view cleared checks on-line (RDSN, Feb. 2, p. 3.)
     The next step for SFNB may require more regulatory involvement. 
The bank plans to buy Five Paces Software and then license the
technology platform on which SFNB was built, Stein said.  Licensing
this technology to other banks likely will be considered a new
business practice for SFNB, which will require Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and Office of Thrift Supervision approval, he
added.
     The Five Paces technology, which includes a secure operating
system that resides at the bank, was created for SFNB by WebTech Inc. 
of Atlanta, an affiliate of Atlanta-based SecureWare. 
     SFNB is not alone in its strategy.  Several banks joined last
year to buy Meca Software from H&R Block and plan to license Mec' home
banking program to other banks.

Two Agencies Publish Rules

     Clearly, the SFNB experience shows that banks can deliver any
previously offered service electronically without receiving any
regulatory grief.  But two agencies have published opinions and rules
on electronic banking regulation.
     The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published a rules'
revision Feb. 9 supporting activities, such as those proposed by SFNB
and Meca.  The revision of part 7 of the OCC regulations states that
banks may market technology they acquired or developed for banking
purposes to third parties, said Julie Williams, chief OCC counsel (see
box, p. 3).
     The FDIC recently released two letters written in October
addressing a bank's questions about Internet banking deposit insurance
and the possible deposit broker role of third-party vendors.  The
opinions can be applied to the industry as a whole.
     One letter addresses customer funds transferred to an account
established at a bank by the sponsoring company to facilitate Internet
transactions.  The FDIC said that federal deposit insurance would flow
through to funds deposited in a third-party agency account with the
insured institution.  Insurance flows through if the company
sufficiently disclosed the capacities in which money was transmitted
to it by customers and that the company maintained adequate records
indicating the identity of customers for which it held funds.
     This approach appears to differ significantly from the approach
used by Mark Twain Bank in its DigiCash trial.  In that system, funds
are deposited directly with the bank into an insured account.  The
money becomes uninsured when withdrawn and placed into the bank's e-
cash mint, or transferred onto the hard drive of a customer's
computer, said Thomas Vartanian, managing partner of the Washington,
D.C. law office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson.
     The second FDIC letter concludes that a sponsoring company or
third-party vendor in an Internet funds transfer program would not be
a deposit broker.
     That opinion was based on the fact that the company's "primary
purpose" was the provision of electronic payment system, rather than
the placement of funds with a depository institution.  Since no
interest was being paid on the agency account, the FDIC obviously
understood that the safety and soundness concerns articulated by
Section 29 of the FDI Act were not applicable in this case, Vartanian
said.
    Be aware, though, that the main exclusion for this FDIC ruling,
"primary purpose," is considered on a case-by-case basis.  The FDIC
considers the following key characteristics when asked if an agency is
a deposit broker:

*   Fees.  Does the party receive fees from the bank for placing funds
with the institution?

*  Purpose.  Would the relationship have been established but for the
purpose for placing funds in the bank?

*   Other Reasons.  Is there any other substantial purpose for the
activity or business other than the placement of funds in the insured
institution?

Think About Product First

    "Regulatory analysis can vary depending on what you're talking
about," said Scott Anenberg, partner and chair of the financial
institutions group at the Washington, D.C., law firm Shaw, Pittman,
Potts and Trowbridge.  Legal issues differ whether you're just taking
deposits or doing loans over the Internet, he said.
    Decide what the product is, how it will be offered, who will be
offering it and who is the target market before investigating
regulatory options, Anenberg said.
    Also, speakers said, consider the competition, which may not
always be another bank.  In the smart card market, for example,
Florida-based Blockbuster Entertainment Group  [VIA] is working on a
pilot and creating set-top box applications.  (Scott Anenberg, Shaw,
Pittman, 202/663-8000; Karen Petrou, ISD/Shaw, 202/296-5240; Julie
Williams, OCC, 202/874-5770; Thomas Vartanian, Fried, Frank, 202/639-
7016.) 

Specifics of OCC Revision

     The Office of the Comptroller (OCC) of the currency, last week, 
released revisions to Part 7 of its interpretive letters.  The final
rule:

*   Modernizes bank data processing rules to recognize bank
involvement in the area of electronic money.  A national bank may
perform, provide or deliver, through electronic means or facilities,
any activity, function, product or service that it is now authorized
to perform, provide or deliver.
  
*   States that a national bank may market and sell excess capacity in
electronic activities to third-parties for uses not related to
banking.

*   Clarifies that some lending activities must be completed at bank's
main office or branch.  A bank loan recipient must appear in-person at
the bank's main office or at a  branch to collect funds.  Loan
origination, approval and disbursal of loan proceeds by third parties
need not be performed at a main office or branch.

*   Defines interest to include fees for late payments, insufficient
funds, annual banking services and cash advances.  The fees can be
applied across state lines as with credit cards. 

*   Defines rules regarding banks' ability to lease excess space,
share space and share employees with businesses other than other
financial institutions.  

*   Provides national banks with added flexibility to structure their
procedures governing board and shareholder actions by permitting the
reliance on recognized complete bodies of corporate law and state laws
where the bank's main office is located.

*   Updates letter of credit provisions to reflect current industry
practices and to cover a broader category of transactions that are the
functional equivalent of letters of credit.

GROCERY STORES PROVING POPULAR BANKING VENUE

    Branch location will continue to play a central role in the
customer relationship, even as on-line banking and smart card delivery
channels become more popular, banking analysts predict (RDSN, Jan. 19,
p. 3.).  But the size, location and services offered at branches will
change, analysts say.
    In-store branches and mini-branches for grocery chains are two
alternative strategies to brick and mortar branches emerging in the
industry.  Last year, the number of in-store branch locations
increased 25 percent and now stands at more than 3,000, according to
International Banking Technologies (IBT) of Norcross, Ga., an in-store
branch consulting company.  These branches average 400 to 800 square
feet and are staffed with several bank employees.
    Mini-branches are the newest solution emerging as a tool to reach
busy consumers, said IBT's President John Garnett.  Mini-branches
range in size from 35 square feet to 100 square feet and are automated
with self-service loan and teller machines and video conferencing
modules.  The mini-branch is staffed by one or two employees, he said.
     Mini-branches have greater space devoted to automated and self-
service delivery, freeing specialized staff to make one-on-one
contacts in the supermarket aisles, Garnett said.  "We think this will
fill the gap in stores that are too-tight for a full branch," he
added. 
     IBT is finalizing its mini-branch prototype, which has yet to be
tested at a store, Garnett said.

Success Story

     One bank that has contributed significantly to the increasing
number of in-store branches is First State Bank of Austin, Texas. 
     The $415 million-asset institution operates a total of 16 in-
store branches at Wal Mart Supercenters and Kmarts, covering a more
than 1,200 miles between Midland, Texas and Corpus Christi, Texas. 
Five additions are planned this year, said Joseph Long, First State
chairman.
     The bank, which trained employees to roam Wal Mart aisles and
discuss loans with customers, has experienced loan volumes double that
of what was expected.  Deposit volumes also are higher than predicted
at the in-store branches, he said.
    "It's the repeat business in the grocery market, I think, that
makes [in-store branches] work as well as they do," Long said. 
Studies indicate that the average American visits the grocery store
two to three times a week.  Those numbers do not include the
additional reasons why consumers might visit Wal Mart SuperCenters,
which often house opticians and unisex hair salons.  A supercenter
conducts 30,000 to 60,000 transactions daily, Long said.
    First State has been able to increase its market coverage at a
fraction of the cost, Long added.  Stand-alone brick and mortar banks
cost $1 million or more to build compared to the $260,000 price tag
for an in-store mini-branch, he said.
    In-store branches can be created for as little as $175,000. Mini-
branches will fall under that figure because rent and staffing
requirements are even less, Garnett said.
    In-store banking provides many benefits for banks, Garnett said:

*   High-touch delivery channels.  The channel  fosters sales,
allowing automation to handle routine transactions similar to IBT's
mini-branch model.

*   Merger and Acquisition Tool.  In-store branching makes it feasible
for acquiring banks to maintain a presence in key markets when
traditional locations are closed to maximize efficiency.

*   Opportunities to build market share.  Banks can move into new
market areas without as much capital investment as with traditional
branch expansion.  For example, all but one of the Wal Mart branches
opened by First State Bank is in a new market area for the bank, Long
said.  Additionally, the inexpensive branch is a tool for community
banks to ward off competition from larger banks.

*   Increased customer service.  The in-store branch is open longer
and located where consumers must go anyway.  It allows bankers to
maintain face-to-face contact even in the evening hours.  The branches
also can provide services similar to brokerage firms.

Consumer Attitudes Positive

    National Commerce Bank Services Inc. (NCBS) of Memphis, Tenn., an
in-store branching consultancy, recently predicted that the number of
in-store branches will reach 7,500 by the year 2000.  NCBS recently
interviewed about 800 shoppers in 20 states who said in-store banking
is important to them and that the branch should offer more than just
deposit and withdrawal services.  The study revealed that of those
interviewed:

*   93 percent consider in-store bank very important;

*   70 percent shop more frequently at the supermarket because of
branch access;

*   79 percent would use the in-store bank at least once a week and
more than 80 percent would visit the store just for banking
activities; and

*   About 40 percent said the in-store branch should add home equity
loans, personal loans, safe deposit boxes and money market/mutual fund
services.

    Two U.S. consulting companies specialize in advising banks on
creating in-store branches.  Pricing for the services vary according
to the number of in-store branches needed, the mixture of bank-
provided and vendor-provided materials and whether the firm has a
relationship with the grocery store, Garnett said.
    IBT is a business unit of First Data Corporation of Hackensack,
N.J., offering a solution called Sales Platform, which has been
adopted by more than 250 U.S. banks and 950 in-store grocery branches,
Wal Marts and Kmarts.  Customers include The State Bank and Union Bank
in Central Valley, California.  NCBS is the consulting division of
National Commerce Bancorporation, which has placed 62 of its 77
branches inside supermarkets.  NCBS has advised more than 200 banks in
developing 600 in-store branches.  Customers include newly signed on
SunTrust Banks of Atlanta. (Douglas Ferris, NCBS, 800/264-2609; John
Garnett, IBT, 770/381-2023; Joseph Long, First State Bank, 512/495-

VISA CASH BENEFITS STILL UNPROVEN

     The Visa Cash division of Visa International is betting that it
can divert some of the nation's $1.8 trillion in annual cash
transactions under $10 into Visa Cash exchanges. Visa believes these
transactions are under the limit for which most people will use a
credit card.
     The banking industry has been awash with big ideas about smart
cards that will hold all of a consumer's vital information, from
medical records to cash transactions.
But Visa Cash stored-value card is designed to be simple and to help
consumers get over technology hurdles, said Mary Buckley, Visa's vice
president of stored value products.  Visa proposes to operate Visa
Cash on its existing VisaNet system and charge a fee for processing
transactions.
      For banks, the card is a vehicle to put its name in consumer
hands, an additional customer service and a fee generator, Buckley
said.
     But the service will require substantial upgrades in
automated teller machines' (ATMs) hardware and software and changes in
merchant point-of-sale equipment, said Basil Bromberg, president of
Smart Cards USA consultancy in Dallas.  "Change-over of equipment out
in the field to support this card is going to be a multimillion dollar
effort."
    Additionally, the VisaNet system limits Visa Cash consumers to
the same merchants where they could use a credit card, Bromberg said. 
He criticized Visa for failing to offer enough information to help
banks to make decisions about implementing the Visa Cash system.
    Indeed, when asked about pricing and profitability potential,
Buckley directed inquiries to each individual bank partner.  But she
acknowledged that, like the credit industry, smart cards may bring
more profits to the issuing banks that earn interest on funds through
float or unused cards funds.  Acquiring banks, on the other hand, can
earn merchant transaction fees.
    Visa Cash is in the pilot stages.  The 1996 Summer Olympics
pilot, for example, will provide many answers to industry questions
about smart card consumer acceptance, profitability and feasibility. 
"There's a lot of work to be done to validate the benefits.  When the
tents are down and the athletes have gone home, we'll still be in
Atlanta,"  Buckley said.
    Visa, at least seems to be ahead of its competition.  MasterCard
is developing a smart card system but has no pilots, Bromberg said. 
American Express initiated a pilot at its headquarters in December. 
The cards, issued to less than 50 employees, contain credit functions
on a chip, but no cash applications, said spokesman Toby Usnik. (Basil
Bromberg, Smart Cards USA, 214/991-6502; Toby Usnik, American Express,
212/640-5060.)

partnered with several banks to issue cards in association with the
1996 Summer Olympics.  In the Atlanta pilot, First Union teamed with
at least 12 merchants to accept Visa Cash.  In April, Visa launched a
stored-value card system for employees at its headquarters.  The $20
cards are used in the cafeteria and vending machines.

MASTERCARD, VISA SET STANDARDS. 

    Debit and credit payments over the Internet received a boost
recently when card-association giants MasterCard and Visa scrapped
their competing Internet security protocols and backed a uniform
security standard.  The companies believe the new protocol will make
the Internet safe for commerce, but consumer adaptation may be further
behind.  "I don't think their announcement is going to do very much
for the progress or the pace at which the mass market adopts the
Internet as a viable channel for commercial or retail enterprise,"
says Mark Hardie, an analyst with The Tower Group, in Wellesley, Mass. 
"It's a complicated issue and there's more to it than simply
MasterCard and Visa agreeing that they'll use the same standard."  The
larger issue is whether consumers will flock to the Internet as they
flock to suburban malls, he said.  The standard, called Secure
Electronic Transaction (SET), combines features from MasterCard's
Secure Electronic Payment Protocol and Visa's Secure Transaction
Technology.  The protocol underlying SET is software-based public key
cryptography from Redwood City, Calif.-based RSA Data Security.  It is
the same technology that MasterCard and Visa were using separately,
which software vendors say they're able to support simultaneously. 
The question remains whether software-based public key encryption is
an adequate form of security.  "It's better than nothing," says Bob
Gargus, president of Atalla Corp., the San Jose, Calif.-based division
of Tandem Computer Corp..  Atalla manufacturers hardware-based
encryption devices for automated teller machines and is offering 
peripherals for client-server systems to secure Internet-based
commerce (RDSN, Feb. 2, p. 6).  Standard specifications are to be
available in a few weeks and operational by the fourth quarter.  (Bob

MICROSOFT TRANSACTS WITH VISA

    As RDSN went to press, Microsoft and Visa Interactive revealed
they are working together to offer banks a turnkey remote banking
solution.  Under the agreement, Visa Interactive will act as a
processor for Microsoft's personal finance software, Money.  The more
than 30 banks offering Money have been processing payments through 
Intuit Services Corp. (ISC), also the processor for Intuit's [INTU]
personal finance software, Quicken. 
    The processing arrangement, expected to be approved by Visa
International next month, apparently offers a choice of processors for
banks that provide personal finance software from either Microsoft or
Intuit, said Mark Hardie, technology analyst with the Tower Group in
Wellesley, Mass., who received a pre-announcement briefing from
Microsoft and Visa.
    Being forced to process transactions through ISC, rather than the
bank's usual processor or a new one chosen by the bank, has been a
common complaint among banks offering the Intuit and Microsoft
programs.  The ISC contract is often the second or third processing
arrangement banks must enter into to offer personal finance software.

Microsoft Strategy

    The Visa partnership may help Microsoft improve its relationship
with the banking industry, which fears the software giant will become
a major competitor.
    When Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates spoke to about 6,000 bankers
at the Bank Administration Institute 's Retail Delivery '95 in
December, he promised bankers future processing choices for home
banking.  Microsoft likely will keep its ISC relationship for banks
that want to use that processor, Hardie said.  "I don't think
Microsoft would be as successful going to banks directly and telling
the banks to set up their own payment systems," he added.
    Additionally, the Visa choice may provide a new comfort level for
bankers who fear Microsoft, but are familiar with the Visa, Hardie
said.
    Microsoft's challenge is to keep Money competitive among Internet
banking and payment strategies, Hardie said.  Several competitors,
including ISC, are creating products for Internet banking.
    It's too early to say how the partnership will affect ISC, which
has been the exclusive Money and Quicken processor by default, ISC's
Chairman Bruce Burchfield told RDSN.  ISC will not disclose its
transaction volume numbers until Intuit's quarterly report is
published next month.
    It is unlikely that the larger banks, already processing with
ISC, will change to Visa because they would have to create a new
interface to replace one that already exists, Burchfield said.
    Indeed, the Microsoft/Visa turnkey system will likely be most
attractive to smaller banks that do not have the resources to invest
in development, Hardie said.  (Bruce Burchfield, ISC, 415/944-3569;
Mark Hardie, Tower Group, 617/235-5777; Greg Jones, Visa, 415/432-
2752.)

FINES TOTALING $258,000
LEVIED BY NASD AGAINST
WORTHEN RESPONDENTS

     The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD)
announced Nov. 7 that it has assessed fines totaling $258,000
against Worthen Investments, Inc. of Little Rock and several of
its officers and registered representatives in connection with
the sale on bank premises of mutual funds containing risky,
derivative instruments.  Worthen Investments, Inc. and Related
Cases, Complaint No. C05950057 (NASD Dist. 5, New Orleans).

     Investors who bought the funds have filed suit against
Worthen and its new holding company, Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.
The investors allege the mutual funds were falsely touted as
safe, government-guaranteed investments.  Many of the mutual fund
sales allegedly took place inside branches of Arkansas' Worthen
banks, which were acquired by Boatmen's earlier this year along
with Worthen Investments.

     NASD is the self-regulatory organization for The NASDAQ
Stock Market and the over-the-counter securities markets.

     NASD said that Worthen and all of the individual
respondents, without admitting or denying the allegations against
them, consented to the NASD disciplinary action taken by the
Association's New Orleans District Business Conduct Committee.

     The respondents, NASD said, consented to findings that they
made, or caused to have been made, misleading statements to their
customers about the characteristics and safety features of the
mutual fund investments at issue.  NASD said that in addition to
conducting many of the mutual fund sales on bank premises,
Worthen "failed and neglected to perform adequate due diligence
in connection with the promotion and sale of certain mutual fund
products."  NASD said that Worthen also failed to keep copies of
all customer correspondence and failed to establish and maintain
an adequate supervisory system.

     Worthen itself was censured and fined $200,000.  In
addition, NASD said, Worthen agreed to a number of additional
sanctions, including a promise to conduct a complete audit of all
internal policies and an agreement to form an investment
committee to meet regularly to review the methods used by Worthen
personnel to market all securities.  The committee is to
especially consider the suitability of sales literature to
promote the sale of the securities, NASD said.  The results of
the independent audit and investment committee reviews are
subject to NASD inspection.

     Among the individuals sanctioned were Patrick D. Miller,
Worthen's former president, and Frank M. McGibbony, Worthen's
executive vice president and former compliance officer.

     NASD said Miller agreed to a $10,000 fine, a five-year
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify in all
capacities.  NASD said Miller consented to findings that he bore
responsibility for misleading and inaccurate statements to public
customers.  Through written solicitations approved by Miller,
NASD said, at least seven registered Worthen representatives sent
misleading sales correspondence to public customers that
misstated the characteristics and safety features of mutual fund
investments.  Miller also failed to supervise employees who use
such correspondence, NASD said.

     NASD said McGibbony agreed to a $5,000 fine, a 30-day
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify as a
principal.  According to NASD, McGibbony consented to findings
that he approved certain items of misleading sales correspondence
that misstated the safety features of the mutual funds.  In
addition, NASD said, McGibbony failed to ensure that copies of
customer correspondence were properly maintained in the firm's
files and failed to establish an adequate supervisory system.

     Higher fines were levied against the seven representatives
who were sanctioned.  Jamai W. Weber was fined the highest
amount, $70,300, suspended in all capacities for three months,
and required to requalify in all capacities.  Altogether, the
seven representatives were fined $130,900.

     Five individuals employed by Worthen Bank & Trust Co., which
was the Worthen parent company, also were censured and fined.

     NASD said that Boatmen's cooperated fully with the
investigation "and promptly instituted new policies and
procedures at Worthen to assure compliance and to prevent future
violations."  (Boatmen's changed the name of the Worthen banks
but did not change the name of the investment company after
acquiring the Worthen enterprises.)

CFTC DISMISSES NUMEROUS
'FRIVOLOUS' MOTIONS IN
NFA DISCIPLINARY CASE

     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission in a Dec. 1 order
tossed out 59 motions filed by J&J Development Corp. and affirmed
a National Futures Association (NFA) decision that imposed a fine
of $2,000 against J&J for failure to keep timely financial
statements.  J&J Development Corp. v. National Futures
Association, No. CRAA-95-2 (CFTC).

     Calling J&J's numerous filings "egregious," the CFTC said
they were prohibited under CFR Section 171.10(d).

     The numerous motions began after J&J appealed an NFA
decision that sanctioned the company for not filing financial
statements seven times between June 1990 and August 1992.  The
CFTC said J&J began its blizzard of motions with a monster brief
that was four times longer than permitted under CFTC regulations
and contained 456 exhibits.

     The CFTC noted that the brief was followed by the filing of
59 motions between January 1995 and July 1995.  The motions
generally reiterated points made in the brief, the CFTC said.

     "[R]ule 171.10(d) itself provides that 'frivolous or
repetitive motions dealing with the same subject matter shall not
be permitted,'" the CFTC said.  "We find that most of appellant's
pleadings in fact are the very sort of filings that Rule
171.10(d) is intended to prohibit.  Although we decline to impose
sanctions pursuant to Rule 171.11, we admonish J&J for its
egregious abuse of the process."

     The CFTC noted that J&J's motions fell into three general
categories.  Most of them were made up of arguments already
contained in the brief.  A second category was composed of
procedural arguments, and a third responded to NFA's opposition
brief.

     The NFA also filed procedural motions, which included a
motion to strike J&J's brief and exhibits.  The motions were
dismissed as moot following the CFTC's ruling in favor of the
NFA.

     "[O]ur review of the record and the parties' appellate
submissions establishes that NFA's findings and conclusions are
supported by the weight of the evidence; we therefore adopt
them," the CFTC said.  "We further conclude that NFA committed no
error material to the outcome of this proceeding, and the parties
have not raised any issues that merit extended discussion.
Accordingly, we affirm NFA's decision without opinion."

SIXTH CIRCUIT: INVESTORS'
CLAIMS AGAINST BROKER
ARE TIME-BARRED

     Disgruntled investors in high-risk limited partnerships
cannot arbitrate their claims against a brokerage firm because
the six-year statute of limitations has passed, a divided panel
of the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 27.  Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. v. M.C. McCoy et al., No. 94-5779
(6th Cir.).

     In a 2-1 decision, the majority said the limitations period
began to run when the investments were made and when the
investors received prospectuses that clearly outlined the
substantial risks, not when the investments later soured.

     The dissenting judge found a material factual issue for
trial on the investors' argument that the limitations period was
equitably tolled because the brokerage firm fraudulently
concealed the unsuitable nature of the investments.  The
dissenter also said the National Association of Security Dealers
(NASD) Code of Arbitration Procedure does not bar equitable
tolling of the Section 15 limitations period.

     The investors, described as unsophisticated retirees, stated
that their primary goals were preservation of principal and a
steady income stream.  They were allegedly told by Dean Witter
Reynolds that limited partnerships would meet those goals and
were promised 20% returns and safety.  The NASD Code of
Arbitration Procedure with its six-year time period was
incorporated by reference and stipulation into their agreements.

     Dean Witter subsequently filed a declaratory judgment
complaint in the Eastern District of Tennessee, alleging that
claims for improper investments were time-barred.  The investors
were permanently enjoined from litigation and arbitration.

     The Sixth Circuit affirmed in a majority opinion by Judge
Alice M. Batchelder.  The arbitration claims were filed more than
six years after the investments were made and the clock began
ticking, the court said, not when they later allegedly discovered
the unsuitability of the investments.  Adopting the investors'
reasoning would undermine Section 15's intent of setting a
six-year limit on the arbitrability of claims, it said.

     The majority also found the prospectuses to be clearly
worded and not misleading, even to novice investors.

     It found no need to decide whether Section 15 is subject to
equitable tolling, saying the investors failed to offer
sufficient evidence of fraudulent concealment.

     In a dissent, Judge Karen Nelson Moore found a material
factual issue as to whether Dean Witter had engaged in fraudulent
concealment.  She also said the equitable tolling doctrine
applies to claims filed more than six years after an investment
in unsuitable securities.

     The due diligence requirement may be relaxed when a
confidential or fiduciary relationship exists, she said, and the
prospectuses in this case are neither clear nor comprehensive.
She also noted that a Dean Witter agent took the initiative to
meet with the investors, reassured them their goals would be met
and made other statements that were gross exaggerations or
clearly capricious.

     In addition, Section 15 does not bar an equitable tolling
claim in Judge Moore's view because there was no evidence these
investors agreed to waive their right to use the equitable
tolling doctrine.

SEC SUIT REMAINS INTACT
DESPITE CONCERNS ABOUT
'SECURITIES' DEFINITION

     Noting that a question may ultimately exist as to whether
the instruments used in multimillion-dollar transactions by the
Foundation for New Era Philanthropy are securities under federal
law, Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Anita B. Brody on
Nov. 16 denied former New Era president John G. Bennett's motion
to dismiss on that point and issued a discovery schedule.  SEC v.
Bennett et al., No. 95-3005 (ED PA); see Securities & Insider
Trading LR, Aug. 21, 1995.

     The motion by Bennett for a more definitive statement of SEC
charges that he and New Era sold more than $100 million in
unregistered securities in 1993 alone was denied by Judge Brody
because Bennett "has not made clear the substance of his
objections."

     Bennett argued that the crux of the SEC's complaint is
whether the New Era notes are securities within the meaning of
the federal securities laws.  Under every criteria, Bennett
contends, the notes fail to qualify as securities, i.e., as
notes, investment contracts and other evidence of indebtedness.

     Judge Brody stated she was unable to say at this point
whether the legal test for registered securities has been met.
After discovery has been completed, the judge ruled, Bennett may
again raise the issue and the parties at that time will address
the economic realities of the transaction.

     Regarding the motion for a more definitive statement from
the SEC, the judge stated that the defects to which Bennett
alludes are not obvious and that plaintiff did not have to
respond to allusions to theories of potential liability in the
complaint, only to factual allegations.  Because Bennett did not
comply with Rule 12(e), which requires him to point out the
defects complained of and the details desired, he has not made
clear the substance of his objections, Judge Brody stated.

     Bennett is represented by Gregory Miller, Daniel Joanas and
Gino Benedetti of Miller, Alfano & Raspanti in Philadelphia.

SUP. CT. HEARS FINALITY OF
PACT v. DE REPRESENTATION
ADEQUACY ARGUMENTS

     In arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court Nov. 27,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Ltd. argued that if the Ninth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' invalidation of a Delaware state
court settlement of shareholder claims against it is not
overturned, corporations will have no assurance of the finality
of state court settlements that include federal securities law
charges.  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. et al. v.
Epstein et al., No. 94-1809 (U.S.).

     Shareholder attorneys countered that Section 27 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which gives federal courts
exclusive jurisdiction to enforce any liability, prevented such a
settlement -- especially where the securities law claims were not
litigated and were based on different wrongs than those at the
heart of the state law breach of duty allegations.

     In 1990, Matsushita acquired MCA Inc. for $6.1 billion.  The
acquisition was accomplished through a tender offer of $71 per
share of MCA common stock.

     Rather than tender his shares, Lew Wasserman, MCA's chairman
and CEO at the time, entered into a separate agreement with
Matsushita, known as the "Capital Contribution and Loan
Agreement," pursuant to which Wasserman exchanged his shares for
preferred stock in a wholly owned Matsushita subsidiary called
MEA Holdings.  Sidney Sheinberg, MCA's COO at the time, tendered
his shares pursuant to Matsushita's $71 per share offer.  Two
days after Sheinberg tendered his shares, he received an
additional $21 million in cash, ostensibly in exchange for
unexercised MCA stock options.

     Subsequently, former MCA shareholders who tendered their
shares for the $71 tender price filed suit in the U.S. District
Court for the Central District of California, alleging that
Matsushita violated SEC Rule 14d-10 by treating Wasserman and
Sheinberg differently from other shareholders in the tender
offer.

     The district court granted Matsushita summary judgment on
class action plaintiff representative Lawrence Epstein's claim
that Matsushita's agreement to pay Wasserman consideration that
was different from the $71 per share tender offer violated
Rule 14d-10.  The trial court subsequently granted Matsushita's
motion for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs' claims.
Appeals were filed.

     During the pendency of the consolidated appeals, the
Delaware Chancery Court entered a judgment approving the
settlement of a state court class action that released all claims
arising out of Matsushita's tender offer for MCA stock --
including the securities law charges.

     The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's order
denying plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment against
Matsushita on the Wasserman claim.  The panel also vacated the
district's court's order granting Matsushita's motion for summary
judgment on the Sheinberg payment.

     In addition, the appeals court held that the Delaware
judgment does not preclude the Epstein class action.  Finally,
the panel vacated the district court's orders denying the Epstein
plaintiffs' motions for class certification and for leave to
amend their complaint.

     In its petition for writ of certiorari, Matsushita asserted
that the circuit court created an anomalous exception to the Full
Faith and Credit Act that will frustrate the settlement of class
action litigation.  It also argued that implying a private right
of action under Rule 14d-10 violates principles announced by the
Supreme Court and conflicts with decisions of the District of
Columbia, Third and Sixth Circuits.  Furthermore, Matsushita
contended that the circuit court expanded Rule 14d-10 in conflict
with the law in the Fourth Circuit and the tender offer
regulatory scheme created by Congress.

     Walter Minton, one of the plaintiffs, filed a separate brief
in opposition, arguing that this is an appeal from an
interlocutory decision, not a final judgment, and the issues
presented arise because of the unique facts of the case.  Minton
also stated that there is no need for the Supreme Court to decide
whether there is a private right of action under Rule 14d-10.

     In a Feb. 13, 1993 opinion that followed a fairness hearing
on the proposed settlement by objectors, then Vice Chancellor
Maurice Hartnett noted that a "whiff of collusion" was not enough
to bar approval, especially since the pact -- in a revised form -
- had an opt-out provision.

     The justices asked plaintiff attorneys why the California
objectors had not opted out of the settlement instead of
attacking it collaterally.  Plaintiff's attorneys argued that the
Delaware Chancery Court made no inquiry into the adequacy of
representation, thereby inviting a challenge to the settlement.

     Nevertheless, some justices questioned the assertion that
only a federal court could release federal securities claims.

     Counsel for Matsushita are Barry R. Ostranger, Mary Kay
Vyskocil, Paul C. Curnin and Joseph M. McLaughlin of Simpson,
Thatcher & Bartlett in New York City.  Of counsel is Geoffrey
Hazard Jr., Trustee Professor of Law, University of Pennsylvania.

     Epstein is represented by Roger Kirby, Irving Malchman and
Peter Linden of Kaufman, Malchman, Kirby & Squire and Henry Paul
Monaghan and Harold Edgar, both in New York City.

     Representing Minton are Peter R. Dion-Kindem and Laurence M.
Berman of Berman, Blanchard, Mausner, Kindem & Resser in Los
Angeles.

CFTC FINDS DEFENDANT'S
BID TO VACATE DECISION
DID NOT FIT RULE 60(b)

     Although Steven C. Brenner claimed that sanctions leveled
against him by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should be
lifted because he satisfied a judgment, the CFTC ruled Nov. 11
that Brenner's motion to set aside a final decision had been
filed too late for him to obtain relief under FRCP 60(b).  In the
Matter of Steven C. Brenner, No. 90-7 (CFTC).

     "To obtain such relief, generally a party must first
demonstrate that he acted within a reasonable time and show a
meritorious defense," the CFTC said, noting that Brenner's motion
involved a decision rendered four years ago.  The CFTC pointed
out that a Rule 60(b) motion must be made "not more than one year
after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken."

     In 1986, the CFTC ordered Brenner to pay a judgment of
$5,987.20 to a complainant.  There was no record of Brenner's
making the payment by early 1987, and he was automatically
prohibited from trading on any contract market.  The CFTC
Enforcement Division, however, learned in 1990 that Brenner had
violated the trading prohibition in 1987 and 1988.

     The Enforcement Division moved for a summary disposition.
Brenner did not respond to the charges nor did he appear at a
consequent hearing before an administrative law judge.  The ALJ
found Brenner liable on the charges and imposed a 10-year trading
ban and a $10,000 civil monetary penalty.  Brenner did not seek a
modification, and the summary disposition became a final order.
Brenner did not appeal the order to the CFTC, and the case was
closed.

     In June 1992, the CFTC was informed that Brenner was trading
under a fictitious name.  The Enforcement Division sought and was
granted an injunction prohibiting Brenner from trading futures by
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

     Brenner responded in February by asking the CFTC to set
aside the sanctions on grounds he had paid the $5,987.20 judgment
in 1987.  He argued that his attorney had been incompetent for
not bringing the satisfaction of the judgment to the proper CFTC
authorities.  The complainant alleged that he was not paid until
1994.

               The Enforcement Division argued that Brenner's motion should
be denied because he had failed to demonstrate the "exceptional
circumstances" necessary for the granting of relief under
Rule 60(b).   The CFTC, however, found that Brenner did not reach
Rule 60(b) because he brought his action well after the one-year
limitation period.

     "[W]e initially note that the sanctions Brenner seeks to
have vacated were imposed four and half years prior to the
instant motion.  Nevertheless, Brenner offers no explanation for
the delay in presenting the evidence he now asks us to consider.
Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that his motion has
been filed within a reasonable time."

     The CFTC noted that even if the action had been brought
within the period of limitation, relief under Rule 60(b) cannot
be granted based on the incompetence of a defendant's attorney.
Quoting Nelson v. City College of Chicago, 962 F.2d at 755
(7th Cir.), the CFTC said the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals has "never held that an attorney's gross negligence
justifies relief under Rule 60(b)."

INVESTORS SAY RECEIVER
LACKED AUTHORITY TO SELL
SECURITIES-BACKED ASSETS

     A group of California securities investors argued in a
Nov. 20 brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that the
Central District of California went beyond its jurisdiction in
approving a receiver's sale of real estate that the investors
claimed they owned through the purchase of securities.  SEC v.
American Capital Investments, Inc.; The ACI Investors Association
et al. v. Shaffer, Nos. 95-55193, 95-55283, 95-5587 and 95-55878
(9th Cir.).

     "The Receiver cannot sell the Investors' interests in the
properties because they are not within the Court's jurisdiction,"
the investors argued.  "Under binding recent Supreme Court
precedent (O'Melveny & Myers v. F.D.I.C...), the Court must look
to State law to define its remedial jurisdiction in Receivership
cases.  Under California law -- as well as all other
jurisdictions -- a Receiver steps into the shoes of the defendant
for whom he is appointed and brings into custodia legis only the
same quality and quantity of title as was owned by the
defendant."

     The case began in August 1993 when the Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a complaint alleging securities fraud
against American Capital Investments, Inc. (ACI), which had been
selling securities interests in real estate investments.  By the
time the SEC obtained a restraining order, 156 investors had
purchased securities backed by commercial real estate.

               The investors -- later organized as the ACI Investors
Association -- claimed they held title to the property directly
through deeds and indirectly through partnerships with ACI.  The
jurisdictional issue presently before the Ninth Circuit had its
genesis in the September 1993 federal court appointment of
Richard G. Shaffer as ACI's receiver.  Shaffer took over ACI's
real estate assets and sold the properties to a Canadian
investment firm.

     According to the investors' opening brief, "The investors
contend that no one can sell what he does not own.  The Receiver
seeks to sell 100 percent fee interests in eight ACI
commercial/office properties -- despite that fact that ACI did
not own 100 percent fee interests.  The investors own major
interests in at least four of the eight properties...."

     The investors claimed the Central District of California did
not have jurisdiction to approve the sale and appealed to the
Ninth Circuit.

     Citing to O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct. 2048 (1994),
which had relied in part on Allen v. Ramsay, 179 Cal.App.2d 843,
4 Cal.Rptr. 575 (1960), the investors argued that federal courts
do not have the power to displace state law in cases involving
the authority of receivers.

     "There is no principle of California law which would permit
a Receiver to sell a better state of title than he acquired when
'he stepped into the shoes' of the Defendant," the investors
argued.  "Applying the law to this case, there is no power to
convey a better title to the ACI properties than ACI itself had
and the district court's sale order is therefore void."

     The appellant investors are represented by Thomas W.
Dressler and Patrick J. Evans of Dressler, Rein & Evans in Los
Angeles.

OFFICER ARGUES THAT NASD
EXCEEDED AUTHORITY IN CASE
INVOLVING NONMEMBER FIRM

     An officer of an Oregon holding company, which owned a
securities dealer but did not sell securities, argued in a
Nov. 24 opening brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
that the National Association of Securities Dealers stretched
beyond its jurisdiction by sanctioning him for a snafu involving
a misdirected securities account deposit.  Alderman v. Securities
and Exchange Commission, No. 95-70609 (9th Cir.).

     "The use of NASD's power to sanction in this context exceeds
the power delegated to it by the Malone Act since it seeks to
impose sanctions over a person not engaged in the investment
banking or securities business for his alleged failure to act in
his corporate capacity with a non-member private corporation,"
according to the brief.

     Daniel Joseph Alderman, an officer and director of Portland-
based Peregrine Holdings Limited, focused his argument on
allegations that the NASD had trammelled on state corporations
law by imposing federal regulatory proceedings over a state-
chartered, non-NASD member private business.

     "The governance of internal corporate affairs [is] reserved
under the Constitution to state law," Alderman argued.
"Corporations such as Peregrine are creatures of state law and
the relationship created thereby are entrusted entirely to state
law....  As a result, state laws govern the internal affairs of
private corporations and federal law shall not intrude into those
internal affairs."

     According to the brief, this case stems from a check for
$3,193.23 that was mistakenly deposited into a Peregrine
corporate account instead of into the account of a Peregrine-
owned securities dealer, American Interstate Financial Corp.
(AIFC).  Peregrine discovered the mistake and issued a check for
the full amount to the AIFC customer.

     The NASD claimed that Alderman deliberately withheld payment
for two whole months.  Alderman said the NASD allegation was
unsupported.

     The deposit snafu eventually resulted in the filing of a
disciplinary action against Alderman by the District Business
Conduct Committee (DBCC) of the NASD.  In addition to being an
officer and director, Alderman was Peregrine's executive vice
president.  He was also a director of AIFC.  The DBCC found
Alderman to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the
NASD's Rules of Fair Practice.

    Article III states:  "A member, in the conduct of his
business, shall observe high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade."

     According to the brief, the DBCC censured Alderman and fined
him $3,000.  Alderman sought review of the decision by the NASD's
National Business Conduct Committee (NBCC), which affirmed the
DBCC.

     The $3,000 case found its way further up the appeals ladder
when Alderman asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to
review the NBCC's finding.  The SEC affirmed.  Alderman appealed
to the Ninth Circuit.

      The brief, citing O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct.
2048, 2053, 129 L.Ed.2d 76 (1994), argued that state law -- not
the NASD -- governs Alderman's actions as a Peregrine officer.
Specifically, Alderman pointed out that ORS Chapter 60.371
allowed Peregrine to delegate day-to-day operations of the
company.  In this instance, responsibility for Peregrine's bank
accounts fell to a vice president for finance and not to
Alderman, the brief argued.

      "The standards to which directors are held are established
by state law," Alderman argued.  "A director must be diligent and
prudent in managing the corporation's affairs.  It is clearly
recognized that the Board's responsibility is limited to
overseeing the operation."

     Alderman is represented by Allan A. Fulsher of Portland, OR.
The SEC is represented by Randall W. Quinn, Senior Litigation
Counsel for the SEC in Washington, DC.

CFTC FILES COMPLAINT
AGAINST ILLINOIS TRADER
FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS

     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has filed a six-
count administrative complaint against Gary K. Bielfeldt,
Carlotta Bielfeldt and Bielfeldt & Co., of Peoria and Chicago,
for alleged violations of the Commodity Futures Act (CFA) that
included exceeding speculative limits and filing false reports,
the CFTC said.

     The Oct. 31 complaint charged in counts one and two that
Gary Bielfeldt, a registered floor broker, allegedly violated the
CFTC's speculative limits for corn futures trading between
Oct. 8, 1993 and Nov. 19, 1993.

     The complaint claimed that Bielfeldt violated speculative
limits rules in two basic ways: by acting pursuant to an express
or implied agreement with his daughters, Linda Bielfeldt and
Karen Gray, and several business and social acquaintances; and,
by controlling the trading in commodity futures trading accounts
of Carlotta Bielfeldt, his wife, who was never registered with
the CFTC in any capacity.

     The CFTC said that counts three through six charged the
defendants with filing false reports.  Gary Bielfeldt,
controlling person of Bielfeldt & Co., was charged with filing
false reports with the CFTC for: (1) identifying his wife as a
reportable trader; (2) filing false 01 Reports that failed to
combine the net positions of the accounts controlled by Gary
Bielfeldt with the positions in the accounts of Carlotta
Bielfeldt; and (3) failing to update his CFTC Form 40 to
accurately reflect his control of the accounts of Carlotta
Bielfeldt.

     Carlotta Bielfeldt was charged with making a false statement
of material fact to the CFTC for allegedly signing a CFTC Form 40
that failed to identify Gary Bielfeldt as controlling her
account.  Bielfeldt & Co. was charged with filing a false CFTC
Form 102 and false 01 Reports with the CFTC.

      First of all, the nature of the consumer market is changing,
with a large portion of the population moving from being savers
to investors, "in part driven by low rates, in part driven by the
fact that baby boomers are inflation-conscious and investment-
driven," said Ed Furash, a Washington, D.C., bank consultant.
This group is searching for yield and isn't content with current
savings account and certificate of deposit (CD) earnings.
      Banks, in turn, are stuck with a big distribution system and
the need to increase fee income to offset their shrinking net
interest margins. "At the same time, banks don't have a lot of
loans to make--the demand and quality aren't there," he said.
      Banks have to stop the drain on deposits caused by plunging
interest rates.  "In the battle between banks and non-banks, it's
essential banks enter non-bank products such as annuities and
insurance.  If not, non-bank competitors will steal banks blind,"
Furash said.
      An illustration of the strength fee income can generate is
St. Louis-based Mark Twain Bancshares, which recently reported a
37.94 percent increase in 1992 earnings over 1991.  The bank
attributes its strong performance in part to its revenues from
its fee-based divisions (bond, brokerage, mortgage and trust),
which grew a collective 30.01 percent in 1992 compared to 1991.

   You Can Jump in All at Once or Dip in a Toe at a Time

      Some banks are taking bold steps in their commitment to
investment products. A prime example is NationsBank Corp.'s
partnership created this fall with Dean Witter Financial Services
Group Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck and Co.  The two
subsidiaries each own 50 percent of the new firm, called Nations
Securities, a Dean Witter/NationsBank Co., headquartered in
Charlotte, N.C.  The company is an independent securities
brokerage firm and has about 400 investment officers now working
at selected NationsBank banking centers around the country.
      Another tactic is to set up a separate bank subsidiary, then
hire outside investment professionals.  First Chicago Corp.'s
bankers call customers before a CD is about to mature.  Customers
disappointed by the new CD rates available are referred to
nonbanker investment professionals; mutual fund sales have
tripled.
      Other banks are cautious about the investment product wave's
future, or don't have the time or money for new product
development.  But banks can still profit from rent and fee income
generated from investment firms sharing branch space.  Another
strategy is to take advantage of third-party processors that, to
varying degrees, help banks sell investment products.

   Don't Expect a Magic Carpet Ride

      Unfortunately, investment products aren't a guaranteed magic
carpet ride to profitability.  Successfully marketing investment
products requires a lot of planning, including developing a
marketing plan that focuses on customers' needs; after all,
investment product managers shouldn't try to sell a high-growth
stock fund to a 90-year-old woman.
      The mutual fund industry may now have more than $1.67
trillion in assets, but so far bank proprietary funds have relied
mainly on converting existing assets rather than acquiring new
customers, said Kenneth Hoffman, president of the Optima Group
Inc., a Connecticut-based marketing consulting firm that
specializes in helping banks market mutual funds.
      The majority of bank proprietary mutual fund growth is
coming from the cannibalization of existing assets, he noted; to
change that trend, banks must put on their marketing hats.
When asked what pitfalls to avoid, Furash fired off this list:

Improperly explaining the product, including giving full and
complete disclosure of the risks;  Offering funds that are
attractive to the bank, not the customer; Trying to sell a stock
or fund without understanding what the customer wants; Confusing
the customer by selling too many options.  Most people want three
or four different options, plus some advice on allocation; Not
offering the right mix of options; Failure to perform due
diligence, investigating mutual fund vendors.
Many more potential traps probably lie ahead, so go cautiously.

   Market Ripe for the Taking

   Market Ripe for the Taking

      Despite snares, industry analysts are predicting that bank
investment products will be successful.  Baby boomers' propensity
to invest will be coupled with the fact that banks can use their
existing distribution system and their image to cash in on this
growing market.  Banks have a traditionally more trustworthy
reputation than non-banking institutions, said Furash.

   Bank of America Funds Show Strong Growth

      Bank of America is an example of a bank reaping big rewards.
Its Pacific Horizon Mutual Funds grew by 83 percent last year, as
opposed to the entire mutual fund industry's growth of 23
percent.  The nine funds had $12.2 billion in average assets
under management in 1992, compared with $6.6 billion in 1991.
      The growth of new assets in 1992 was principally due to
institutional clients--banks trust departments and Fortune 500
companies--that chose mutual funds over direct instruments, said
Debra McGinty-Poteet, senior vice president and manager of mutual
funds for Bank of America.
      Other reasons are low interest rates that make funds more
attractive to investors and marketing and sales efforts by
Concord Financial Group Inc. (the distributor) and the
relationship managers at Bank of America Funds Management, said
McGinty-Poteet.  Bank of America's and Security Pacific National
Bank's April 1992 merger also resulted in the convergence of
several funds.
      Bank of America NT&SA is the investment adviser to the
Pacific Horizon Funds.  Concord Holding Corp., a proprietary bank
mutual fund administrator, administers the Pacific Horizon funds;
its subsidiary, Concord Financial Group Inc., is the sponsor and
underwriter and distributor.
      Here are some tips from Hoffman on how to make mutual funds
and other investment products tempting enough to keep existing
deposits as well as attract new customers--and their money.

      1.  Give investment products the marketing efforts they deserve.
Banks aren't placing a priority on marketing funds, and "many
banks have attempted to pass marketing responsibility over to
their distributors without effectively communicating their
expectations," said Hoffman.  According to a survey performed by
Optima, 17 percent of senior fund managers reported that no
dollars were committed to mutual fund marketing, while 28 percent
didn't know what percentage of operating expenses went to funds
marketing.
       Optima Group discovered in its survey that banks with a
marketing plan are twice as likely to view their fund product as
"very successful," yet more than one-half of the banks surveyed,
with proprietary funds, had no developed marketing plan.
      The best approach is to cultivate a joint marketing plan
with the distributor, said Hoffman; that is done by about 36
percent of the banks with a marketing plan.  Another 29 percent
did one in-house, while 36 percent left marketing to the
distributor.
      Banks also err by not properly allocating advertising
dollars.  "The strategy that works well for Fidelity and Vanguard
is unlikely to work for your bank for two fundamental reasons:
First, customers of the mutual fund companies are unlikely to
switch; second, the mutual fund companies will always outspend
you," he said, adding that the large mutual fund companies can
spend more than $100 in advertising and marketing for every new
customer they acquire.

      2.  Avoid turf wars.  Retail bankers are used to thinking of
trust departments as handling clients with tax, estate and
investment management concerns.  In turn, trust departments view
brokers as people poised to steal the best customers, and view
retail customers as unprofitable.
      The choice is "to rely exclusively on converted assets and
let your departments squabble over control of the marketing of
the mutual funds or to develop a consistent, well thought-out
marketing plan that commits a significant portion of bank
resources to capitalize on the immense potential of mutual
funds," said Hoffman.

      3.  Capitalize on Competitive Advantages.  One of those
advantages is customer access, including information from
databases, branches and loan applications.
      "Frequent contact with customers provides a tremendous
opportunity to cross-sell existing customers into mutual funds.
This is an advantage which brokerage firms, insurance companies
and other financial competitors do not have.  At a bank,
customers literally 'come to you,'" Hoffman said.

      4.  Focus on customers with the greatest promise.  Carefully
analyze available data, including DDA dollar velocity, CD
balances, credit card balances, credit lines and savings
balances.  Doing so separates the investors from the savers.
      DDA dollar velocity, the amount of money a customer puts
into his checking account each month, can be a prime indicator of
customer income.
      Combined with other research such as car buying habits and
residence location, the resulting market segmentation can be used
for mailings and telemarketing, Hoffman said.  Its effectiveness
in using it to market investment products can then be tested and
refined.
      "This data on purchase behavior is critical," said Hoffman.
"Banks should take pains to update it, nurture it and make it an
operable part of future marketing efforts.

      5.  Divide and conquer, then offer something extra.  Divide
potential customers into three groups:  the traditional mutual
fund retail customer, the affluent and the high-end trust
customer.  Retail customers traditionally don't understand the
difference between stocks and bonds.  But they could become a
lucrative market if those products are explained properly.
      The high-end investors need more services, such as trust
services and portfolio rebalancing.
      Customers that fall in the middle may require a relationship
manager; they often need more service than the traditional retail
customer but don't possess the assets of a trust customer, said
Hoffman.

      6.  Offer brokers incentives.  Instead of worrying that the
brokers will take away the largest customers, bankers need to
focus on strengthening those relationships.  Besides offering
monetary incentives, bankers can give brokers access to customer
data and sales support.  Separate customer statements for the
funds are attractive, as are prospectus wraps with strong sales
messages, dedicated wholesaler telephone support, service support
and cross-sale programs to encourage customers to commit
additional dollars to the fund.

BANKS AGAINST NON-BANKS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS

      Despite the hard knocks banks have taken in the recent past,
commercial bank trust departments have come out winners over the
past 10 years when it comes to equity investments.
      In fact, over the past decade banks have outperformed mutual
funds, insurance companies and investment advisors in equity
funds under management, according to an annual study conducted by
CDA Investment Technologies Inc., an independent investment
performance measurement service.
      The Rockville, Md.-based company also found that banks
reaped higher equity returns than insurance companies and mutual
funds over the last three- and five-year periods.
      Fixed income returns also fared well, with banks remaining
competitive with those experienced by mutual fund and insurance
companies over the last three-, five- and 10-year periods.

   Bank Trust Departments Produce Returns as Good as Non-Banks

      The survey results are evidence that bank trust departments
are holding their own and producing good investment returns for
their clients.
      "Not only do the absolute returns compare favorably to our
major competitors, but bank-managed portfolios have exhibited
more consistent results under varying market conditions, a
reflection of lower risk profiles," said Henry Gooss, managing
director and chief investment officer of Chemical Bank.
      For the one-, three-, and five-year periods, investment
advisors achieved the highest annualized rate of return in
equities, but banks edged them out over the last 10-year period.
      The chart below summarizes the study's findings for the one-
, three-, five- and 10-year period ended Dec. 31, 1992:

ANNUALIZED RATE OF RETURN ON EQUITIES

                      1-Yr      3-Yr      5-Yr    10-Yr

Banks                  8.7%    11.3%      15.7%   15.6%
Mutual Funds           8.5%    10.0%      14.0%   13.5%
Insurance Cos.         7.5%    10.3%      14.9%   15.4%
Investment Advisors    9.3%    11.9%      16.3%   15.3%
S&P's 500              7.6%

      The survey also found that banks have performed consistently
in the fixed-income area against mutual funds and insurance
companies.  Investment advisors were excluded for lack of data.
      For the one-year period, banks, at 6.8 percent, were
slightly behind mutual funds (6.9 percent) and insurance
companies (7.1 percent).  Over the last three years, banks
achieved a 9.8 percent annualized rate of return, ahead of mutual
funds (9.4 percent) and behind insurance companies (10.2
percent).
      Over the five-year period, banks, which achieved a 10-
percent annualized rate of return, were again behind insurance
companies (10.6 percent), but still ahead of mutual funds (9
percent).  This pattern repeated itself over the 10-year period,
with banks reaping 10.6 percent, mutual funds bringing in 10.2
percent and insurance companies achieving 11.3 percent.
      The Rockville, Md.-based research firm based its equity
research on a survey of 1,489 managers, consisting of 217 bank-
pooled funds, 73 separate/variable insurance accounts, 577 mutual
funds and 622 investment advisors, which manage a total of $1.2
trillion in assets.
      For its fixed-income research, CDA surveyed 741 managers,
broken down into 215 bank-pooled funds, 38 separate and variable
insurance accounts and 488 mutual funds, that manage a total of
$316 billion in assets. (For more information, call Jeff Schutes,
CDA, 301/975-9600.)

CHEMICAL TO GET TAX BREAK, NEW BUSINESS IN DUBLIN

      Chemical Banking Corp.'s Geoserve unit has established
operations in Dublin's International Financial Service Center
(IFSC) by acquiring Irish Life's IFSC licenses.
      The bank foresees the move as an opportunity to generate new
business and expand products and services available to existing
and prospective clients, said Jeremiah O'Leary, senior vice
president of Chemical Bank and general manager of the global
securities services division of its Geoserve unit.
      Chemical also chose the IFSC because it's sponsored by the
Irish government and is fully sanctioned by the European
Community.
      "As a result, this location provides access to the entire EC
market and comes with a comprehensive set of tax treaties in
addition to its own favorable tax environment.  Dublin is rapidly
becoming a major center for offshore fund management," O'Leary
said.
      The IFSC was created to encourage the growth of financial
services activities in Ireland; qualifying financial operations
receive special tax incentives to operate within the center; more
than 200 companies currently operate from the IFSC.
      The two licenses acquired from Irish Life will operate as
separate companies under the names Chemical Fund Administrators
Ltd. and Chemical Custody & Trustee Services Ltd.  They will
become part of the Global Securities Services Division (GSS) of
Chemical Bank's Geoserve unit.
      Chemical Fund Administrators, Ltd. will offer fund managers
and promoters administrative and ancillary services relating to
the issue, redemption and conversion of units in collective
investment schemes in accordance with the directives adopted by
the member states of the European Community.  Chemical Custody
and Trustee Services, Ltd. will act as custodian and/or trustee
on behalf of client fund management companies. Geoserve, Chemical
Bank's global wholesale services arm, provides cash management,
funds transfer, securities processing, corporate trust and trade
services to corporations and financial institutions.  Its annual
revenues exceed $700 million. Global Securities Services provides
domestic and global custody, dealer and broker clearance,
securities lending and master trust services. Chemical has been a
frontrunner in using cutting edge technology to offer global
trust and custody services.  Last year, its ChemTrust system went
live in New York and Europe, fully integrating worldwide
reporting and accounting on one platform.  The system allows
clients to view the status of their global and domestic holdings
in real-time on one integrated report.

MUTUAL FUNDS, INVESTMENT ADVISER ARE BILLS TO WATCH

      Two bills germane to selling mutual funds are in front of
Congress this session: The Financial Services Act of 1993 and the
Investment Adviser Regulatory Enhancement and Disclosure Act of
1993.
      The Financial Services Act (H.R. 458), introduced by Rep.
Peter Hoagland (D-Neb.) in January, would expand bankers' ability
to engage in full mutual fund activities by permitting bank
subsidiaries and affiliates to underwrite and distribute mutual
funds. Mutual funds represent a significant market for bankers.
Approximately 120 banks now offer over 675 proprietary mutual
funds; total assets are an estimated $25 billion.  But under
current law, banks must use a middleman instead of having full
control over sponsorship and distribution of their own products.
      Banks are only permitted to serve as investments advisers,
custodians, transfer agents and fund administrators.
      National banks, their subsidiaries and bank holding company
subsidiaries are also allowed to both broker and recommend
securities of investment companies for which they serve as
investment advisors.

   Act Would Give Bankers More Freedom

      The act would give bankers the freedom to sponsor,
distribute and underwrite mutual fund shares--eliminating the
need to involve a third-party provider. Also, management
interlocks between a bank or bank holding company and the mutual
fund subsidiary would be permissible.  The act would also require
one-time disclosures to be made to customers regarding, among
other things, the lack of FDIC insurance for these investment
products.
      This bill has seen no action yet.  It was first introduced
in the closing hours of the last session, mainly for purposes of
discussion.  Keep an eye out.

   The Investment Adviser Regulatory Enhancement and Disclosure Act

      This bill (H.R. 578), introduced by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-
Va.) in January, would amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
an act criticized by industry players for having no teeth.
      The bill proposes to rectify the deficiency by providing
enhanced supervision and regulation of investment advisers by
providing for:

       Higher registration fees (initial and yearly) for
investment advisers to fund more SEC inspections and surveys of
unregistered advisers; More frequent SEC examination of high risk
advisers;  A record-keeping requirement to verify suitability;
SEC authority to designate a self-regulatory organization to
conduct investment adviser examinations; Enhanced disclosure
through brochures containing general information, advance
transactional reports revealing commissions and third-party
payments, and periodic reports of all charges; Client assets;
Disqualification from being an investment adviser for a felony
conviction; Confidentiality with respect to personally
identifiable information unless consent is given.

      Because the bill doesn't propose any change in the
definition of investment adviser, it wouldn't apply to banks or
their trust departments as they are currently exempt from the
definition.  It would, however, have an impact on banks that have
established separate subsidiaries.
      This act was also introduced last session and passed
committees in both the House and Senate, but differences couldn't
be worked out before the recess. Testimony has already begun this
session, and further action is expected.

NEW CALIFORNIA ACTION SEEKS RESCISSION OF PRU PARTNERSHIP RESIDUALS

By:
Daniel Colarusso

   A group of California investors has sued Prudential Securities, claiming
that the firm's continuing residual payments to brokers and former Direct
Investment Group executives has perpetuated its allegedly deceptive limited
partnership sales practices.
   The group, which brought its case in California Superior Court in
Sacramento County, is also demanding rescission of both the residual
payments and its members' limited partnership investments because the firm
failed to disclose financial incentives for brokers to sell the funds.
   Among former high-ranking Prudential Securities executives receiving
residual payments is James Darr, the former head of the firm's Direct
Investment Group, who has frequently been mentioned during investigations
of the firm's partnership problems. According to published reports, Darr
has received more than $2 million in partnership residuals.
   ``We're saying that the fraud was not over and done with at the time of
the sales,'' said Allan Haley, one of three lawyers representing the group.
``Every day Prudential pays residuals is a continuation.''
Prudential has responded to the claim and a hearing on that response is
scheduled for Jan. 30.
   The plaintiffs have petitioned the court to enjoin and restrain
Prudential from ``making or receiving'' further residual payments without
first making full disclosure of each contractual obligation currently in
effect and offering to rescind each contract for the sale of a Prudential
direct investment made in California.
   The suit also is seeking to rescind each limited partnership sale made
after Sept. 1, 1982, and force Prudential ``to account for and to disgorge
the profits made through its unlawful and unfair business acts and
practices in California.'' The investors made their partnership purchases
between 1983 and 1987.
   The foundation of the suit is in a California statute stating any
financial interests a broker has in a security must be disclosed prior to
the transaction. Unless the broker notifies the client of the existence of
the financial interest, a client has a right to cancel the transaction.
   ``Not disclosed in any offering document or sales communication directed
to any plaintiff or other purchaser was the fact that the registered
representative of PSI making such sale had been given by PSI an
indeterminate, open-ended participation in the cash flow, earnings,
refinancing and distribution rights held by the PSI affiliate involved in
that PSI partnership,'' according to the plaintiffs' filing.
   The suit also includes a 1982 memo from former Prudential CEO George
Ball that states: ``Starting September 1st, 50% of Bache's net earnings
from Tax Investment Group programs, from which Bache Properties, Bache
Energy, or Bache Leasing subsequently earns asset residuals interests
and/or cash flow, will be paid to Account Executives who sell $25,000 of
any such offering.''
   Prudential's response said the plaintiffs' claims are made beyond the
statute of limitations, coming eight years after their initial investments,
that the California laws under which the claim is filed is pre-empted by
Federal statutes, and that the state's Business and Professional code is
not applicable to securities transactions based on a similar 1988 ruling in
Hawaii.
   San Francisco law firm Steefel, Levitt & Weiss is representing
Prudential in the case.

MEGA-PRODUCER LANYI LANDS AT OPCO'S MIDTOWN BRANCH

By:
Daniel Colarusso

   Andrew Lanyi, author, radio show host, and $4 million-producer, last
week agreed to bring his team to Oppenheimer & Co.'s Midtown Manhattan
office from Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., branch manager Jordan Berlin
confirmed.
   At Ladenburg, Lanyi operated his team as a self-contained unit, Andrew
Lanyi Research Inc., but he will join Oppenheimer as a senior vp. He will
continue to publish his own research and follow what he terms ``tomorrow's
blue chips,'' undervalued, under-followed stocks.
   Lanyi's 10-person team is comprised of three brokers, one full-time
analyst, and other support staff. Berlin described Lanyi as the ``most
organized, hardest-working broker I've ever known.''
   In addition to his brokerage work, Lanyi, a Holocaust survivor who
arrived in the United States penniless, has a radio show on New York's WEVD
and has written a book, ``Confessions of a Stockbroker.''
   One national headhunter said Lanyi, who was at Lehman Brothers before
Ladenburg, was among the most sought-after brokers on the recruiting
scene.

NYSE MEMBERS FINDING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO LEASE SEATS AS PRICES SOAR

By:
Heike Wipperfurth

   While the NYSE is ringing out 1995 on many record notes, floor brokers
and specialists are beginning to feel the heat as prices of membership
leases on the Big Board are reaching a new high, making it more difficult
for some to afford the cost as demand remains strong, sources said.
   While some NYSE participants seem eager to pay higher prices for
membership privileges on the world's largest equities market, others are
unwilling or unable to pay up, and drop out, sources said.
   Attorney James Rothenberg said that he had unfilled demand from a
specialist and a floor broker wanting to purchase a lease on a seat at an
annual cost of $150,000 each, up from recent lease prices of between
$130,000 and $140,000. Prices are typically negotiated between the lessee
and the lessor as a private agreement and the NYSE does not get involved,
an NYSE spokeswoman said.
   Demand for seat leasing is skyrocketing because of the recent rise in
trading volume and the positive direction of the market, Rothenberg said.
   Sources said that about 740, or more than half of the 1,366 seats on the
Big Board, have been leased. The rise in demand for the limited amount of
seats creates major problems for some members, sources said.
   ``It's definitely a problem. It's hard to get a lease,'' a source said.
A lot of specialists, he noted, are trying to lock in costs by paying
premium prices for two-year leases. They are afraid that next year's prices
may be even higher, he said. As a result, some two-dollar brokers are not
able to make it and they drop out, he noted.
   The high prices for seat leases reflect record prices for seat sales,
sources noted. One source predicted that a seat soon could go for as much
as $1.15 million up from the last seat sale at $1,05 million in December.
   At the end of 1995, the Big Board's market capitalization reached $6
trillion. There were 2,675 NYSE-listed companies with 155.2 billion shares
available on the exchange, according to statistics from the Federation of
International Stock Exchanges.

LAWYERS FIGHTING OVER ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS IN NASDAQ ANTITRUST SUIT

By:
Heike Wipperfurth

   Lawyers on both sides of the antitrust suit involving 33 of the biggest
Nasdaq market makers filed court motions in December accusing the other
side of not providing enough documents, sources said.
   The bickering between the opposing sides will be carried into the court
room for a hearing on January 17 before Judge Robert Sweet in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, an attorney said.
   Defendants' lawyers filed a motion in late December requesting more
documents relating to how `class' was defined by the plaintiff lawyers, he
said. Plaintiffs' lawyers, on the other hand, are fighting for additional
access to documents and tape recordings and are asking for permission to
confer with the Justice Department, he noted.
   Both sides think that they do not have everything they are entitled to,
he said. This is ``the typical bickering over how much paper each side is
going to produce at the beginning of a big case,'' he added.
   In addition, the source said that Judge Sweet has to make a decision on
a motion filed by the Los Angeles Times in December, requesting, among
other things, that the court break its confidentiality order and provide
access to the tapes and other material handed over to the plaintiff lawyers
by the defendants.
   The antitrust suit accusing major Nasdaq market makers of collusion,
price fixing and overpricing was filed after an academic study brought to
public attention of indirect evidence of implicit collusion among market
makers.

PRU'S FORMER SAN FRANCISCO MANAGER MOVES TO NASHVILLE

By:
Daniel Colarusso

   Mike Baker, Prudential Securities' former San Francisco branch manager,
last week moved to Nashville to take over the firm's branch in the city,
sources said.
   Baker was dismissed from his San Francisco manager's post in late 1994
for what appeared to be compliance-related problems (SW, 7 Nov. '94, 4). At
that time, Baker had been expected to take the helm of the consolidated
office made up of Prudential's two metro San Francisco offices. That branch
is the firm's largest nationwide.
   Since leaving the managerial position, Baker has continued working for
Prudential as an internal auditor.
   Ironically, Nashville manager Rick Hertz was recently dismissed for
compliance-related problems in that same office.

DEBATE REMAINS ON RULES TO ENSURE BEST EXECUTION FOR MULTIPLE TRADED
OPTIONS

   A letter submitted recently to the SEC by the Committee On Options
Proposals concerning the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's so-called ``Trade or
Send'' rule for multiple traded options, indicates that a split remains
within the industry on how to ensure the best execution of trades entered.
   The letter, while noting that the COOP ``has [previously] endorsed
[Phlx's] filing in principal,'' also indicated that it ``has received
little or no support from the other exchanges.''
Under Phlx's proposed rule, which was submitted as the exchange's proposal
to ensure that customers receive the best offered price on an option at all
times, when a market maker or specialist at another exchange makes a better
bid than his counterpart at another exchange where the order was first
submitted, the order would automatically be sent to the exchange making a
better market.
   Part of the Phlx rule also requires that public customer orders be
designated as ``Principal Acting as Agent,'' or PA orders, to differentiate
them from trades submitted by institutional customers. However, sources
said, that rule provision has led to some market makers and specialists
refusing to honor posted prices for anything other than small customer
orders.
   Previously, a majority of the industry had instead supported, and still
support, a so-called ``Trade or Fade'' rule, which allows market makers and
specialists to match a better bid, or to contact his counterpart at the
other exchange to negotiate the price. Then, if the market maker or
specialist making the better bid decides not to deal with his counterpart
he can withdraw (fade) the bid.
   While the Trade or Fade rule has been used up until now, the COOP noted
in its letter to the SEC that several exchanges have indicated that ``their
market-makers/specialists match the Best Bid/Offer (BBO) [only] 93% of the
time they receive options orders that are eligible for automated
execution.''
Although the COOP called the results ``a commendable feat,'' it also
indicated that ``the member firm community is very concerned about the
portion of the remaining 7% who do not obtain the BBO.''
   The Trade or Fade rule, the COOP added, is by it nature limited in
addressing the problem, and it added that in any case ``it has been
reported that some trading crowds are not honoring Trade or Fade
procedures.''
Phlx's rule would seem to solve the problem, but the COOP noted in its
letter that the nation's other four options exchange don't support it.
   In the past, the other exchanges have argued that to properly implement
a Trade or Send rule a fully automated linkage system would need to be
developed, something that was originally part of an overall plan for the
multiple trading environment but that was abandoned as too costly before
multiple listing was imposed on the entire market for new listings.
   As a compromise, Phlx's rule was supported in principal with the
provision that the exchange make various adjustments, but sources indicated
that many COOP members now regret the endorsement.
   For its part, the SEC has not been pressuring the exchanges extensively
to accept a standardized rule, probably because the BBO has occurred in the
vast majority of cases. With competition for new listings heating up,
though, the agency could begin to push the industry more strongly.
   Previously the regulator delayed a vote on any rule regarding the issue
until December of last year, allowing a November deadline to pass. The
current government shutdown followed, so the agency has yet to act and it's
unclear when it will be able to do so.
   In the meantime, the COOP has scheduled a meeting for this Saturday for
industry representatives to discuss the issue, along with some other
issues. Among the topics to be discussed will be whether to reconsider the
development of a linkage system to determine if it would be ``economically
feasible.''
   Separately, The Options Industry Council, an educational and
informational group comprised of the nation's options exchanges and The
Options Clearing Corp., last week reported that equity options volume
reached an all-time high in 1995, with 174.4 million contracts changing
hands, surpassing the previous record, set in 1987, by 6%.

NASD SEEKS NEW BROKER/DEALER COMPENSATION LIMITS ON MUTUAL FUND AND
VARIABLE CONTRACT SECURITIES

   The NASD is seeking SEC approval to amend its Rules of Fair Practice to
limit the use of ``cash and non-cash compensation received by
broker/dealers who sell mutual funds and variable contract securities.''
   The NASD said the amendments would ``tighten and broaden existing rules
on the sale of these investment products,'' and added that they were
proposed ``in response to the increased use of non-cash compensation and
certain types of incentive-based cash compensation for the sale of
investment company and variable contract securities.''
   Such practices, the NASD said, ``may heighten the potential for a
member's loss of supervisory control over sales practices and increase the
possibility of the perception of impropriety,'' resulting in a loss of
investor confidence.
   Broadly, the new rule amendments would do the following:
   -- Prohibit, except under certain circumstances, broker/dealers from
receiving any cash or non-cash compensation from anyone other than the NASD
member with which the individual is associated.
   -- Require that NASD members maintain records of compensation received
from an investment company, an adviser to an investment company, a fund
administrator, an underwriter and any affiliated person.
   -- Prohibit receipt by a broker of cash compensation in connection with
the sale of investment company securities, unless the arrangement is
described in the current prospectus.
   -- Retain the prohibition, only with respect to the Investment Company
Rule, against a broker receiving compensation in the form of securities.
   -- Prohibit, with some exceptions, NASD members and associated persons
from accepting, directly or indirectly, any non-cash compensation in
connection with the sale of investment company and variable contract
securities.
   -- Prohibit, again with certain exceptions, an associated person from
accepting cash sales incentives for the sale of investment company or
variable contract securities.
   Separately, the NASD has also submitted new rules to the SEC designed to
eliminate potential confusion by investors purchasing mutual funds and
similar products on the premises of banks, savings and loans, credit unions
and other financial institutions other than broker/dealers.
   The new rule would require NASD member firms, among other things, to
conduct business in a location distinct from the area where retail deposits
are taken whenever possible; provide customers with a written document
outlining differences in insurance coverage and risks for securities and
institution deposits; and prohibit member firms from making payments,
including referral fees, to individuals employed by the financial
institution who are not registered with the member firm.

S.W.I.F.T. LAUNCHES NEW TRADE INITIATION AND CONFIRMATION MESSAGES TO
IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND TIMELINESS

   S.W.I.F.T. announced that it has made available new securities messages
for trade initiation and confirmation on its global network that it said
would ``significantly improve the efficiency and timeliness of confirming
trades as the industry globally moves towards shorter settlement cycles.''
Using the messages will allow S.W.I.F.T. customers to issue settlement
instructions through the same window as trade confirmations, resulting, the
firm said, in ``greater straight-through processing and single-window links
to trade counterparties.''
   The new messages will allow customers to more easily process their
trades automatically end-to-end, the firm said, adding that in the United
Kingdom regulators and tax authorities have approved accepting the
confirmation messages as electronic contract notes, meaning they can be
used to confirm trades without the need for a paper copy.
   The first users of the new messages, the firm said, will include The
Hong Kong Securities Industry Group, which will also ``be piloting the new
messages in conjunction with connection to the New York Depository Trust
Co.
   S.W.I.F.T. added that the new messages can be used in conjunction with
existing securities order and confirmation messages, which are slated to be
removed from the network in November of this year.

FIMAT HIRES S&P FUTURES BROKER GROUP FROM LIT TO EXPAND PRESENCE

By:
Michael Ocrant

   Fimat, the futures sales and clearing division of Societe Generale
Group, hired a group of about 10 broker professionals to execute business
on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, mostly in S&P 500
contracts traded at the exchange, from LIT, a division of First Options of
Chicago.
   The group, headed by Luke Adrian, will also conduct some trading in the
Eurodollar pit at the Merc, sources said.
   Previously the group operated as an independent futures commission
merchant prior to becoming a division of LIT, sources said, adding that it
will remain a division of Fimat.
   Sources said the firm views the new hires as a way to add to its current
business profile and to meet the expected demand from clients for broker
execution services, particularly in the equity index area.
   Sources said the firm also hopes that the addition of the group will
raise Fimat's profile at the exchange and in general.
   Because of the steep rise in equity markets last year, sources said,
there is an expectation at Fimat that there will be significant activity
this year as investors seek to hedge their positions or to speculate on
market moves.
   While Fimat had several employees handling the business on the floor of
the CME, sources said, the expected business in the coming year required
that the firm be ``reasonably well prepared'' to manage any surge by
bringing on board dedicated and experienced brokers capable of meeting all
customer needs.

LIFFE OUTLINES 1996 STRATEGIC PLANS SET FORTH LAST YEAR

   The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has
outlined a number of strategic developments to help ensure that it retains
the position as the leading futures and options exchange outside of Chicago
and to further its worldwide market penetration throughout the coming
year.
   Cited first by the exchange was the linkage agreement between Liffe and
the Chicago Board of Trade, which was formally signed just last month after
months of prior negotiations.
   Liffe noted that the linkage will provide market users with increased
access to major government debt futures and options products on both sides
of the Atlantic during U.S. and European business hours. Initially, the
linkage will include Liffe's German government bond (bund) contract and the
CBT's U.S. Treasury bond contract, which are scheduled to begin trading in
the second quarter of this year.
   Next, the exchange said, in April of this year it will commence another
linkage with the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange that, under
an agreement signed last year, will begin the trading of a fungible
three-month Euroyen futures contract.
   Also slated for this year is a merger between Liffe and the London
Commodity Exchange, which the exchange said will be the first step in
``providing a platform for the development of a liquid European time zone
agricultural and soft commodity complex in London.''
   In an effort to maintain a leading technological edge, Liffe noted that
this month it would launch its APT trading system for options, a move it
said would create the first fully functional screen-based options trading
system in the world.
   Other technological initiatives, the exchange said, include the
development of its so-called LOTS system, designed to provide the
industry's first comprehensive electronic business processing system, and
the development of an unnamed automated system for its equity options
complex.
   Finally, the exchange noted that an agreement has been reached with
London Stock Exchange for Liffe to lease the LSE's former trading floor,
office and storage space, which will allow it to meet its medium-term
needs.
   Like other exchanges around the world last year, Liffe suffered a drop
in volume compared with the prior record year, but still had its second
busiest year ever. The exchange indicated that the various initiatives it
has in store for 1996 will help it continue to grow.

CHICAGO MERC PROPOSES FUTURES AND OPTIONS ON BRAZILIAN AND ARGENTINE
BRADYS

   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange last week filed for regulatory approval
to trade futures on Brady Bond indexes based on Brazilian and Argentine
issues.
   The new products will trade on the Merc's new Growth and Emerging
Markets (GEM) Division, which was launched in November.
   The Merc already trades a Mexican peso contract, which has recorded
strong volume since its April launch. In 1995, the contract averaged 1,186
contracts daily and 15,809 open interest positions.
   Also launched in November was the Merc's futures and options on the
Brazilian real. which also was met with strong interest.
   Open interest on the Brazilian real contracts passed 5,000 positions by

JAPAN:  MITI LINKS WITH VISA ON INTERNET

IN AN EFFORT to develop a global platform for electronic commerce,
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), recently
launched the "Smart Commerce Japan" project, which will allow Japanese
consumers to use a Visa card to pay for goods found in the virtual
shopping malls of the Internet. This forms part of the MITI's overall
strategy to promote a wider range of applications for electronic
commerce.

According to Visa, the pilot of the Smart Commerce Japan project will
involve the distribution of 35,000 chip cards which will conform to the
EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) specifications, together with
compact stored-value card readers, to current Visa cardholders who have
experience using the Internet.

A source at Visa Japan told SCB that other Internet projects are also
being conceived by the ministry. Following the test of Smart Commerce
Japan, it is expected the MITI will develop other electronic data
interchange (EDI) type systems for the Internet.

Other systems being envisioned will facilitate the exchange of
trade-related information between individuals and corporations on the
Internet, with later systems allowing similar exchanges between
corporations.

The Smart Commerce Japan project is slated for a pilot debut in the
first quarter of 1997. It is believed to be the world's first system to
combine the EMV-compatible integrated chip card for electronic
commerce. Other payment systems available on the Internet are based on
conventional magnetic stripe technology.

The project will allow Visa cardholders to use their card not only for
credit and debit transactions but also for stored-value transactions on
the Internet. Cardholders might even be able to load up their
reloadable stored-value cards on special terminals in their homes.

Team leader of Smart Commerce Japan, Toshiba Corporation, said the
project will promote electronic shopping and put powerful chip cards
into the hands of thousands of Japanese consumers.

The project is undertaken by a consortium headed by Toshiba and will
also involve international credit card association, Visa International,
Daiei Group, Japan's largest retailer and the Hankyu Toho Group, a
diversified entertainment, retail and transportation group.

A spokesperson for Toshiba said the company's role in the project will
involve the provision of system integration from the EMV compatible
chip card and related devices to back-end servers.

According to Visa, the lack of security for financial transactions over
open networks has hampered the development of electronic commerce. To
overcome this constraint, Toshiba and Visa have revealed that they will
be working to develop hardware applications to facilitate secure
payment over the Internet. It is expected that when the pilot commences
in the first quarter of 1997, a common application standard will
already be in place.

Visa International had earlier partnered software giant, Microsoft, to
develop Secure Transaction Technology (STT), an open standard for
security and payment applications. Visa would not confirm whether
Microsoft are involved in the Japanese project.

A source at MasterCard, the other international card association
currently developing a standard for secured Internet payment
transactions, said: "It is perplexing that for Internet transactions,
which are global in nature, it is necessary to create a Japanese
standard for secured payment. We will certainly be watching this
project with interest."

The source at Visa, however, said there is no intention to create a
Japanese standard for secured transactions. "The objective is not to
create a de facto standard, if another standard comes out and is well
accepted, we will use that. But what we do want to create is
international operability. There will eventually be a commonality of
standards between what Visa and MasterCard are attempting to do."

A spokesman for Toshiba said: "We will adopt a world-standard security
technology, which is compatible with the settlement system for
EMV-based IC cards."

It is understood that Toshiba will co-operate with Netscape
Communications Corporation, a leading Internet-related software
provider, to develop the Internet platform for the project. It will
also develop the system for EMV chip transactions over the Internet, as
well as the Sun Microsystems' Java-based interface software between the
EMV chip card and the transaction system.

Visa said that, during the pilot, experiments will be conducted to find
ways to deliver the convenience of shopping in cyberspace to those who
do not own a home PC, such as the construction of"Virtual Mall Kiosks"
placed in convenient locations. Several credit card issuers, major
retailers and Japan's leading banks will be involved in the pilot.

MONDEX HIRES EXEC FOR AMERICAN EXPANSION

MONDEX International has hired a US-based executive as another effort
by the NatWest-led smart card project to build franchises throughout
North and South America.

Timothy Stewart, who worked for AT&T's corporate strategy and business
development office, will be a US-based liaison to Mondex International.
Stewart formally begins work this month, out of his New Jersey
residence, according to Tim Jones, Mondex International's chief
executive.

Jones introduced Stewart to bankers during the BAI Retail Delivery Show
in Atlanta. According to Jones, Stewart will be a "relationship manager
for all of the Americas", with Canada, the US and other national
subsidiaries reporting through his office.

"We'd like to get Canada and the US operational on an integrated basis
and then expand southward," to Latin America, Stewart told SCB in a
recent interview. Stewart has a business as well as technical
background from his days with AT&T's Bell Laboratories, where he was
involved with research and development.

"If you're dealing with North American corporations, it's important to
have someone on the ground, in the same time zone, available for
meetings at short notice. He'll sweep the whole load of issues. We have
more people wanting to talk to us than we can cope with at the moment,"
Jones said, though he declined to identify the banks involved.

In the US, to date, Mondex has encountered heavy resistance and has not
yet been embraced. Detractors claim that US regulators will never
authorise Mondex because it is harder to audit and control centrally.

Mondex is the only electronic purse scheme that proposes card-to-card
transfers between users without requiring that transactions be routed
through a central clearing mechanism. This will only encourage tax
evasion and money laundering, critics have said.

But Stewart said he was optimistic that regulators at the office for
Comptroller of the Currency and the federal Reserve Board would be
convinced of security and integrity of the Mondex scheme.

In mid-1995, Mondex got its first foothold in the US at Wells Fargo
Bank, which initiated a test among fewer than 100 employees. Jones said
he hopes the $50 billion-asset San Francisco bank will roll out the
system and become a charter member of the Mondex USA franchise.

Elsewhere, according to an industry observer, NationsBank and NBD
Michigan (National Bank of Detroit) are said to be in discussions with
Mondex. Spokesmen from the two banks declined to comment.

There is also speculation that Midland Marine Bank of Buffalo will
participate, since it is owned by the UK Midland Bank, the other
founder of Mondex.

In another significant development last month, National Westminster
Group, which created Mondex in conjunction with Midland Group, sold New
Jersey-based subsidiary NatWest Bancorp.

The bank, which owns retail branches in the New York City area and a
credit card bank based in Delaware, was purchased by Fleet Financial
Group of Boston in a cash deal worth $3.26 billion. Jones said it had
been pretty obvious that NatWest USA would be an important part of
Mondex USA, but that discussions have already begun with Fleet.

PORTUGUESE KEEN ON PURSE

PORTUGAL'S SOCIEDADE Interbancaria de Servicos (SIBS) says it is
holding talks with a number of countries over the transfer of
technology and know-how of its Porta Moedas electronic purse, which was
launched in Portugal last year.

"The talks taking place are on two levels", explains Dra Carmo Alvim,
SIBS's head of marketing. "On the one hand, we are helping our Spanish
counterparts to actually set up their own electronic purse and, on the
other hand, we are providing, on a more general level, basic know-how
and information to countries as diverse as Israel, Brazil, the UK,
France and Canada".

She added that the Spanish electronic purse project should be up and
running by mid-1996."Both SIBS and the Spanish banking sector are keen
to make the two systems mutually acceptable, which means the Portuguese
will be able to use their electronic purse in Spain, and vice versa.

SIBS says the number of electronic purses in circulation is rising
faster than had been expected. Luis Cid, head of SIBS, recently told
journalists that Portugal issued in the month of October alone what it
took the Danish three years to achieve.

However, he conceded that the numbers are still well below the 10
million cards SIBS expects to be in circulation within the next five
years.

SIBS has already sold around 360,000 cards to the country's banks.
Until October 1995, over 100,000 cards were in circulation, with a
total loaded value of Esc174 million ($1.16 million). In the same
period, there were 7,028 POS terminals in operation, 4,343 of which
were off-line terminals exclusively for the electronic purse. Of this
number, 43 had been integrated into vending machines of various kinds.

The value of the average payment transaction (of which there were over
685,000 in the first nine months of the electronic purse's career) is
Esc370 ($2.5), which substitute for petty cash payments.

SIBS also says that the upgrading of the country's ATMs to accept
electronic purse loading facilities is virtually completed and that the
electronic purse will be usable nationwide within two years.

CARTE BLEUE BANKS GO LIVE WITH PURCHASING

THE FRENCH banks belonging to Groupement Carte Bleue have finally gone
live with the purchasing card service on their range of chip-based
products.

This information and payment system is now on offer to large
corporations that process small-value purchases by the "blue" banks,
that is, Societe Generale, Banque National de Paris and Credit
Lyonnais.

The average transaction value of items processed by these corporations
is estimated by Carte Bleue to be about Fr2,500 ($500). At the moment,
these purchases are carried out from a distance (by telephone, fax,
minitel or ordinary mail) in 90 percent of cases.

Every Carte Bleue member bank will be able to market the purchasing
service, and to personalise it, should it wish to do so, in order to
satisfy the requirements of its client companies.

The purchasing system, as it is defined today, will work from a common
operational core, which will have to evolve in order to become richer
as its market develops both nationally and internationally.

In 1994, the Groupement Carte Bleue conducted two studies of the way
potential customer firms viewed the service. What emerged from them was
that 38 percent of those surveyed expressed an interest in the service.

A study carried out in 1994 by Andersen Consulting evaluated the French
potential for service purchasing to be more than Fr110 billion, but
only took into account the market involving the country's 500 largest
firms in terms of turnover.

Jean-Marc Bornet, the chief executive of Carte Bleue, told CI that he
had great confidence in the future of the purchasing service: "The
question arose as to whether the purchasing service would be
experimented jointly once it had appeared in the Carte Bleue catalogue,
but the Groupement finally decided against this.

"French banks will, in fact, start off with the new product at their
own individual pace. It should be remembered that a large number of
telematic services are already offered to companies by French banks,
and the role of the purchasing service is to enrich the services
already available".

AUSTRALIA GEARS UP FOR SMART REVOLUTION

RECENTLY IDENTIFIED as one of the smart card centres of the world,
Australian consumers are expected to embrace chip technology with
enthusiasm. However, central bank regulators in the country have
expressed reservations about a possible loss of revenue if stored-value
cards (SVC) take off.

According to a report published by Visa International, called Payments
2001, the number of chip-based cards in Australia will swell to 27
million by the year 2001. Meanwhile, the number of consumers holding
cards is expected to rise to 2.8 million by the same year.

One of the greatest breakthroughs that will be facilitated by smart
cards is the ability to load funds on to the card at home. This could
be the catalyst for a massive increase in the use of home banking
services, said the report.

The Australian market also has the benefit of a sophisticated
telecommunications infrastructure. "The hurdles to connectivity are
already coming down. One fundamental is the broad band cable which is
being laid through Australian suburbs and which will not only provide
Australians with Pay TV but also all the utility of two-way data
communication in cyberspace."

In a survey conducted by Visa, Australian consumers were asked to
evaluate three stored-value options - a disposable card, a stand-alone
reloadable card and a multifunction card. The survey found that 72
percent of respondents favoured some form of stored-value function. Of
that figure, 44 percent want the chip embedded on their existing
credit/debit/ATM card. However, a substantial 37 percent preferred a
disposable card, while the remaining 19 percent opted for a reloadable
card.

Interestingly, disposable cards were preferred by those consumers who
thought of buying the cards for family and friends as gifts. "Almost 50
percent of Australian consumers would buy disposable cards for someone
else, and 40 percent would buy stand-alone reloadable cards for
others."

Another finding of the report was that 88 percent of consumers wanted
the capability to reload value onto their SVC at any ATM or eftpos
device and about 46 percent wanted the option of reloading the card at
home through a special device.

Identifying and signing the right merchants was given as an essential
requirement for the success of stored-value cards. Petrol stations were
highlighted as the most important, with 61 percent saying they wanted
to use their card there. Meanwhile, 60 percent identified grocery
stores, 40 percent pointed to payphones, 34 percent buses and trains,
and 29 percent mentioned post offices.

One issue which has not been resolved is the reaction of regulators to
a potentially radical shift in the means of payments. At the moment,
central banks earn money from issuing notes and coins, called
seigniorage.

According to Ray Jones, assistant secretary of the business finance and
superannuation branch of the Australian Federal Reserve: "The fiscal
impact of stored value cards will depend upon the speed and extent of
their market penetration. A sudden loss of a substantial revenue stream
would naturally have some public finance implications, but whether this
is a likely outcome is by no means clear at the moment."

According to Ian Harper in an article in The Australian Financial
Review, "they [stored-value] represent the first real threat to the use
of currency notes and coins in everyday payments. The bank and the
Treasury fear this may at last be about to change. And they have much
to lose."

However, he went on to say "there does not appear to be any significant
downward trend in seigniorage earned by the banks", but he attributed
this to the fact that stored-value cards are in their infancy.

Harper predicts that the Reserve Bank will not allow this revenue
stream disappear if stored-value does take off. "The bank also earns
seigniorage by obliging banks to hold compulsory reserves with it and
paying them low rates of interest or none at all. The trouble is that
banks might not be the main players in stored-value cards.

"The real worry for the Reserve Bank and the Treasury is the prospect
of multiple issuers which have no connection with the banking system at
all and no reason to pay seigniorage to the Reserve Bank," said Harper.

NEW ISSUES - WORLD COLOR LONG TERM BUY

   Currently an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts, this company is a leading diversified commercial printer providing
digital prepress, press, multimedia, binding and distribution services to
customers in the magazine (an estimated 33% of 1995 net sales), catalog
(21%), direct mail (9%), commercial (30%), directory (7%), and new media
market sectors. Since the appointment of a new management team in May 1991,
the company has taken streamlining and other special pretax charges
totaling $196 million (including $38 million in the fourth quarter of
1995), invested more than $200 million in equipment and plant expansions to
position itself for growth and productivity improvements, and made nine
acquisitions having an aggregate purchase price of over $400 million.
   The company maintains 14 printing plants, one warehouse, one
prepress/warehouse facility, five prepress facilities, one
distribution/bindery facility, two distribution centers, and one multimedia
facility. The company supplies all of the ink and a substantial amount of
the paper it uses. An extensive network of sales offices located throughout
the U.S. is staffed by approximately 250 sales and marketing
representatives.
   Assuming exercise of the overallotment option, KKR is selling
approximately 12 million of the shares being offered, affiliates of Merrill
Lynch are selling about 2 million shares, and numerous less than one
percent holders are selling their shares. KKR's stake will be reduced to
50.1% (approximately 49% assuming exercise of the overallotment option).
Certain minority shareholders have agreed not to sell any of their
remaining shares for 120 days after the close of the offering, and the
company, KKR, and remaining stockholders have agreed not to do so for 180
days. As of October 1, 1995, debt was 59% of total capital. In 1995,
lenders increased the maximum available under the company's credit
facilities, of which about $89 million remains available.
   Since 1991, the actions of the new management have resulted in a
significant improvement in profitability. Measured by adjusted operating
income margin which excludes steamlining and other special charges,
profitability has increased from 3.4% of revenues in 1991 to 7.1% in the
first nine months of 1995. This has occurred despite that revenue growth
over that time has largely been derived from acquisitions and increases in
paper prices, offset to some extent by higher paper costs.
   Because of the company's substantial leverage, we think free cash flow
is a good method of valuation. Importantly, cash flow has been adequate to
pay down a substantial amount of acquired debt. The company projects
capital expenditures in 1996 will total $75 million and scheduled debt
principal payments total $21 million, leaving free cash flow by our
estimate of about $20.5 million, or $0.60 a share. We also expect free cash
flow will increase an average 40% annually over the next several years as
debt is repaid. Discounting projected free cash flow at the riskfree rate,
the stock price could increase 100% to 125% over a five year period. In the
short term we see the stock climbing to 22 to 24. We recommend purchase of
the shares as a long term holding.

NEW ISSUES - OMNIPOINT SHORT TERM BUY

   As a result of this company's work in developing core spread spectrum
technology (software and integrated circuits) and working prototypes based
on this technology for various wireless voice, data and digitized
compressed video transmission projects, the FCC awarded it a Pioneer's
Preference right to a 30 MHZ license to provide Personal Communications
Services (PCS) for the New York Major Trading Area (MTA). The New York MTA,
with 26.8 million people, has the highest population of any MTA in the
nation. The FCC determined the company's license fee at 85% of the average
per population price of the winning bids for the top 23 MTAs, times the New
York MTA's population. The company has been accruing interest on this
obligation at the prime rate and expects interest only payments to begin in
1996. The company is also participating in the Entrepreneurs' Band Auction
for small businesses for additional PCS licenses in each of the 493 Basic
Trading Areas.
   The Omnipoint System has been designated by a key industry standard
setting group as IS-661. IS-661 is one of four technical common air
interfaces (CAI) competing for adoption by PCS license holders, the others
being PCS-1900, a system similar to the digital wireless standard common
across Europe and adopted in many other countries, CDMA, and TDMA, both of
which are being upbanded to the 1900 MHz section of the radio spectrum from
current cellular technologies.
   Each CAI has its proponents among equipment manufacturers and service
providers. The Omnipoint System, as the company proposes to implement
IS-661, is a hybrid system that will interface with PCS-1900 based systems.
It also incorporates certain coding features of CDMA between cell sites,
but uses timing features of TDMA within cells to separate channels. The
company expects that initial capital costs to deploy a commercial IS-661
system, incremental capital costs per subscriber, and ability to rapidly
scale up a system as demand grows, will enable it to offer a variety of
wireless services at lower costs than current cellular and wireline
competitors.
   The company has entered into or committed to agreements with Northern
Telecom for Omnipoint to buy, and for Telecom to sell infrastructure
equipment and finance system buildout, up to $612 million. It has also
entered into a series of agreements with Ericsson for, among other things,
the development of dual mode IS-661/PCS-1900 handsets. The agreements
obligate the company to purchase $250 million of infrastructure equipment
and $100 million of handsets from Ericsson, which will provide up to $375
million of vendor financing. Additional handset development, manufacturing,
marketing and sale agreements have been entered into with JRC International
and Hansol Paper Co., the latter being primarily in Korea and other parts
of Asia.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used for interest payments on the New
York MTA license, for development and marketing of Omnipoint technology and
equipment, and in connection with additional PCS licenses, if any,
purchased by the company. Other than the New York MTA license obligation,
other debt as of September 30, 1995 totaled $26 million.
   The three largest shareholders are Avance Capital, which will own 22% of
the outstanding shares, Madison Dearborn Capital Partners, L.P. 16%, and
Allen & Co. 9.7%. Insiders and their affiliates in the aggregate will
control 64% of the stock. About 1.2 million shares will be eligible for
sale in the public market beginning 90 days after the offering closes, and
26.4 million upon expiration of the underwriter's 180 day lockup period.
   Although IS-661 has obtained separate CAI designation, IS-661 systems
are designed to be compatible with PCS-1900 systems. PacBell and Bell
South, which will construct PCS-1900 systems in certain license areas, have
tentatively agreed to provide each others' subscribers with roaming
capability in the others' license areas. The company expects to have a
pilot system in operation in New York City in the first half of 1996, and
to begin wider deployment by the end of the year.
   Significant revenues will not occur until 1997, even if all goes
according to plan, which it will likely not, judging by the experience of
other wireless service firms. We believe losses will be sustained through
1999. Nevertheless, based on per POP valuations of wireless services firms,
we think the stock price will initially rise from the 13 to 15 range
proposed for the offering, but is likely to be volatile as quarterly
results exceed or fall short of expectations. We recommend purchase of the
shares as a short term holding.

NEW ISSUES - VANSTAR SHORT TERM BUY

   This company provides extensive PC network infrastructure products and
services throughout the network life cycle which it divides into four, more
or less distinct stages: design and consulting, deployment, operation and
support, and enhancement and migration. The company exited the retail arena
in early 1994, which was conducted primarily through the Computerland
franchise business.
   The current business strategy is predicated on the belief that the
market for outsourced PC network services is growing at a compound annual
rate of more than 14%, and that profitability can grow at a faster rate
because the valued added services which comprise a growing percentage of
the company's business have higher margins than the traditional services
which it provided, such as product procurement and repair and maintenance.
   The company's technical workforce currently exceeds 2,200 employees
nationwide, including a rapidly expanding systems engineering force, which
grew from about 200 in March 1994 to over 600 as of October 1995. The
company will seek to expand its business globally by entering strategic
alliances with international partners. Over the past four quarters, about
225 customers purchased products and services totaling at least $1 million.
The domestic sales network as of October 31, 1995 consisted of over 540
field sales and service representatives. A variety of service automation
software products have been implemented to reduce the cost and enhance the
delivery of the services to the customer. Products from over 700 vendors
are provided.
   Proceeds from the sale of eight million shares for the company will be
used to repay debt. The company maintains a $425 million credit facility
with IBM Credit Corp. at prime plus 1.06%. As of July 31, 1995, long term
debt would have been 70% of committed capital on a pro forma basis,
however, this is somewhat misleading since a large portion of the credit
facility is used to finance inventory. Nynex Worldwide Services Group is
the selling stockholder. Nynex obtained the shares when it sold the assets
of its Nynex Business Centers business to the company in fiscal 1991.
Warburg Pincus Capital will own 35% of the stock after the offering.
Although our copy of the prospectus was incomplete in regard to future
sales of stock, we assume that most of the currently outstanding shares are
subject to a 180 day underwriter's lockup agreement and Rule 144 volume
limitations.
   The pressure to cut costs and eliminate non-core operations is likely to
keep the outsourcing trend intact over the next few years. We project
earnings growth at over 14% annually, but it is likely to be uneven. Given
that 1995 PC sales were so strong, growth in 1996 is apt to be particularly
weak by comparison. We view the shares as fairly valued if offered at 11
1/2, but recommend purchase in anticipation of buy recommendations from the
underwriters, after which we would sell the shares.

NEW ISSUES - IRON MOUNTAIN AVOID

   Approximately four trillion documents are generated each year in the
U.S., and paper remains, at least for now, the primary medium. About 80% of
the documents generated each year are not needed for frequent reference,
and can be considered inactive records, for which it provides storage
services in 66 facilities in 25 markets across the U.S. containing an
aggregate of 4.9 million square feet of space.
   As of September 30, 1995, Iron Mountain stored approximately 21 million
1.2 cubic foot cartons for 14,000 customers. New customers are obtained by
a dedicated sales force. An ongoing fee is collected for storage, and
nonrecurring fees are charged for storage materials and services, such as
document retrieval. The company also provides vital records services for
items such as master audio and video recordings, and provides courier
services via a fleet of approximately 200 vehicles. We believe that growth
in the number of documents generated and outsourcing of document storage
activities has resulted in an increase in the number of cartons stored
which has outpaced the 4% attrition rate experienced by the company due to
destruction or permanent removal. Internal growth has been augmented by
additions of new customers and acquisitions of other document storage
businesses.
   Proceeds from the shares sold on the company's behalf will be used to
redeem a warrant, fund several pending acquisitions and repay debt incurred
for other recently completed acquisitions. Long term debt on a pro forma
basis as of September 30, 1995 was 64% of total capital. About $17 million
was subsequently borrowed to fund recently completed acquisitions. CEO
Richard Reese will own 16% of the stock outstanding after the offering, and
Vincent J. Ryan will control 36%, including 20% held by Schooner Capital
Corp. The sellers are Schooner, Chase Manhattan Investment Holdings, and
Security Pacific Capital Investors, L.P. A small number of shares become
eligible for sale in the public market beginning 90 days after the
offering, but most of the currently outstanding shares are subject to a 180
day (360 day in the case of Ryan and Schooner) underwriter's lockup
agreement.
   Although there will be about $47 million of additional borrowing
capacity available under the company's credit agreement, we believe that
further leverage would necessitate the curtailment of planned capital
expenditures. It already appears that current obligations have been
extended to maintain debt levels at their current level. If additional debt
is assumed for more acquisitions, as is the company's plan, we think that
it will have difficulty meeting interest and scheduled principal repayments
after 1998. Scheduled payments this year of about $2 million, and of $3.3
million and $3.4 million in 1997 and 1998 should not be a problem, but the
$8.3 million payment in 1999 becomes difficult if the balance sheet is
leveraged further.
   How did the company get into its current financial position? We think
it overpaid for the businesses it has acquired, paying about 2.1X revenues,
which is the same ratio of our 1996 revenue projection to the proposed
market capitalization of equity plus debt. We would avoid the shares.

NEW ISSUES - HEARTSTREAM AVOID

   More than 350,000 people in the U.S. suffer sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)
each year. SCA is characterized by rapid and irregular heart beat, or
ventricular fibrillation, in which the heart's normal electrical signals
become disorganized and erratic, causing the heart to cease pumping blood
within a few minutes. Defibrillation involving the application of an
electric shock to the heart, causing it to resume a regular rhythm, is
necessary to prevent death from SCA. It has been documented that timely
defibrillation can boost the survival rate from SCA to over 70%. Often
paramedics or emergency medical technicians (EMTs) equipped and trained in
the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) do not arrive on site
quickly enough, resulting in average SCA survival rates in the U.S. of 5%.
AEDs use computer technology to interpret the patient's heartbeat to
determine if defibrillation is necessary. This contrasts with hospital
based defibrillation units with which most people are familiar, that
require medical personnel to interpret an electrocardiogram.
   This company has developed and clinically tested an AED which it
believes is easier to use and maintain, requires less training, and costs
less than current AEDs in use. The American Heart Association (AHA) has
endorsed the training and use of AEDs by ``first responders'', i.e. police
and fire personnel in addition the paramedics and EMTs, and The Department
of Transportation has adopted guidelines which include AED training for
EMTs beginning in 1995. The goal is that police and fire personnel, who
typically are on the scene prior to medical personnel, can administer AED
in a timely manner. Also, EMTs, who usually receive substantially less
training than paramedics, are typically not trained in the use of AEDs due
to the expense of training and purchasing AEDs for EMT ambulances.
   The company has conducted two clinical trials which show no difference
in efficacy between its AED, called the ForeRunner, and AEDs currently on
the market. The trials actually measured the efficacy of a method of
delivering the electric shock that uses lower energy relative to the
standard higher energy AEDs currently in use. A 510(k) application to the
FDA was submitted in December 1995 for clearance to market the ForeRunner
on the basis that it is substantially equivalent to AEDs that have been on
the market since before 1976.
   Proceeds from the offering and cash on hand, which together on a pro
forma basis totaled $49 million as of September 30, 1995, will be used to
fund product introduction, to build a sales and marketing organization, for
continuing research and development, and for working capital and general
corporate purposes. Long term obligations are nominal. Four venture fund
groups will own 5% or more of the stock to be outstanding after the
offering, including entities affiliated with Mayfield Fund 23%, Oak
Investment Partners 7%, Weiss, Peck & Greer 6%, and Medical Innovation Fund
II, L.P. 5%. Insiders in the aggregate will own 37%. Future sales of nearly
all of the shares currently outstanding are subject to a 180 day
underwriter's lockup agreement and Rule 144 volume limitations.
   Despite the submission of a 510(k) application to the FDA, we must
classify this offering as speculative. The FDA may require additional
clinical data or may rule that the ForeRunner does not qualify for pre-1976
device equivalency. The ForeRunner has never been tested in the field. The
low energy electrical stimulation which it uses does not meet current AHA
guidelines, and certain states have additional laws regarding which AEDs
may be used. The company and five of its founding employees are subject to
a lawsuit brought by their former employer alleging misappropriation of
trade secrets and tortious interference with business relations. Even if
all these issues are resolved, we believe it will take at least three or
four years for the company to become profitable. We would avoid the
shares.

NEW ISSUES - PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AVOID

   In 1994, worldwide expenditures on research and development by
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are estimated to have been $30
billion, of which this contract research organization (CRO) believes $1.5
billion was outsourced to CROs. Among the services which the company
provides are Phase I clinical testing, laboratory analysis, Phase II-IV
clinical trial management, clinical data management and biostatistical
analysis, treatment investigational new drug applications, medical writing
and regulatory compliance, and health care economics and outcomes
research.
   In the nine months ended September 30, 1995, the pharmaceutical industry
accounted for 74% of net revenues, biotechnology 16%, the National
Institutes of Health 8%, and other 2%. Therapeutic areas from which
revenues were derived were virology/AIDS/infectious diseases 30%,
gastroenterology/metabolic diseases 27%, critical care 11%,
pulmonary/allergy 11%, central nervous system 10%, and other 12%. At
September 30, 1995, there were 165 active contracts with about 110 clients
in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and the backlog was $50.2 million, versus
$21.6 million a year earlier.
   Contracts are based on specific project proposals developed by the
company's business development personnel in response to potential clients'
requests. We believe the contract cycle can be quite lengthy. Contracts are
usually on a fixed price basis, so the company bears the risk of cost
overruns. Senior management has experience with the regulatory process in
previous positions with Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham. At September 30,
1995, 86 employees had post-graduate degrees.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay debt incurred to make a
final S corporation distribution to current stockholders. Total debt
outstanding will equal 14% of total capitalization. The company will seek
to renegotiate the terms and the amount of its credit facility. Insiders
will own 77% of the shares outstanding after the offering. Most of the
currently outstanding shares become eligible for public sale under Rule 144
after a 180 day lockup period.
   We estimate revenues per employee in 1995 will be about $78,000, which
seems low. It is likely that the company has been adding significant
numbers of business development, research and other personnel, which have
not been reflected yet in revenue growth. This is supported by the
substantial increase in backlog and in the rise in selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from 20.4% in 1993 to
33.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 1995. The revenue per employee
may be misleading. Even so, we find it difficult to believe that
compensation levels at the company are adequate to motivate professional
research personnel. A recently adopted stock option plan should aid
employee retention. The company has likely benefited in its hiring from
downsizing of R&D staffs at major pharmaceutical firms that have been
acquired.
   Still, we think that a business in which the overwhelming key to success
is the performance of its employees in conducting research under fixed
price contracts, in which many variables can lead to unpredictable results
and cost overruns, and which is not capital intensive, is better suited to
be a privately held entity. Minority shareholders are apt to find their
interests do not always come first. Moreover, at 30X our $0.50 EPS for 1996
on revenues of $55 million (with 24% more shares outstanding), which
represent 43% and 47% gains over projected EPS of $0.35 (pro forma for
income tax provision) and revenues of $37.5 million, we believe the shares
are amply valued. We would avoid the shares.

NEW ISSUES - NICE SYSTEMS AVOID

   Everyone is aware of the increased use of automated voice systems to
handle everyday business communications. Examples include voice mail and
automated call routing. Increasingly, computer telephony integration
applications are being developed for more important transactions such as
brokerage orders and mail order pharmaceuticals, for example. Voice records
have long been kept for critical communications such as emergency response
centers and air traffic control facilities. Organizations' growing need to
record, process, and store large amounts of voice data has resulted in the
introduction of digitally based voice logging systems that can handle large
volumes of calls at lower costs.
   This Israeli based company's principal product, NiceLog, can record,
store and retrieve up to thousands of analog and digital telephone lines
and radio channels, and enables simultaneous access by multiple users.
NiceLog incorporates enhanced digital networking and voice processing
technologies in the areas of computer telephony integration, digital signal
processing, mass storage and database management. It uses an open
architecture that provides connectivity options to networks such as Novell,
IPX, and TCP/IP using DOS, Windows, Windows NT, and UNIX operating systems
(a Windows 95 version is expected to be introduced in 1996), and
telecommunications interfaces such as T1, E1, ISDN, and analog trunks.
   An add-on module, Call Logging System, enables prompt location and
retrieval of data records according to several key record details, such as
time of call, duration, extension number, and calling number. The company
has sold hundreds of NiceLog units (each capable of handling 96 channels),
to more than 150 users worldwide. A fax logger and a logging system for
customers with requirements in the eight to 24 channel range are under
development. The company also develops and sells communications
intelligence systems, primarily the NiceFix, which enables users to detect,
locate, and monitor transmissions, or ``get a fix'' on the transmitting
object, and provides engineering services for other defense applications.
   The company primarily sells its products to distributors specializing in
the voice logging market. For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, 86%
of total sales were to customers outside of Israel and 52% were to
customers in the U.S. The company has arrangements with IPC Information
Systems and Etrali, two trading room switching equipment suppliers, to
market its products, and with Northern Telecom and Aspect
Telecommunications to market the compatibility features of NiceLog with
their automated call distribution systems. Contracts have been won to
supply up to 800 U.S. air traffic control centers with NiceLog systems over
seven years and for the air traffic logging system at the new Hong Kong
airport. These two contracts have a combined value of $3.4 million to $13
million, for a period of one to seven years.
   Proceeds will be used for working capital and other general corporate
purposes. The ordinary shares trade on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and on
12/27/95 closed at 10 13/16. In October 1995, the company sold its 57%
stake in NiceCom, a developer of advanced data communications switches, to
3Com for $53 million, and subsequently paid dividends of $2.10 per share.
No long term debt is outstanding. Insiders as a group will own 19% of the
shares outstanding after the offering.
   The U.S. air traffic system contract award is a major win because it
gives credibility to the company in the U.S. Still, the company has
generally not been profitable, and despite the contract award, we do not
think the company's products have a clear technological advantage over
competing systems. Most costs are recorded in New Israeli Shekels, while
most sales are made in, and the reporting currency is, dollars. Israeli
inflation in recent years has exceeded the rate of devaluation of the
shekel against the dollar, thereby lowering dollar earnings. This and the
dividends paid after the sale of NiceCom made the shares more attractive to
Israeli investors, who may have pushed up the stock price, despite the lack
of dollar profits.
   It is not assured that a liquid market will develop for the ADSs. The
recent dollar equivalent share price in Tel Aviv is about 23X our $0.45 EPS
estimate for 1996. We do not believe this adequately discounts the risks of
buying the stock, and we would avoid the shares.

Underwriters: Lehman Brothers; Oppenheimer. Offering: 2,000,000 ADSs (all

NEW ISSUES - PHYMATRIX SHORT TERM BUY

   Formerly known as Continuum Care Corp., this physician practice
management company provides or has entered into agreements to provide
management services to 112 physicians, including 56 oncologists, and
provides related medical services. It also owns a 44% interest in a newly
formed management services organization for a physician association based
in Connecticut of over 240 multi-specialty physicians and has a 50%
interest in a medical facility development company. The business is the
conglomeration of several physician management firms operated under common
control by CEO Abraham D. Gosman, who is also CEO of Meditrust and founded
The Mediplex Group, which was acquired by Sun Healthcare Group in June
1994.
   Several factors are combining to put the solo physician or small
partnership practice at a disadvantage to management organizations. For
example, the information systems that are necessary to respond to the
requirements of managed care organizations and the Medicare and Medicaid
programs are costly and usually beyond the means of most practices. By
joining a physician management organization, physicians can cut costs and
reduce the volatility of their earnings. In other words, the changing
payment structure of the U.S. healthcare system has made the practice
management model a better deal for most physicians. Healthcare reforms
being proposed should only bring more pressure to bear on physicians to
join management groups.
   Up to $32 million of offering proceeds will be used to repay
indebtedness to Mr. Gosman and about $50 million will be used to repay
obligations guaranteed by, or to substitute for collateral provided by
Gosman. On a pro forma basis, long term debt would be 18% of total capital.
The company is negotiating to obtain an acquisition/working capital line of
credit. Gosman will own 40% of the stock outstanding after the offering.
All of the shares to be issued to him and other management and founding
stockholders are subject to the holding requirement of the Securities Act,
and may not be sold in the open market until the second anniversary of the
closing date of the offering.
   The company intends to pursue an aggressive acquisition strategy, so
future results may vary substantially from our estimates. Industry
fundamentals favor physician management organizations, and because only a
small percentage of the approximate 650,000 physicians in the nation have
joined a management group, we think there are ample acquisition candidates.
As the company brings more physicians within its structure, it will realize
economies of scale and cost efficiencies will result in much improved
margins.
   We are projecting a pro forma loss for 1995 of $0.20 a share on revenues
of $128 million, including a $2.5 million charge in the fourth quarter to
write down certain acquired assets at their book value. In 1996, our
forecast is $160 million in revenues and EPS of $0.25. Tentatively in 1997,
revenues could top $200 million, and EPS could more than double. We
recommend purchase of the shares as a short term holding, with a price
target of 21.

NEW ISSUES - WILMAR SHORT TERM BUY

   Outsourcing is one of the important trends in American history. This
company markets and distributes repair and maintenance products principally
to the apartment housing market, and in 1995 initiated sales to the
hospitality, health care, and institutional markets.
   The primary marketing tool is the Wilmar Master Catalog, containing over
14,000 skus of standard and specialty plumbing products, 36% of sales in
the first nine months of 1995, electrical 19%, hardware 16%, chemical and
janitorial 6%, appliance parts 5%, window and floor coverings 5%, HVAC 5%,
paint and accessories 4%, and other products 4%. The catalog is
complemented by a local direct sales force in 34 markets and a telesales
force in other markets which maintain frequent contact with the company's
19,500 active customers. These efforts are augmented by national and
regional accounts serviced by senior management and by participation in
Buyers Access, a group purchasing organization of apartment property
management firms. Members of Buyers Access accounted for 23% of sales in
the nine months ended September 30, 1995.
   The company operates 10 distribution centers and offers next day
delivery for orders over $25, either by its own trucks or a contract
service. The company has found that customers order significantly more in
areas in which it offers next day delivery. Standard or customized billing
services can be provided, and electronic order access is available. The
company has developed foreign sourcing of a broad array of private label
products, which accounted for 18% of net sales in the first nine months of
1995.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay all company debt and
redeem all outstanding preferred stock. In March 1995, CEO William Green,
the sole stockholder at the time, sold a substantial interest in the
company to Summit Investors. Additional funding was borrowed to complete
the November 1995 acquisition of One Source, operator of a supply
distribution business in Miami, for $3.7 million. As a result of the
recapitalization, Green and Summit Investors have withdrawn $28 million in
capital from the company.
   Green will convert $5 million of preferred stock into common shares at
the offering price, giving him a 28% interest after the offering. Summit
Investors paid $55,000 for their 3.1 million shares, or 32% interest. Sales
of additional shares of common stock to the public are subject to a 180 day
underwriter's lockup agreement, although sales of the shares purchased by
the Summit Investors do not become eligible for sale under Rule 144 until
March 1997, unless the SEC amends the Rule to cut the holding period from
two to one years. Such an amendment is under consideration.
   We think the key to the company's growth has been the value added
services which it provides to property managers. Many properties are
heavily leveraged or under capitalized, so maintaining a repair and
maintenance products inventory is just one more headache. The company
solves this problem, and we believe most competing firms do not provide a
similar breadth of products and services.
   We think the company will continue to grow, gaining market share and
forcing out weaker, local firms. It made its first acquisition only last
November at a fraction of the value which the underwriters have placed on
the firm. Other acquisitions at favorable prices are likely to be available
for some time. Geographic expansion and new end market penetration also
present strong growth opportunities. The hospitality, health care, and
institutional markets accounted for only 1.5% of net sales in the first
nine months of 1995. We believe the company covers less than 50% of the
nation currently. On a pro forma basis assuming the acquisition occurred at
the beginning of 1995, we estimate EPS was $0.45 a share on sales of $72.5
million. Pro forma assuming the offering and related transactions occurred
on 1/1/96, we project EPS of $0.60 on sales of $90 million. It is still
early in the IPO cycle for outsourcing firms, which typically means that
the success of the first offering raises the valuation standard until the
quality of firms looking to capitalize on the trend deteriorates. We
recommend purchase of the shares as a short term holding with a price
target of 15.

NEW ISSUES - FYI INC. IPO

   Simultaneous with the consummation of the offering, this company will
acquire the seven companies, all of which provide document management
services primarily to health care institutions, professional services (such
as legal services) firms, and financial institutions. One or more of the
founding firms provide micrographic services, electronic image processing,
active document and file storage and maintenance, inactive document
archival storage, and information and database management services. These
services are provided for all three target markets.
   In addition, certain of the companies provide medical records release
services to health care institutions, litigation support to professional
services firms, and remittance processing to financial institutions. The
founding companies have been in business an average of 22 years and operate
33 facilities in 21 states. Selling is conducted at the local level,
typically by senior management, but the company expects to add a direct
sales force where appropriate.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used to pay the cash portion of the
purchase price for the founding companies, to repay debt, and for general
corporate purposes including acquisitions. Future acquisitions are likely
to be financed wholly or in part with common stock. Long term debt is
nominal. Negotiations are ongoing with a leading financial institution for
lines of credit in the aggregate amount of $25 million to be used for
additional acquisitions, working capital, and general corporate purposes.
   Insiders will own 39% of the stock after the offering. All of the
stockholders of the company, including the former owners of the founding
companies will be contractually prohibited from selling any of the shares
for a period of two years after the acquisitions are closed. Recently, in
November 1995, Ed H. Bowman, Jr. was appointed CEO of the company. Mr.
Bowman's previous experience was with First Data, HBO & Co., and Andersen
Consulting. Chief Development Officer Thomas C. Walker has been responsible
for the acquisition or divestiture of over 100 businesses over a 29 year
period.
   We think that the value added services which the company provides is a
more attractive business than the archival storage business of Iron
Mountain, another firm which is planning an IPO. Both firms are likely to
benefit from the growing trend for businesses to outsource their document
management operations and from consolidation within the industry. More
importantly, F.Y.I.'s proposed market capitalization is about 1.2X our
projection of 1996 revenues for the founding companies, versus the 2.1X at
which Iron Mountain is seeking to sell shares. Our pro forma combined EPS
estimate for 1995 is $0.85 on revenues of $47.5 million. Assuming
acquisitions add about $10 million in revenue in 1996, we project total
revenues of $65 million and EPS of $0.90 on 37% more shares outstanding. We
recommend purchase of the shares.

organization of the company.

Investment opinion

   We are recommending the purchase of SGS-THOMSON as a low-risk way to
benefit from the strong demand expected in the semiconductor industry over
the next several years. Semiconductor stocks have been hammered in recent
months as investors have chosen to take profits in light of weaker than
expected results being reported by several companies, and amid signs of
pricing pressures in the highly visible memory segment. However, we do not
believe these factors portend an overall slowdown in the market, but rather
reflect isolated pockets of weakness in certain segments of the industry.
   SGS-THOMSON should continue to prosper in this uncertain environment, as
its product and geographic diversity makes it less susceptible to the risks
of more narrowly focused semiconductor companies. In addition, this
diversity gives us confidence in revenue and earnings visibility, a factor
that should be highly prized by investors during 1996.
   Finally, the volatility seen in the last several months underscores the
need for careful investment selection in this group. As such, we recommend
focusing on stocks that are not overly exposed to one industry or product
line and that can be purchased at a low multiple to future earnings.
SGS-THOMSON meets this criteria at just 7.4X our estimate for 1996 and
should be purchased by investors seeking above-average capital
appreciation.

Overview

   SGS-THOMSON is a leading manufacturer of semiconductor chips and devices
for a variety of end markets. The company sports a diversified line-up of
some 3000 products that are sold to more than 1500 customers, including
OEMs in the computer systems (27% of sales in 1995's first nine months),
telecommunications (23%), consumer products (19%), industrial (21%) and
automotive (10%) industries. Revenues are also well balanced globally,
with Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Japan accounting for 47%, 25%,
24% and 4%, respectively, of revenues in 1995's first nine months.
   The company's principal focus is on differentiated products (51% of
revenues in 1995's first nine months), a segment which mainly contains
analog and mixed-signal (analog/digital) integrated circuits (ICs). Analog
ICs provide the critical link between electronic systems and a variety of
variables including sound, light, temperature or speed. Mixed-signal
circuits combine analog and digital functionality on a single-chip to
process both analog signals and digital data. During 1994, SGS was the #1
worldwide producer of analog and mixed-signal devices.
   Because of the close relationships needed with customers to design
differentiated products, SGS-THOMSON is less vulnerable to pricing
pressures than commodity producers. In addition, these products have longer
life cycles than commodity devices, are less susceptible to technological
obsolescence and cost less to make as older and more reliable manufacturing
processes can be employed. Market projections are for differentiated
products to grow at a 21% annual growth rate through 1998.
   The balance of SGS's revenues are logic and memories (24% of revenues
in 1995's first nine months), discrete (16%), and standard & commodities
(9%). The company's logic devices, which include microprocessors,
microcontrollers and digital signal processors (DSPs), are generally
differentiated from competitive offerings by patents and specialized
product design skills. In contrast, the company's non-volatile memory
products (EPROMs, EEPROMs, SRAMs, flash memories, chips for smartcards) are
generally considered more commodity in nature and mainly differentiated by
price. The company does not manufacture DRAM memory chips. During 1994, SGS
was the #2 worldwide producer of non-volatile memories.
   SGS-THOMSON Holding II controls 69% of the outstanding shares and is
equally owned by a consortium of French and Italian shareholders that are
indirectly controlled by their respective governments.

Targeted products should help drive top line growth

   Despite its broad-based product portfolio, the company is also well
positioned to benefit from exposure to several promising growth segments in
the semiconductor industry. MPEG (motion picture experts group) chips,
which utilize advanced digital video compression to improve the quality of
video and audio, are gaining widespread acceptance in the fast-growing
multimedia computer segment. The company was the leading worldwide MPEG-2
supplier in 1994 and market forecasts are for the MPEG market to reach $2
billion in 1996, up from $600 million in 1995. The company is also
targeting the fast growing flash memory market. Flash memories can be
erased and reprogrammed electrically without having to be physically
removed from a system, like EPROMs. Because of their flexibility, low cost
and small size, the use of flash memories is expected to proliferate.
According to In-Stat, a Scottsdale, Arizona-based research firm, the flash
memory market is expected to grow 32% in 1996 from about $1.3 billion in
1995. Longer term, we expect the company to benefit from its license
agreement with Cyrix. Under the agreement, the company has the option to
manufacture and sell Cyrix's line of microprocessors, including its highly
touted M1 chip that is set to challenge Intel's Pentium family. Volume
production is set for 1996's second quarter but any meaningful contribution
is more likely to come in the 1997 time frame.

SGS benefiting from strong industry demand

   Revenues and earnings were up 40% and 37%, respectively, in the three
months ended September 30, 1995, and 34% and 32% for the nine month period.
The company has benefited from strong global demand for semiconductors
across all key product categories and geographies. We are estimating
revenue growth of about 25% in 1996, which assumes that the company will
grow in line with projected industry growth rates. The Semiconductor
Industry Association has forecast a 26% increase in worldwide semiconductor
sales for 1996, but we believe the company's growth rate is likely to be
slightly lower due to its lack of exposure to the fast-growing DRAM
market.
   Gross margins have trended down from the 42% rate experienced in 1994
and the first quarter of 1995, mainly due to costs associated with capacity
additions. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by recent management comments
that margins could range between 40% and 42% in 1996. Since margins are
currently at the low end of this range, we have built in some upside in our
forecast with a 41% gross margin estimate.
   The company continues to increase spending at healthy levels in an
effort to keep pace with growing demand. SG&A expenses grew as a percentage
of sales in 1995, excluding a $15 million non-recurring item, owing to
greater marketing efforts. The company continues to spend aggressively on
research and development, a trend we view positively. We expect little
diversion from these spending trends in 1996, and have conservatively
targeted these categories to grow cumulatively at rates slightly below our
25% earnings growth estimate.
   We are forecasting earnings of $4.25 for 1996, up 12% from our $3.80
estimate for 1995. The earnings gain is being restricted by an increase in
the tax rate to 26% from an estimated 20%. In 1995, SGS realized certain 
tax breaks from the initiation of capital expenditure programs in certain
countries. We also expect a 6% increase in the number of shares
outstanding, reflecting the October 1995 public offering of 8.9 million
shares at US$43.50 a share.

Company adding capacity to address demand

   SGS-THOMSON is aggressively expanding manufacturing capacity over the
next several years to meet projected industry demand. The company has
applied 1994 and 1995 investments to three new front-end fabrication
plants, two of which are now in operation. In addition, two older plants
are being converted to process newer and larger wafer sizes. The company is
expected to use the proceeds of US$377 million from its October public
offering to help fund these additions. Capital spending in 1995 is expected
to total some $900 million.

Is it time to buy semiconductor stocks?

   Semiconductor stocks went on a roller coaster ride in 1995, with an
impressive surge seen from the beginning of the year through September. As
tracked by the S&P Semiconductor Index, semiconductor stocks rose by more
than 70% during that time frame. This performance was then followed by
extreme volatility and subsequent profit taking that saw many semiconductor
issues fall by 30% to 40% from their highs. The S&P Semiconductor Index
finished up only 35% for the year. Is the 1995 sell-off a harbinger of
things to come for 1996?
   We don't believe so. Industry fundamentals are in place for selected
semiconductor issues to do very well in 1996. Our bias would be towards the
more broadly diversified companies versus companies that are overly exposed
to a particular industry, customer or product line. Furthermore, we would
stay away from companies specializing on more price-sensitive, commodity
products. We think this criteria is critical as pockets of softness are
beginning to surface in various segments of the market, particularly in the
commodity segment. We do not believe this portends a dramatic decline in
the demand for semiconductors, but rather a pause from the overheated
consumption levels of 1995 and heightened uncertainty about longer term
growth rates in key personal computer and telecommunications industries.
Our view is that growth in these segments will remain strong, although not
at the rates seen in previous years. In addition, the proliferation of
semiconductors in automobiles, electronics and appliances should complement
nicely the growth in PCs and phones. In summary, we expect semiconductor
issues to remain volatile over the next several months, but for investors
to eventually revisit higher quality names that can prosper in this
fast-changing industry.

Valuation

   Valuations on all semiconductor issues have come down dramatically since
the latter part of 1995, and many now sport single-digit P/E multiples on
1996 earnings. While we believe many of these issues warrant this type of
multiple because of imminent pricing pressures and the lack of clean
earnings visibility, other stocks have been unduly punished by overly harsh
investor sentiment towards the group.
   We believe SGS-THOMSON is one of those issues, as its broadly
diversified product line and customer base will prove to be a buffer
against periodic pockets of softness that inevitably surface in end
markets. In our opinion, the company's diversity effectively lowers the
risk of a customer or product driven event slowing sales and earnings
momentum. When coupled with the current low valuation on the shares, SGS is
likely to be an investor favorite when positive sentiment returns to the
group.
   With the shares trading at just 7.4X our 1996 estimate of $4.25 a share
and down from the high of 57 1/2, we see a strong likelihood of P/E
expansion as semiconductor stocks eventually return to favor. Based on our
favorable long term views of the industry, we can easily rationalize a P/E
multiple of 10 on 1996 earnings, giving the shares a value of $42.50, up
33% from current levels. We would also note that this valuation may prove
conservative based on what we view as the company's 15%-20% long term
growth rate. Based on the its low risk profile along with strong underlying
growth prospects, we recommend that investors accumulate the shares for
above average capital gains.

BIO-TECHNOLOGY GENERAL (BTGC, 5 7/8, NASDAQ) EMERGING GROWTH

By:
Thomas Tirney


Investment Opinion

   Bio-Technology General (BTG) is an overlooked biopharmaceutical with
excellent growth potential, several commercialized products, and a
promising drug pipeline. Lead products include BioTropin, authentic human
growth hormone (hGH); and Oxandrin, an anabolic steroid approved in various
indications for weight gain.
   BTG sells hGH overseas; the worldwide hGH market totals about $800
million to $1 billion. The company markets Oxandrin domestically, and U.S.
market could easily top $100 million. Both drugs are still in the early
stages of their product cycle and have yet to capture a meaningful share of
their markets; revenue growth has substantial upside potential. The most
promising pipeline drug is Androtest-SL, a sublingual form of testosterone,
which is being prepared for a New Drug Application with the FDA. 
Androtest-SL will be marketed to hypogonadal males and men with
testosterone deficiencies. The U.S. market is valued at about $625 million
and is growing approximately 16% a year.
   We predict revenue growth of 45%+ through 1997 and estimate earnings in
1995 at break-even, those in 1996 at $0.15 per share, and $0.45 in 1997. 
As BTG turns cash-flow positive in 1996 and with over $12 million in cash,
we doubt the company will see the need to do an offering of shares (all the
rage in biotechs these days) or raise capital through debt.
   Our 12-month price target is $12 based on a reasonable price/earnings
ratio of 27X 1997 earnings. Considering that most publicly traded
biotechnology companies, even 1995's success stories like Agouron
Pharmaceuticals and Cephalon have no immediate earnings expectations nor
any commercial drug products (no P/E's either), Bio-Technology General has
a compelling investment profile based on the fundamentals in this
high-growth, high-risk sector.

Overview

   This small-cap biopharmaceutical develops and manufactures
pharmaceuticals and genetically engineered products. BTG focuses on drugs
that treat endocrinology disorders, cardio/pulmonary diseases, opthalmic,
and skin disorders. Through marketing partners and distribution agreements,
the company sells its products in Western Europe, Japan, Israel, Canada,
the U.S. and Mexico.
   BTG's flagship drug is called Bio-Tropin, human growth hormone (hGH),
and is used to treat short stature, growth hormone deficiency, and
dwarfism. hGH is secreted from the pituitary gland and controls important
physiological functions essential to normal development and maturation. The
worldwide market for hGH is very large, estimated between $850 million and
$1 billion, and growing by about 10% each year. The major geographic
markets are the U.S. with a $300 million market potential, Western Europe
at $250 million, and Japan, slightly less than the U.S. Currently, BTG is
selling Bio-Tropin in Western Europe and Japan through licensees, as well
as in other smaller markets in East Asia and Latin America.
   Bio-Tropin accounted for approximately $7.2 million of BTG revenues in
1994 (65% of the total) mostly through sales in Japan by licensee JCR
Pharmaceuticals. JCR began selling Bio-Tropin in mid-1993 and is starting
to make inroads on capturing a more significant portion of the Japanese
market. Sales contributions from its Western Europe market was slight in
1994, as its licensee, the Ferring Group, had a late start: sales to the
Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden commenced in 4Q 1994. During late 1995,
Ferring started selling in the U.K., France, Spain, Denmark, Belgium,
Ireland, and Luxembourg. The 1995 comparisons in both the Japan and Western
Europe market have been very favorable and as Bio-Tropin is still in a
``launch stage'', projected growth rates are high. We estimate BioTropin
sales from Japan in 1995 at $11 million and will grow about 15% through
1997. In Western Europe, revenue contributions will approximate $2.3
million in 1995 and grow at 45%+ through 1997.

Problems with BioTropin in the United States may have clouded investors'
perception of the stock

   Unfortunately, BioTropin's biggest and most lucrative market, the United
States, is closed off . After obtaining FDA approval to market Bio-Tropin
in the United States, Genentech filed a suit claiming patent infringement
and was able to prevent BTG from selling its hGH domestically. Genentech
is, of course, trying to preserve market share of its own hGH drugs in
America. In August 1995, Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical was also
slapped with a preliminary injunction by Genentech when it tried to sell
hGH products in the U.S., as well. BTG has appealed the ruling and expects
a decision by March 1996. Although there is a good chance that the company
could succeed in overturning the injunction, we are not including the
possibility of U.S. sales in our earnings model. Whatever happens with
the court case, we believe that Bio-Technology's present markets for
Bio-Tropin as well as revenues from other products will promulgate adequate
earnings growth in 1996 without U.S. sales.

Oxandrin addresses an underserved and growing market

   The problems related to Bio-Tropin has muddied the waters in relation to
the company's other promising products. In the unfolding of Genentech's
injunction, investors have forgotten about Oxandrin, BTG's approved drug
for weight gain. Oxandrin is an anabolic steroid used in patients suffering
from severe weight loss (``wasting syndrome'') due to chronic infection,
extensive surgery, or trauma. Wasting syndrome, clinically known as
cachexia, is a metabolic disruption frequently occurring in patients with a
compromised immune system. Cachexia causes the body to break down protein
stores to meet energy requirements rather than first using stores of fat.
The combination of losing body weight and muscle mass in a seriously ill
patient leads to a life threatening condition.
   Oxandrin has distinct advantages over the current crop of therapies used
in wasting syndrome. Megace, an injectable anabolic steroid, has a higher
liver toxicity profile and also may lead to androgenic effects in female
patients. Megace has also demonstrated limited efficacy in weight gain
through adding lean muscle mass. Weight gain with Megace adds mostly water
and fat. Human growth hormone, while effective in adding weight, is
prohibitively expensive at over $50,000 per treatment year. Reimbursement
for hGH in this indication is not expected by many insurance companies nor
from state Medicaid or AIDS Drug Assistance programs. Oxandrin on the other
hand, can be taken orally, halts weight loss, adds lean muscle mass, and
costs about $20 per daily dosage (roughly $6,000 per treatment year).
   Oxandrin, as discussed, is already approved for a variety of
indications. Additionally, BTG is trying to expand the labeling of Oxandrin
through Treatment Investigative New Drug trials. Treatment IND status
allows the company to be reimbursed during the trial. A Phase III
Treatment IND trial in AIDS cachetic patients is going forward in 1996 and
a Treatment IND trial for Turners Syndrome has already been completed. The
Treatment IND could ideally generate a revenue stream of $8 million
although our forecasts are more conservative at $5 million in 1996. 
Approximately 75,000 AIDS patients in the United States are cachetic.
   Severe weight loss is not just a symptom of AIDS patients. Cancer and
aging are two vast markets in which Oxandrin can easily be adopted. BTG has
a dialogue with medical specialists treating wasting conditions and
oncologists concerning Oxandrin's use. Cachetic cancer patients number
between 250,000 to 400,000 in the United States alone. We believe the
current labeling of Oxandrin will allow it to be given to cachetic cancer
patients.
   In November 1995, Bio-Technology General announced an alliance with
Quantum Health Resources to distribute Oxandrin nationally. Quantum's
therapies and services are provided through four regional centers, 20
licensed branches, and 17 service branches throughout the United States. 
Quantum's expertise is in long-term chronic disorders and specialized
disease management where the needs of patients differ markedly from acute
or short-term illnesses. Due to Quantum's recent problems with its mainstay
hemophilia service unit, we believe Quantum will place a strong emphasis
on growing Oxandrin business.

BioLon's smaller revenue contributions round out BTG's drug portfolio

   BioLon is a sodium hyaluronate product used in cataract surgery and
intraocular lens transplantation. It is a high-viscosity, gel-like fluid
which also has applications in dry eye syndrome and as a general contact
lens solution. Marketing partners sell BioLon in Canada, Spain, South
Korea, India, Mexico, and Israel. Labaoratoire Chauvin is launching BioLon
in Europe during 1996 and a New Drug Application is planned to be filed in
the U.S. Upjohn-Pharmacia sells hyaluronic acid in the United States under
the trade name Healon. Healon goes off patent in February 1996. Revenue
growth from BioLon will come principally from the U.S. and to a lesser
extent, Europe. Although competition will no doubt be fierce, revenue
contributions from BioLon will approximate $4 million in 1996 and about $6
million in 1997.

Androtest-SL represents the company's most promising pipeline drug

   This pipeline drug is a sublingual form of testosterone that is absorbed
in the bloodstream through the mucosal membrane under the tongue.
Androtest-SL is designed to treat hypogonadism, a testosterone deficiency
that affects about 250,000 males in the United States alone. Androtest-SL
is also being developed to treat delay of growth and puberty which affects
about 80,000 boys (U.S. market). Hypogonadal males, either through a
constitutional deficiency or through aging, suffer lower testosterone
levels which leads to impotence, suppressed libido, and loss of muscle
mass.
   Current therapies include testosterone injections, scrotal patches, and
transdermal patches attached to the upper thighs and stomach area. While
the intramuscular injections are being abandoned in favor of the new
transdermal patches (such as those marketed by Theratech and Alza), we
believe that Androtest-SL will provide an even more convenient alternative
for hypogonadal males. The obvious disadvantage that transdermal patches
have compared to injections is delivery. However, the patch must be worn
constantly which may lead to irritation and discomfort. As an oral tablet
taken three times a day, Androtest-SL provides a convenient alternative to
patches and painful injection.
   The drug has proved effective in Phase III trials and is being prepared
for registration with the FDA. An NDA filing is expected at the latest by
mid-1996 with sales commencing as early as mid-1997. Androtest-SL has
Orphan Drug status for constitutional delay of growth and puberty. Like the
Oxandrin market, the hypogonadal market is a segment that hasn't been
properly addressed in the past. Competing transdermal patch companies like
Alza and Theratech are attempting to expand this market for men with
impotency, mild testosterone deficiency, and males that experience lower
testosterone levels because of aging. Under this criteria, the expanded
market numbers between 3 million and 5 million males in the United States.
But even without such indications, Androtest-SL's ease of use and
competitive profile may help it capture as much as $12 million in revenues
when marketing commences in 1997.
   BioTropin, Oxandrin, BioLon, and Androtest-SL constitute the products
which will generate earnings growth in the next five years. Other products
currently being sold include psoriasis treatment, Silkis, sold in Europe
through marketing partner Cilag S.A. and Delatestryl, an injectible
testosterone product being phased out in favor of Androtest-SL. Aside from
Androtest-SL, drugs in development include Porcine Growth Hormone for the
production of leaner pork products; OxSODrol (Phase II/III trials) for the
prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns; and Bio-Hep-B, a
third generation vaccine against the hepatitis B virus.

Financial summary and valuation

   We're expecting Bio-Technology General to post break-even numbers when
it reports its fourth quarter and year-end results sometime in February
1996. Third quarter 1995 net income was $0.00 per share, which excluded an
extraordinary gain of $0.03 due to debt forgiveness. Bio-Technology General
reached a major turning point in 1995 as its revenues (including interest
income) matched its expenses and the company demonstrated the ability to go
forward in 1996 as a profitable company.
   The company will probably have a burn-rate of approximately $5 million
for 1995 and end the year with about $12 million cash and equivalents. With
only half a million in long-term liabilities and nearly $15 million in
working capital, the company has a credible balance sheet. We are
predicting earnings of $0.15 in 1996 and $0.45 in 1997 broken out in Table
1.
   In 1996, the company will be cash flow positive and will probably not
need to raise substantial capital in the form of a secondary offering or
debt. Also, resources for marketing and sales infrastructure are already
in place along with several international marketing partnerships. BTG has
bypassed the dilemma that many biotechs meet when products are approved
without a sales force to market them. However, should the opportunity
present itself and market conditions prove favorable, we would view a
secondary offering as a positive development since BTG would be issuing
shares from a position of financial strength.
   Both administrative and R&D expenses have been pared down in recent
years as management has made a commitment to keep operating costs
well-controlled. Expenses in both categories will increase modestly in
1996 and 1997. The company also has over $50 million in net operating loss
carryforwards which expire from 1996 through 2009, therefore no provisions
for income tax has been made in our earnings model.
   We think that Bio-Technology General is an overlooked biopharmaceutical
with excellent growth potential and a robust pipeline unusual for a
small-cap concern. Its products meet the needs of immature, underserved
markets and possesses a fundamental investment profile in a sector
notorious for pie-in-the-sky prospects. Our one year price target is $12.00
based on a price/earnings ratio of 27X 1997 earnings. The ratio reflects
an average of generic drug companies' and pharmaceutical p/e ratios. We
are using a we strongly recommend purchase of the shares.

Minimum of four IPOs added to S&P New Issues Index; closed end funds
excluded.

It may come as a surprise to many investors that both the number and dollar
volume of new issues brought out in 1995 slightly trailed year earlier
levels. Last year, 489 IPOs were added to S&P's New Issues Index, compared
with 496 the year before, while total dollars raised came to $31.1 billion,
compared with $34.0 billion in 1994. Both years significantly trailed the
record 672 deals and $56.9 billion raised in 1993. Despite the fireworks
surrounding many technology deals, they are typically smaller than those
for mature companies reentering the market via a reverse LBO or ADRs, REITs
or closed end funds, which were popular offerings at various times over the
last 10 years. Despite some highly visible reverse LBOs and ADRs such as
Nabisco Holdings, Royal PTT Nederland, ENI, Canadian National Railways,
AVX, Gucci Group and Estee Lauder, there were fewer reverse LBOs and ADRs
on the IPO roster last year.
   With the economy slowing down, there were many industries that were off
limits to underwriters during the year. Financials and technology were in,
but heavy industry, basic materials, consumer durables and consumer
nondurables were out. With overall market leadership narrow, underwriters
had to concentrate their energies in the few in-favor industries.
   Although the year ended with a bang, with $14.0 billion raised from 201
deals during the last quarter, we believe that both the number and dollars
raised in 1996 will be slightly lower than last year's totals. Standard &
Poor's is of the view that the total return of the S&P 500 will be less
than double digits and that intermediate term fixed income investments
could provide similar returns over the next 12 months. With the economy
exhibiting sluggish growth and interest in technology temporarily on the
wane, we think that underwriters will easily be able to beat the 61 deals
and $3.7 billion raised in the first quarter of 1995. That was when the
market was treading water while waiting for interest rates to level off.
Comparisons, however, will get tougher as the year wears on. Should the
economy show signs of picking up, a number of offerings could surface in
specialty retailing and consumer products and services.

Telecommunications equipment and Internet plays were the big winners

   The S&P New Issues Index almost doubled in value last year, its best
performance since 1991, when it rose 106.1%. It finished 1995 up 96.5%. The
index tracks the performance of new issues, including REITs and closed end
funds, for the first six months of trading. To be added to the index, IPOs
must be firm underwritings priced at or above $5, with an offering
capitalization of at least $5 million. We exclude bank and S&L conversions,
best efforts deals and unit deals that include warrants. The index is price
weighted.
   Fully 62 deals more than doubled last year based on offering price and
what they closed the year at. Another 77 rose more than 50%. Before you
get the idea that buying IPOs is like shooting fish in a barrel, though, it
should be pointed out that 135 deals fell in value, while another 109 rose
less than 20%. Put together, they amount to 50% of all deals brought last
year.
   The biggest winner was Premisys Communications, which sextupled in less
than nine months. The company makes integrated multiple access servers and
concentrators that support prevailing centrex and digital switch
technologies as well as emerging frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode
(ATM) technologies. Its products allow the proliferation of frame relay
based ISDN services within a traditional broadband network structure. Right
now it is delivering just about the only ATM concentrator around. Revenues
for the September quarter rose 149%, while earnings quintupled to $0.25.
AT&T is its major customer and accounts for a third of revenues. One danger
is that when AT&T splits up, the new entity that makes equipment may choose
a different vendor, or more likely, other more traditional switch
manufacturers will catch up technologically and cause profit margins,
currently quite high, to eventually come down. The shares are currently
trading at 80X consensus projected fiscal 1996 EPS.
   Three of the next four winners were Internet plays, Spyglass, Netscape
Communications and UUNET Technologies. Spyglass more than quintupled, NSCP
almost quadrupled, and UNET more than tripled. These companies went public
so early in their corporate lives that one could only conjecture as to how
fast they might grow. All three are trading at multiples quantum leaps
higher than just about any other non-Internet related or biotech growth
stock.
   We are of the view that the Internet will be the dominant mass
communications medium in the 21st century. Nonetheless, once forward five
year sales and earnings growth rates for these companies become defined,
their share prices will be adjusted downward. In the meantime, shares of
Netscape, the company with the best shot at becoming a dominant player in
Internet services, is trading at over 20X projected 1997 revenues!
   Just about all the other big winners were technology related. There were
nine software companies among the 25 biggest winners, plus three
telecommunications related companies. The only exceptions were Renters
Choice, Compdent, Sequana Therapeutics, Garden Ridge and Spin-Tech.
   PDT makes light activated drugs to treat or diagnose a variety of
diseases. The company has yet to generate revenues or a profit, but it is
entering phase III trials for a drug to be used on hard tumors. DSP
Communications is developing chipsets for wireless personal communications
applications. To date, sales have come from chipsets for Japanese digital
mobile phones. Customers include Kenwood, Kyocera and Sanyo. Renters Choice
runs 325 rent-to-own stores. Nine month earnings more than doubled on a 60%
increase in sales. Verity is a maker of tools for the dissemination of
texts over various electronic networks. Although the company is still
running losses, revenues are up substantially. Greatest interest is in its
Topoc search engine for the Internet.

As usual, small deals done by third tier underwriters populate losers list

   The largest deal that landed on our losers list was Asia Pacific
Resources. It has a 60.7% interest in a major Indonesian producer of pulp
and rayon and almost wholly owns another firm that operates the largest
single line pulp mill in the world. Three paper mills are planned, two in
China and one in Indonesia. Unfortunately, the company has not earned much
money since going public in early April. With economies slowing in most
major markets, the company could be expanding capacity at just the wrong
time.
   Electronics Communications provides cellular phone services and
equipment. Sales dropped over the last nine months, with operations going
to a loss due to one-time advertising charges. AHI Healthcare Systems
integrates individual physicians and small medical groups into local
managed healthcare delivery networks. Although revenues more than doubled
in the nine months to 9/30/95, a larger than expected loss was reported due
to high development costs. Losses are expected to continue for at least one
more quarter.
   Other losers brought by large underwriters include HighwayMaster
Communications. It offers a wireless communications network for use by
truckers. Although revenues rose substantially of late, losses failed to
narrow. Number Nine Visual Technology initially received a very favorable
reception by investors. This maker of graphics accelerator products for
personal computers continues to show a very positive sales trend, but a
loss was reported for the September quarter. Analysts expected earnings of
$0.25 a share.
   Many of the worst losers were brought out by small underwriters such as
Investors Associates, Hampshire Securities, John G. Kinnard, Needham & Co.,
Paulson Investments, Lexington Securities, and J.W. Charles. Small sole
underwritings tend to do well initially, but then tail off rapidly as time
goes on. Most of these deals have generally weak underlying fundamentals,
but are operating in industries that are currently in favor. The
underwriter insures success at the IPO by developing more than enough
demand to float the shares at the offering, and those that are retail
oriented often drive the share price higher by convincing its clients to
buy additional shares in the aftermarket. Then the underwriter moves on to
the next deal. Lacking sponsorship and with a market capitalization too
small to hit the radar screens of most buy side managers, the offerings
inevitably drift lower.
   Salomon Brothers brought out three deals that found their way on the
losers list, as did Alex. Brown. Even the most successful underwriters,
however, bring out companies that falter due to subsequent poorer than
expected results. Some deals that initially moved higher before plummeting
included Business Resource Group, Number Nine Visual Technology, Hello
Direct, TGV Software and EqualNet Holdings.

Goldman Sachs dominates list of biggest deals

   Of the 10 largest deals, Goldman, Sachs kept the books on six of them.
No one else had more than one in the top 10. Goldman's largest deal was
Nabisco Holdings, which went public early in the year. It advanced 33.2% in
value by year end. Other large Goldman deals were Prudential Reinsurance,
PMI Group, Intimate Brands, Canadian National Railway and Borders Group.
Morgan Stanley's largest deal was Royal PTT Nederland, which edged up 2.4%
in the last five weeks of the year, Smith Barney's was Union Pacific
Resources, up 20.8% in less than three months, CS First Boston's was ENI,
rising 4.2% in five weeks, and Merrill Lynch's was DST Systems, which
advanced 35.7% in two months.
   The best performer in the aftermarket among the 10 largest deals was
Prudential Reinsurance, which advanced 39.6% by year end. The runner-up was
DST Systems. Large deals with offering capitalizations of more than $100
million that rose more than 30% are on page 11.

As usual, technology and white shoe underwriters lead in IPO aftermarket 
    performance

   Technology, regional and white shoe underwriters usually lead the pack
in bringing out the most successful offerings, and 1995 was no exception.
Rauscher Pierce leads the list. Of its four deals, one, Renters Choice,
tripled, while another, Belmont Homes, doubled. Other regional houses that
brought out excellent deals were William Blair and Robinson-Humphrey.
   The major specialty technology underwriters, as usual, brought out deals
that did much better than average in subsequent trading. Alex. Brown,
Montgomery, Hambrecht & Quist and Robertson, Stephens all served both
investors and corporate clients in pricing their deals well. As is also the
norm, second tier technology underwriters such as Needham & Co., Miller,
Johnson, Kuehn, and Unterberg Harris, for the most part brought out weaker
than average deals when they took the lead. The exceptions this year were
Cowen & Co. and Volpe, Welty.
   Salomon Brothers has been struggling to remain a major underwriter of
equity issues. The poor performance of their deals in the aftermarket in
1995 will not make their task any easier going forward. The multi-office
retail brokers typically bring out poorer performing deals. PaineWebber has
landed in the lower half of the list for many years and appears there
again, as does Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Smith Barney and Donaldson
Lufkin. There were no exceptions to the rule this year.
   The most deals were brought by Goldman, Sachs, followed by Robertson,
Stephens, Alex. Brown, and Morgan Stanley. Both Goldman, Sachs and Morgan
Stanley have consistently brought out better than average deals. Of
Goldman's 36 IPOs, only six finished the year under water. Just five of
Morgan Stanley's offerings finished under their IPO prices.

Sector rotation likely in 1996

   From an investment perspective, over the next six months or so, we would
emphasize those groups that could generate strong corporate earnings growth
regardless of how the overall economy does. They include health care,
(particularly HMOs and subacute care companies), energy services (the
drillers), REITs, insurance, computer networking, telecommunications
equipment, and farm related businesses.
   We may also see more foreign stocks. Many emerging markets could turn in
better performances than the U.S. in 1996. Our bets are on the Czech
Republic, Argentina, Chile and the Philippines. Following on the heels of
Gucci, we would also expect an increased number of ADR offerings of family
owned consumer product companies based in Europe.
   With technology stocks in a deep freeze, many IPOs in this sector will
be postponed until the climate improves. That may not be until later in the
year. In the meantime, it appears that value could beat growth in a market
environment in which the total return of the S&P 500 this year may not
reach its long term average of 10.1%.
   At least for the first quarter, we would emphasize low P/E plays. Of the
tech companies that do venture forth in this environment, they are apt to
be better priced. Although they may not move much in the immediate
aftermarket, they could do well when technology comes back into favor,
possibly late this year.
   Groups we would not commit additional funds to now would be personal
computer related technology, cyclicals, nonprecious metals, and consumer
finance stocks.

C-CUBE MICROSYSTEMS

   A two-for-one split was paid to shareholders of C-Cube Microsystems on
December 19, 1995. The shares, now 48% higher than in November last year
when we upgraded them from hold to buy, are a bit off from their recent
all-time high of 65 (post split). The stock is likely to be quite volatile
along with the technology sector as other firms report earnings for the
fourth quarter. For this reason, we are lowering the shares (CUBE, 53 5/16,
NASDAQ) from buy to hold on continued positive long term fundamentals.
C-Cube reports earnings for 1995 on January 18, 1995.

SMALLCAP-NEW ISSUE MARKET REVIEW

By:
Robert S. Natale, CFA
Editor

The tug of war between value and growth goes on

   Last year, growth beat value. The growth half of the S&P 500 provided a
total return of 38.1%, as measured by S&P/BARRA, while the value half of
the index generated 37.0%. But, for the five years ended 12/31/95, value
generated a 16.9% compound annual total return, against 16.1% for growth.
In 1996, value could again have the edge. With P/Es well above the
historical norm and economic growth slowing down, investors are seeking to
reduce perceived investment risks by searching out less expensive stocks in
industries that have not already run up. Indeed, we would be looking to
place money in industries that run on their own operating cycles, that is,
that are less affected by what is going on in the overall economy.
   For example, oil service companies, especially the drillers, stand to
benefit from increased exploration expenditures by the major oil companies
this year. That is because new technologies such as 3-D seismic and
horizontal drilling have reduced finding costs, making the redevelopment of
older fields and of new small fields economical. In addition, after 10
years of depression, the supply of oil rigs is finally coming into balance
with demand. Day rates rose substantially last year even though natural gas
prices plummeted and oil prices went nowhere. Our favorites here are Global
Marine and Nabors Industries.
   Another group attractive to value and growth players alike is health
care. New rules coming out of Washington, D.C. could adversely impact
hospital and nursing home businesses, but the drive to reduce per capita
costs will push increased use of subacute rehabilitation services and
Medicare and Medicaid patients into HMOs. We have three rehab companies on
our buy list, Mariner Health Group, RehabCare Group, and TheraTx. All are
trading at or below the market multiple as measured by the S&P 500. HMOs on
our buy list are Pacificare Health Systems and United American Healthcare.
   Semiconductor companies now look like value plays in the sense that they
now sport low P/Es despite prospects for above average, albeit somewhat
cyclical, earnings growth. Many on our buy lists have been beaten up of
late and offer considerable appeal for investors looking beyond the
uncertainties surrounding the industry as excess inventories are worked
down. Industry growth this year will not match the 40% increase in
worldwide shipments experienced in 1995; 26% will be more like it. Still,
that should more than justify a recovery in P/E ratios. In addition to
SGS-Thomson, which is recommended in this issue, we like Exar, which makes
lower end application specific integrated circuits, Integrated Circuits,
which manufactures mixed signal Ics, and Sierra Semiconductor, which is
supplying chips to fast growing ATM and frame relay telecommunications
switch makers. All of these companies are trading at single digit multiples
against current forecasted 1996 EPS.
   We also suggest taking another look at real estate plays. With Standard
& Poor's predicting the total return for the S&P 500 to be less that 10% in
1996, REITs could provide comparable or better returns with less risk.
Except for retail properties, real estate values continue to climb,
particularly for office properties. Our favorites in this area include
Catellus Development, an almost pure play on the California recovery, First
Union Real Estate Trust, which has one of the lowest dividend payouts as a
percent of cash flow in the REIT industry, which bodes well for steady
dividend increases over the next 18 months, and Property Capital Trust,
which is liquidating, and we feel will provide a total return well into the
double digits as it does so over the next three to five years.
   Other industries that we would target for investment, either through
IPOs or otherwise, are domestic farming (i.e. Case and Tractor Supply,
insurance, and telecommunications equipment (Stratacom, Sierra
Semiconductor).
   Finally, some leading emerging foreign markets should also provide
better returns than the S&P 500 in 1996. We would play them via listed
closed end funds. Our favorites are Czech Republic Fund and First
Philippine Fund.
   Despite the weak start to the year by small stocks, we continue to
believe that they will beat the S&P 500 this year. Earnings growth for
companies in the SmallCap 600 is projected to be much stronger than the S&P
500 in 1996, while the P/E ratios of small stocks are only slightly higher.
Although investors are very unlikely to garner the same returns achieved in
1995, small stocks should provide excellent relative returns in 1996.

THE NEW CRA EXAMINATION PROCEDURES
Changes Designed To Reduce the Examination Burden Have Focused Regulatory
Attention on Community Reinvestment Results. The Interpretation of Key CRA
Standards Remains Subject to Substantial Examiner Discretion.

By:
Christina M. Gattuso*

In May 1995, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of
Thrift Supervision, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, the
``Agencies'') issued final revised regulations under the Community
Reinvestment Act (``CRA'') (the ``Revised CRA Regulations'').1 In the
preamble to that rulemaking, the Agencies noted that they would work
together to improve training for examiners, to increase interagency efforts
to apply standards consistently and reliably, and to minimize unnecessary
compliance burdens. Consistent with those efforts, on November 13, 1995,
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (``FFIEC'')
officially released new CRA examination procedures that were jointly
adopted by the Agencies for monitoring an institution's compliance with the
Revised CRA Regulations (the ``Procedures'').
There are four sets of examination procedures -- procedures for large,
retail institutions; for small institutions; for wholesale and limited
purpose institutions; and for institutions with an approved strategic plan.
In accordance with the Revised CRA Regulations, examiners began using the
small institution examination procedures on January 1, 1996. The other
three sets of procedures do not become mandatory until July 1, 1997.
However, examiners will use the Procedures in conducting examinations of
those institutions that elect to be evaluated under the Revised CRA
Regulation prior to that date.2
In some instances, the assessment criteria set forth in the Procedures
mirror the twelve assessment factors under the prior CRA regulations.3
Examiners will still review and rate institutions on the geographic
distribution of their loans; their record of opening and closing offices;
their participation in community development projects; their real estate,
small farm, and small business loans; and their participation in government
loan programs for housing, small farms, and small businesses. Under the
Procedures, the examiners will continue to review, but the institution will
not be rated, on any practices by the institution that are intended to
discourage applications, any prohibited discriminatory or other illegal
credit practices,4 the institution's ability to meet community credit
needs, the institution's delineated community, and the institution's
willingness to explore other activities. Under the Revised CRA Regulations
and the Procedures, examiners will no longer look at, and an institution
will not be rated on, its ascertainment of community credit needs,
marketing, and board of director involvement in the CRA process.
   The Procedures emphasize that examiners are expected to exercise
judgement and common sense to minimize the burden imposed on the
examination process and to perform only those steps necessary to arrive at
an accurate assessment of the institution's CRA performance.5 Consistent
with the Revised CRA Regulations, the Procedures establish evaluation
methods based on a review of objective data that can also be used by
institutions to measure their own performance under the CRA. An examiner's
assessment of an institution's CRA performance will be based on a number of
objective factors, which include the number and amount of loans originated,
the amount of qualified investments, and the types of services provided by
the institution.6 However, by necessity the Procedures allow for examiner
discretion in the assessment process in order to account for the
differences among institutions and the communities they serve. While the
need for flexibility in assessing an institution's performance is
important, unless the examiners are provided with clear guidance and
comprehensive training, inconsistencies in CRA examinations are likely to
continue. The Agencies believe that the training examiners have received
and will continue to receive in the future will enable examiners to make
more informed judgements in the areas in which they have discretion and
should ensure consistency in the examination process.7

EXAMINATION PROCEDURES FOR LARGE RETAIL INSTITUTIONS
The Revised CRA Regulations provide that a financial institution with total
assets of $250 million or more or, regardless of size, one that is owned by
a holding company with total banking and thrift assets greater than $1
billion, will be examined under the Lending, Investment, and Service Tests.
The Procedures set forth the items that will be reviewed in assessing an
institution's performance under those three tests.

Examination Scope
The Procedures set forth factors that will be reviewed and compiled by the
examiners at the pre-examination stage to determine the scope of the
impending CRA examination.8 To make this determination, the examiners will
review the institution's prior CRA evaluations, information provided by
community contacts, and the lending data and demographic data reported for
each assessment area.9 The examiners will also consider the number of other
institutions in the assessment area and the opportunities available in the
assessment area for lending, investment and other services. Based on this
information, the examiners will determine the scope of their on-site and
off-site examinations.

Performance Context
The Procedures require the examiners to establish a ``performance context''
for the examination by evaluating information about the institution, its
community and its competitors. In this regard, the examiners will review
standardized worksheets and other agency information to obtain relevant
demographic, economic, and loan data on each assessment area under
review.10 The examiners will also review agency-prepared community contact
forms for groups within the institution's assessment area, and may contact
local community, governmental, or economic development representatives to
update such information.11 To determine the institution's ability and
capacity to serve its assessment area, the examiners will review Call
Reports or Thrift Financial Reports (``TFRs''), annual reports, supervisory
reports and prior CRA evaluations. The examiners will also consider any
information the institution provides on its local community and economy,
its business strategy, and its lending capacity, and any information that
otherwise assists in the evaluation of the institution.12 However,
examiners will not require the institution to create such information; nor
will they ask for any information other than what the institution has
developed as part of its normal business practice.
   Finally, by reviewing the public evaluations and other financial data,
the examiners will determine whether any similarly situated institutions13
serve the same or similar assessment area and, if so, whether they would
provide relevant and accurate information for evaluating the institution's
CRA performance. The Procedures note that the examiners should consider
whether such information would help to identify lending opportunities
available in the institution's assessment area that are compatible with the
institution's business strategy and consistent with safe and sound banking
practices; constraints affecting opportunities to make safe and sound loans
and qualified investments compatible with the institution's business
strategy in the assessment area; and successful CRA-related product
offerings or activities used by other lenders serving the same or a similar
assessment area.
   The development of the performance context will likely occur prior to
initiation of the on-site examination. The Revised CRA Regulations and the
Procedures make clear that an institution need not compile or maintain
information related to the performance context. However, to the extent the
institution compiles information to analyze the demand for loans,
investment and services within its assessment area, it would be to the
institution's advantage to provide such information to the examiner for use
in developing the performance context.

Assessment Area
Under the prior CRA regulations, an institution's delineated community was
reviewed and rated as part of an institution's overall CRA performance. The
Revised CRA Regulations require an institution to define its assessment
area but do not require that an examiner rate the institution's assessment
area. The Procedures and the Revised CRA Regulations state that examiners
will use the institution's assessment area unless they determine that ``the
assessment area does not comply with the requirements for assessment areas
set forth in the final rule.''14 Since this is not a rated area, an
incorrect identification or definition of an institution's assessment area
will not result in a downgrading of an institution's CRA Rating.15
As long as an institution's assessment area meets the requirements of the
Revised CRA Regulations, the examiners should not second guess the
assessment area. In order to meet the requirements of the Revised CRA
Regulations, the assessment area should consist of one or more metropolitan
statistical areas (``MSAs'') or contiguous political subdivisions. It
should also include the geographies16 where the institution has its main
office, its branches, and any deposit-taking ATMs, and the areas
surrounding such locations where the institution originated or purchased a
substantial portion of its loans. In addition, the assessment area should
consist of whole geographies; it should not exclude low or moderate income
geographies and should not illegally discriminate; and not extend
substantially across consolidated MSAs or state boundaries unless the
institution is in a multi-state MSA. If the examiners find that the
assessment area fails to meet these regulatory criteria, the examiners will
develop a revised assessment area and will evaluate the institution's
performance based on that revised assessment area.

Public File Checklist
The Procedures provide that there is no need for the examiners to review
each branch or each complete public file during every examination,
particularly if the institution has complied with the public file
requirements of the Revised CRA Regulations in previous examinations.
However, it is likely that the examiners will review the public files in
the first examination of every institution under the Revised CRA
Regulations and the Procedures. In cases where a review of the public file
is undertaken, the examiners will determine whether an accurate public
notice is displayed in the lobby of each branch, and whether the file(s) in
the main office and in each state contain all information required by the
Revised CRA Regulations.17

Performance Criteria
Lending Test
The Lending Test is the primary test for large, retail institutions, since
failure to achieve at least a Low Satisfactory rating in this area makes it
impossible to achieve an overall Satisfactory rating. The examiners will
rate the institution's lending performance under the following criteria:
lending activity; geographic distribution; borrower characteristics;
community development lending; and innovative or flexible lending
practices. The analysis under the Lending Test is similar to the analysis
conducted under the prior CRA regulations.
   After the examiners determine the loans to review for purposes of the
Lending Test,18 the examiners will test a sample of loan files to verify
the accuracy of data collected and/or reported by the institution and to
ensure that (i) affiliate loans reported by the institution are not also
attributable to another affiliate subject to CRA;19 (ii) loans reported as
community development loans meet the definition of community development
loans;20 and (iii) all consumer loans in a particular loan category have
been included, when the institution collects and maintains the data for one
or more loan categories and elects to have the information evaluated. The
examiners will also identify the dollar amount and number of loans under
evaluation that the institution has made or purchased within its assessment
area, taking into account the institution's resources and business strategy
and other information that the examiners gather under the performance
context, including population, income, housing, and business data. The
examiners will also review any analyses offered by the institution to
provide insight into the reasonableness of the institution's geographic
distribution of lending.21 If the areas of low- or no-loan penetration are
found in the institution's analyses, the examiners will review explanations
and determine whether the institution took action to address the
disparities.
   While the Procedures direct the examiners to supplement their review
with an independent analysis of geographic distribution as necessary to
determine the extent to which the institution is serving geographies in
each income category, they make clear that an institution is not required
to lend in every geography. The Procedures also permit the examiners to
compare the institution's lending performance to that of other lenders
within its assessment area if the examiners determine that such an analysis
would provide insight into the reasons for an abnormally low penetration of
lending in the assessment area. Taking all of these factors into
consideration, the examiners will determine whether the institution's
abnormally low loan penetration in certain areas should constitute a
negative consideration in rating the geographic distribution of the
institution's loans.
   In terms of borrower characteristics, the examiners will review any
analyses prepared by or for the institution to determine the reasonableness
of the institution's loan distribution by borrower characteristics. To the
extent necessary, the examiners will supplement the analysis provided by
the institution with an independent analysis. If the institution adequately
serves borrowers within its assessment area, the examiners will look to its
performance outside its assessment area based on borrower characteristics
to determine whether such performance would enhance the assessment of the
institution's overall performance.
   The examiners will also review the institution's community development
lending, using information obtained in the performance context to determine
the responsiveness of the institution to available community development
opportunities and the extent to which the institution has demonstrated
leadership in community development lending.
   Finally, the examiners will evaluate whether the institution uses
innovative or flexible loan products, and, if so, the degree to which the
loans serve low- and moderate-income individuals in new ways or serve
borrowers not previously served by the institution. In addition, the
examiners will look at the success of any innovative or flexible loan
products offered by the institution, including the number and dollar amount
of such loan products originated during the review period.22 To some
degree, an institution's rating under the Lending Test will be based on
objective data. However, examiners will still be required to determine
whether an institution's lending activity is reasonable or adequate, terms
that are not defined in the Revised CRA Regulations or the Procedures, in
order to reach a conclusion as to which rating to assign to the
institution.

Investment Test
The review of an institution's performance under the Investment Test is
similar to the examiners' review of this area under the prior CRA
Regulations. Under the Investment Test, the examiners will identify
qualified investments23 by reviewing the institution's investment
portfolio, and, if elected by the institution, the investment portfolio of
its affiliate(s). Investments that were made since the last CRA evaluation
and those that were made prior to the previous CRA evaluation but still
remain outstanding will be considered. The examiners will also consider
qualifying grants, donations, or in-kind contributions of property since
the last evaluation that are for community development purposes.
   In evaluating the institution's investment portfolio, the examiners will
determine whether the investments benefit the institution's assessment area
or a broader area that includes the institution's assessment area; whether
the investments have been considered under the Lending or Service Tests;
whether an affiliate's investments have been claimed by another
institution; the dollar volume of investments made to entities that are in
or serve the assessment area, in relation to the institution's capacity and
constraints, and the assessment area's characteristics and needs; the use
of any innovative or complex investments; and the degree to which the
investments serve low- and moderate- income areas or individuals, and are
responsive to available opportunities for qualified investments.24
   After considering the number and dollar amount of qualified investments;
the innovativeness and complexity of qualified investments; the degree to
which these types of investments are routinely provided by other private
investors; and the responsiveness of the institution's qualified
investments to available opportunities, the examiners will reach a
conclusion regarding the institution's performance under the Investment
Test. As with the Lending Test, there will be some degree of subjectivity
in reaching this conclusion since examiners will need to determine the
adequacy of an institution's qualified investments in order to assign a
rating.

Service Test
The Service Test evaluates the institution on the basis of the retail
banking and community development services provided by the institution.
With respect to retail banking service, the information used by the
examiners to evaluate the institution is similar to information reviewed
under the prior CRA regulations. As was the case under the prior CRA
regulations, the institution should be prepared to provide an explanation
for any material differences in the hours of operations or services
available at branches within the institution's assessment area.
   The examiners will also review the institution's record of opening and
closing branches within its assessment area since the previous evaluation
and the extent to which any such openings or closings have had a negative
or positive impact on low- and moderate-income geographies within the
institution's assessment area. In addition, the institution will be
evaluated on the basis of the accessibility and use of alternative systems
of delivering banking services in low and moderate income geographies and
to low and moderate income individuals.25 Finally, the examiners will
assess the quantity, quality, and accessibility of the institution's
service-delivery systems provided for all income areas within its
assessment area. In making such an assessment, the examiners are directed
to consider the degree to which services are tailored to the convenience
and needs of each geography.
   As part of the Service Test, the examiners will also review the
institution's community development services, which can include at the
institution's option, services through affiliates of the institution. The
examiners will identify such services and determine whether the services
qualify under the definition of community development services, benefit the
assessment area or a broader statewide or regional area encompassing the
institution's assessment area; and ensure that any services provided by
affiliates of the institution are not claimed by other affiliated
institutions. Taking into account the information gathered in the
performance context, the examiners will evaluate the extent of the
community development services offered by the institution; the
innovativeness of any such services, including whether they serve low- and
moderate- income customers in new ways or serve groups of customers not
previously served; and the degree to which they serve low- or moderate-
income areas or individuals and their responsiveness to available
opportunities for community development services.

Ratings
Based on the analysis discussed above, an institution will be rated
Outstanding, High Satisfactory, Low Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or
Substantial Noncompliance for each of the Lending, Investment, and Service
Tests.26 These rating descriptions are relatively subjective in order to
provide the examiners with the flexibility to accommodate differences in
institutions and their communities. The Procedures do not provide any
guidance on interpretation of the descriptions. The examiners will total
the institution's scores on the three tests to assign the institution an
overall composite rating. Under the Procedures, an institution's assigned
rating can be no more than three times its score on the Lending Test.27 In
addition, the examiners must take into account the results of the fair
lending component of the institution's most recent compliance examination
and determine whether these findings should lower the institution's overall
CRA Rating. In determining whether to downgrade the institution, the
examiner will also take into account the nature and extent of any evidence
of discrimination, the policies the institution has in place to prevent
discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective action
taken, and any other relevant information.

EXAMINATION PROCEDURES FOR SMALL INSTITUTIONS
Generally
Under the new Procedures, the scope of the examination for small
institutions is streamlined, with the primary focus on the institution's
lending performance. If a small institution has more than one assessment
area, the examiners will select the assessment areas for on-site review
based on the institution's prior CRA performance, its lending activity in
the assessment area, information obtained from community contacts, and
demographic data on each assessment area.
   The performance context for small institutions generally includes the
same information that is reviewed in the performance context for
examinations of large, retail institutions. The primary difference is that
the examination is much more streamlined, and while the examiners will
review financial information and the prior CRA evaluations of institutions
of similar size that serve the same or similar assessment area(s), they
will not consider the same detail of information regarding similarly
situated institutions as will be considered in examining large retail
institutions. The review of the assessment area of a small institution is
the same as that of a large, retail institution, as is the review of the
small institution's public files.
   The examiners will review small institutions in five areas: (i) the
loan-to-deposit analysis; (ii) comparison of credit extended inside and
outside of the assessment area; (iii) distribution of credit within the
assessment area; (iv) review of complaints; and (v) investments and
services (at the institution's option to enhance a satisfactory rating.)

Performance Criteria
Loan-to-Deposit Analysis
Examiners will use the data contained in Call Reports and TFRs to calculate
the institution's average loan-to-deposit (``LTD'') ratio since the
institution's last examination by adding the quarterly loan-to-deposit
ratios and dividing by the number of quarters covered by the examination.
If the LTD ratio is high, the examiners will only analyze financial
information. If the ratio is low, the examiners will make a determination
about the reasonableness of the LTD ratio by reviewing information gathered
in the performance context, including the institution's capacity to lend,
the capacity of other similarly situated institutions to lend in the
assessment area, demographic and economic factors present in the assessment
area, and the lending opportunities available in the institution's
assessment area.28 If the examiners determine that the LTD is not
reasonable in light of the performance context, they will also consider the
number and dollar volume of any loans sold by the institution to the
secondary market, the innovativeness or complexity of community development
loans and qualified investments by the institution, to assess the extent to
which those activities compensate for a low LTD ratio or supplement the
institution's lending performance as reflected in its LTD ratio.
   Comparison of Credit Extended Inside and Outside of the Assessment
Area(s)
The examiners will review HMDA data, automated loan reports or other
reports generated by the institution to analyze the extent of lending by
the institution both inside and outside the assessment area. If such data
is not available or cannot be verified, the examiners will use sampling
guidelines to select a sample of loans originated, purchased, committed to
calculate the percentage of loans located within the assessment area. Only
if the percentage of loans or other activities inside the assessment area
constitute majority of the institution's lending and other activities will
the institution meet the standards for a Satisfactory rating under this
category. If such activities are less than a majority, the examiners will
consider information from the performance context with respect to economic
conditions, loan demand, and the institution's size, financial condition,
branching network, and business strategies.29 If an institution has a
significant amount of lending outside of its assessment area, it may want
to provide the examiners with a geocoded lending analysis since sampling
may not accurately reflect the institution's lending activity.

Distribution of Credit within the Assessment Area
The Procedures direct the examiners to determine first whether the number
and income distribution of geographies in the assessment area are
sufficient for a meaningful analysis of the geographic distribution of the
institution's loans in its assessment area. If such an analysis would be
meaningful and the necessary geographic information is collected by the
institution in the ordinary course of business, the examiners will
determine the distribution of the institution's loans in its assessment
area within the four geographies. While the Procedures state that the
absence of loans in any particular geography should not be a concern, the
examiners are directed to identify groups of geographies by income
categories in which there is little or no loan penetration.30 If the
institution collects information about borrower income or revenue, the
examiners will review such information to determine the distribution of the
institution's loans in the assessment area by borrower income and business
revenue, and to identify categories of borrowers for which there is little
to no penetration of loans.
   If an analysis of the distribution of loans would not be meaningful or
could not be performed, the examiners may analyze the geographic
distribution by street address rather than geography (if such data is
available and the analysis would be reasonable), or they may analyze the
distribution by loan size as a proxy for income or revenue of the borrower.
If the analysis shows that the institution is not penetrating some areas or
has low penetration in some areas, the examiners are directed to form a
conclusion about the reasons for the loan penetration using information
gathered in the performance context. If the institution is found to have
low penetration of some areas, it may be useful for the institution to
provide the examiners with data to justify its loan distribution.

Review of Complaints
The examiners will review all complaints received by the institution
regarding the institution's CRA performance and the institution's action
with respect thereto as well as any complaints regarding the institution
received by the Agencies.

Investments and Services
These areas will only be reviewed by the examiners at the institution's
option to enhance a Satisfactory rating. If the institution chooses to have
these areas reviewed, the examiners will consider the dollar amount of
qualified investments, the impact of those investments on the institution's
assessment area, and the innovativeness or complexity of the investments.31
With respect to services provided by the institution, the examiners will
take into account the same general information considered under the Service
Test for large retail institutions.

Ratings
A small institution will be assigned a Satisfactory rating if it meets each
of the standards set forth in the Revised CRA Regulations for that rating
or if it has exceptionally strong performance with respect to some of the
standards that compensates for weak performance in other standards.32 If an
institution fails to qualify for a Satisfactory rating, the examiners will
assign a Needs to Improve or a Substantial Noncompliance Rating depending
on the degree to which the institution's performance falls short of a
Satisfactory rating. The Procedures also direct the examiners to review the
results of the fair lending component of the institution's most recent
compliance examination to determine whether those findings should lower the
institution's overall CRA Rating.

PROCEDURES FOR LIMITED PURPOSE AND WHOLESALE INSTITUTIONS
Generally
Under the Revised CRA Regulations, limited purpose and wholesale
institutions are evaluated under separate examination procedures on the
basis of the community development test.33 The scope of the examination for
limited purpose and wholesale institutions will focus on community
development lending, qualified investments, and community development
services. In defining the performance context for the examination, the
examiners will review the same types of information reviewed under the
performance context for large, retail institutions except that the analysis
will focus on the information as it relates to community development. Thus,
to the extent the institution collects data to analyze the types of
community development opportunities in its assessment area, it should
consider providing such information to the examiners for their use in
establishing the performance context. The evaluation of the assessment area
is generally the same as for large, retail institutions.

Performance Criteria
Under the Community Development Test, the examiners will review the
institution's performance with regard to community development lending,
qualified investments, and community development services. The examiners
will review the number and dollar amount of community development loans
made by the institution and will test a sample of the institution's
community development loan files to verify that such loans qualify as
community development loans. The examiners also will review qualified
investments and other community development services provided by the
institution and, at the institution's option, will include activities by
affiliates and community development lending by consortia or third parties.
In reaching a conclusion about the institution's community development
performance, the examiners will take into account the degree of innovation
in community development lending activities and the responsiveness of the
institution to the opportunities for community development activities.34 To
the extent the institution is collecting information regarding community
development loans and qualified investments, the institution should provide
the examiners with such information, as well as information on the
beneficiaries of such loans and investments.

Ratings
The institution will be rated based on the examiner's analysis of the
institution's performance under the Community Development Test in
accordance with the criteria set forth in the Revised CRA Regulations.35
While the rating descriptions set forth in the Revised CRA Regulation are
highly subjective, the Procedures are fairly straightforward.

PROCEDURES FOR INSTITUTIONS WITH STRATEGIC PLANS
Generally
The examination scope for institutions with strategic plans will focus on
whether or not the institution has met the goals stated within its
strategic plan.36 In order to make such a determination, the examiners may
also consider the level of the institution's lending, investment and
service activity in the different assessment areas, particularly in low-
and moderate- income areas, the importance of the institution in meeting
the credit needs in its assessment area, information provided by community
contacts and the institution's prior performance evaluations.37
As part of the performance context, the examiners will consider any
information that the institution provides on its record of meeting the
goals of the strategic plan and will contact local community, governmental
and other representatives to update or supplement information about the
institution's record of meeting the plan goals. Since the institution is
likely to be gathering data to show its progress toward meeting its goals
under the plan, the institution should consider providing that information
to the examiners. The review of the institution's assessment area will
occur when the strategic plan is submitted.

Performance Criteria
The examiners will review the institution's performance to evaluate the
institution's record of meeting the performance goals set forth in its
plan. If the goals were not met, the examiners will determine whether the
plan goals were ``substantially met'' by considering the number of unmet
goals, the degree to which the goals were not met, the importance of those
goals and the reasons why the goals were not met.

Ratings
A rating will be assigned to the institution based on the goals and rating
objectives established by the plan. If the institution has not
``substantially met'' its goals, it can elect to be evaluated under the
small institution, large or retail institution, or wholesale or limited
purpose institution test, as appropriate.38 The examiners will also review
an institution's fair lending performance based on its most recent
compliance examination to determine whether evidence of discrimination
exists that should lower the institution's overall CRA Rating.

CONCLUSION
The Procedures are designed to reduce the burden associated with the CRA
examination process while at the same time ensure consistency in the
examination process. While the Revised CRA Regulations and the Procedures
shift the focus of the examination process from documentation to community
reinvestment results, examiners will continue to exercise a fair amount of
discretion in interpreting the CRA standards. For example, under the
Procedures, examiners will still be required to make subjective
determinations with regard to the ``innovativeness'' of loans and
investments and they will be required to differentiate between ``adequate''
responsiveness and ``poor'' responsiveness or ``excellent'' and
``reasonable'' dispersion of loans. In the past, the attempts by the
federal banking regulators to ensure certainty and consistency in the
examination process by revising their examination guidance and training
programs did not achieve the intended results. The success of the most
recent attempt by the regulators will be determined over time as
examinations are conducted pursuant to the Procedures. In the meantime,
institutions would be well advised to continue to maintain data to support
their CRA performance.

activities and the bank's record of opening and closing branches. M.

the Agencies to The Honorable Joseph P. Kennedy II, dated Jan. 3, 1996.
6. See 12 C.F.R. Section25.22 (b). For small institutions, the examiners
will look at objective factors such as an institution's loan to deposit
ratio; the percentage of loans located in the institution's assessment
area; and the geographic distribution of the institution's loans. See 12
C.F.R. Section25.26(a).
7. The Agencies are in the process of drafting an ``Official Staff
Commentary'' to the Revised CRA Regulations which will be published for
notice and comment in the Federal Register and which is intended to provide
the public and examiners with a consistent interpretation of the Revised
CRA Regulations.
8. The Revised CRA Regulations require large institutions to collect and
report certain data that will be used by the examiners to evaluate CRA
performance. See 12 C.F.R. Section25.42. The data will be reported to the
Agencies electronically in standardized format which will enable the
examiners to conduct much of the necessary analysis prior to the on-site
examination.
9. The Revised CRA Regulations and the Procedures address the means by
which an institution's performance will be reviewed if it has multiple
assessment areas. For purposes of this article, an institution's assessment
area is referred to in the singular.
10. The Agencies have devised standardized worksheets for use by the
examiners in determining community profile, economic patterns, and lending
distribution.
11. The examiners will conduct interviews with local community, civic, or
government leaders to help learn about the community, its economic base,
and local community development initiatives. These interviews may be
conducted prior to the examination or as part of the examination.
12. While an institution is not required to provide such information to
the examiners or to create such information, it may still be advisable to
maintain the data necessary to respond to any issues that may be raised in
the examination. To the extent an institution maintains such information,
it should provide it to the examiners to assist them in establishing the
performance context for the examination.
13. The examiners will look to institutions that are similarly situated in
terms of size, financial condition, product offerings, and business
strategy.

15. However, if the assessment area reflects illegal discrimination,
examiners will take into account problems with the designation of the
assessment area when assigning a rating to the institution. Large

16. A ``geography'' is defined in the Revised CRA Regulations to mean a
census tract or a block numbering area delineated by the Bureau of the
Census in the most recent decennial census. 12 C.F.R. Section25.12(l).
17. See 12 C.F.R. Section25.43 for a description of the items that must be
contained in a public CRA file. Generally, these items include, but are not
limited to, all written comments from the public relating to the
institution's CRA performance; the institution's most recent CRA Public
Performance Evaluation; a map of the assessment area; a list of services
provided by the institution; and, if applicable, the number and amount of
consumer loans make to the four income categories of borrowers and
geographies and the number and amount located inside and outside the
assessment area.
18. This will be accomplished by reviewing the institution's most recent
HMDA and CRA Disclosure Statement, interim HMDA Loan Application Register
(``LAR''), and any interim CRA data collected by the institution; a sample
of consumer loans if consumer lending represents a substantial majority of
the institution's business and any other information the institution
chooses to provide regarding its lending activities. The institution may
also provide information on small business loans secured by non-farm
residential real estate, home equity loans not reported for HMDA, unfunded
commitments, and information on loans outstanding and loan distribution
analysis conducted by and for the institution, including any explanations
for identified concerns or actions taken to address such concerns. Large

19. Examiners will accomplish this by requesting the institution to
identify how loans are attributed and how it ensures that all loans within
a given lending category (e.g., small business loans, home equity loans,
and other types of loans ) in a particular assessment area are reported for
all of the institution's affiliates if the institution elects to count any
affiliate loans. Id.
20. The examiners will also determine whether community development loans
benefit the institution's assessment area or a broader area that includes
the assessment area.
21. The examiners will test the accuracy of the data provided by the
institution and determine if the institution's analysis is reasonable.

THE DUTY TO RESPOND

The SEC Has Issued Two Reports on Management's Duty To Respond to Employee
Misconduct. A Company That Meaningfully Investigates Alleged Misconduct,
Ensures That It Will Not Be Repeated, and Appropriately Sanctions the
Wrongdoer Will Be Judged More Leniently than the Errant Employee.

By:
John K. Carroll*

Traditionally, the government has exercised its discretion over whether to
punish a public company for the misconduct of its officers or employees
based upon several factors: the seniority of the officer or employee
involved; the degree to which the company benefited from the misconduct,
the vulnerability of the victims; the extent of harm inflicted; and, to a
lesser degree, the foreseeability of the misconduct. The consequence of
basing prosecutorial discretion on this mix of factors has been to leave
companies -- and their innocent shareholders -- at the mercy of errant
employees. By the time a company learns of the misconduct, it may already
be too late to avoid governmental punishment.
In recent actions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'') has
indicated strongly that a new factor should be added to this mix. The SEC
has made clear that it will calibrate corporate punishment based on the
steps taken by a company, through its board and senior management, on
learning of alleged employee misconduct. In so doing, the SEC has
delineated a ``duty to respond,'' i.e., the responsibility of senior
management to investigate, deter, and punish employee and management
misconduct. This duty to respond imposes new obligations on companies
confronted with employee misconduct. In a realistic sense, it promises that
a company's punishment, if any, will depend on the knowing and intentional
conduct of its managers.
   In two reports, one issued at the end of last year, the SEC specifically
addressed the duty to respond to employee misconduct.1 A public company
whose management meets this duty can argue compellingly that it should be
judged separately from its errant employees and should be treated
leniently.2 Managers who fail to respond will be criticized and sanctioned.
Indeed, a lackadaisical management response may amplify a company's
exposure and even jeopardize its viability. This article will review the
Cooper and Gutfreund reports and examine the three steps required to
fulfill the duty to respond articulated in those reports.
THE COOPER COMPANIES
Background
In November 1992, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York
returned a 24-count indictment against the Cooper Companies, Inc. and Gary
Singer, Cooper's chief executive officer.3 In substance, the indictment
charged Singer in two fraudulent schemes relating to his position as CEO of
Cooper. The first scheme, which involved front-running, benefited both
Singer and Cooper. As set forth in the indictment, Singer was tipped by the
manager of a high-yield mutual fund with information regarding the
securities the manager intended to purchase for the portfolio. Singer
profited by going into the market ahead of the fund, purchasing bonds for
accounts he controlled, including Cooper accounts, and reselling the bonds
to the fund at a profit. In return, Singer caused payments to be made by
Cooper to the manager.
   Singer's second scheme directly victimized Cooper. Singer caused Cooper
to sell high-yield bonds at below-market prices from Cooper's position to
Singer and his family. Singer and his family then resold these bonds in the
market at a profit. Singer failed to disclose these related-party
transactions on internal Cooper questionnaires circulated among the
company's management.
   Cooper Company itself was indicted as a participant in Singer's first
scheme, even though the company was the direct victim of Singer's second
scheme and its shareholders were the direct or indirect victims of all of
Singer's misconduct. Simultaneous with the filing of the indictment, the
SEC filed a civil action against Cooper, Singer, and his brother Steven
Singer arising out of the same series of transactions.4
   On January 13, 1994, following a jury trial, Singer was found guilty in
connection with each of the schemes.5 The company was also convicted in
connection with the front-running scheme. Eleven months later, on December
12, 1994, the SEC settled its civil charges against Cooper. As a part of
that settlement, the company agreed to be permanently enjoined from further
violations of specified sections of the securities laws, and from any
further employment of Gary or Steven Singer. In addition, Cooper was
ordered to disgorge $1.4 million plus interest, and to pay a civil penalty
of $1.15 million. The settlement permitted Cooper to offset these payments
against fines and restitution and interest payments made in connection with
the criminal conviction.6
The Board's Failure to Respond
The charges against Cooper in both the indictment and the SEC complaint
represent starkly the inherent paradox when a fraud charge is brought
against not only an employee but a public company itself. Why should
innocent shareholders suffer the financial consequences of their company's
indictment for the misconduct of an employee, albeit the chief executive
officer? This issue is especially germane to the Cooper case because the
company and its shareholders were the direct and intended victims of much
of Singer's misconduct. In its recent report, the SEC answered that
question by sharply criticizing Cooper's board for failing to respond to
its knowledge of Singer's misconduct. The board's failure is worth
discussing at length.
   As discussed in the report, Cooper's directors were first notified of
alleged misconduct by Singer in January 1992, when the SEC issued a Formal
Order of Investigation of the Cooper Company.7 The board responded to the
SEC notice by disclosing the pendency of the investigation in the company's
form 10-K filed at the end of January. There is no indication that the
board took any other action in response to the subpoena.
   In early February 1992, the gap between the interests of the company and
those of the Singers widened. In response to SEC questioning, both Singers
asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege and declined to testify. At the
time he invoked his privilege, Gary Singer was Cooper's CEO and Steven
Singer was acting chief operating officer. Gary Singer had the authority to
trade in the company's securities accounts. Steven Singer was formally
elected COO just days following his refusal to testify.
   In March, after being formally advised that the company was being
investigated by the U.S. Attorney's office, the board authorized an
internal investigation by independent counsel. The board was subsequently
informed that independent counsel was unable to interview either Singer
brother. The investigation did reveal, however, that Gary Singer had
diverted $600,000 in trading profits from the company to personal and
family accounts.8
   The government investigation continued, and in May charges were filed
against the two men who participated in the front-running scheme with Gary
and Steven Singer. In connection with his guilty plea, one of these men
identified Gary Singer as a co-conspirator. Although the board was aware of
these developments, it took no action in response. Subsequently, Steven
Singer caused the company to issue a press release in which the company
denied knowledge of any wrongdoing on the part of management. Although this
was clearly false, the board took no action.
   Until the end of May when he agreed to take a leave of absence, Gary
Singer continued in his capacity as CEO. Even after his departure, the
board approved the continuation of his pay and benefits and authorized the
relocation of his offices. The company issued a press release about his
leave of absence that included a denial by Singer that he had participated
in any illegal activity. This press release was also the first public
disclosure of Gary and Steven Singer's refusal to testify before the SEC or
to cooperate in the Company's internal investigation.
   During the late summer and fall of 1992, Gary and Steven Singer
continued to participate in the business of the company. Gary Singer
attended board meetings, was present at the company's headquarters, and
continued to have contact with the company's securities brokers. Steven
Singer was re-elected as COO in late July. It was not until November 1992
that the board finally determined that additional supervision of Steven
Singer was needed in light of his assertion of the Fifth Amendment in his
January testimony.
   The 21(a) Report
The SEC unsparingly criticized the board's failure to respond to the
allegations of the Singers' misconduct. As the Commission reported,
Cooper's board had an affirmative obligation to act; by not acting, it
failed to meet its duties. The Commission explained that it is
[e]ssential for board members to move aggressively to fulfill their
responsibilities to oversee the conduct and performance of management and
to ensure that the company's public statements are candid and complete.
   In this case, Cooper's Board failed to satisfy its obligations when
confronted with serious indications of management fraud. After the Board
learned that a member of senior management had concealed fraudulent
self-dealing transactions and thereby caused the company's outstanding
reports to be inaccurate, the Board failed to take immediate and effective
action to protect the interests of the company's investors. The Board's
inaction allowed a second corporate officer, who himself was allegedly
involved in the fraudulent front-running scheme, to direct the issuance of
a press release on behalf of the company falsely denying any knowledge of
wrongdoing. By failing to take immediate and decisive corrective action on
these matters, the Cooper Board appeared to prefer management's interest in
keeping the facts secret over the investors' interest in full, fair, and
accurate disclosure under the federal securities laws.9
   The consequence of the board's inaction was dramatic. By aligning
Cooper's interests with the Singers' fate, the board nullified its chances
of receiving lenient treatment from the government. Indeed, the indictment
of Cooper, in spite of its status as victim in one of Gary Singer's
schemes, can be traced directly to the board's failure to respond
appropriately to the allegations of employee misconduct.
GUTFREUND
The Failure to Respond
The facts relating to misconduct on the government trading desk at Salomon
Brothers in 1991 have been rehearsed thoroughly.10 The details of
management's failure to respond to that misconduct are particularly
instructive when considered along with the Cooper matter.
   In late April 1991, John H. Gutfreund, Thomas W. Strauss, and John W.
Meriwether, three members of Salomon's most senior management, learned that
Paul Mozer, the head of the firm's government trading desk, had submitted a
false bid in an auction of Treasury securities. Promptly upon learning of
the false bid, these three senior managers and Donald M. Feuerstein,
Salomon's chief legal officer, convened and discussed Mozer's misconduct.
They concluded that Mozer's misconduct should be reported to the
government. Nevertheless, they did not even discuss ``investigating what
Mozer had done disciplining him, or placing limits on his
activities.''11
   Salomon's supervisors compounded this failure by not acting on their
decision to self-report for more than three months. In the interim, Mozer
committed additional violations of the securities laws. In early July 1991,
Salomon retained outside counsel to investigate a separate allegation of
misconduct relating to the government trading desk. In the course of that
investigation, Feuerstein disclosed Mozer's earlier misconduct to counsel.
Thereafter, counsel widened its inquiry and uncovered additional
auction-related misconduct.
   In August 1991, four months after concluding that Mozer had engaged in
substantial misconduct, Salomon finally suspended Mozer and three others
and publicly disclosed that it had uncovered irregularities on its
government trading desk. Within days, Gutfreund, Strauss, Meriwether, and
Feuerstein resigned their positions.
The Commission's Criticism
The Securities Exchange Act imposes upon broker-dealers a specific duty to
supervise that does not explicitly apply to other public companies.12
Failure to meet supervisory obligations can serve as a basis for
sanctioning individuals as well as the broker-dealer itself. Gutfreund,
Strauss, and Meriwether each were sternly punished for their failure to
supervise.13
Although section 15 reaches only broker-dealers and the employees of
broker-dealers, it would be naive for any public company to ignore the
clear duty to respond set forth in Gutfreund:14
   The supervisory obligations imposed by the federal securities laws
require a vigorous response even to indications of wrongdoing. Many of the
Commission's cases involving a failure to supervise arise from situations
where supervisors were aware only of ``red flags'' or ``suggestions'' of
irregularity, rather than situations where, as here, supervisors were
explicitly informed of an illegal act.
   Even where the knowledge of supervisors is limited to ``red flags'' or
``suggestions'' of irregularity, they cannot discharge their supervisory
obligations simply by relying on the unverified representations of
employees. Instead, as the Commission has repeatedly emphasized, [t]here
must be adequate follow-up and review when a firm's own procedures detect
irregularities or unusual trading activity.'' Moreover, if more than one
supervisor is involved in considering the actions to be taken in response
to possible misconduct, there must be clear definition of the efforts to be
taken and a clear assignment of those responsibilities to specific
individuals within the firm.
   In Gutfreund, the Commission upbraided Salomon's managers for their
failure to investigate responsibly ``what had occurred and whether there
had been other instances of unreported misconduct.'' Until that inquiry was
complete, Salomon should have increased supervision of Mozer and
appropriately limited his activities.
   Another precedent, In the Matter of the Boston Company, Inc., provides a
stark and encouraging contrast to the results in Gutfreund. There the
Commission lightly sanctioned Boston Co.'s management because, in the
Commission's view, it had met its obligations under the duty to respond. As
set forth in the Commission's report, Boston Co. used improper accounting
practices and, as a result, overstated its income by $44 million for the
first three quarters of 1988. As a result, Boston Co.'s parent, Shearson
Lehman Brothers, overstated its income for the same period.15
A portion of the overstatement resulted from the improper characterization
of certain income and expenses, done at the direction of ``certain''
company officers. Citing the exemplary response of management from both
companies, including the firing of Boston Co.'s CEO, the institution of
internal controls, and cooperation with the SEC, the Commission issued a
simple ``cease and desist'' order against Boston Co. and took no action
against Shearson.16 According to one news report of the settlement, the
Commission chose leniency over the stiffer sanctions recommended by its
enforcement staff because of management's response upon the discovery of
misconduct.
THE DUTY TO RESPOND
With the Cooper and Gutfreund cases, the Commission has imposed upon the
senior managers of public companies the obligation to ``take immediate and
decisive corrective action'' when ``confronted with serious indications of
management fraud.'' In practice, this duty to respond requires that, upon
learning of allegations of misconduct, management and the board (i)
investigate the allegations to determine whether they are substantial, (ii)
take steps to deter repetition of any misconduct, and (iii) if warranted,
sanction the employees involved.
   This duty does not necessarily require that a company report its
findings to the government,17 although such a duty may arise from another
source.18 Alternatively, the company may also determine that the benefits
of self-reporting exceed the almost certain costs.19
In sum, Cooper and Gutfreund should be read to impose a duty to act rather
than wait for government reaction. The company is obligated to investigate,
make a determination, and act based on that determination. It is important
to note that the duty to respond is not an obligation to accede to every
government allegation of misconduct. Rather, the duty is met when
management can answer a regulator's questions by stating, ``We responsibly
investigated the alleged misconduct and took the actions that we deemed
appropriate based upon that responsible investigation.''20
Meaningful Investigation
When management reasonably suspects that an employee has engaged in
misconduct that has brought a benefit to the company, the company should
conduct a meaningful investigation of the misconduct. The scope of a
meaningful investigation differs with the situation, but it always includes
two steps. The company must first review relevant company documents and
then interview current employees with access to relevant information. If
these two steps are not completed, company management will have failed in
its duty to respond and both management and the company will face increased
jeopardy of being charged.
   A meaningful investigation can be completed by internal counsel,
accounting, business, or compliance personnel. Conducting a review
internally does raise certain risks, however. A review conducted by
non-legal personnel will not be protected from discovery by the
attorney-client privilege.21 Similarly, review should never be conducted by
personnel who had even tangential connection to the conduct under review.
Where an employee is both a fact witness and an investigator, the
likelihood that the results of the internal investigation will be disclosed
increases greatly.22 At the same time, internal counsel may not have
sufficient perspective to conduct an arm's-length review and the friction
generated by an internal inquiry can limit the ability of internal counsel
to conduct his or her day-to-day advisory duties.
   No hard and fast rule governs whether and when employees should be
invited to retain their own counsel.23 Typically, independent employee
counsel is not used at the beginning of an investigation. At such an early
stage, the company does not know whether the employee's interests have
diverged from the company's. The employee must be fully informed, however,
that counsel is representing the company, not him or her personally.24 The
investigating counsel should specifically advise the employee that the
results of his or her interview will be used in the company's best
interests and that the company controls the use of interview notes or
memoranda. Such use may include disclosure to the government if the company
later determines to waive its own privilege.
   Separate representation is advisable when and if the employee's
interests are no longer co-extensive with the company's. A strong employee
defense benefits the company since the company may be vicariously liable
for the employee's wrongful conduct.25 By retaining separate employee
counsel, a company can present a separate face to an investigating
regulator or prosecutor. For example, if the company chooses to adopt a
conciliatory posture, employee counsel will be able to defend aggressively
a position that company counsel could not advocate. Finally, internal
inquiries strain company morale. Some of that strain may be mitigated if
employees perceive that the company will support their separate defense.
   Regardless of whether the company provides employee defense,
management's primary obligation is to ensure that employees central to the
inquiry are interviewed. The employee, no matter what his or her level of
management, cannot be permitted to refuse to speak with the company's
investigators. As the Cooper matter makes clear, failure to interview the
central subjects in an internal inquiry results in the unification of
interests -- and outcomes -- for the company and the individual.26 Where
the employee did not act wrongfully, such an identity of interests is
appropriate; where the employee did act wrongfully, the company must
separate its interests from the individual's. The only way a company can
make that evaluation is by learning the facts. A company that must concede
to a regulator or prosecutor that it failed to interview the central
subject has forfeited its ability to argue compellingly that it should be
viewed differently from an errant employee.
   Ultimately, the company's obligation is to inquire into a situation
thoroughly enough to determine whether wrongful conduct occurred. Cooper
stands for the proposition that a company is obliged to reach its own
independent conclusions and act based upon those conclusions rather than
postpone that responsibility by waiting for a regulator, prosecutor, or
court to reach judgment.27 A regulator expects the company to accept the
responsibility of supervising employee conduct rather than demurring and
relying upon government action.28
Ensuring That It Will Not Happen Again
The Gutfreund matter likely would have been more containable had management
promptly inquired into Mozer's prior conduct upon first learning of the
false bid. Instead, the company's exposure increased dramatically when
misconduct on the treasury desk repeated itself after management's initial
discovery. In effect, Salomon lost its ability to argue convincingly that
it had been deceived by its own employee. By failing to take corrective
steps, management allowed misconduct to happen on management's watch.29
A company discovering employee misconduct must act to ensure that such
misconduct will not happen again. Often corrective steps may involve no
more than increased supervision. Pre-clearing employee activity by an
immediate supervisor frequently fulfills this need.
   On occasion, more is required. Counsel may recommend that new business
or compliance policies be adopted. The company may determine during the
course of its investigation that it wants to change the way it pursues a
particular business or exit that business entirely. Particularly where
class action or shareholder suits loom a company may determine that
business practices should change.
Internal Sanctions
The internal review may reveal that the employee has acted wrongfully. The
company must act on this information. In the most extreme circumstances, an
employee may have to be terminated and/or reported to a regulator. More
often, the appropriate sanction will be a change in job responsibilities or
title or a reduction in bonus or some other economic penalty.
   By acting decisively, the company not only strengthens its argument that
it should be judged separately from the employee, it also gains credibility
in the government's investigative process. By appropriately sanctioning an
employee who has acted wrongfully, the company bolsters its ability to
argue that another employee acted correctly. The company in effect
validates its vote on the conduct of the employees it will aggressively
defend.
   Companies in a regulated industry engage in a constant dialogue with
their regulators. How a company acts in one circumstance will condition the
regulator's expectation in the next. A company that is not perceived as
accepting the responsibility of self-regulation will have difficulty
convincing the government that its fate should be considered separately
from the fate of the employee in trouble.

bonds just before reset date to buoy the price, and also caused two small
brokerage firms with which Cooper was affiliated to opine falsely that the
value of the bonds was below the reset trigger. Id., 70-96.

responsible for supervising costs under the contracts at issue. The
employees were subpoenaed to testify for the grand jury, where they refused
to answer certain questions based on their employer's assertion of
privilege. The court held that while communications between corporate
counsel and these employees were privileged, their knowledge of the
underlying facts was not. Moreover, the defendants did not identify what

witnesses which would be protected by the ``work product'' privilege. The
court directed the prosecution to rephrase certain questions to omit

ASSET CONCENTRATION ISSUES IN REAL ESTATE SECURITIZATIONS

By:
Karsten P. Giesecke and Michael Ready Treanor, Jr.*

The volume of new issuances of commercial (including multifamily)
mortgage-backed securities (``CMBSs'') has grown at a tremendous pace since
1991, and significantly more CMBSs are likely to be issued in the future.
For example, only two percent of non-multifamily commercial mortgage loans
have been securitized.1 Much of this increased CMBS volume has been in the
form of registered public offerings, even though public offerings of CMBSs
implicate co-registration and disclosure issues not present in traditional
mortgage or asset-backed transactions. Disclosure issues arise in a CMBS
transaction largely due to the economic significance of individual mortgage
loans that back a CMBS. In particular, where individual mortgage loans or a
group of related mortgage loans constitute a significant portion of the
assets underlying a CMBS offering, borrowers or other parties may be
required to sign the registration statement as ``co-issuers,'' or the user
may be required to provide financial disclosure regarding the borrowers or
the properties backing such a CMBS. This article will discuss the current
rules governing co-issuer registration and financial disclosure applicable
to registered CMBS offerings.
COMMERCIAL OR MULTIFAMILY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES
Mortgage-backed securities are securities backed by one or more mortgage
loans in a structure designed to protect investors from credit risks (other
than those associated with the underlying mortgage loans), particularly
against claims by creditors of the issuer or sponsor of the transaction.
Such securities can therefore be rated based on anticipated cash flows
from, and credit risks associated with, such mortgage loans.
   Registration of public mortgage-backed securities may be accomplished
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ``1933 Act''), by filing
a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
``Commission''), usually using either form S-11 or form S-3. Form S-11 may
be used for the registration of securities of certain real estate companies
and is available for the issuance of either (i) securities issued by real
estate investment trusts, or (ii) securities issued by issuers whose
primary business is that of acquiring, and holding for investment, real
estate or interests in real estate or interests in other issuers whose
business is investing in real estate.2 Since amendments made to form S-3 as
announced in the Commission's Rel. No. 33-6964 (1992) (the ``Asset-Backed
Shelf Release''), form S-3 is available to, among others, issuers of
``asset-backed securities'' that are offered for cash and which are
``investment grade.''3 Unlike form S-11, form S-3 permits the issuer to
incorporate by reference reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the ``1934 Act''). Only issuers using form S-3 have the
additional benefit of the no-action position of the staff of the
Commission's Division of Corporation Finance (the ``Staff''), which permits
delivery of certain computational materials and collateral information
before delivery of a final prospectus.4 Registrants using both form S-3
and form S-11 may also be able to offer securities on a delayed basis
pursuant to the Commission's 1933 Act rule 415.5
   Mortgage loans backing traditional single-family residential
mortgage-backed securities generally contain large numbers of homogeneous
mortgage loans, thereby rendering each individual mortgage loan
statistically insignificant and allowing rating agencies to rate a
transaction based on a statistical analysis of the pool as a whole. The
Commission similarly has concluded that, for traditional single-family
residential mortgage-backed securities, financial information concerning
the related borrowers is unimportant to the investment decision.6 In
contrast, because the initial principal balance of a typical commercial or
multifamily mortgage loan is much higher than the principal balance of the
individual obligations backing other securitizations of pooled assets, CMBS
pools often include fewer mortgage loans, with each individual asset
representing a larger percentage of the pool (an ``asset
concentration'').7
   The Commission has identified two principal consequences of asset
concentration. First, the Commission has indicated that ``asset-backed
offerings with significant asset concentration may involve one or more
co-issuers under Securities Act Rule 140.'' In addition, the Commission has
indicated that ``if a significant amount of the asset pool represents the
obligations of a single obligor or related obligors, financial information
and other disclosure about the obligor(s) may be required.''
   In the Asset-Backed Shelf Release the staff declined expressly to
identify asset concentration limits, indicating instead that existing
disclosure rules would continue to apply. The Staff has since settled on
three key concentration levels as being important. A mortgage loan
representing 45 percent of a pool triggers co-issuer requirements, a
mortgage loan representing over 20 percent of a pool triggers requirements
to file full audited property-level financial statements, and a mortgage
loan representing over 10 percent of a pool triggers requirements for
condensed unaudited property-level financial statements.
CO-REGISTRATION AND RULE 140
The Asset-Backed Shelf Release stated that securities backed by the assets
of a single obligor or group of related obligors are not ``asset-backed
securities'' for purposes of the new form S-3 rules.8 As a result, an
issuer relying on characterization of its securities as ``asset-backed
securities'' to make such securities eligible for form S-3 and shelf
registration under rule 4159 must involve at least two obligors or groups
of related obligors.10
Of greater significance than the prohibition against shelf registration for
single obligor pools is the requirement that, where significant asset
concentration exists, one or more borrowers with respect to the underlying
mortgage loans may be required to co-register the issuance of the
securities.11 Rule 140 of the 1933 Act provides that:
[a] person, the chief part of whose business consists of the purchase of
the securities of one issuer, or of two or more affiliated issuers, and the
sale of its own securities ... is to be regarded as engaged in the
distribution of the securities of such issuer or affiliated issuers within
the meaning of Section 2(11) of the [1933 Act]. [emphasis added]
   In simpler terms, rule 140 provides that when an issuer of a security
(the ``Delivered Security'') uses the proceeds of the sale of the Delivered
Security to acquire securities of another issuer (the ``Underlying
Security'') from such issuer, the issuer of the Delivered Security is also
deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the Underlying Security.
Accordingly, the Underlying Security is also being publicly offered and the
``issuer'' of the Delivered Security, who is deemed to be directly
accessing the capital markets, must sign the related registration statement
as a registrant in the public offering of the Delivered Security. The view
of the Staff that rule 140 is applicable in the context of a commercial
mortgage loan-backed securitization suggests that the Staff views mortgage
loans (including those providing for recourse only against the mortgaged
property) as securities requiring registration if sold in a public
offering.12
   In order to determine the applicability of rule 140 to a particular
securitization, it is necessary to determine whether the ``chief part'' of
the business of the issuer of the Delivered Security is the purchase of
Underlying Securities of a single obligor or related obligors. The Staff
has taken the position that where obligations backing securities include
the obligations of a single obligor or related obligors constituting at
least 45 percent of the mortgage loan pool backing such securities, rule
140 is implicated and such obligor or related obligors must co-register.
   Rule 140 has generally been viewed as applying only where a person
purchases securities from an issuer, and therefore, would not apply where
mortgage loans made to a non-affiliate are acquired in the secondary market
and not from the borrower. In addition, there have been indications from
the Staff that it is reconsidering the inapplicability of rule 140 to such
secondary market purchases and may expand its breadth.13 In the context of
commercial mortgage securitization, the Staff has taken a broader position,
to the effect that rule 140 applies if the issuer of the Underlying
Security financially benefits from the securitization (as a result of which
the issuer of the Delivered Security may have leverage to require the
involvement of the issuer of the Underlying Security in the offering of the
Delivered Security). In such cases, it is appropriate to determine whether
``significant involvement'' exists based on the individual facts and
circumstances presented.
   Where co-registration is required, securities which might have been
eligible for issuance under rule 415 of the 1933 Act on a delayed or
continuous basis (i.e., a shelf registration) will now, as a practical
matter, be required to be registered on a separate registration statement
(i.e., on a one-off basis) because of the need to include the related
obligor as a co-registrant.14 This has the effect of increasing the costs
associated with a CMBS transaction by requiring the preparation of a full
registration statement for each new issue. In addition to the time and
expense of issuing securities on a one-off basis, forcing an obligor to
co-register means that the obligor will be liable as an issuer under the
1933 Act and the 1934 Act and may become subject to the reporting
requirements of the 1934 Act.15
   In addition, the co-registration concentration levels trigger issuer
financial statement disclosure requirements with respect to the obligor of
the Underlying Security. Under regulation S-X, sections 3-01 and 3-02, the
borrower's financial statements must be included in the disclosure to
potential securityholders. Regulation S-X, section 3-01 requires each
registrant to file a consolidated audited balance sheet as of the end of
each of the two most recent fiscal years or, if the registrant has been in
existence for less than one fiscal year, as of a date within 135 days of
the date of filing the registration statement.16 Furthermore, section 3-02
requires the registrant to file a consolidated audited statement ``of
income and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years preceding the date
of the most recent audited balance sheet being filed or such shorter period
as the registrant (including predecessors) has been in existence.''17 For
filings made more than 134 days after the end of the fiscal year, an
unaudited interim balance sheet and a corresponding statement of income and
cash flows must be provided.18
   In a typical CMBS securitization, the mortgagor is often a newly-created
special purpose entity which has as its sole asset the ownership of the
underlying real property, and, accordingly, it might be expected that the
mortgagor's financial statements only cover a short period of time. The
requirement of section 3-02 that the registrant's statement of income and
cash flows include predecessor businesses may, however, create significant
difficulty if mortgage loan borrower financial statements are required.
Since the special purpose vehicle may be considered a successor to the
earlier business from which it acquired the property, financial statements
of such predecessor business may be required. Such predecessor financial
statements may not be readily obtainable. Section 3-05 of regulation S-X
addresses predecessor business financial disclosure and indicates that a
determination of whether a business has been acquired is to be made with
reference to the guidance set forth in regulations S-X, section 11-01(d).
Under section 11-01(d), an acquisition of a business occurs when, in light
of the facts and circumstances involved, ``there is sufficient continuity
of the acquired entity's operations prior to and after the transactions so
that disclosure of prior financial information is material to an
understanding of future operations.''19 Such continuity is more likely to
be viewed as present if the special purpose vehicle is related to the prior
obligor. To resolve predecessor business issues, it is likely that a
discussion with the Chief Accountant's Office of the Commission would be
appropriate.
PROPERTY-LEVEL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As previously indicated, in instances where sufficient asset concentration
exists, the Commission requires disclosure of financial information
concerning the specific assets constituting the pool.
   The Staff has taken the position that, in the event that a single
mortgage loan exceeds 20 percent of the pool, audited financial statements
with respect to the property, as described in sections 3-01 and 3-02 of
regulation S-X, are required. As described above, sections 3-01 and 3-02
generally require audited balance sheets for the two most recent fiscal
years and audited income statements and statements of cash flows for the
three fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balance
sheet being filed. In addition, for filings made after 134 days subsequent
to the most recent fiscal year, a balance sheet as of an interim date
within 135 days of the date of filing together with a related interim
statement of income and cash flows, which in each case may be unaudited,
must be provided. Staff Accounting Bulletins 71 and 71A (``SAB 71/71A'')
state that where ``the amount of a loan exceeds 20 percent of the amount in
good faith expected to be raised in the offering, disclosure would be
expected to consist of financial statements for the underlying operating
properties for the periods contemplated by rule 3-14,''20 which indicates
that, for acquired properties, financial statements are for shorter
periods. Rule 3-14 does not apply in the case of acquired businesses,
however, as to which rule 3-01 and 3-02 financials (including as required
for predecessor businesses) must be included. In many cases (including in
particular where the acquired assets are in the form of a business, such as
hotel or nursing home loans), the Staff has viewed acquired mortgage loans
as acquired businesses.
   The Staff has taken the position that ``condensed'' financial
information should be provided as to assets that constitute more than 10
percent but not more than 20 percent of the entire pool.21 Condensed
financial information is financial information generally presented in
accordance with article X of regulation S-X and generally consists of
consolidated unaudited statements similar to those required in a form 10-Q
filing under the 1934 Act.
ADDITIONAL ASSET CONCENTRATION ISSUES
While the Staff's position with respect to asset concentration provides
guidance to CMBS issuers, it leaves unresolved many issues regarding
exactly what constitutes asset concentration. In particular, in what
instances do the relationships between borrowers, cross-collateralization,
common tenants, or other common features between mortgage loans result in
such mortgage loans being treated as a single mortgage loan for the
foregoing analysis, or result in the underlying borrowers being treated as
a single borrower? The analysis is a factual one resolved on a case-by-case
basis, generally after prior consultation with the Staff. Nevertheless,
certain guidelines are available.
   In the instance of a pool consisting of fully cross-collateralized and
cross-defaulted mortgage loans securing the debt of unrelated obligors, the
Staff has indicated that such a pool would be treated as a single loan
subject to the 10 percent or 20 percent financial reporting standards, as
appropriate, even though the individual obligors may be completely
unrelated.22 In addition, the underlying borrowers are generally regarded
by the Staff as a single borrower under the assumption that they are acting
in concert. This may not be the case where it can be proven that the
unrelated obligors have voluntarily cross-collateralized and
cross-defaulted without the expectation of a pecuniary or other benefit,
which would seem to be an exceedingly rare situation.
   In addition to obligor-based asset concentration, other types of
concentration may trigger the need for additional financial disclosure. In
the event that there is a concentration of tenants, financial statements
for such tenants may be required,23 although it is unclear at what level of
concentration such financial statements will be required, and, if required,
the nature of such financial statements (i.e., audited or condensed).24
Furthermore, in the event of a concentration of managers, the Staff has
indicated that it may require financial statements for such managers
because of a perception that the bankruptcy of a significant manager could
affect securityholders.25

Reg. (Sept. 14, 1994.)
2. See General Instructions to form S-11.
3. ``Asset-backed securities'' include qualifying mortgage-backed
securities (including commercial mortgage-backed securities). ``Investment
grade'' means that at the time of the sale to the public, the securities
are rated by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating
organization in one of its generic rating categories signifying investment
grade (typically one of the four highest categories). Form S-3 is also
generically available to large, widely-held issuers, to subsidiaries of
such companies, and for securities guaranteed by such companies. See
General Instructions to form S-3.
4. Because mortgage-backed securities are frequently not structured (and
therefore a final prospectus cannot be printed) until after certain
institutional investors have decided on their particular requirements after
receipt of certain information, the Staff has permitted delivery by
registrants of asset-backed securities on form S-3 of certain computational
materials and collateral information prior to the delivery of a final
prospectus. See Kidder, Peabody Acceptance Corporation I (avail. May 20,
1994); Public Securities Association (avail. May 27, 1994).
5. Rule 415 or, as it is commonly referred to, the ``shelf rule'', permits
certain securities to be offered on a delayed or continuous basis, thereby
avoiding the necessity of preparing a new registration statement for each
offering, and thus greatly speeding up the time required to issue new
securities and reducing related costs. Rule 415 is available to offerings
which ``qualify'' for form S-3 and, therefore, in the event an offering
``qualifies'' for form S-3, the offering may be registered under another
form (such as form S-1 or form S-11) and still offer securities ``off the
shelf''. Rule 415 is also available for ``mortgage-related securities,''
which include certain securities rated in one of the two highest rating
categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating agency and which
are backed by qualifying residential mortgage loans.
6. The Commission indicated in the Asset-Backed Shelf Release that in a
situation where asset-backed securities are secured ``by a pool of
financial assets representing obligations of a large number of obligors ...
the information about the financial condition of any one obligor is not
important to an investment decision.''
7. Larger pools of commercial or multifamily mortgage loans may avoid
asset concentration issues. This is particularly true for ``conduit''
programs providing for acquisition of mortgage loans from multiple sources
which, as part of the program parameters, limit the size of mortgage loans
specifically to avoid asset concentration concerns.
8. Id. at page 22 ``... the definition does not encompass securities
issued in structured financings for one obligor or related group of
obligors''. See also Rel. No. 33-6943 (notice of proposed rulemaking) at 25
(``Structured financings would not be considered asset-backed securities
for the purposes of the proposed revisions to form S-3 where a substantial
portion of the underlying assets are originated by one obligor (including
affiliated entities).'')
9. Single-loan multifamily mortgage-backed securities may still be
eligible for shelf registration if they constitute ``mortgage-related
securities'' as used in rule 415.
10. As described below, unless the underlying mortgage loans were acquired
in secondary market purchases so that rule 140 would not apply, or
co-registrants are already included in the shelf registration statement, as
a practical matter at least three obligors or groups of obligors would be
required.
11. In the Asset-Backed Shelf Release, the Staff stated that, in instances
where there is significant asset concentration, such an asset-backed
offering ``may involve one or more co-issuers under rule 140.''
12. But see Bob Reves, et al. v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56 (1990).
13. Although open-market purchases of commercial mortgage loans may not
trigger rule 140 (assuming no involvement at all by the obligors under such
loans in the new offering and regardless of the existence of asset
concentration with respect to the mortgage loans), they could potentially
trigger the requirement for property-level financial statements in the
event that mortgage loans of a single obligor or group of related obligors
exceed the 10% or 20% thresholds described below.
14. The Staff has taken the position that the amendment of a shelf
registration statement so as to add or change a co-registrant is not
permissible.
15. But see Linpro Income Fund I Partnership (avail. Nov. 29, 1986) and
Rockefeller Center Properties & RCP Associates (avail Jan. 2, 1986)
(co-registrant not required to file 1934 Act reports). Furthermore, this
article does not attempt to address the potential applicability of the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939 to the mortgage notes insofar as they are
considered debt securities by the Commission.

20. SAB 71, interpretive response to Question 1.
21. Comments of Linda Quinn, Director of the Division of Corporate
Finance, at the ABA Annual Meeting on August 9-10, 1994. The requirement to
provide condensed financial information is not based on any published
position of the Commission. Indeed there is some authority indicating that
audited financial statements would be required, at least with respect to
investment-type arrangements. In the Staff Accounting Bulletins, Topic 1 --
Financial Statements, I. Financial Statements of Properties Securing
Mortgage Loans, the Staff indicated that ``separate audited financial
statements should be provided for any investment-type arrangement that
constitutes 10% or more of the greater of (i) the amount of minimum
proceeds, or (ii) the total assets of the registrant, including the amount
of proceeds raised'' and this language has been cited by the Staff in
support of its asset concentration thresholds. Of course, the Commission
bases its standards only in part on the Staff Accounting Bulletins, as the
interpretive responses in Topic 1 were not specifically drafted for CMBS
transactions.
22. Such an analysis would create the result that audited property level
financial statements should be included on an aggregate basis. Such
financial statements, however, are not always available and the exact
nature of financial disclosure must generally be resolved in discussions
with the Staff.
23. Unlike the requirement for obligor financials which, in a non-recourse
transaction, is of nominal investor interest, financial information
concerning major tenants appears to be of significant investor interest as
the availability of funds to pay securityholders will depend on the
timeliness of the lease payments by major tenants.
24. The Staff has indicated that, in cases where there is tenant
concentration but the tenant is not involved in the offering (and,
accordingly, audited financial statements, and related auditors' consents,
cannot be obtained), the transaction may still proceed as a registered
public offering provided that the tenant is a publicly reporting company
and its public filings (including audited financial statements) can be
referenced in the prospectus.
25. This view is mitigated by provisions in the relevant documents which
provide for replacement of the manager and the use of a lockbox or other
mechanism to protect the cash flow from creditors of the manager.


Information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable.
However, accuracy, adequacy, or completeness is not guaranteed.

ADMINISTRATION SEEKS REPEAL OF KEY AUDITING REQUIREMENTS
IBAA Pushes Reforms

In response to banking industry pressure, the Bush
administration is drafting legislation that would undo several key
auditing and regulatory requirements contained in the 1991 Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).
     If submitted, the bill could set the stage for a
heated fight pitting the administration against congressional
Democrats and Republicans who feel the requirements are necessary to
protect federal deposit insurance funds.
     The proposal, requested by the Independent Bankers
Association of America (IBAA), would repeal a FDICIA provision
requiring outside ratios of market value to book value for publicly
traded bank and thrift stocks.
      Permit rural financial institutions with less than
$100 million in assets to self-certify their compliance with the
Community Reinvestment Act.
      Allow regulators to grant all institutions CRA
credit for making loans to depressed areas that are outside an
institutions delineated community.
      Clarify that the standards for safety and soundness
mandated by the FDICIA do not require micro-management of
institutions management and operations.
      Repeal the small business and small farm reporting
requirements imposed by the FDICIA.
      Postpone for a year the truth-in-savings provision
of the FDICIA.
      Specify that the FDICIAs aggregate lending limit
exceptions for insider loans would also apply to loans secured by
Treasury obligations.
      Repeal a FDICIA provision requiring regulatory
agencies to establish detailed compensation standards for officers,
directors and employees of healthy institutions.
      Require regulators to demonstrate immediate and
irreparable harm before seizing or freezing assets in advance of an
administrative law judge hearing of accused institution officers,
directors and outside professionals.
     According to the IBAA, the above amendments actually
constitute a scaled-back list of regulatory reforms the
administration feels it can implement this year if a majority in the
banking and insurance industries agree to a broader legislative
package on interstate banking liberalization. That package includes
substantial home office protection for banks and thrifts in smaller
communities, reauthorization of insurance sales by community banks in
towns of less than 5,000 people and limitations on court-sanctioned
insurance underwriting and sales by the nations largest banks.
     Interestingly enough, a bill that would mandate some
of the FDICIA reforms sought by the administration and the IBAA has
been introduced by Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan.
     Doles legislation would exempt institutions with
under $100 million in assets from CRA requirements if they are
located in towns with populations of 20,000 or less. It also would
provide a CRA safe harbor for institutions with assets of $300
million or less, if they have satisfactory CRA ratings.
     The bill would require banking regulators to
coordinate their actions to ensure consistency and uniformity of
standards.
     It would clarify that regulators are empowered to set
levels below which certified or licensed appraisers are not required
to perform appraisals.
     Moreover, the measure would require regulators to
perform an economic impact analysis on any rule that affects more
than 20% of all small institutions.
     In addition to the reforms, Doles legislation would
impose a 15-month moratorium on Office of Thrift Supervision approval
of any interstate branching applications by federal associations
submitted under a rule that became effective last month.
     The IBAA opposes the regulation, fearing that it
could prompt large banks to seek interstate branching equity in the
federal courts.

IRS DEBT RESERVE PROPOSAL SETS OFF THRIFT OBJECTIONS

An Internal Revenue Service proposal to tighten the
tax requirements on bad debt reserves of savings and loan
associations has triggered loud protests from the thrift industry.
     The tempest was ignited by an IRS plan to require
S&Ls immediately to recapture into income their bad debt reserves
when they change to a commercial bank charter or when they diversify
and their home mortgage-related assets decline below 60% of their
total assets.
     In other words, the entire amount of bad debt
reserves would have to be included immediately in an institutions
taxable income instead of being capitalized over the life of the
troubled debt portfolio involved.
     Under the IRS revision, thrifts that switch charters
or flunk the IRS version of the thrift lender test would be
confronted with a much harsher tax schedule than commercial banks,
one that would place them at a competitive disadvantage, the S&L
industry argues.
     Moreover, it would prevent thrifts from expanding
their services more fully to meet the needs of their customers,
contends the Savings & Community Bankers of America (SCBA), a new
trade group formed by the merger of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions and the National Council of Community Bankers. The SCBA
contends that the IRS regulation would thwart the Treasury
Departments broader efforts to modernize the banking industry and
permit savings institutions to offer a wider array of products and
services. Asserting that there is no statutory language authorizing
IRS to alter the existing bad debt reserve formula, the SCBA
recommends that the agency withdraw its proposed rule.
     IRS set procedures for bad debt reserve recapture
after commercial banks were compelled to recapture their reserves in
accordance with the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The new procedures permitted
banks to pay the tax over the life of the loan portfolio to which the
reserve applied.
     For thrifts, however, the agency is proposing, in
effect, a more rapid bad debt reserve repayment schedule if they
change charters or fail the IRS version of the thrift lender test.
     During a hearing before IRS this week, Abraham Ossip,
an SCBA representative, warned that the proposal would generate a
severe problem for institutions with large reserves built up between
1950 and 1980, when Congress gave thrifts an incentive for a
commitment to home mortgage lending by authorizing large additions to
the bad debt reserve.
     Ossip, corporate tax director for the Dime Savings
Bank in New York, maintained that existing IRS regulations strongly
indicate that savings institutions should be allowed to switch
commercial bank charters without tax penalty as long as they remain
committed to residential lending.
     In a lengthy supporting document filed with IRS, SCBA
analysts point out that a distinguishing difference between the
reserves of banks and thrifts is that thrifts historically were
permitted much larger reserve additions with respect to their
qualifying loansprincipally residential mortgage loans.
     The reserve additions to the qualifying reserve bore
no relationship to any anticipation of actual loan losses when
computed as a percentage of taxable income, the trade group
emphasizes. This percentage, which could have been as high as 100% of
taxable income at the inception of thrift taxability, was gradually
phased down until the 1986 Tax Reform Act set the current percentage
at 8% of taxable income.
     This statutory requirement, designed to safeguard the
capital levels of thrifts, created a standard of qualifying levels
for historically profitable S&ls that was far in excess of that which
would have been established using the bank reserve method, the SCBA
notes.

FASBS NEW UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES PROJECT DEALS WITH ISSUE OF
JOINT VENTURE FINANCING

The Financial Accounting Standards Board is studying
whether to require companies that enter into a joint venture to book
debt used to finance part of the venture.
     The FASB proposal would change current practice,
which requires that such debt be treated as an off-balance-sheet
financing.
     The proposed change would be in line with the views
of regulators, who think this item should appear on companies books.
Failure to disclose the liability could mislead users regarding the
true financial condition of the company, banking regulators argue.
     The project is part of a broader attempt by FASB to
develop accounting and reporting standards for affiliated entities,
an area that is being watched closely by bank regulators.
     The Board will discuss the diverse accounting methods
used by various industries,including international accounting
standards, for joint ventures on June 16, according to FASB Project
Manager Ron Lott. In addition, FASB staff will present case studies
that show current inconsistencies and the problems they spawn, he
says.
     Banks and thrifts that establish joint ventures with
other entitiesa real estate developer, for examplewould be included
in the scope of the project. Some banks have joint ventures in data
processing.
     But initially, the Board will avoid using the term
joint venture because it means different things to different people,
says Lott. The Board will try first to develop a uniform standard
without making distinctions between types of joint ventures. If that
doesnt work, then the Board may be forced to come up with a formal
definition of joint venture.
     Commonly, people think of joint venture as being an
investment by two people, each owning an equal amount and exercising
joint control over the investment, Lott says. This is typical in a
situation involving real estate.
     According to Lott, the absence of any clear standard
for reporting joint ventures has led industries to use varying
methods. For instance, one company used three methodsequity method,
proportionate consolidation and costin accounting for various joint
ventures.
     And those are just three methods I could name off the
top of my head. There may be other methods without names, Lott says.
     Current rules for consolidation require a 50%
ownership of a subsidiarys common stock. The equity method is used by
an investor who owns between 20% and 50% of the companys common
stock, although there are situations when an investor may use this
method even though more than 50% is owned. The cost method is used if
ownership is 20% or lessa stock investment that is required to be
marked to lower of cost or market.
     According to Lott, entities that fall between the 20%
to 50% range will fall within the scope of the joint venture project.
It affects anything not covered by either the consolidation standard
or the stock investment standard, says Lott.
     Other projects focusing on other aspects of the
consolidation issue also are under way. Two discussion memoranda are
out for comment: New Basis Accounting and Consolidation Policy and
Procedures. The Board decided to consider the need for and timing of
public hearings on both documents after comments, due by July 15,
1992, are received.
     The Board also has commissioned a research study on
disaggregated disclosures, which is expected to be completed later
this year.

INCIDENTS OF FRAUD BY INDUSTRY ACCOUNTANTS SHOW DISTURBING UPWARD
TREND, FBI SAYS

George Brooks
Fraud is on the rise at financial institutions
nationwide and the perpetrators are no longer from within the teller-
to-middle-management range, according to an FBI expert on fraud.
     Accounting staff committed 13% of about 150
embezzlements over $250,000 in institutions across California, for
example, Special Agent Robert DeMaria told accountants attending a
recent meeting of the Financial Managers Society in San Francisco. At
least 13% of the total dollar losses in the 350 cases of fraud
reported last year in the state wound up in accountants pockets.
     The FBIs profile of an embezzler is a person 33 years
of age who has been with a company at least five and a half years,
and with an average time on the job of more than three years. The
embezzlers work performance rating usually ranges from good to
excellent or outstanding.
     The potential embezzler is a highly desirable
employee, reliable, bright, motivated, and trustworthy, says DeMaria.
He or she is an achiever with high self-esteem, an independent worker
who is self-sufficient and has good self-control.
     The embezzler is married with children, optimistic,
empathetic, well-educated and has never been arrested. His or her
greatest fear is being found out by family and friends, DeMaria
concludes.
     Leading DeMarias list is collusion between insiders
and outsiders (39% of incidents, resulting in 32% of total losses),
followed by electronic data processing and support staff (19% of
incidents, resulting in 22% of total losses). Warehouse personnel
equalled accountants notoriety by committing 13% of reported fraud
but ended with less cash in their pockets7% of total losses.
Dishonest treasurers admitted to 7% of the incidents but walked away
with only 6% of the fraud-related losses in their pockets.
     Although the percentage of fraud being committed at
the executive level may appear small (9% of some 350 cases handled by
the FBI last year), the culprits accounted for 20% of the total
losses.
     Half of the fraud reported in California was
discovered by accidentthrough called-in tips, for exampleaccording to
DeMaria. Only 19% was uncovered by internal auditors, while
management controls snared only 10% of the perpetrators.
     DeMaria cites three reasons people commit fraud:
situational pressure, opportunities that create an environment for
fraud and personal characteristics that may drive a person to commit
fraud.
     Situational pressure could push somebody to embezzle
against or in behalf of a company, for example, falsely boosting a
companys revenues to impress stockholders and artificially inflate
stock prices, he says. We have several pending investigations in that
area.
     Other reasons include high personal debt, financial
loss, inadequate income, extravagant lifestyle, excessive gambling,
job frustration or inequity whether imagined or real and undue family
or community expectations.
     However, weak or dishonest management, or simply one
corporate manager calling the shots, also ranks as one of the major
causes of institutional fraud, DeMaria notes.
     In one case, DeMaria and his team arrested a 54-year-
old accountant for embezzling some $3.2 million from the bank where
she worked. During that time, the bank was under investigation by the
FBI for certain questionable deals that put it on the brink of
failure. Despite the presence of the agents, the accountant continued
to carry out her scam under their noses for nine months until her
arrest.
     Asked why she did it, she replied, For years, I have
watched (the owner) and his cronies go into his little office to
figure out how to plunder this institution. Very simply, I decided to
get my share before this thing collapsed.
     Like any good accountant, she kept records of every
illegal transaction management ever made. Her books led to the arrest
and conviction of 18 top management officials. For cooperating with
authorities, her jail time was reduced to 67 days.
     Some embezzlers do it for bizarre reasons, too. One
accountant was arrested by the FBI for embezzling $4,312.16. Puzzled
by the exactness of the amount, DeMaria asked the felon why he took
that specific amount.
     Attending conferences and speaking to colleagues who
were employed in companies similar to mine, I found out I was being
underpaid, he said. So I netted it all out and figured how much the
company owed me. Thats how much I took.
     Insiders who commit fraud are mostly first-time
offenders, 90% of whom are motivated by greed, says DeMaria.

OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION

Core Capital to Total Adjusted Assets Ratio (or leverage ratio).  The
proposal raises the core capital level for all but the strongest
thrifts from 3% to 4% and sometimes 5%. The agency is moving toward
required consistency with national bank requirements.
Undercapitalized S&Ls would be required to submit capital plans
within 60 days of finalization of the rule.
Federal Register, Friday, April 26, 1991.

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. The agency has passed a regulation
giving most savings and loan associations a two-year extension of
their existing QTL status. Meanwhile, Congress is considering
legislation that would liberalize the test.
Capital Plan and Compliance. OTS is considering allowing thrifts
operating under approved capital plans to be deemed in compliance
with capital standards.

Recourse. Proposal defines recourse, the acceptance of the risk of
any loss associated with owning an asset, the same way FFIEC does.
OTS would not use that definition to determine capital adequacy.
Comment ended May 16.

Allowable Dividend. The agency is considering a proposal to reduce
the amount a healthy thrift can pay in dividends to 75% of its net
income (based on the most recent four-quarter period).
Comment ended May 16.

Interest Rate Risk-Related Capital Requirements. The controversial
proposal has been temporarily tabled for further review. It requires
thrifts to assess the value of their portfolios subject to swings in
the interest rate of 200 basis points up or down. The rule would
require a thrift to calculate 50% of the greater loss in value, and
hold capital reserves against it.  No cap has been set on the amount
that could be required to be held in reserve. OTS has said it
probably will be 2% for most thrifts. The 2% cap could either be
added to the 8% reserve requirement held against credit risk, or it
could be part of the 8% reserve requirement with the credit risk
reserve requirement reduced to 6%.

Risk-based Capital. Weights assets based on risk and treats loans
sold with recourse as if not sold. The current focus is on a lower-
of-cost-or- market-value approach for purchased servicing. OTS issued
capital rule with tough treatment for REO and delinquent loans.

Interest rate risk component could be added to or incorporated into
the 8% rule. Early intervention and marginal capital options
proposals still to come. Compliance is required by Dec. 31, 1992.

Leverage Ratio. The core to total adjusted assets ratio  for state-
chartered nonmember banks that have been rated CAMEL 2 by examiners.
The capital to assets ratio (leverage) must now be 4% for banks that
fall into that classification. According to the FDIC some 7,500 state
nonmember banks and 500 savings banks will be affected by the rule
change.

SAIF to BIF Conversion Fees. The entrance fee paid when an insured
thrifts deposits are transferred to a bank or bank holding company
has been lowered by the board. The board voted to decrease the fee
from 54 cents per $100 of transferred deposits to 18 cents. The move
will primarily affect banks or holding companies purchasing thrifts
that have failed from government receiverships.

Use of Purchased Mortgage Servicing Rights in Capital. The FDIC has
set the limit on the amount of purchased mortgage servicing rights
that may be counted toward core capital at 50%. As much as 100% of
tangible capital may be composed of PMSR. The FDIC also removed a
six-year phase-in provision, replacing it with a grandfather clause.
All PMSR on the books as of Feb. 9, 1990, will be grandfathered and
gradually phased out.

FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL

Loan Splitting.  The FFIEC  proposed guidelines for accounting when
Returning a Loan with a Partial Charge-off to Accrual Status appeared
to be going nowhere. They would have allowed thrifts and banks to
charge off nonaccruing portions of loans and return the performing
portion to accrual status. Letters received during the comment
period, however, were almost universally negative. Banks and thrifts
felt the types of loans that would qualify (in-substance foreclosed
loans were not to be eligible for splitting) would have been few and
the benefit of the proposal to institutions would have been minimal
at best. Both the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the AICPA
have expressed opinions that the proposal did not conform with
generally accepted accounting principles. Sources in the federal
regulatory agencies think the proposal will simply die.

Applications, Reports and Notices Submitted  by Thrift Holding
Companies (91-3051). OTS is proposing to streamline and simplify the
reporting requirements of S&L holding companies.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

Sale of Mortgage Servicing Rights. The SEC has asked the FASB to
clarify criteria for determining whether mortgage servicing sales
should be treated as sales or financing.

Financial Instruments: Debt Securities Held as Assets. The board is
discussing what instruments should be included in the scope of a
possible project addressing the use of market-value accounting for
investments in marketable debt securities and maybe other
instruments.

Offsetting Amounts Related to Certain Contracts. This proposed
interpretation of existing guidance  will clarify the circumstances
under which amounts recognized for forward contracts, interest rate
and currency swaps and similar contracts may be offset in the
statement of financial position and presented as a net amount. The
board has tentatively decided to let the proposal affect financial
statements issued for periods ending after Dec. 15, 1992.

Accounting for Inome Taxes. Tentatively, the board wants to end dual
criteria for recognition of deferred tax assets. Only a more likely
than not criterion would be required. It wants to put procedures in
place to measure a deferred tax asset or liability using a rate
convention and to determine whether a valuation allowance is
necessary. It wants to apply the classification convention used in

APB Opinion #11 and FAS #37 to the classification of deferred assets
or liabilities in a classified balance sheet. It wants to prohibit
methods of intercorporate tax allocation that are inconsistent with
the overall method of accounting for taxes. It wants deferred tax
liabilities and assets for a particular jurisdiction to be offset and
presented as one net current amount and one net noncurrent amount.
Also, it wants the amount of valuation allowances to be disclosed.

Accounting for Investments with Prepayment Options.  Board asked for
an exposure draft to be prepared by the staff on its tentative
conclusions. They are: in the case of such securities as ARMs,
changes caused by anticipated prepayments should be accounted for
with revised calculations of the periodic amortization and recognized
through a cumulative adjustment in the current period. The
prospective recognition of those effects (as allowed in Statement 91)
would be precluded; deferred servicing fees and purchased mortgage
servicing rights are not included in the project; no additional
disclosures are required for entities complying with guidance, but
they would be required to disclose circumstances in which prepayments
are being anticipated; transactions after Dec. 15, 1992,  would be
affected; retroactive application is urged.

Impairment of Assets and Present-value Based Measurement of
Accounting. Public hearings on the discussion memoranda, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Identifiable Intangibles
and Present-Value-Based Measurements in Accounting,were held Aug. 21-
23.

Interest Methods Project. Public hearings were held Aug. 21-23, 1991,
in New York.

PROPOSED IRS LOAN LOSS RECAPTURE RULE FOR S&LS HEAVILY CRITICIZED
BY TAX LAWYER

The following is excerpted from comments by Donald B.
Susswein, a tax partner at Thacher, Profitt & Wood in New York, at
the Internal Revenue Services June 5 public hearing on regulations
that would impose restrictive guidelines on loan loss reserve
recapture for savings and loans that convert to banks. First of two
excerpts.
     The IRS has taken the position in the proposed
regulations that the large bank reserve recapture timing rules of the
1986 Tax Reform Act apply to some large banks, but not to all large
banks. Large banks that were formerly thrifts are not eligible, in
the IRS view.
     As many others commentators have noted, this position
directly contradicts the position previously taken by the Treasury
Department in public testimony to the Congress on Oct. 26, 1989, and
also directly contradicts the interpretation given in the Joint
Committees General Explanation of the 1986 act.
     There is nothing wrong, of course, in a government
agency changing its position when it discovers that it has made a
mistake in interpreting the law.
     Where there is such a complete change from a
consistently held position, the IRS would appear to owe the public a
convincing explanation of the statutory basis for its change in
position. These regulations purport to interpret a statute. They are
not legislative regulations.
     The preamble skips over problems of statutory
language and construction, and goes directly to the IRS policy
concerns.
     Policy concerns alone, no matter how valid, are
irrelevant to the issue of statutory interpretation unless the
Service can first articulate a convincing case that the statute
itself is ambiguous. This has not yet been attempted.
     Even if ambiguity were subsequently demonstrated, the
Services stated policy concerns would not support its proposed
statutory interpretation. In addition, the IRS can actually address
its stated policy concerns much more effectively than the way
outlined in the proposed regulations.
     The core policy issue in this area seem to be Section
593(e).
     Under that provision, thrifts are subject to partial
recapture to the extent they distribute untaxed earnings accumulated
in their reserve balances.
     Once a large thrift becomes a large bankand begins
recapturing all of its reserves over a multi-year periodit is
apparently no longer subject to the partial recapture rules of
Section 593(e).
     The IRS does not like this result, and apparently
would have preferred that Congress maintain a continuing role for
Section 593(e).
     This policy argument is historically quite relevant
to the issue of congressional intent, since one of the options before
the Congress in 1985 was an approach to recapture that would have
similarly stressed the policy concerns underlying Section 593(e).
   The Joint Committee staff recommended an option under
which thrifts changing to the specific charge-off method would
automatically recapture only the bank portion of their reserves,
while the remainder would be subject to the continued application of
Section 593(e).
     The IRS apparently would have preferred this
approachsince it would have treated the bank portion the same way
bank reserves are treatedand it would treat the thrift or subsidy
portion in the way thrifts reasonably expected those reserves would
always be treatedi.e., recaptured if, and only if, they liquidated or
attempted to distribute untaxed amounts in their reserves to
shareholders.
     There is much to be said for this approach as a
policy matter. I suspect that many in the thrift industry might agree
that it would have been wiser had the Congress adopted this Joint
Committee approach to the timing of recapture, rather than the
elective cut-off method.
     But the IRS is purporting to make a statutory
construction argument, not a pure policy argument. In that regard,
there is a world of difference between Congress making an unwise
policy decision, and making an unreasonable or insupportable policy
decision.
     It is not enough for the IRS to say, or even prove,
that choosing the cut-off method, over the Joint Committee option,
would have been unwise.
     To make its statutory argument, the IRS must argue,
and must demonstrate, that it would have been so insupportable or
unreasonable that no one can rationally conclude that Congress could
have made that choice.

STATE BANK INVESTMENT LIMITS CALLED INCONSISTENT WITH LAW

The FDIC is proposing to impose more stringent restrictions on the
exercise of equity investment powers by insured state savings banks
than Congress intended, the thrift industry asserts.
     Paul Schosberg, president of the Savings & Community
Bankers of America, contends that the FDIC proposal takes a much
narrower view of those powers than Congress intended when it enacted
them in  the 1991 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act.
     The FDIC interpretation, which the FDIC says would
put state banks insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund on
a par with those insured by the Bank Insurance Fund, unjustly
restricts the amount a savings bank can invest in equities and mutual
funds, Schosberg maintains. He is urging the FDIC to reconsider.
     In an amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Act, the FDICIA generally limits the activities and
equity investments of a all state-chartered banks insured by the SAIF
and the BIF to those permissible for national banks.
     The dispute between the FDIC and the industry centers
around the agencys interpretation of a grandfather clause in the
provision, which became effective last Dec. 19.
     Specifically, the provision creates a limited
grandfather for investments in common or preferred stock or shares of
investment companies.
     This grandfather exception pertains to savings banks
located in states that, as of Sept. 30, 1991, permitted them to
invest in such stock listed on a national securities exchange or in
shares of an investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. These banks must have made or maintained
investments in listed stock and registered shares during the period
from Sept. 30, 1990, to Nov. 26, 1991 (the window period).
     Under the FDICIA amendment, those institutions could
acquire or retain, with FDIC approval, listed stock or registered
shares to the same extent that they did during the above period, up
to 100% of their capital.
     But Schosberg claims the FDIC is ignoring the spirit
and letter of the provision in its proposed rule. He argues that the
proposal defines equity security authority using restrictions that go
far beyond the discussions that led up to the FDICIA and far beyond
its language.
     The proposal divides equity powers into two groups:
mutual fund holdings and holdings of common and preferred stock.
     Under the proposed rule, an institution that had
mutual fund and equity holdings during the window period could
continue to invest in the holdings, but only up to the highest level
invested during that period. The total of all such investments could
not exceed 100% of capital.
     We will suggest that the FDIC return to what we
believe was the intent of Congress, Schosberg says. State banks
holding either mutual funds or stocks during the window period should
be permitted to invest in either type of security in the future, up
to 100% of capital.

ADC LOANS FOR HOUSING ARE NOW REGARDED AS THRIFT INVESTMENTS UNDER
THE QTL TEST

In an effort to help ease the nations credit crunch
and stimulate the housing market, the Office of Thrift Supervision is
now permitting some acquisition, development and construction (ADC)
loans to be treated as qualified investments under the qualified
thrift lender (QTL) test.
     To be eligible, the ADC transactions must involve
residential housing projects and bear little risk, according to new
Thrift Bulletin 20-2, which also offers guidance on QTL test
requirements regarding starter homes and credit-needy areas.
     ADC loans for development of commercial structures
will continue to be ineligible for qualified thrift investment (QTI)
status.
     OTS move is consistent with a Bush administration
directive asking regulators to moderate tough regulatory requirements
that discourage insured lenders from making real estate-related
loans, as long as the action does not pose a threat to the safety and
soundness of the institutions involved.
     ADC transactions received a bad reputation during the
1980s when government studies implicated them in the savings and loan
industry debacle. As a result, Congress and federal regulators
imposed restrictions on such transactions, most of which were
considered high-risk.
     For an ADC transaction to qualify as an investment
under the QTL test, it must meet the following criteria:
      Both stages of an acquisition and development loan
must be funded in a single combination. The financing must be a loan,
not an investment.
      The S&L involved must demonstrate that the property
is reasonably certain to be developed as domestic residential
housing;
      The property must be zoned exclusively for
residential use;
      The property must be zoned to permit residential
use, and the deed must have legally enforceable covenants that
restrict its use to sites for structures designed primarily for
homes; or
      The property must be zoned to allow residential use,
and the borrower must certify that he or she intends to construct
dwelling structures immediately on almost all of the property.
     S&Ls must have at least 65% of their assets in
housing and housing-related assets in order to pass the QTL test. If
they fail it, they could be compelled to convert to commercial bank
charters.
     QTL test provisions allow thrifts to include in their
qualified thrift investments 200% of the dollar amount of loans and
investments used to buy, build or develop starter homes or starter
home developments.
     To be classified as a starter home loan for QTL test
purposes, TB 20-2 says, a loan must be:
      Secured by a one-to-four family home, condominium or
cooperative, or by a development where 75% or more of the
developments value consists of such homes;
      Located in the associations Community Reinvestment
Act community; and
      Valued when the loan is made at an appraised value
of 60% or less than the median value of newly constructed one-to-four
family homes in the thrifts CRA community.
     If no median value figures are available for the
associations CRA community, OTS explains, the institution may
estimate the value by relying on data provided by the Federal Housing
Finance Board, the National Association of Home Builders or private
firms.
     Federal laws and rules also let thrifts include in
their qualified thrift investments 200% of the dollar amount of loans
made to small businesses or for construction, development or
improvement of residential housing or community service facilities
within credit-needy areas.
     The term credit-needy area includes areas within the
thrifts delineated CRA community that meet one or more of these
criteria:
      Census tracts, counties or areas in a Metropolitan
Statistical Area with median household income that is 80% or less of
the MSA median.
      Census tracts where loans by all institutions, as
reported by the most recent available Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
data, total 50% or less of the average loan volume for all census
tracts in the MSA, and the median household income is 120% of the MSA
median.
      Areas that have been designated as credit-needy by
federal, state or local government and that receive some form of
credit-related targeted assistance from such governments.
     If none of the above data are available for the
associations community, credit-needy areas may be identified after
consultation with local government and community representatives, TB
20-2 says.
      In addition, it says, if the loan is for a small
business or a community service facility,  it may be classified as
being for a credit-needy area for QTL purposes if it is made to a
small firm owned by a person whose home address is within the credit-
needy area, or if it is made to a community service facility that
primarily serves people whose homes are in the credit-needy area.

OTS, CBO DISAGREE STRONGLY ON THE INDUSTRYS CONDITION
700 More S&Ls At Risk?

Bob Duke
Are the shadows of misfortune that have stalked the
savings and loan industry for more than a decade fading or growing
larger and darker?
     Like beauty, the answer lies in the eyes of the
beholder. This was evident last week when a favorable report on the
industrys condition issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision was
shot down by Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional
Budget Office.
     Although the industrys net income for the first
quarter of this year totaled $1.6 billion, a figure nearly equal to
that for all of 1991, Reischauer contended that the industrys future
remains bleak.
     He told the Senate Banking Committee that an
additional 500 to 700 savings institutions might fail during the next
three years, substantially boosting the cost of the taxpayer-financed
industry cleanup.
     Reischauer said the only reason that the industrys
condition seems  good now is that so many insolvent and troubled
institutions have been removed from the scenario.
     The cost of this effort has been high, and the
cleanup of the thrift crisis is not over, he stated.
     Reischauers comments chilled the festive atmosphere
that had prevailed earlier when OTS Director Timothy Ryan announced
at a briefing that the industrys strong first quarter earnings this
year, coupled with its solid performance last year, strongly
indicated that the industry was becoming capable of sustained
profitability and stability.
     Ryan emphasized, too, that the industrys capital
position had improved greatly over the past two years.
     Furthermore, he pointed out that the 1992 first-quarter profit
marked the fifth consecutive quarter that the industry
had been profitable. In addition, he said, this was the first time
since 1986 that quarterly net income had exceeded $1.5 billion.
     Later, in testimony before the Senate Banking
Committee, Ryan declared that the end of the industry cleanup was in
sight.
     We have closed over 700 failed thrifts with nearly
$360 billion in assets since the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 became law, Ryan said. All
critically undercapitalized institutions that we have identified as
being nonviable should be resolved, or have active resolution
strategies in place, this year, if the Resolution Trust Corporation
is granted funding and the current real estate markets do not worsen.
     Ryan said only 37 nonviable institutions remain
unresolved.
     Reischauer sees the situation differently, arguing
that when the cleanup is finally over, it will have cost the public
$215 billion (in 1990 dollars), and fewer than 1,400 thrifts will
remain on the financial services industry landscape. At present,
there are 2,064 S&Ls in the private sector, compared with 2,096 at
the end of last year and 4,000 in 1980.
     If 500 to 700 more savings institutions go under, as
Reischauer believes, then there will almost certainly be a merger of
OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Ryan
advocates such a consolidation,  and there is considerable
congressional sentiment favoring it. Proponents argue that there is
no logical reason for the perpetuation of a costly federal agency to
regulate a shrinking industry.
     Whatever the case, OTS-OCC merger legislation is sure
to be introduced  in Congress next year by House Banking Committee
Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, or some other member of his
panel.
     Meanwhile, in his congressional testimony, Reischauer
warned that if the Resolution Trust Corporation stops accepting
institutions for resolution by October 1993, as scheduled, and
transfers the remaining case load to the FDIC-administered Savings
Association Insurance Fund, the fund will be unable to handle the
task without additional federal resources.
     This situation has been worsened by the failure of
the administration and the Congress to agree on continued funding for
the RTC, and the premature setback of RTC resolution operations
before completing its task, he said.
     While Reischauer concedes that industry profits have
improved, he thinks the situation could change quickly if the present
favorable interest-rate environment took a negative turn.
     But Ryan maintained that capital was the best measure
of the thrift industrys safety, since it provides a buffer between
the institution and the SAIF, and between it and American taxpayers.
     Today, the industrys tangible capital is over 5% of
total assets, Ryan told the Senate Banking Committee. In the second
quarter of 1989, the industry reported tangible capital of only 3%.

OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION

Here are the most significant rules, proposed regulations
and policy statements affecting savings and loan associations issued
by the Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Housing Finance Board,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FASB, Treasury, FFIEC and the
Federal Reserve. New or updated entries are marked with a star.*

*Thrift Bulletin 20-2. This bulletin says acquisition,
development and construction  (ADC) loan transactions involving
domestic residential housing now are considered qualified thrift
investments under the qualified thrift lender test.

Operating Subsidiaries of Federal Savings and Loan
Associations (92-8). This proposal would allow federal S&Ls to
establish and acquire operating subsidiaries just as national banks
are authorized to do. These subsidiaries would be distinguishable
from service corporation subsidiaries and would be empowered to
engage exclusively in activities permitted for all federal
associations. Comment period expired May 15.

Regulatory Capital: Intangible Assets (92-142). This
proposal would allow purchased mortgage servicing rights (PMSRs) and
purchased credit card relationships (PCCRs) to be defined as
qualifying intangible assets, and therefore includable in core
capital (the leverage ratio). Singly, PMSRs could count up to 50% of
core capital, while PCCRs could be includable as only up to 25% of
the leverage ratio. If aggregated, the core capital inclusion
limitation for these two intangibles is 50%. Comment period expired
May 15.

Bonds for Thrift D&Os, Employees, and Agents (91-733).
This final regulation requires S&Ls to secure fidelity bond insurance
coverage consistent with safety and soundness standards.Unlike OTS
previous standards, the rule does not require coverage under a
specific standardized form and does not specify minimum amounts of
coverage. The regulation brings thrift fidelity bond requirements in
line with those for commercial banks.

Branch Offices, Exclusive Leases, and Similar Agreements
(92-136). This proposed rule would eliminate regulations (considered
obsolete by OTS) that prohibit thrifts from entering into leases and
other arrangements that give associations the exclusive right to
occupy the premises of a chain store or regional shopping center. OTS
believes existing federal and state laws addressing anticompetitive
behavior are sufficient to address potential abuses that might arise
in this area. Comment period expired May 15.

Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System (91-500).
This proposed rule requires all thrifts to maintain their membership
in the system. Comment period expired May 15.

Applications Restructuring (92-134). This final rule
expedites the processing of applications submitted to OTS by savings
institutions with MACRO (examination) ratings of one and two and
which have satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act and other
regulatory compliance ratings.

Interstate Branching Rule (91-133). This final rule
permits healthy federal savings and loan associations to branch
nationwide.

Residential Bridge Loans (91-721). This final regulation
reduces to 50% from 100% the risk-weighted capital required for loans
made to builders to construct presold homes.

Regulatory Bulletin 27. The bulletin provides guidance to
regulatory personnel for the review of employment contracts and
clarifies OTS policy regarding unsafe and unsound practices relating
to executive compensation and employment contracts.

Thrift Bulletin 50. This guidance bars S&Ls with MACRO
ratings of four or five from entering into third-party contracts
outside the normal course of business unless the contract is approved
by the regional OTS director.

Thrift Bulletin 38-3a. This bulletin requires an acquired
or resulting association in a voluntary unassisted transaction tot
meet the fully phased-in capital requirements applicable at the time.

Reports, Applications, Notices Submitted by S&L Holding
Companies. This proposed rule would streamline the documents process
for holding companies.

Leverage Ratio (Core Capital) Rule (90-3039). This
proposal would impose a core capital requirement of between 4% and 5%
on institutions with MACRO ratings below MACRO 1. MACRO 1 thrifts
would continue to have a 3% requirement.

Miscellaneous Capital and Capital-Related Amendments (90-
4015). This final rule clarifies certain provisions in OTS minimum
capital standards rule, including the provision on recourse
arrangements.

Mutual Holding Companies (90-4017). This proposal would
let mutual savings institutions establish mutual holding companies in
order for them to generate additional capital.

Transactions with Affiliates and Subsidiaries. (90-543).
This rule implements restrictions imposed on affiliate transactions
by FIRREA.

Thrift Bulletin 45. This bulletin prescribes the
notification procedures that must be followed by troubled thrifts and
thrift holding companies when they hire senior executive officers and
appoint board members.

Thrift Bulletin 38-3. These guidelines set forth OTS
policies that will be applied to significant voluntary unassisted
transactions.

Thrift Bulletin 5a. This bulletin outlines the limited
capital maintenance obligations that will be imposed on acquirers and
owners of savings associations.

OTS Interim Final Rule on Loans-to-One-Borrower
restrictions.The rule generally bars thrifts from lending more than
15% of their unimpaired capital and surplus to one borrower. However,
they may lend an additional 10% of their capital and surplus to one
person if the loans are secured with readily marketable collateral.

Risk-based Capital Rule. The regulation requires thrifts
to meet an 8% minimum capital requirement, including 3% core capital
and tangible capital of at least 1.5%. Full compliance with the
standard is required by Dec. 31.

Thrift Bulletin 13-2. This bulletin urges thrifts with
more than $500 million in assets or with investments in high-risk
mortgage strips to implement interest-rate risk policies adopted by
their boards.

Regulatory Enforcement Bulletins 90-331, 90-332, and 90-
333. These policies generally are designed to create an enforcement
climate in which deficiencies at S&Ls are corrected before they can
pose a significant risk to the Savings Association Insurance Fund.
The guidelines provide that a violation or unsafe or unsound practice
by a thrift with a MACRO rating of 3, 4 or 5 warrants an enforcement
action unless the OTS is satisfied that the problems are being
corrected.

Final Rule on Divestiture of Certain S&Ls. The rule
requires owners of thrifts operating under capital maintenance
agreements to comply with the agreements before trying to sell the
institutions.

Regulatory Bulletin 24. The bulletin permits higher limits
for loans to one borrowerup to 30% of unimpaired assets and capital
surplus, or double the general 15% restriction proposed by the OCCin
cases where a qualified thrift invests in the development of domestic
residential housing.

Thrift Bulletin 38-2. These guidelines advise S&Ls that
have been operating under capital or accounting forbearances that the
forbearances must be eliminated in determining compliance with
capital standards.

Trading versus Investment. Although the OTS has completed
its policy statement on accounting for securities held for trading,
investment and sale, it has been delaying implementation to give the
accounting community time to develop its policy.

Thrift Bulletin 12. This bulletin establishes guidelines
for the use of high-risk mortgage derivative products and mortgage
swaps, and limits the use of such products by weakly capitalized and
otherwise troubled thrifts.

Excess Servicing Bulletin. The bulletin instructs thrifts
to stop overstating the value of excess servicing by refraining from
booking the asset at above-market value.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

Here are the most significant rules, proposed regulations
and policy statements affecting savings and loan associations issued
by the Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Housing Finance Board,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FASB, Treasury, FFIEC and the
Federal Reserve. New or updated entries are marked with a star.*

Sale of Mortgage Servicing Rights. The SEC has asked FASB
to clarify criteria for determining if mortgage servicing sales
should be treated as sales or financing.

Offsetting Amounts Related to Certain Contracts. This
proposed interpretation of existing guidance will clarify the
circumstances under which amounts recognized for forward contracts,
interest rate and currency swaps and similar contracts may be offset
in the statement of financial position and presented as a net amount.
The board has tentatively decided to let the proposal affect
financial statements for periods ending after Dec. 15.

Accounting for Investments with Prepayment Options. FASB
reached the following tentative conclusions: In the case of such
instruments as ARMs, changes caused by anticipated prepayments should
be accounted for with revised calculations of the periodic
amortization and recognized through a cumulative adjustment in the
current period. The prospective recognition of those effects (as
allowed in Statement 91) would be precluded. Deferred servicing fees
and purchased mortgage servicing rights are not included in the
project. No additional disclosures are required for entities
complying with guidance but they would be required to disclose
circumstances in which prepayments are being anticipated.
Transactions after Dec. 15, 1992, would be affected. Retroactive
application is urged.

S&L Audit Guide. The guide, drafted by the S&L Committee is
effectively complete. While little in the way of new accounting is
outlined, the focus of the guide is risk.

The Treadway Steering Committee, composed of five accounting groups,
has issued policy guidelines to combat fraud and misreporting by
accountants. The guidelines identify nine inter-related components that
interlock to form an effective internal control system.

OCC GIVES NATIONAL BANKS THE GREEN LIGHT TO BECOME FEDERAL HOME LOAN
BANK MEMBERS

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has
given the green light for national banks to become share-holding
members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to buy preferred
stock in the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
     This authority is outlined in two interpretive letters issued by
the OCC Office of Chief Counsel.
     Robert B. Serino, OCC deputy chief counsel, says Section 704 of
the 1989 Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act
clearly authorizes national banks to join the FHLBank System and to own
stock in it if they meet the stipulated housing and safety and soundness
requirements.
     The section repealed a provision in the Federal Home
Loan Bank Act that expressly barred national banks from becoming
members and stockholders in an FHLBank, he says.
     Serino cautions that if a national bank decides to
apply for FHLBank System membership, it should make sure it complies
with the OCCs general rules relating to prudence and appropriate
banking practices.
     For example, he says, if a national bank owned
FHLBank stock exceeding the amount required by federal law for system
members, it could create concern at the OCC.
     Serinos interpretive letter is expected to eliminate
any lingering doubts by national banks as to their authority to join
the FHLBank System as members and shareholders. Some national banks
have been reluctant to seek system membership because of those
doubts, the OCC says.
     Serino notes that the FIRREA conference report
emphasizes that Section 704s purpose is to expand system membership
to include commercial banks and credit unions that engage in mortgage
lending.
     The report says a bank or credit union would qualify
for system membership if its financial condition were sound and its
management and home-financing policy consistent with sound economic
financing.
     This expansion of Federal Home Loan Bank membership is intended
to promote and sustain housing finance and the Banks, the report
continues. The [Joint Conference] Committee believes that the
extension of membership to insured commercial banks and credit unions
that engage in mortgage lending will strengthen the Banks and their
ability to support the mortgage market.
     Serino stresses that the OCC neither encourages nor
discourages national bank membership and investment in the FHLBanks.
Such decisions, he points out, are the responsibility of the national
banks management and boards of directors.
     Meanwhile, in regard to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(Freddie Mac) preferred stock, OCC Chief Counsel William
P. Bowden Jr. says in an interpretive letter that it is permissible
for national banks to purchase the stock as long as they observe safe
and sound banking practices and proper accounting in undertaking the
transactions.
     While the statutes permit unlimited investment, as with any equity
issue, there are market risks, and share prices may decline due to
changes in market interest rates, the issuers financial standing or
government tax policies, Bowden warns. Therefore, the OCC believes that
prudential limits of this sort typically are an element of safe and sound
banking practice.
     The chief counsel says Freddie Mac plans to issue its
preferred stock under Section 306(f) of the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation Act, with the stock carrying an investment grade
rating from a national rating agency.
     Congress, Bowden explains, has exempted Freddie Mac
instruments of that type from the statutory underwriting and stock
investment restrictions normally imposed on national banks.

APPLICATION FEES ASSESSED HEALTHY INSTITUTIONS WILL DECREASE UNDER
OTS MODIFIED SCHEDULE

Beginning June 30, processing fees assessed healthy savings and loan
associations in connection with certain significant applications will
be considerably lower.
     For other thrifts, the Office of Thrift Supervision
fees essentially will remain as they are under the present schedule
applicable to all institutions.
     Healthy institutions are eligible for lower application fees under
an expedited processing program authorized by the OTS new applications
regulation.
     To qualify for the expedited program, a thrift must
meet or exceed its minimum regulatory capital standards and have
composite MACRO examination ratings of one or two, as well as have
satisfactory regulatory compliance ratings.
     The revised fee structure for applications is
outlined in new Thrift Bulletin 48-8.
     Although healthy institution managers are delighted
with the modified fee formula, managers for undercapitalized ones
naturally are upset at the change.
     Harold L. Levi, a former Federal Home Loan Bank Board
attorney who represents several undercapitalized institutions,
contends that the new formula is unfair and that lower fees for
certain applications should be  determined on a case-by-case basis.
     Levi, managing partner in Harold L. Levi Associates
in Washington, says the formula is inconsistent with OTS general
policy of adopting rules applying to the industry as a whole.
     In any event, classification as being healthy will
mean much lower applications processing fees in some instances.
     For example, expedited interstate and intrastate
branch applications will cost $650 for healthy institutions, compared
with $1,900 for standard or unexpedited applications. For an
expedited change-of-location application, the fee will be $250,
compared with $900 for a standard application.
     While undercapitalized institutions will have to pay
$1,400 for bylaw amendment applications, healthy institutions wont
have to pay anything, since their submissions will be regarded by
authorities as preapproved.
     Well-capitalized thrifts wont be assessed any processing fee for
charter amendment applications, but undercapitalized ones will have to
pay $1,400.
     Ailing S&Ls will have to pay $5,300 for applications
involving the inclusion of subordinated debt and mandatorily
redeemable preferred stock in capital. In contrast, healthy
institutions will be assessed only $1,700.
     For a finance subsidiary application, the processing
fee will be $6,650 for a standard one and $2,000 for an expedited
filing. An application for an exemption from the loans-to-one-
borrower requirements will cost a healthy S&L $825, compared with
$2,500 for an undercapitalized one.
     For other applications, the present fee schedule generally will
prevail for all savings associations.
     Because the new applications restructuring regulation
will replace certain applications with simple notices, OTS expects
the time and cost associated with processing such transactions to
decrease.
     Accordingly, the fees relating to transactions and
activities that formerly required applications have been reduced, TB
48-8 says. The new fees are based on the existing fees imposed on
applications estimated to have similar processing times.
     The bulletin notes that the assessment schedule no
longer contains fees for applications for agency offices, temporary
changes of location, investments in office buildings, brokered
deposits, liquidity penalty and affiliated transactions.
     In addition, it points out, the schedule combines the
subordinated debt regulation with the mandatorily redeemable
preferred stock rule.
     The application fee schedule reflects that change,
the bulletin says. The fee for the combined application is the same
as the existing subordinated debt fee.
     Change of control applications will continue to cost
all S&Ls $12, 400, plus $23 to cover the FBIO background check.

Long-Term Prime Rate Up


   The long-term prime rate at long-term credit institutions,
including the Industrial Bank of Japan <8302>, is expected to
rise for the first time in four months.  IBJ will review trading
trends on interest-bearing debt and make its decision as early
as next week.  Implementation will follow soon after.  The Long-
Term Credit Bank of Japan <8303> and the Nippon Credit Bank
<8304> will likely follow suit.  The bank-to-bank gap on the
coupon rate for interest on interest-bearing debt will probably
remain.  At December- end, this was 1.7% at IBJ; 1.9% at LTCB;
and 2.05% at NCB.

Dai-Ichi Kangyo in Electronic Settlement


   In a first for Japanese banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank <8311>
plans to establish a special section for fund settlements, in
response to the growing number of companies engaging in cross-
border, electronic data transfer.  As outlined in the bank's new
medium-term business plan, on which the bank will embark in
April this year, Dai-Ichi Kangyo will make electronic settlement
services the new pillar of its international network business.
If trials of electronic settlements on the bank's corporate
network succeed, the resulting service will help Dai-Ichi Kangyo
secure main bank status.  The bank may also team up with foreign
banks and data communication businesses.

Nov. Construction Equipment Shipments Down


   The Japan Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association
announced that November 1995 shipments of construction equipment
fell 9.4% YOY, to a value of 143,116 million yen, dropping for
the third consecutive month.  Of this figure, domestic shipments
decreased 10.0%, to 108,432 million yen, while exports fell
7.4%, to 34,684 million yen, as a result of increased overseas
production.  By product, shipments of hydraulic excavators
dipped 8.2% YOY, to 3,476 units, and shipments of mini-shovels
fell 6.5%, to 4,109 units.  However, demand for wheel loaders,
particularly smaller models, expanded 21.4%, to 1,671 units.

PRU-BACHE DRIVES MORTGAGE ANALYTICS
WITH INTEL'S iPSC/860 SUPERCOMPUTER

Prudential Bache Securities Inc. is retooling its fixed income
analytics desk around Intel Corp.'s newly-announced iPSC/860
supercomputer. The new parallel-processing supercomputer, which
was unveiled at the World Trade Center on Jan. 8, utilizes up to
128 of Intel's high-performance, 64-bit i860 microprocessors and
can deliver up to 7.6 billion floating point operations per
second (GFlops).

  About a dozen of Pru-Bache's 400 traders and salesmen currently
have access to applications running on an iPSC/2, a precursor of
the new iPSC/860. "Over the next six to 12 months, all
parallelizable, cpu-consumptive applications will be
parallelized, and a large number of our traders and salesmen will
be using them," says Vincent Pica, managing director of Pru-
Bache's financial strategies group.

  The IPSC/2, an 80386-based supercomputer, was installed at the
investment firm's New York office in mid-1989. In April, the
IPSC/2 will be upgraded to performance levels of the new
iPSC/860. The upgrade will result in a iPSC/2-860 hybrid, one
that uses eight i860s and 24 386 chips.

  In parallel processing computers, problems are divided into
many parts and executed simultaneously, resulting in execution
times that far surpass serial or batch processing methods.

  Pru-Bache claims it is the first securities firm to use the new
generation of supercomputers from Intel. The new machines are the
first commercial products resulting from the joint Intel-DARPA
(Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) Touchstone project.
Seeking to set new standards for supercomputer performance,
Touchstone hopes to develop a 2000 processor, 150-GFlop machine
by 1992.

  The air-cooled iPSC/860 machine, with anywhere from eight to
128 microprocessors, ranges in price from $265,000 to $3.5
million. Intel claims that the new machine out-price-performs a
comparable Y-MP supercomputer from Cray Research Inc. by a factor
of 10.

  Pru-Bache has been using the iPSC/2 machine as a server on its
ethernet network which also links IBM mainframes, Digital
Equipment Corp. VAX minicomputers and Sun Microsystems Inc.
workstations. The initial applications fitted to the
supercomputer have been geared toward the firm's mortgage-backed
securities trading business, but future developments will address
government and corporate bond analysis needs.

  Current applications running on the iPSC/2 include the creation
of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and predictive
performance analysis. "There is an evolving need on the part of
sophisticated clients to know how these securities will act over
a wider range of interest-rate scenarios, requiring more fire
power," says Pica. Last year Pru-Bache created over $13 billion
worth of "engineered" securities, he says.

  The high-speed capability of the Intel machine has prompted
Pru-Bache to take on more arcane and computationally intensive
functions, such as the tax arbitrage associated with CMO
residuals. "Without the arbitrage values, while [an issue] may
have a high yield before tax, it may have a very low yield after
tax," Pica says.

  After-tax residual calculations that once took 20 minutes to
execute on the firm's DEC VAX now take 90 seconds on the Intel
iPSC/2. And converting the residual program to run in the
supercomputer's parallel processing environment required only 40
lines of code.

  The supercomputer is also being used to speed programs used in
the analysis of adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities. All
the required software conversion -- including the development of
parallel scheduling algorithms that allow multiple users to
interact with the iPSC/2 simultaneously -- has been performed
collectively by Pru-Bache and Intel.

  Along with its low price, Intel hopes to win customers by
covering all the compatibility bases. The iPSC/860 purportedly
can be linked to DEC VAX, IBM and/or UNIX-based environments.
TCP/IP and ethernet standards are also supported. The iPSC/860 is
available with up to 2 gigabytes of RAM. Disk storage in excess
of 100 gigabytes can be linked to the machine.

  "With any parallel computer that's new, regardless of who the
vendor is, you have the potential of being left high and dry with
the technology," says William Anderson, executive vice president
of information systems at Pru-Bache. He adds: "With Intel, at
least from a chip point of view, they control the chip that makes
it all happen. "

  "We were familiar with [Intel's] management through previous
associations," adds Pica. "We were impressed by their involvement
with DARPA...and Intel had a natural advantage being the
manufacturer of the both the 386 and 860 chip."

REUTERS TRADING SYSTEMS EXEC
DEPARTS AFTER TRIARCH FIASCO

  Reuters Holdings PLC and Mario Rosi, its global product group
leader for trading room systems, have gone their separate ways.
The break comes in the wake of the recent collapse of Reuters'
bid to install its TRIARCH 2000 digital data distribution system
at National Westminster Bank (TST, Oct. 9, 1989).

  Rosi's departure was expected for some time -- the final straw
being the Nat West fiasco, sources say. Revenues at Reuters' Rich
subsidiary are said to have gone from about $150 million in 1987
to $50 million in 1989. The 1989 total is said to include
continuing service contract revenues of about $25 million, but
not PRISM revenue because it isn't a U.S.-developed product.

  Rosi was replaced by David Morgan, formerly Reuters'
international marketing manager for trading room systems and
Rosi's subordinate. Morgan could not be reached for comment.

  Morgan's ascendance is said by insiders at Reuters to be a blow
for Rich president Peter Leger. Like Rosi, Morgan will be based
in London and report to David Ure, managing director of Reuters
Europe, Middle East and Africa Ltd. As a product group leader,
Morgan will also report to Andre Villeneuve, who chairs
Reuters'international product planning committee in addition to
his regional management responsibilities.

  Sources say part of the reason Leger was passed over was that
Ure wasn't willing to let North American management gain control
of another product group. John Hull is product group leader for
transactional services, and Buford Smith is product group leader
for real time information.

                       An Amicable Parting

  A spokesman in Reuters' London office stated last week that
Rosi "had resigned, effective immediately, for personal reasons."
Sources at Reuters say the senior executive was offered the
position of director of operations in Italy, an offer he flatly
refused.

  Reached by phone at his London home, Rosi corroborated Reuters'
statement, saying that circumstances surrounding his departure
were "totally" amicable. Asked if the failure of Triarch 2000 in
any way contributed to his motives for leaving, he said "not at
all....I decided the time was right to take on something new,
different and more challenging." Rosi says he is looking into
"several options" for employment in the industry, including
"setting up my own company."

  Though Reuters would not elaborate on the details of Rosi's
departure, his Reuters stock holdings are likely to have been
considerable. Executives were given shares of Reuters stock
before the company went public; stock options have subsequently
been offered over the past few years. Rosi had been with Reuters
for 16 years.

SEC SAYS RMJ'S OPTIONS
SYSTEM IS NO EXCHANGE

  The Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that RMJ's
Over-the-Counter Options Trading System is not an exchange and
that Delta Government Options Corp., the system's clearing
agency, can operate as such.

  Last summer, the commission was ordered to define an exchange
by a Chicago federal appeals court which heard a case the Chicago
futures exchanges brought against the SEC (TST, Sept. 11, 1989).
The court opinion was a key event in the futures exchanges'
sustained legal campaign against the RMJ system, which they
viewed as a competitive market.

  A spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange says the
exchange "will review the SEC rule and consult with the Chicago
Board of Trade on future action we would take, if any." A CBOT
official says the exchange won't decide what to do until the SEC
issues an official order, expected this week.

  The uninterrupted operation of RMJ's system hinged on the
commission's ruling. Had the commission ruled that the system was
an exchange subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
operation of RMJ and Delta might have been temporarily stopped
while appropriate registration was sought.

  The ruling also paves the way for action on the SEC's proposed
rule on proprietary trading systems (TST, Aug. 14, 1989), which
the commission had shelved while pondering the RMJ case. The
decision is likely to help sponsors of proprietary systems
understand what innovations they can and can't make.

  TST learned about key points discussed at the commission
hearing, held on Jan. 5, although SEC officials won't discuss
what was said until the commission issues an official order. The
Chicago court order requires the commission to issue its order by
Jan. 18, SEC officials say.

  The key to the SEC's decision is that RMJ's system functions as
a so-called billboard without intermediary market makers who
continuously make a two-sided market, according to Stephen
Lynner, president of RMJ Options Trading Corp., who attended the
commission hearing. Says Lynner: "In the SEC's mind, what most
clearly delineates an exchange in the rules and procedures
imposed by its sponsors is a requirement that a subgroup of
participants in the system make bids and offers on the securities
in the system on a continuous basis. We don't have anything in
our procedures that requires anybody to do that."

  Instead, RMJ's billboard system "displays indications of
interest of the price at which someone wants to buy or sell, but
there is no requirement that anybody put up an offer." Indeed,
many days have gone by, especially since the Chicago court issued
its order last summer, when no participants have put up bids or
offers, Lynner says.

  The RMJ system advertises indications of interest to buy or
sell, but executions are done by telephone. In the RMJ system, a
potential buyer calls an RMJ broker to enter a bid into the
system, which other system participants will see on dumb
terminals. A potential seller calls the broker to indicate his
interest. By phone, the broker confirms the deal with both
parties and consummates the transaction with a keystroke.

                       What's an Exchange?

  During the commission hearing, which lasted over an hour, staff
in the SEC's division of market regulation presented arguments to
the commissioners about what constitutes an exchange, according
to Lynner. He says that among the features the staff said
distinguish RMJ's system from an exchange are the following: the
absence of a physical trading floor; no concept of members who
buy a seat; and the idea that the system's sponsor selects what
securities will be traded.

  But, says Lynner, the staff indicated that even "the presence
of any of those things with a billboard doesn't turn the system
into an exchange." Rather, he says, the SEC staff suggested that
"the expectation of a two-sided market may draw the system into
more of an exchange than a billboard."

  Last summer's Chicago court order created a "dearth of
interest" from the 23 participants in RMJ's market, Lynner says.
Now that the SEC has ruled in RMJ's favor, Lynner expects
transaction volume to pick up shortly. He says the system's
screens are already "filling up with bids and offers," that
spreads are tighter and that in general "people are spending more
time with the system."

KAPITI AND AREGON JOIN FORCES
IN MOVE SEEN AS CONSOLIDATION

  U.K. financial software firms Aregon International Ltd. and
Kapiti Ltd. have merged in what appears to be a shotgun wedding
arranged by venture capital companies Advent Ltd. and Electra
Investment Trust, which have stakes in both companies.

  The combined company will operate under Kapiti's name. Barry
Roberts, Aregon's managing director, becomes executive chairman
of the combined company. Dick Willott remains as Kapiti's
managing director. Sources say Aregon has been up for sale for
some time.

  Kapiti and Aregon have not crossed paths before at client
installations, despite Kapiti's customer list of 500 institutions
worldwide. Previous cooperative ventures thus didn't play a role
in bringing the two parties together.

  Sources at the newly combined company attribute the move to
product synergies. But sources say it's more likely that
investors Advent and Electra saw the merger as a means of
maintaining product lines while reducing costs.

  The move makes sense for Kapiti, which last year launched a
front-office deal-capture module to its Equation back-office
package. Customers balked at the module's primitive functionality
and high price, sources say. Aregon's FIST, a digital feed
handler and development toolkit, and its new TS-STAR decision
support software could enhance Kapiti's credibility in the front
office.

                     Picture of Aregon Gray

  But for Aregon, the picture is different. Aregon has been going
through a bad patch lately, sources say, although the emergence
of TS-STAR has sparked some market interest. Some of the
company's problems are said to spring from its relationship with
DEC.

  Aregon, which has traditionally based its products on the
VAX/VMS platform, has looked to DEC and in particular the
company's DECtrade initiative as a vehicle to carry it into the
market for large trading-room systems.

  DEC, however, recently acquired the PriceWatch package from
Security Pacific Corp.'s Sequor Group subsidiary. Both FIST and
PriceWatch perform a similar function within DECtrade; they both
manage incoming data feeds and deliver real-time market data to
user positions. DEC's purchase of PriceWatch suggests it will be
favored by DEC over FIST. Observers say Aregon regarded its
involvement in DECtrade as "vital" to the company's future.

  Aregon has attempted to widen its possible market through a
marketing agreement with IBM (TST, Feb. 27, 1989). But that
accord has yet to bear fruit.

  The new Kapiti will post 1989 sales of more than 21 million
pounds sterling and pretax profit of 3.5 million pounds sterling.
The company's products will include Aregon's FIST and TS-STAR
packages and Kapiti's Equation. The complementarity of the
products, according to Jeremy Wood, executive director at Aregon,
is "obvious."

  Aregon says the merger gives it access to an international
sales and marketing infrastructure that will improve distribution
channels for its products. Aregon's two offices, in London and
New York, will be merged with those of Kapiti. Kapiti, a supplier
of back-office processing software primarily to foreign branches
of major banks, will gain access to Aregon's client list of more
than 20 trading institutions.

                     It Couldn't Not Happen

  Aregon's products cater to the front-office trading
environment. FIST is a digital feed handler that features an
applications development toolkit. U.S.-based users of the system
include J.P. Morgan & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Bankers Trust
Co. and Citicorp, Wood says. TS-STAR is a recently launched
analytics package that delivers easy-to-digest graphical
representations of financial data relationships (TST, Nov. 6,
1989).

  Kapiti's Equation is a back-office processing system that
covers all functions of a bank's international department or
foreign branch office, including money markets and capital
markets trade processing. According to Peter Nizich, senior vice
president at Kapiti Inc. in New York, Equation "serves as the
mainframe for the branch office." The package runs on an IBM
AS/400 computer with user access via IBM PCs on a local area
network. Users in the U.S. include First Interstate Bank and
National Australia Bank.

  Both Wood and Nizich agree that the merger is almost certain to
result in the development of a front-to-back-office package. "I
couldn't see how it couldn't," says Wood. Nizich is certain an
interface between FIST and Equation is technologically possible
and will be forthcoming.

TGB SEEKS CAPITAL AFTER
ASSETRONICS DEAL COLLAPSES

  The purported acquisition of interdealer bond broker TGB Corp.
by Assetronics is off, according to Henry Wattson, head of TGB.
The deal was to have given Assetronics a 20% interest in the
brokerage innovator. TGB's regulatory capital has dipped below
requisite levels, resulting in a suspension of trading.

  Reported in the trade press as a fait accompli, the acquisition
failed because Assetronics and its founder Jerry Kaplan reneged
on their buyout intentions, according to Wattson. Commenting on
the reasons behind the aborted acquisition, Wattson says
Assetronics' Kaplan "got cold feet."

  A letter of intent had been signed by Assetronics, according to
a source close to the deal, stating that the companies would
effectively combine their resources. The agreement was terminated
when "contingent conditions in the letter were not met", the
source says.

  Founded in 1988, TGB hoped to gain market share by slashing
commissions and using technology to redefine the broker-trader
relationship (TST, July 5, 1988). TGB brokers enter orders into
an automatic order matching system, rather than executing trades
by voice. TGB was partially capitalized by primary dealers and
planned to generate income by selling transaction information.

  Assetronics has no business or holdings except cash, and is
looking for acquisitions and/or mergers, a source says.

  With Wattson's proven track record in interdealer bond
brokerage, TGB was widely regarded as a company to watch.
Although TGB still is planning for the future, it is now mired in
financial troubles. "As of yesterday we were $40,000 under-
capitalized," Wattson said last week. "We ran out of regulatory
capital."

  "What we're trying to do right now is refinance," Wattson says.
"TGB is close to finalizing a deal with another source of
capital....we've got other irons in the fire." Details were not
available. Until it comes up with the requisite funds, TGB is not
permitted to function as an interdealer broker for any securities
transactions.

CBOE-AMEX STUDY REJECTS
PHLX-PSE-NYSE FINDINGS

  A new study on multiple listing of options strongly opposes the
recommendations of an earlier study sponsored by the Pacific,
Philadelphia and New York stock exchanges' task force. The study,
commissioned by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the
American Stock Exchange, rejects the earlier study's proposed
Options Market Integration System (OMINTS) (TST, Oct. 23, 1989)
for multiple trading of options.

  The exchanges' lack of cooperation has prompted Richard
Breeden, chairman of the SEC, to force them to the negotiating
table.

  In a letter to exchange officials this week, Breeden has
amended the planned rule change set to take place on Jan. 22
(TST, June 5, 1989). The lottery system for newly-traded issues
will be phased out as planned, but Breeden has decided to extend
the ban on multiple listing of existing issues until the five
exchanges sit down and discuss a plan for linking the exchanges.

  The CBOE-AMEX study says OMINTS, a proposed intermarket order-
routing system similar to the Intermarket Trading System (ITS)
that has linked U.S. stock exchanges since 1978, is redundant,
outdated and would not serve the best interests of investors.

  The CBOE and AMEX are the largest U.S. options exchanges in
terms of trading volume, with 44% and 30% of the market
respectively. Philadelphia has 13%, the Pacific exchange 11% and
the NYSE a 2% share.

                       Staying Competitive

  While Nicholas Giordano, president of the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange defends OMINTS as "a logical first step," the authors of
the CBOE-AMEX study say the system would "lock the market into an
old concept that will significantly impair the ability to develop
new and more advanced solutions later."

  The new study questions the OMINTS feature which allows
specialists to choose between meeting the best inter-exchange bid
or offer, and thereby executing the order, and re-routing a
customer order. The study says this reduces the immediacy of
execution, and that the broker initiating the trade from his
office should decide the final destination of a customer order.

  This, the authors believe, will compel each market maker to
maintain a competitive bid or offer, and thus help to keep the
markets competitive and allow the investor to execute quickly and
cost-effectively. Both studies claim to propose measures that
will prevent market fragmentation -- the task forces's by
implementing an integrated order-routing system and the CBOE-
AMEX's by preserving competition.

  The new study, jointly authored by Yakov Amihud, professor of
finance at New York University's Stern School of Business and
Haim Mendelson, professor of decision sciences and information
systems at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, was
prepared in response to the SEC's white paper calling for
comments on multiple listing of options. The Pacific-
Philadelphia-New York study was executed by Tellefsen Consulting
Group Inc.

                         Looking Forward

  In keeping with the CBOE and AMEX's desire to take a more
forward-looking approach, the professors have released only an
interim study. They will not release their final recommendations
for a market integration system until after multiple trading
commences, allowing the impact of multiple listing to be
assessed.

  In a letter to Chairman Breeden, Nicholas Giordano, president
of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, says the CBOE-AMEX study
offers no "concrete alternatives to or legitimate criticisms of
OMINTS" and therefore the members of the task force are convinced
OMINTS is the best alternative.

  Although the exchanges continue to argue over how to integrate
the options markets, they all consider development of new pricing
systems for their specialists a top priority.

  Options specialists at the AMEX have started using The Options
Pricing System (TOPS), a computerized options pricing model that
updates prices as the underlying stock prices change. TOPS was
jointly developed by the AMEX and David Bruce & Co., a Chicago
financial software developer, and the Securities Industry
Automation Corp.

                        Faster is Better

  Selected CBOE market makers have had an online analytical
system installed. PC Auto Quote uses different pricing models to
quickly calculate option prices (TST, Oct. 23, 1989). The pilot
system uses IBM PS/2 terminals with touch sensitive screens and
has been installed at three booths covering four equity options
series. The exchange's floor procedure committee approved the
installation of the pilot as a test to see if online systems help
to increase order flow.

  The Philadelphia Stock Exchange is also developing an auto-
quote system for options specialists. The auto-quote system has
been in use for a few years on the exchange's currency floor.
Officials say the exchange hopes to have the entire options floor
operational by April. The auto-quote system updates options
prices as the underlying security moves. The exchange is also
using software developed by David Bruce, but because the software
will run on a high-powered workstation, exchange officials claim
Philly market makers can update prices six times faster than
users of Amex's TOPS system.

  The Pacific Stock Exchange will have an auto-quote system tied
to its online Pacific Options Exchange Trading System (POETS) to
allow specialists to quickly update options prices.

  The NYSE is in the process of installing an online automatic
quote system for its specialists. The system will carry quotes
for all issues traded on the NYSE.

TELERATE PLANS BROKER VERSION
OF TTS TO RIVAL REUTERS SYSTEM

  In response to Reuters Holdings PLC's planned launch of its
Dealing 2000-2 foreign exchange order-matching system, Telerate
Inc. is developing a rival system that will preserve the role of
the broker in the interbank market. Telerate has traditionally
maintained close relationships with brokers, particularly with
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., which provides Telerate with U.S.
government securities prices under an exclusive arrangement.

  The proposed system will display executable, two-way prices
contributed by foreign exchange brokers. Subscribers to
Telerate's Trading Service (TTS) will be able to view and hit
firm broker prices through their TTS slates instead of having to
trade over the telephone. Telerate says it is talking to brokers
about participating in the system but has yet to conclude a firm
agreement.

  The system will use the same worldwide network Telerate built
to support TTS. Telerate says development of the system -- dubbed
the Broker Version -- is 85% completed. The only upgrade required
to access the new system will be installation of a color version
of the monochrome TTS dealer slate. TTS is a conversational
interbank trading service that competes with Reuters' Monitor
Dealing and Dealing 2000 systems.

  Dealing 2000-2, which is slated for rollout before the third
quarter of this year, will make Reuters the sole intermediary for
its own screen-based market. The system is expected to take some
business away from the telephone-based forex broker market.

  Telerate says its Broker Version will retain the existing
broker structure of the over-the-counter foreign exchange market.
In that structure, banks telephone brokers to get two-way prices
on any currency combination. The brokers match sellers and
buyers, taking a cut in the process.

                      Black Boxes Premature

  In more direct competition to Reuters' Dealing 2000-2 is RADAR,
a black-box order-matching system under development by RADAR
Financial L.P., a joint venture comprising MAI PLC, Euro Brokers
Inc. and a number of as yet undisclosed partners (TST, Oct. 23,
1989). But according to Jim Wiseman, chief designer of TTS,
Telerate doesn't believe the foreign exchange market is ready for
an anonymous black-box trading system.

  A TTS user would access the Broker Version by hitting a field
on his slate marked with the letter B. This would change the
format of both the slate and the screen in front of the trader.
The Broker Version slate shows the same function fields along the
lower edge of the slate.

  Above the function fields, the slate is divided horizontally
into two segments. The lower segment contains the bank's own
rates for selected currency pairs. The upper segment shows the
best three broker bid and offer rates for the currency pair the
trader is dealing in. The bids and offers are arranged in a
pyramid formation, with the best bid and offer side by side at
the top-center of the slate.

                          Hit the Field

  To hit a broker at a particular bid or offer, the trader
touches the relevant field on his slate. At this point, the
transaction is immediately executed, with the system
automatically exchanging settlement details between the two
parties. If the trader hit the best bid or offer on the slate,
the previous second-best bid or offer moves to the top of the
pyramid and the new third-best bid or offer joins the pyramid at
the bottom. If the trader hits the second- or third-best bid or
offer, the system automatically hits the best bid or offer at the
same time and calculates the average rate for the transaction.

  At the center of the pyramid is a field that displays details
of the most recent three transactions the trader has completed
that day. Included in the data are the identities of the
counterparties with which the deals were struck. The trader is
able to scroll up and down in this field, giving him access to
transactions made earlier in the day.

  Meanwhile, a fifth quadrant superimposed onto the center of the
trader's screen displays the best three broker bids and offers in
the system, plus the bank's own rates. An incoming call from a
counterparty on the TTS network would automatically take
precedence on the screen over the broker quadrant.

STRATUS TOUTS JAPANESE
DEAL STRUCK LAST SPRING

  Security must be pretty tight in Japan these days, because
Yamaichi Securities has only just allowed Stratus Computer Inc.
to announce a $1.9 million deal the computer manufacturer struck
last spring with Toshiba Engineering Co. Two of the three XA
2000s Yamaichi acquired in the deal have actually been up and
running since last summer.

  A Stratus Computer Inc. press release dated Jan. 2 and sent to
TST offices via Federal Express, fax and ordinary mail boldly
claims: "Stratus wins $1.9 million contract to supply Yamaichi
Securities with online trading system."

  The third Stratus XA 2000, which was also delivered last
summer, will support a trading system to be developed by systems
integrator Toshiba for Yamaichi. Stratus' contract is actually
with the systems integrator, which is developing the futures and
options trading system that will run on Stratus computers at
Yamaichi offices in Japan.

                     Economic with the Facts

  The release also says that "the Stratus-based system...is
already online," distributing "real-time futures and options
prices listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to Sun Workstations" on
Yamaichi's trading floor and at branch offices.

  A long discussion starting on page 2 of the press release
describes in detail what seems to be a ticker plant, not a
trading system. There is no further mention of the futures and
options trading system in development.

  A little investigation helped sort out the situation. Yes,
Stratus assures us, the release does describe a ticker plant that
uses Stratus technology, and that system has been in operation
since the summer. A Stratus XA 2000 model 120 receives the
prices, and a model 110 distributes the data to broker
workstations, Stratus says. Yamaichi wanted a second machine to
perform the ticker plant function usually performed by one
because the firm plans to run other, as yet undisclosed
applications on it, Stratus explains.

  Now that the ticker plant is up and running, a trading system
is being developed, Stratus says. The third Stratus, another
model 120 Yamaichi got in last spring's deal, is being used by
Toshiba Engineering to develop a new application for futures and
options trading, Stratus says.

TECHNOLOGY FORECASTING AND
HUMAN FACTORS AT HP SEMINAR

  Hewlett-Packard's recent seminar on Technological Challenges
Facing the Securities Industry might well have been subtitled
True Confessions of Trading Systems Design. Two speakers, Scott
Abbey, managing director and head of worldwide operations for
Morgan Stanley & Co., and George Kenney, senior vice president of
O'Connor & Associates, offered unusually candid and informative
presentations. The meeting was co-sponsored by Business Week.

  Morgan Stanley does its share of strategic technology
forecasting, striving to identify the shape of trading systems to
come. Before airing his latest prognosis, Abbey turned the clock
back five years to review Morgan Stanley's then-current vision of
trading systems of the future.

                    "What hasn't happened..."

  * The attempt to satisfy all the trader's needs -- market data,
position management, analytics etc. -- with a single device was
"one of the driving forces" of Morgan Stanley's development
effort in the early-to-mid 1980s. But it met with "tremendous
resistance."

  Not only was it difficult to create a single system as good at
multiple applications as separate systems would be, but traders
insisted on being able to see all their data all the time.

  * Morgan Stanley had expected to see a reduction in the average
number of devices per trader. Instead, the "tower of power" at
many traders' desks is actually getting higher.

  * Large screen devices with partitions -- like the IBM 3290
plasma display -- were a hot prospect until Abbey & company found
out that traders didn't like not being able to see over their
terminals.

  * Abbey and his team also looked into windowing systems on
normal-sized displays, but traders were adamant about being able
to see "all the information," so overlapped windows were
discarded.

  * He had expected much of the analytic workload to migrate from
mainframes to workstations. Instead, "a lot of the MIPS on the
desk" are being applied to the user interface.

  Meanwhile, "a tremendous number of Lotus spreadsheets" have
popped up on PCs. But PC power hasn't replaced any mainframes. In
fact, there are even more mainframes, due to increased demand for
local data collection, storage, processing and retrieval.

                     "What Has Happened..."

  * Five years ago, Abbey decided to pay the small incremental
price of making his firm's terminals "graphics-capable." Today, a
lot more graphics are being used at Morgan Stanley -- for
spreads, trends and graphical user interfaces.

  * There's been a significant increase in the use of internal
data. Five or 10 years ago, capital markets traders used external
(market) data almost exclusively. Today, more traders have access
to position data, internal research and customer data.

  * More interactive software is allowing traders greater
flexibility in configuring and passing data among applications.

                           What's Next

  Undaunted by his spotty forecasting track record, Abbey went on
to share his predictions for the next five years.

  * The availability of high resolution intermediate-sized (12"-
15") monitors will result in increased use of windowing
interfaces and mice. The higher resolution and larger size will
satisfy traders' need to see all their data, while the shape of
the monitors won't obstruct vision.

  * Mainframe applications developed for the batch environment
will continue to be grandfathered -- partly because of the
investment in new applications that talk to the old ones, and
partly because of the need to amortize the old applications
themselves. Systems designers, Abbey seems to say, will continue
to be held hostage by financial inertia.

  This prediction may hold more meaning for Morgan Stanley -- as
developers and users of the omnipurpose, mainframe-based Tradepro
trade processing behemoth -- than for other firms.

  * Workstations will be the focal point for integration of data
from heterogeneous in-house mainframes as well as outside data
sources. Morgan Stanley has devoted a lot of resources to develop
connectivity software that will allow workstations to run
applications that crunch data from remote, mainframe databases.

  * Some of the incremental power of new workstations will
support more sophisticated graphical user interfaces. For a 15 or
25 MIP machine, says Abbey, one to three MIPS of window
management is insignificant.

  * A lot of money will be wasted on workstations simply because
they're sexy and the salesman does a good job, and because buyers
look at the one-off cost rather than quantity.

  * Another dumpster load of money will be wasted because people
don't understand how to build distributed systems. "Despite what
anybody says," says Abbey, "I don't believe that that technology
exists and is widely understood."

  Abbey believes it will take a lot of blood, sweat and tears,
thousands of programming hours and "not a lot of profits" to make
a distributed system work. But he believes the investment is
necessary. "There's no way around it; we have to fail and we have
to stand up to our management and say, this is why we have to do
it."

                     The Facts of Half-Life

  Now with O'Connor, George Kenney came from the American Stock
Exchange where he guided the development of a theoretical options
pricing system (TOPS). The system was developed, Kenney says,
because specialists on the floor of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange were consistently out-quoting the AMEX specialists.
Kenney's AMEX experience left him with a healthy respect for the
human and political factors of systems design.

  The first duty of a trading systems designer, according to
Kenney, is to survive long enough to complete a project.
Unfortunately, "the time it takes to implement and design an
architecture greatly exceeds the half-life of MIS directors."

  At the AMEX, Kenney lasted two years. His successor, says
Kenney, must decide whether to complete the project Kenney
started or throw it away or do something that will have his name
on it. Kenney advises systems architects to make a "sober
assessment of the political climate, both yours personally and
that of the firm."

TECHNOLOGY FORCASTING
PART TWO

                     Consider the Lowly User

  But the biggest challenge facing the systems designer, says
Kenney, is making "the impedance match between these great
systems you're spending all this money to design and this poor
user who has to use it."

  Kenney had just come from visiting the New York offices of his
new employer. And while praising O'Connor's "tremendous
technology," he also points out that "a lot of the users really
don't know how to turn the systems on, so 95% of the sparkle that
system can deliver is really lost."

  Systems designers, says Kenney, are the least qualified people
to make the match between systems and users because they think
differently from users. Designers, for example, are comfortable
with "hidden information," while users are not.

  Kenney told of a brief encounter with one AMEX specialist
during tests of an electronic display book. The specialist
remarked, You see this ticket? I can touch it. I can smell it,
and I trust it. And I don't trust this electronic book. You'll
sneak orders into it and I'll never know about them.'

                       Eggheads Under Fire

  Systems designers, according to Kenney, don't like talking to
users. Instead, they like to deal with system specifications.
"They get the specs and then go hide behind them and design their
system and then they sort of throw it over the wall," said
Kenney.

  Talking to users is "very painful" for systems designers,
according to Kenney. "It takes time -- time away from valuable
design." Kenney likens the state of computer systems design to
automotive engineering in the 1940s.

  Apropos of systems design, Kenney acknowledges his intellectual
debt to John D. Gould, a human factors scientist at IBM's
Hawthorne, New York research center. Gould's paper, "How to
Design Usable Systems," will appear as a chapter in the "Handbook
of Human-Computer Interaction" edited by Martin Helander and to
be published by North-Holland Press.

  The Gould paper describes "good computer systems" as "easy to
learn, easy to use, contain[ing] the... functions that allow
people to do the things they want to do, and that are well-
liked." To meet these goals, Gould says designers should learn to
pay more attention to users and the user interface throughout the
design process.

                  How to Design Usable Systems

  Several clever tactics for increasing user orientation -- both
in the conceptual and testing phases -- are advocated by Gould,
including:

  * Begin writing the user manual before any code is written --
in some cases the draft user manual can become the definitive
design document;

  * Define explicit behavioral targets (not MIPS or I/O rates)
for systems performance and test for them. A behavioral goal
might be, after an hour's unsupervised exposure to the system, a
trader must be able to execute 10 trades, accurately enter the
trade data, and check his position, in two minutes';

  * Eliminate intermediaries, such as marketing research people,
between systems designers and users;

  * While observing users, ask them to think aloud about what
they are doing as they are doing it;

  * Schedule design meetings in users' work areas;

  * Observe and videotape users in their work environment --
videotapes "are often much more convincing than charts and oral
reports;

  * Include users on the design team -- participative design
improves the probability of user acceptance;

  * Sketch user scenarios and show them to the design team to
provoke arguments about the user interface;

  * Create mock-ups and simulations -- one group simulated a
"listening typewriter" by having a concealed typist enter what
users said.

                   Living in a "Sea of Change"

  Like Kenney, Gould accuses systems designers of avoiding
contact with users whenever possible. As a result, designers tend
to design systems to satisfy themselves, not users. "Smart
systems designers like to build projects that have high
intellectual content," says Kenney.

  Gould also thinks designers must learn to embrace failure in
order to succeed. Since nobody, no matter how gifted, gets it
right the first time, designers must commit to an iterative
process, says Gould, and be willing to work in the midst of a
"sea of change."

  Of course, an iterative design process is only possible with
the right tools. Gould acknowledges the need for a user interface
management system (UIMS).

  The UIMS, says Gould, "provides for a well defined interface
between that portion of the code that contains the user interface
and that portion of the code that implements the functions of the
user interface." Gould cites "Apollo Computer's ADM" and
"Cosmic's (NASA software) TAE" as examples of commercially
available UIMSs.

                      Off the Drawing Board

  Kenney actually used some of Gould's techniques while
developing AMEX's TOPS. He hired two industrial psychologists who
spent three months gaining the confidence of the specialists and
developing a model of the user interface. He formed a users
committee and developed story boards depicting user scenarios. He
designed a mock-up of a custom keyboard, and prototyped a
simulator for users on a PC.

  "The users were becoming authors; they became invested in the
system," says Kenney. "And user satisfaction is key to the
survivability of the MIS director." Key, but no guarantee.

CORPORATIONS ADVISED TO FOCUS ON MARKET RISK 

     Corporate finance professionals are finding they don't know
enough about measuring market risk to meet new  U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed regulations.  The SEC wants
executives to evaluate and disclose the market risks their companies
face and how they use derivatives as a hedge.  While the action is
intended to give investors a better understanding of the risks
involved with hedging, a new survey suggests many corporate finance
professionals don't fully understand the risks themselves.
     While there has been a dramatic effort in the last year or two to
establish or update corporate investment policies, "where we get into
a little bit of a problem is in the risk measurement and control
element of those policies," says Robert Baldoni, managing director  of
Irvington, N.Y.-based Emcor Risk Management Consulting.

Stumped by Value-at-Risk

     Emcor polled treasury executives recently at multinational
corporations and found that two-thirds of the more than 80 respondents
believed they did not have an adequate understanding of value-at-risk
(VAR).  
     Widely endorsed, VAR is considered an essential component of the
new SEC proposals.  The VAR approach looks at the entire corporate
risk profile, not just the individual transaction -- which is where
corporations tend to focus, says Baldoni.  "Many people are getting
involved in complex transactions and are not necessarily aware of the
ramifications," he says.  
     The SEC action comes exactly a year after the bankruptcy filing
of Orange County, Calif.  The municipality lost more than $1.5 billion
in ill-advised derivatives trades.  Similar recent disasters led the
SEC to review the annual reports of some 500 public companies to gauge
how well market risk was being evaluated and reported to investors.
     As a result of that investigation, the SEC is calling for new
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of hedging activity.  The
accounting policy for derivatives will have to be detailed within the
corporate financial statements. And the agency wants to see "a
narrative discussion" of the company's primary market risk exposures
and how those exposures are managed.  TREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT,
January 19, 1996                                                      
     To the extent that derivatives or other financial instruments are
used to hedge a company's primary market risk, the SEC proposes three
alternatives to disclose the associated risks:

     * The first option is to present a table with "common inputs to
market risk measurement methods," so that investors and analysts can
plug the data into their own models and do their own risk analysis;  

     * Alternatively, corporate financial executives may choose to
present a  "sensitivity analysis," illustrating the potential impact
of certain hypothetical market moves.  The SEC cautions that a
detailed explanation of the modeling techniques and parameters must be
included so that investors understand the analysis;

     * The third option is a VAR model which calculates the net effect
of all of the hedges used entity-wide.  The risk projection is
expressed as the most that could be lost over a specific period -- a
day, a week, a month -- with a statistically-derived confidence level. 
In other words, a typical VAR expression would be that over the next
quarter there is a 90 percent confidence level that the loss potential
due to market activity will be no more than x dollars.  To have that
kind of overarching measure of market risk requires some sophisticated
number crunching.

Why VAR, Why Now?

     Little about the VAR concept is new, except the need to apply it
in a corporate environment.  Financial institutions with dynamic
trading operations long have used the approach.  And while most
corporations have fairly simple and stable hedging positions, Baldoni
says that's changing:  "As we have gotten into more complex
instruments the risk profile has changed.  And unfortunately, the
instruments that are being offered are way ahead of the control
systems in most of these institutions." 
     The basic statistical concepts of standard deviation, variance
and covariance are at the heart of the so-called "analytic approach,"
to VAR, but various simulation methods can also produce VAR
measurements.  However, even the most vigilant risk manager may be
stumped by where to get the numbers.  
     Until New York-based J.P. Morgan introduced its RiskMetrics
database in the fall of 1994, there wasn't a reliable, consistent
source of data, says Mike Salzberg, partner with Price Waterhouse in
New York.  
     "One of our goals is to demystify derivatives," explains Jacques
Longerstaey, head of the Market Risk Research unit at Morgan.  The
firm provides free access to data on commodity futures, fixed-income,
equity and currency markets, as well as volatility measures and
correlations.  The RiskMetrics data is available via the Internet
(http://www.jpmorgan.com), and such information services as Bloomberg,
Reuters and Dow Jones Telerate.  
     Access to data has not been the only barrier to widespread use of
VAR.  In fact, 84 percent of the respondents in the Emcor survey
indicated they have not used the RiskMetrics database.  
     A majority indicated they simply don't have the software to make
use of the data, which is probably not surprising considering a base
level VAR package runs from $100,000 to $200,000 a year, according to
Baldoni.  He adds that cheaper packages on the market are not very
good.  
     "To pay for the software and get your people trained you've got
to have the deal flow to justify it," he says.  Most corporations
don't, and will choose to outsource the analysis. 

Who Is Responsible for VAR?

     Under the new SEC proposals, a corporation will be held
accountable for the risk quantification that is put before the public. 
"I think it's beginning to open up a very interesting issue," says
Salzberg of Price Waterhouse.  "Once it starts getting into the area
of actually disclosing numbers, who's responsible for that number?  Is
it the risk manager?  The capital markets guy?  The CFO who signs his
name on the report?"  
     Baldoni says his goal with the VAR concept is to make the numbers
understandable to the highest levels of the corporation, "so, 10 or 12
months later when something goes wrong people aren't saying, 'Oh, I
didn't know.'"
     The SEC's stated goal is to make risk quantification
understandable to investors, and that, Salzberg says, will have
repercussions in the market.       "Suppose I divide VAR into revenue?
What I wind up with is a risk-adjusted value," allowing investors to
gauge how much they're putting at risk to make that return, he
explained.  
     "That's how we choose between investments," adds Salzberg, and 
"right now we can't do that."  But he cautions that VARs should be
considered directional measures, and not absolute numbers.
     "Establishing an historic pattern of risk-adjusted numbers will
allow investors to look back and see how accurate the company has been
in determining its risk profile," he says.  (Robert Baldoni, Emcor

Morgan, 212/648-8321; Michael Salzberg, Price Waterhouse, 212/596-
8945; Michael H. Sutton, SEC, 202-942-4400.)

CORPORATE-VALUE-AT-RISK

        The value-at-risk (VAR) approach was developed by and for the
trading operations of financial institutions, but has been endorsed
for corporate use by the Group of Thirty, the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, the Financial Executives Institute and now
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
        Irvington, N.Y.-based Emcor Risk Management Consulting
developed a proprietary risk measurement system which they call
Corporate-Value-At-Risk (CVAR).  The concept embodies four distinct
measures, each of which can employ the full range of statistical
analysis -- variance, covariance, historic scenario analysis, Monte
Carlo analysis, etc.:

* Operating Exposure

This measures the underlying risk exposure that results from the
company's operating activities to determine if there is enough risk to
warrant the time spent managing it.

* Financial Instrument Exposure

This step applies the same analysis specifically to the financial
instruments chosen to manage the company's underlying risk.  These
tools include such things as securities, debt and hedge instruments.

* Operating Exposure and Hedges

Step three is to overlay measures one and two and run the same risk
analysis a third time.  This measure, when compared with the company's
initial operating exposure, should indicate a lower overall level of
risk.

* Counterparty Exposure

This analysis focuses on the company's risk exposure to each financial
institution that serves as a counterparty.  It provides a measure of
the upside potential of the hedging portfolio, so that the company
stays below its counterparty credit limit.

TREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT via NewsNet
January 19, 1996

SENATE BILL TIGHTENS UP ON PENSION PLAN AUDITS

The Pension Audit Improvement Act (S. 1490), introduced in the U.S.
Senate last month, would eliminate limited scope audits, enhance the
qualifications necessary for pension plan auditors and require those
auditors to promptly notify authorities of any serious violations. 
All of which, it is expected, will significantly raise the cost of
plan administration.  
        The measure was introduced in the midst of the holiday
season, betwixt government shutdowns and before the east coast
disappeared under a blizzard.  
Because of the timing, reaction against the bill has been muted, "but
my guess is you're going to see mobilization," says Paul Doxsee, vice
president of St. Paul, Minn.-based Pension Solutions Inc., the
marketing arm of MSI Insurance Group which specializes in 401(k) plan
administration for firms with fewer than 500 employees. 

When Is An Audit Not An Audit?

        Plan administrators, under current law, can exclude certain
pension plan assets from the annual audit as long as those assets are
invested with a regulated institution such as a bank or insurance
company.  The assumption has been that those assets are being audited
elsewhere.  About half of the required audits under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) contain a "limited scope
disclaimer." 
        "Potentially, the majority of the assets in a plan aren't
audited, and then you're not getting the full benefit of an audit,"
says Sue Hicks with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) in Washington, D.C.      
        Since 1987 the U. S. General Accounting Office and the U.S.
Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General have issued separate
reports questioning the suitability of limited scope audits.  
        To further dramatize the situation, U.S. Secretary of Labor
Robert B. Reich announced in November that Department of Labor (DOL)
investigators had more than 300 civil- and criminal inquiries underway
against companies accused of improperly diverting 401(k) funds. 
Doxsee acknowledges DOL has found some bad apples, but says, "I think
they've already heightened the awareness ... why do they need the
audit requirement on top of it?"
     Although the independent Washington, D.C.-based, Employee Benefit
Research Institute (EBRI) has not taken an official position on the
bill, organization president Dallas Salisbury says the bill's reforms
come at a relatively high price "with the principal beneficiaries
being the nation's accounting firms." 
   Whatever the cost, it's outweighed by the benefits, says the
AICPA's Hicks.  The benefits, however, may be in the eye of the
beholder.  While DOL  traditionally has found most 401(k) problems in
small firms, plans with fewer than 100 employees are exempt from
audits altogether.  "This would be a further cost and discouragement
for large plans while not doing anything to get at the problems
related to small plans," says Salisbury.      
   According to Hicks, AICPA committees have estimated the
legislation would push up the cost of a pension plan audit by 10
percent-to-40 percent.  "I would say that for some of our clients who
are marginally profitable, that increase may force a decision to
discontinue the plan.  That's very real.  To a small employer, $500 to
$1000 matters a great deal," says Doxee.  (Paul Doxee, Pension
Solutions, 612/631-7760; Sue Hicks, AICPA, 202/737-6600; Dallas

RESOURCEIQ OPENS WINDOW TO EUROPE

   Privately-held ADS Associates Inc. is considering conquering the
world, again.  The Calabasas, Calif.-based software developer has
established sales and service outposts throughout the world to support
Global Trader, a leading broker-dealer work station used by central
banks and global financial institutions.  But the company's treasury
management workstation, Resource, has barely ventured outside North
America.  That may change this year.
   "Our new Windows product was designed with an eye toward
international applications," says Harvey Holman, vice president for
sales.  "The DOS-based Resource product was very much North America-
oriented," he adds.
   The Windows release, ResourceIQ, is due out in June and is
expected to introduce several unique features.  Among them, a "drag
and drop" capability that allows figures and graphs to be moved to
outside applications without the intermediary step of going to an
ASCII flat file.
   Similarly, a spreadsheet figure showing an account surplus can be
moved and dropped on a wire transfer icon and automatically moved into
an overnight investment.  "Through an application programming
interface, all the appropriate wire transfer information moves along
with the figure," says Holman.
   In addition to the new gee-whiz functionality, ResourceIQ has
gained derivatives, sensitivity analysis and risk analysis
functionality from Global Trader -- "all the things that corporates
want, but have traditionally not been able to afford," says Holman.  
Whereas a Global Trader workstation runs between $1 million and $3
million, the average Resource installation costs $30,000-to-$80,000.
   Annette Sneckenberg, financial operations manager for a $3 billion
Omaha-based conglomerate, settled on the ADS Resource workstation a
year ago after grilling three vendors.  "Overall, they had the better
package, and the people who came to do the demo were so knowledgeable
we couldn't stump them on anything," Sneckenberg says.  Her firm,
privately-held Peter Kiewit Sons, has more than 250 subsidiaries.  "We
were looking for an investment system that could run the gamut," she
says.  (Harvey Holman, ADS, 818/591-2371; Annette Sneckenberg, Peter
Kiewit Sons, 402/536-3623.)

Commentary

     The corporate bond market seems to be on hiatus, apparently
taking its cue from the federal government shutdown in Washington,
D.C.  With neither economic indicators nor a federal budget to guide
forecasts, corporate credit issuers are on the sidelines.
     Beyond Wall Street, the federal government shutdown has blacked
out more than data.  Billions of dollars in civilian and military
export licenses are held up at the Commerce Department; Small Business
Administration loans have dried up; and government contractors have
been idled.  
     At the same time, the East Coast blizzard silenced major
retailing centers from Boston to Richmond.  Wall Street's manic
reaction to the federal budget talks sank the stock and bond markets
last week when political differences appeared to put off any hope of a
balanced budget pact.
     The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is down over 2.5 percent for the
year to date.  Similarly, the bond market has given back its late
December gains, pushing the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond over the 6
percent mark.  The Federal Reserve Board's open market committee meets
again Jan. 30, but most market analysts expect the Fed is as much in
the dark as they are and so will put off any interest rate action.  
     What little information the market has comes from the Fed this
week with its report on December industrial production and capacity
utilization.  The U.S. Labor and Commerce Departments are expected to
be catching up this week on overdue reports covering gross national
product, employment, retail sales and producer and consumer prices.

FIRMS WORRY ABOUT BUDGET FIGHT

   A poll conducted last month by the Morristown, N.J.-based
Financial Executives Institute (FEI), found that senior financial
executives in the United States are concerned about the failure of
President Clinton and the U.S. Congress to reach a balanced- budget
agreement.  Asked how a budget impasse would directly affect their
companies, 68 percent predicted higher interest rates; 56 percent
expected reduced sales; 40 percent believed it would negatively affect
employment; and 50 percent said it would decrease their companies'
stock prices.  An earlier FEI membership poll, conducted in early
November, found most of the respondents in favor of Congress' tough
tactics -- two-thirds of the respondents said they favored tying an
extension of the federal debt ceiling to passage of the budget
reconciliation package.  (Jim Kaitz, FEI, 202/659-3700.)

SEC COULD WANT DISCOUNT BACK

The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's recent budgetary lapse
resulted in a firesale on securities registrations (TMR, Nov. 24).  In
the absence of a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
appropriation amending the filing rate set in the Securities Act of
1933, filers were paying 1/50th of one percent of the value of their
filing.  With the emergency funding measure passed on Jan. 6, that
rate goes back to 1/29th of one percent.  But the SEC says filers who
got away with the lower rate between Dec. 15 and Jan. 8 may be
required to make up the difference. (SEC Office of Filer Support, 
202/942-8900.)

BANKS PUSH CHECKS ON CD-ROM

Several major banks have come to market in recent weeks offering check
images on CD-ROM.  The new technology uses search and retrieval
software to pull up a check image on a personal computer screen as
opposed to pulling a paper check out of a storage box, or waiting for
the check to clear.  New York-based Chase Manhattan Bank announced a
CD-ROM enhancement for its ImageAccess check disbursement customers. 
These are customers who issue thousands of checks a month.  Each CD
can store up to 25,000 checks.  Similarly, Chemical Banking Corp.'s
New York-based Geoserve division now offers check images on CD to
controlled disbursement customers of Chemical Bank Delaware.  And Bank
of Boston is offering corporate customers check image delivery on CD
as an alternative to receiving traditional paper or microfilm.  "Many
customers anticipate that they will be able to resolve telephone
inquiries while the payee or customer is still on the phone," says
Mary Ann Hardy, Bank of Boston image product development manager.

NEW MESSAGE SERIES LAUNCHED

   S.W.I.F.T. and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA) introduced a new series of derivatives messages.  The new
message types are MT 360, single currency interest rate swap
confirmation; MT 361, cross currency interest rate swap confirmation;
and MT 362, interest rate swap reset confirmation.  The new messages
are intended to improve the ability of swap dealers to execute
confirmations and to reduce the operational risk in interest rate swap
transactions.  "Control of operational risk is of primary importance
for the financial services industry," said Peter Guldentops, S.W.I.F.T
senior manager for standards.  (Ian Fraser, S.W.I.F.T., 011/32-2-655-

STOCK OPTION ACCOUNTING WORRIES HIGH TECH FIRMS 

   Corporate financial officers may have won a round with the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), but now many are finding
they still have a lot to lose.  After facing years of opposition, the
FASB agreed in October to back down from its plan to require that
corporate financial statements reflect the value of stock options
granted as compensation.
   The FASB wanted corporations to fix a cost to those options and
charge it against earnings.  While that won't happen, effective
January 1 the FASB is requiring that the same valuation be included in
corporate financial footnotes.  "This is one footnote I hope the
readers of our financial statements don't read," says Chris Paisley,
chief financial officer for 3Com Corp., a Santa Clara, Calif.-based
high technology firm.
   It's not that Paisley has anything to hide, other than a profound
befuddlement over how to value the thousands of options his company
grants each year.  All 4,600 of 3Com's employees receive options as
part of the company's bonus and incentive program.  "We were obviously
none too thrilled with this pronouncement," says Paisley.  Start-up
high tech firms like 3Com routinely use stock options in lieu of
scarce cash to attract top talent.   

FASB Provides Questionable Model  

   The FASB's Statement 123 explains that for stock options "fair
value is determined using an option-pricing model that takes into
account the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, the
expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock
and the expected dividends on it, and the risk-free interest rate over
the expected life of the option."
    "When CFOs realize the complexity of what they're going to have
to do, they're going to be in shell shock because it's not going to be
an easy compliance by any stretch," says Cheryl Breetwor, president of
Sunnyvale, Calif.-based ShareData, which provides software for stock
option accounting to some 2000 customers throughout the United States. 
To date, ShareData has produced software that merely tracks a
company's stock options, keeping up with who's vested, and how many
options have been exercised.  Putting a value on those options is
something else.
   "It's not nearly as simple as the FASB has made it sound.  It's
going to be very costly," she says.  Not only will the software will
be expensive, but so will the consulting help Breetwor assumes
companies will need in making projections about stock price,
dividends, length of employee service and interest rates, all of which
are needed to feed the FASB model.   (Cheryl Breetwor, ShareData,
408/746-3666; Chris Paisley, 3Com, 408/764-5000.)

Assets & Liabilities:  Why Investment Portfolios Are Shrinking


Don't look now, but the investment portfolio is shrinking at most major banks.
A recent survey of mid- to large-sized banks shows over half reduced their
portfolios relative to asset size in 1995 despite overall industry
asset-growth rates of more than 7%.  It's not hard to see why.

First and foremost, banks have been restructuring their balance sheets to
improve liquidity.  According to a recent survey by Olson Research Associates
and the Bank Administration Institute, robust loan demand has fueled an urgent
quest for liquidity since 1993.  Banks have taken net paydowns on securities
or have actively liquidated securities positions to fund the growth of loans.
This ongoing process is the expected flip side of the early 1990s, when there
was strong growth in the portfolio amid poor loan demand.

A second, and more enduring, reason for portfolio shrinkage may be that
investment officers now have to worry about a new dimension of portfolio
management.  These days, the chief investment officer or portfolio manager
must manage not only the yield on the bank's portfolio but also its market
value.  Not that it wasn't always important to manage investment market
values, but the difference now is that evolving accounting standards compel
specific market value disclosure.  Executive managers and stock analysts alike
can exercise greater scrutiny because of the new visibility of portfolio
values.

It all traces back to Financial Accounting Standard 115 for disclosures about
debt instruments.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued this
standard in 1993 as part of the Board's long-range project on financial
instruments, initiated in 1986.  FAS 115 creates three different accounting
approaches pertaining to market valuation for banks' and other firms'
investment securities.  For changes in market values of trading securities,
gains and losses are passed through the profit and loss statement and the
capital account.

For "available for sale" securities (AFS), changes in market value are
recognized in the banks' capital accounts and, along with trading securities,
potentially destabilize reported bank capital.  "Held to maturity" securities
(HTM) do not create accounting gains and losses, nor do they impact reported
capital, but they must meet rigorous standards concerning the bank's ability
and intent to hold them until they mature.

Of course, fluctuations in the market values of bank securities are a highly
visible beacon of interest rate risk.  Gap charts in banks' annual reports
appear benign and only mildly suggest interest rate exposures to bank
earnings.  In contrast, changes in market values hit the bullseye of
interest-rate risk measurement and grab the annual report reader's attention.
It's a worrisome thing for executive managements who may connect their
compensation with the need to report ever-improving performance.

I Shrunk the Portfolio

So, naturally, some banking firms have shrunk the portfolio itself to reduce
the impact of portfolio instability.  Many firms view a portion of the
investment portfolio as discretionary.  It's the part funded with
discretionary wholesale money and is not just a parking place for core
deposits.  It's no secret that acquisition-minded superregional banks are
backing away from large wholesale banking positions that add volatility and
are reemphasizing their core businesses.

This strategy contributes to the shrinkage of the portfolio.  Banking firms
are restructuring their balance sheets by laying off gobs of wholesale funds
and the portions of the portfolios that these funds supported; instead, their
balance sheets are absorbing core loans and funds obtained through the
acquisition of smaller banks.

PNC Bank Corp.  provides a good example of portfolio shrinkage.  In mid-1994,
PNC's $22-billion investment portfolio comprised 36% of the bank's earning
assets-quite large by industry standards at that time.  The bank embarked on
an aggressive strategy of emphasizing its core franchise, including a landmark
acquisition of Chemical Bank branches in New Jersey, and backing away from
wholesale funding and investing.  By late 1995, the portfolio had been reduced
to below $19 billion.  In the process, the bank exorcised some troublesome
investments and took heavy losses.

Still, PNC had a problem because HTM securities represented over 80% of the
portfolio.  Under FAS 115, these securities escaped accounting for gains and
losses, but the restrictiveness of the HTM classification tended to freeze
them in place and make them unmanageable.  And transferring part of them into
the AFS portfolio risked regulatory tainting of the remaining HTM securities
that might lead to their subsequent revaluation.

At yearend 1995, in a bold departure from the temptation to disguise the
volatility of its HTM portfolio permitted by FAS 115, PNC was said to be
preparing to transfer all of the HTM portfolio to the AFS classification.
Apparently the bank is now willing to expose all of its securities activity to
market pricing.

The new FASB-driven focus on volatility has changed the way banks view the
purpose of their investment portfolios.  According to the Olson/BAI survey,
chief investment officers most often state that the primary objective of their
securities portfolios is to manage interest rate risk, followed by managing
liquidity.

It would be an understatement to declare that FAS 115 does not get great
support from bankers.  A very legitimate complaint is that it does not allow
for symmetrical market value adjustments to the funding side of securities
positions.  And, like a lot of regulation, it leaves room for inconsistency
among examiners and invites arbitrary enforcement.  It's not clear how much
portfolio shrinkage is due to distaste for the new accounting rules and the
visibility the rules give to investment performance and how much is due to
cyclical effects that sacrifice investment performance in the quest for
liquidity to service loan demand.

Our speculation is that even an imperfect FAS 115 will eventually change the
role and practice of investment management for the better.  Nay-sayers point
out that judging portfolio performance by tracking unrealized gains and losses
does not recognize the awkward role the portfolio must play because it is
routinely whipsawed by the loan market.

In general, if an investment manager is going to take an aggressive position,
it will occur when earnings on the investment portfolio are most critical to
bank profits.  Information on how a bank management team reaches for those
earnings or how it moves cyclically from a liquidity support mode to an
earnings mode ought to be more apparent to users of its financial information.
In this context, market value information ought to add a crucial element of
discipline to future investment management.

Point of view


My vote for the most dynamic banker of the past decade goes to Hugh L.  McColl
Jr., chairman of NationsBank.  I'm not sure he's the best banker, at least not
by the criteria that most people would use, since NationsBank's performance
has tended to be fairly average as measured by traditional yardsticks like
return on assets or loan quality.  I've always thought of McColl as more of a
builder, and banking just happened to be the business that he was in.

McColl was the keynote speaker at a recent industry conference, where he
delivered a stirring wake-up call about the importance of the Internet and
on-line commerce to the industry's future.  McColl is not a tall man, but he
has a deep, booming voice that begins in the soles of his shoes and builds all
the way up.  It was good to hear him say that the industry's greatest threat
is not Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, but rather its own indecisiveness in the
face of change.  McColl is an unlikely person to emerge as banking's most
vocal leader, and yet he played the same role last year with the passage of
interstate banking legislation.  I say "unlikely" because for years, McColl
seemed to have a chip on his shoulder, the hard-bitten ex-Marine who kept a
hand grenade on his desk and had a "war room" where he plotted his merger
strategy.  Who would listen to a guy hell-bent on taking them over?

I've written two stories about McColl since 1987 and learned something each
time.  The first time around, I learned that he doesn't take well to
criticism, as when I wrote that his tough-guy rhetoric was the main reason why
few bankers wanted to merge with him.  His spokesman coolly informed me later
that I had so offended McColl that he wasn't going to talk to the press
anymore.  The second encounter, in 1993, taught me that McColl can be warm and
delightfully down-to-earth as well.  An investment banker told me of flying
into Charlotte, where NationsBank is headquartered, to pitch a deal to McColl,
whom he had not met before.  My source expected someone from the bank to fetch
a colleague and him from the airport-but that "someone" turned out to be
McColl himself, holding up a little sign like a limo driver and grinning from
ear to ear.  Later, as they were racing into town in McColl's BMW, the
chairman spotted a friend who had pulled his car off the highway.  McColl
quickly stopped to see what was wrong.  When they stayed to BS for a while, my
source started thinking this wasn't your normal CEO.

My favorite story also occurred when I was not around.  Photos for the second
piece were shot at a Habitat for Humanity job site, where McColl was helping
build a house.  The photographer told me later that McColl noticed two young
boys playing basketball nearby with a makeshift hoop and backboard.  McColl
disappeared for a while, then returned with a new hoop, which he proceeded to
put up for them.

The point of all this is that McColl might be a more effective leader if
people knew him better.  His trash talk of years past has largely obscured
both his warmth and sense of humor.  The media is partly responsible for this,
but McColl and his advisers share in the blame.  When he appeared on the cover
of Fortune last August crouching with a shotgun while bird hunting, it
reinforced the old image of the hungry predator.  Banking doesn't have leaders
like it did 20 years ago.  It could use a few now, and McColl might fit the
bill if he allowed a fuller, more balanced picture of himself to emerge.

USB Forum:  Talking Mergers


A combination of factors-high stock prices, declining revenue and the fear of
being left behind-helped create a robust market for bank mergers in 1995.  In
an effort to review the year's most significant developments, as well as peer
into the year ahead, U.S.  Banker assembled a crack team of investment bankers
for a thorough discussion about shareholder activism, hostile takeovers and
deal fatigue, to name only a few issues.  The participants were:  Robert A.
Baer Jr., Bear, Stearns & Co.; John Duffy, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods; Kathleen
M.  Fisher, J.P.  Morgan & Co.; J.  Christopher Flowers, Goldman, Sachs & Co.;
John C.  "Hans" Morris, Smith Barney; and Kendrick Wilson, Lazard Freres & Co.
The moderator was John W.  Milligan, editor-in-chief of U.S.  Banker.



USB:  Let's talk a little bit about why 1995 turned out to be such a great
market for bank mergers.  What were some of the things that drove the market?

DUFFY:  The first thing is maybe valuation; stock valuation led the acquirer
universe to be able to pay prices that a lot of the seller universe found
acceptable.  I think you also had a situation with a couple turnarounds where
maybe all of the fixing up had been done.  People like Midlantic, Shawmut and
First Fidelity probably fit that category.  So you had sellers; you had a
universe of people that were maybe not perceived to be sellers two years ago
that today were sellers for a new reason.

WILSON:  I think you might call it a revenue "crunch."  There aren't too many
institutions on their own looking at double-digit revenue growth.  Banks have
benefited from an improvement in credit quality and a steep yield curve, and
now it is tough to get revenue.  Also, many managers are saying, "I can't cut
my expenses any more, I might have to think about an acquisition."

FISHER:  An incredible confluence of events is encouraging merger activity.
Bank stocks are up 50% this year (1995) versus roughly 30% for the market, and
this clearly has made the banks feel well off in terms of their currency.  But
they look ahead and ask where revenue growth is going to come from.  And it is
an amazing dichotomy to have those conversations going on when the stock
prices look so favorable.  So why not use your currency to make an acquisition
now?  It is as good a time as any.  And the sellers appreciate that it is a
great time to sell at these prices, so they are selling.

BAER:  An additional reason is that shareholder activism is responsible for
specific deals; where Michael Price has gone into Chase Manhattan and Michigan
National and taken positions that led directly to those firms turning over.

USB:  Was Michael Price a phenomenon of one-specifically, his involvement with
Chase and whatever pressure he applied there-or does that happen more broadly,
but (in) situations that are not as public?

BAER:  If you look at the 13D filings, there has been-I don't know what the
number would be this year-but probably in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 that
had been filed with a letter attendant to that filing going to the board,
stating that, "We think you should research your various alternatives to
increase shareholder value, including the sale of the bank."  It is not just
Michael, there are several groups out there.



USB:  How many of those situations yielded something similar to what happened
with Chase?

BAER:  I can't think of one of them that so far in 1995 has resulted in the
decision by the institution to sell.

MORRIS:  I think more than the specific cause and effect of a single
shareholder, it is more an aura in the defensiveness of the company that it
creates.  Good management teams are more credible, and the more credible you
are, the less you really care about what any particular shareholder suggests
you should do.  I think many people would say that whether Michael Price
caused the sale of Chase into Chemical is not as much of an issue as whether
it clearly changed the overall tempo and framework in which Chase had to make
decisions.

FISHER:  Shareholder activism has also heightened the sensitivity levels of
directors, and there is now a significant increase in the activism of
directors in many of these situations versus the past.

BAER:  That is important.  The Bank of Boston is an extreme case of where
directors seemingly took the place of management for a while.  I think there
has been a number of examples which have not gone that far, but certainly the
directors are tenfold more involved on a daily basis than they had been in the
past.



USB:  If you are representing a bank that may feel vulnerable to an offer from
another institution, perhaps because it has hit its own revenue wall, and yet
is not ready to surrender its independence, how do you counsel the CEO?  What
is that CEO's obligation when it comes to entertaining a merger offer?

MORRIS:  First off, what is the strategy of the bank?  If you don't have a
plan, you really don't have any reason to think that you can earn a reasonable
return for your shareholders.  Further, you will be forgoing a potential
takeover premium.  I think it is not responsible for a management team to say
we just want an investment banker to defend our position, even though we don't
have a good plan for what to do about it.  The first thing is helping them
sort out strategies of what they can do about this position.

There is a lot of current discussion about that very issue, in terms of what
we mean by the revenue wall and how banks are looking at branches and how they
should be speaking about expenses and efficiencies.  For a long time, banks
had a model that they felt that they could aim towards, and get down to their
peer group in efficiency, and they could adequately manage their
non-performing assets and manage their capital and buy back stock.  It is
clear that you have to go beyond that and have a better plan than your
competitors to be attractive to the market.



USB:  If you have the plan but haven't accomplished it yet, what are you
required to do in terms of reviewing an offer and so on?

MORRIS:  If you have a plan, and you have a good plan, you are not required to
do anything.  You are required to carefully consider things and listen to bona
fide offers.  Ultimately it is the credibility of management and the
confidence that you can create with your own directors and with your ultimate
shareholders-and your ability to execute-that is going to decide whether you
have support for your stock and support to continue to execute that plan.

DUFFY:  Hans is right.  The board needs to be educated in terms of how the
plan will create value for the shareholders.  Otherwise, anybody that walks in
the door with a premium over market could be viewed as legitimate.

WILSON:  Obviously, a plan is important, but if you don't have a good offense,
your defense will be under a lot of pressure.  I think there is no substitute
for frequent and ongoing communication with your shareholders.  A track record
helps.  I think having a board that is well-informed and supportive is key.
This is very important, because many of these activist investors are not shy
about using their telephones or fax machines to contact directors.  There have
been several instances where management with credibility and a good story have
defeated well-organized attacks.  All things being equal, in our experience
management starts with a leg up if they are credible and prepared.



USB:  If you wait until you are under pressure and vulnerable, that is a lousy
time to decide that you need to communicate better with shareholders.

FLOWERS:  Several companies have successfully formulated new plans after
receiving offers.  You might say-in fact I think you would say-it would be
smarter to do it in advance.  That doesn't seem to be necessary.  You asked
what does the company do that has single-digit revenue growth.  One thing
everybody all over the place is doing is buying back their stock in large
quantities and adding two or three percentage points to their growth rate.
That appears to have been a very successful strategy and makes a lot of sense,
I guess.  We will find out.  Maybe they are paying too much for the stock, and
they could have bought it back for less later.  Right now, it seems to make
sense.

The other comment I would make is I think in responding to offers and thinking
about the whole arena, boards and managements have become much more attuned to
the quality of what they are getting.  I don't know if anybody remembers five
or three years ago, I found much more focus on just pure dollars.



USB:  There was at one point this year, and I guess it would have been July or
August, when a series of deals were announced.  It almost seemed like a
frenzy.  What accounted for that?

FLOWERS:  Two factors.  One is, not only the high stock price, but also the
fact that they declined precipitously early in 1995 and then bounced back, and
resulted in managements and boards realizing that it may not be forever that
they can choose their options.  They have to do this at a time when share
prices are high, and that isn't always the case.  And it went through a brief
period where a lot of the options were eliminated and they came back and they
said, "We better get on with this."  The second thing is, I do think there is
a bit of a situation where Party A does a deal and Party B says, "If they did
it, then I will too," and so forth.  For one thing, it makes it more
respectable if your next-door neighbor sells out.

WILSON:  There are two other issues to think about.  First, management
succession can be a factor in deals, particularly among boards where you have
had a very effective and strong CEO who is near retirement with no one
designated as his successor.  A second factor is that many management teams
have equity packages that are worth a lot of money now, as well as severance
arrangements that compensate them for a change of control.

MORRIS:  In some sense, the seminal transaction was First Fidelity in that
light, because here you had someone (Anthony Terracciano) who was not the
typical old CEO, and one who had a lot of institutional credibility.  He was
well-regarded by his peers and well-regarded by the Wall Street analysts, and
he had done extremely well managing that institution.  He laid out in a very
articulate way what his thinking was in deciding to approach a couple of
institutions in a sale, and that led to other boards of directors, and often
individual directors, to call their CEO and ask, "What do we think about
that?"

Frankly, the fundamental facts of the industry are still before us.  There is
revenue growth which is at best five percent for the industry, and you have
some very challenging decisions that need to be made about commitments to
different types of infrastructure, and it is not easy.  And if you have
someone who is a leader like Tony Terracciano coming to the same conclusion, I
think that made it easier for others to go along.  And I don't necessarily
think of this as a cop-out, but it sort of led to a series of discussions
among all banks, which accelerated the trend.

DUFFY:  I think every transaction has an impact on other people's options, and
sometimes they result in fewer options to the remaining institutions, and it
forces them to accelerate their thinking.  Maybe they knew they were going to
sell the institution within the next three years, but all of a sudden one of
their potential partners has just done a deal which precludes the combination
of the two of them.  He now has only two potential partners left.  He would
rather be in the position of negotiating or having an option with two of them
rather than having just one person left on the dance floor.



USB:  The fundamental factors that we have talked about vis-a-vis 1995-a
revenue wall, strong currency, sound asset quality-they all seem to still be
in place today.  What would you anticipate in terms of 1996?

BAER:  I think one thing that will force people to rethink their future is
that many of the companies in the last few years have focused on cost-cutting.
But to the extent that savings have been derived, it is not a recurring
source.  As banks reach the end of their cost-cutting, they have to look
elsewhere for revenue.  I think the banks then have to go back to basics and
ask, "How will we get the revenue up again?"  That is forcing them to turn to
acquisitions as a way to increase revenue.  So, if things stay in place, if
the market remains strong and the P/Es stay high for the acquirers, I think
you will see a continuation of this.

FLOWERS:  I sense a fair amount of deal fatigue out there.  I think with the
huge deals, it is hard to do more than one at a time.  One thing we will see
is people assimilating some of the very large transactions before moving on to
the next one.  That doesn't take that long.  I mean, nine months or a year
later the whole world could change.  In the short run, it will affect the
market.

BAER:  That is exactly right for the bigger deals.  This year we have had far
fewer numerical deals than last year or even the year before.  I don't think
there is the same deal fatigue at the smaller institutions, and I believe we
will probably see in 1996 more smaller transactions rather than larger
transactions.



USB:  Deal fatigue:  Chris, is that a reason why it seems that in the last two
or three months (deal) volume has really flattened out?

FLOWERS:  I think that is some of it.  There are a certain number of potential
deals, and we went into it, we used a lot of that in 1995, and I think there
will be somewhat less until everybody reloads.

MORRIS:  I sense that a pricing discrepancy has begun to emerge.  You have
seen some very high prices get paid on a price-to-book basis, and that has led
to higher expectations on the part of sellers, and yet at the same time, I
think lower expectations on the part of buyers, which could be a function of
deal fatigue, but also a sense of uncertainty about how to value
infrastructure systems.  However, the seller's expectations have not evolved
at all.  Five percent revenue growth and larger provisions coming in 1996-and
we see evidence of that all over the place-is inconsistent with some of these
valuations.  I think that you will have some significant discrepancies emerge.



USB:  There were several deals this year that were priced a little bit north
of two times book, and involved some fairly significant dilution.  Were buyers
finally cooled off by shareholders who weren't anxious to see them pay quite
that much for deals?

BAER:  The marketplace actually let them get away with it, by and large.

DUFFY:  It has been pretty tolerant.

BAER:  Three years ago, maybe we would think three percent dilution and earn
out in a year and a half or something, and that is comfortable.  We are in a
stage far beyond that with a lot of transactions.  I am just a little
astounded that the market has been acquiescent of the banks taking the stand
that they have got a birthright to do one large strategic deal.  I don't think
that same tolerance would have been there three or four years ago.

FISHER:  Investors have generally been favorably disposed toward bank
acquisitions this year.  Many of the stocks of the acquirors have bumped back
to their preexisting prices eight or ten days or less after an acquisition is
announced.  The market has been quite willing to believe that projected
savings are achievable.



USB:  Would each of you tell me what you think the most significant deal in
1995 has been so far, and why?

WILSON:  I think the situation involving First Interstate (which is being
pursued in a hostile takeover by Wells Fargo & Co.)  subsumes virtually all of
the elements that we have been talking about.  I think it is a long way from
over.  It could be a precursor of some additional activity, and I think will
certainly bring to the floor all of the issues that we talked about in terms
of shareholder activism.  I think that is an extremely significant
transaction.

FISHER:  I have to agree with that.  Certainly when looking back several years
from now, this deal will be memorable because it is big and dramatic.  And
maybe we can even hypothesize that one of the reasons there is a bit of a
pause in the market now is that all of the banks are watching to see how this
transaction unfolds, because it does have a lot of precedent-setting aspects
to it.  But I think we can't give short shrift to all of the other large deals
that were done this year, because each one of them did set new precedents.
The Chase and Chemical merger certainly should be looked upon as an
extraordinary transaction in the U.S.

MORRIS:  I already (noted) one earlier, so I will add First Chicago and NBD to
my list.  When it happened, it kind of refocused many of us on the
opportunities of mergers of equals.  The recent transactions leading up to
that deal indicated that there was tremendous investor pressure on an
institution to sell out at a premium.  And the fact that First Chicago and NBD
were able to convince investors on the value, balance street restructuring and
business line benefits of the combination, led to an immediate improved
valuation for both companies' stocks.  That was very significant, compared to
the transactions that were leading up to it.

DUFFY:  I agree with Kenny that First Interstate stole the limelight from the
rest of the sector, for at least the time being, and it has implications.  I
think First Fidelity was kind of interesting in that it was the first big
interregional deal, and that was kind of like the dam breaking a little bit.
One that probably may not be mentioned was Fleet/Shawmut in terms of the
market dominance that it created in New England.  I don't think that you have
seen that in other places else yet.  In the Midwest or Southeast, it is still
pretty fragmented.

FLOWERS:  I think since we have run out of significant deals, I will suggest
the company that got the luckiest this year.  I will offer up United Counties
Trust Co., which managed to get a double dip and was acquired first by
Meridian and then by CoreStates.

BAER:  That was not strategic.

FLOWERS:  That was luck.

BAER:  If it is one deal, it is First Interstate.  It easily is something that
none of us have seen on that scale before, and/or complexity.  And I think
what's going to be very interesting is the way politics has entered into this
transaction, because we have grown into a situation realizing that we have an
inefficient banking system, and the economics are driving the system to
consolidate to make it more efficient.  We now have politicians who are trying
to keep the inefficiencies for political votes.

We have already got politics starting to enter into the First Interstate
transaction.  It is such a public forum, it will be an ideal place for the
politicians to continue to play.  I think it will be interesting to see how
politics ends up influencing the final transaction.



USB:  Would you expect to see banks continue to build their product
capabilities by doing more focused transactions, consumer finance being one?

BAER:  I think you would, if the banks could.  The difficulty is that the
mono-line companies, whether it is the B/C auto lenders or equity home lenders
today, sell for around 25 and 30 times earnings because there is such huge
growth potential.  But even the pure credit card companies, the pure finance
companies and other business lines that the banks would find very attractive
to enter through acquisition, are all selling at higher multiples than the
banks.  So it becomes a conundrum.  I think there is probably a high desire
and a low capability.



USB:  It makes you wonder about the future of the full-service,
brick-and-mortar bank if it doesn't find some way of taking all of those
product capabilities and tying them together to add value.

DUFFY:  I think we are in the bottom of the third inning, and some people are
talking like it is the eighth inning.  And you look at the Chase/Chemical pro
forma market cap, and it is $20-odd billion.  I mean, supposing tomorrow
Merrill Lynch decided that they wanted to sell-who could they sell to?
Probably a bank.  Banks don't have the P/E today, but I think they have the
cumulative market cap to be a player.  They have consistently lost market
share to the more innovative players, whether it is a mortgage bank or asset
management company or auto finance company, but a bank winds up acquiring them
at some point later in the cycle.

While the market share of the banks has declined dramatically over the past 10
years, the market cap of the industry still (overshadows) most of the
competition.  I think the industry is not dead, and some of the more
progressive players are starting to surface as giant financial intermediaries.
I don't know who the ultimate winners will be.  I think it is still pretty
early in the game.

Retail Banking:  Ringing Up New Customers


Large and brightly decorated, the sign in the Safeway supermarket had a
simple, but symbolic message:  "Now Hiring Bright, Motivated People Our
Customers Will Like."  Interestingly enough, it could serve equally well as a
recruiting poster for any bank that is beginning to open new branches in
retail establishments like supermarkets.

Such signs clearly underscore an attitude bankers are adopting as they embrace
customers on their own turf-in stores where they do the weekly shopping.
Chasing new customers in this ever-changing, highly competitive marketplace
requires new marketing skills, shedding the stodginess and acting like
retailers.

While in-store banking isn't a new phenomenon, it is a fast-growing trend that
clearly has bankers excited.  Community banks, superregionals and even thrifts
are embracing the idea.

Many are staking out prime locations, hoping to gain an advantage over
competitors, while others are developing branches in areas where they didn't
have a banking presence.  While supermarkets have historically made good
partners, they aren't the only homes for in-store branches.  General
merchandise stores like Kmart and Wal-Mart are quickly becoming good locations
as well.

In 1995, the nation's largest banks accelerated their efforts.  Wells Fargo &
Co., BankAmerica Corp., Union Bank, BayBanks Inc., Barnett Banks Inc.,
National City Corp.  and First State Bank all expanded their operations.

The in-store movement has produced more than 3,000 branches, and many more
ribbon-cutting ceremonies are planned for this year.  National Commerce
Services, a Memphis-based consulting arm of National Commerce Bancorp.,
forecasts as many as 5,000 branches by the year 2000.

"Banks are looking for alternative distribution networks," explains Kathleen
Holmes, managing director of the Wharton Financial Institutions Center in
Philadelphia.  "They're doing it for strategic reasons.  Some are entering new
markets.  Others are opening branches where the local market isn't strong
enough to support a traditional branch."

Proponents believe the rewards make the venture worthwhile.  "An in-store
branch can be more profitable quicker than a brick-and-mortar branch."
explains John W.  Garnett, president of International Banking Technologies, in
Norcross, GA.  "There are lower startup costs, a captive audience-a majority
of whom are not already customers."

For example, studies reveal that store branches are less expensive to build
and often become profitable much sooner than traditional branches.
Supermarket branches cost $150,000 to $200,000 to install, while the tab for
traditional branches ranges between $800,000 and $3 million.  Once in
operation, they are also quicker to yield profits.  "In-store branches should
break even in about 18 months," contends NCS president Douglas W.  Ferris Jr.
"If they are not breaking even in two-and-a-half years, something is wrong.
It usually takes a traditional branch about three years to become profitable."

In the '80s, success came easily for the supermarket pioneers.  With access to
30,000 to 60,000 weekly supermarket customers, they attracted new prospects
much faster than traditional branches.  Customers embraced the concept.
One-stop convenience, services that surpassed those of the automated teller
machines and interactive relationships with live tellers were the drawing
cards.  Customers marveled at the thought of applying for a car loan while
completing their weekly grocery shopping.

And sometimes a bank really hits the jackpot.  One elderly gentleman opened a
$1 million savings account at a southern supermarket branch because he felt
safer.  "In a supermarket, a person walking out with groceries doesn't expose
themselves.  No one knows that they've cashed their check.  It's not uncommon
to see customers open very large accounts at supermarket branches," explains
Garnett.

For many, the benefits continue.  Throughout the country, supermarket bankers
report impressive financial results.  Many produced spectacular revenues
during their first few months of operation.  In Memphis, the Tri-State Bank
proudly touts how it opened 1,155 new deposit accounts during the first
quarter of '95.  Twelve hundred miles away in North Dakota, the First National
Bank's Hugo branch celebrated its 288th new account.

But the novelty has pretty much worn off, and customers want more than mere
convenience.  And there have been some failures.  Banks that entered a local
grocery store without studying the local demographics or developing a
strategic plan for serving that customer base generally have not done as well.
"Some banks have (treated) them like a branch, but they don't work like a
traditional branch," notes Holmes.  "They are more like a community bank.  You
have a closed community, so your capacity to the market is more like that of a
community bank."

Success begins with knowing the difference between supermarket and
brick-and-mortar branches.

"The key to success is in hiring the right staff," explains Garnett.  "You
also must have frequent marketing and promotional programs, as well as
streamlining operations and freeing up people to go out into the aisles and
sell."

The People's Bank of Connecticut grasped that concept a few years ago.  Today,
it operates 45 branches in Stop 'N Shop stores and plans another 46 by the end
of next year.

"You have to change your thinking," suggests Bryan Huebner, senior vice
president with the human resources and strategic planning unit for the bank.
"You have to advertise, market and sell, Huebner says.  "That requires
employees who are experts in our products.  They must understand how the
products serve the needs of our customers.  We also need employees who know
that the real game is talking to as many customers as possible."

BankAmerica launched its first in-store branch 10 years ago.  As an industry
leader with more than 180 in-store branches, the San Francisco-based giant
foresees future success through further expansion into the supermarket arena.

"To capitalize, you have to do things differently," cautions William G.
Raymond, senior vice president for retail distribution at BankAmerica.  "You
need to hire different kinds of people.  You need to train differently.  You
have to set different goals and you need different operating practices.

"One of the keys to success is getting out into the aisles and meeting
prospects," he explains.  "That's not something that many traditional bankers
feel comfortable doing.  We like to have people who are not specialized
tellers or sellers.  You need people who can do many things."

Raymond believes banks should train their sales force to act more like their
store colleagues and maintain a quality relationship with their host grocer.
Such mundane, non-banking chores as knowing how to operate the public address
system and learning the location of store merchandise are also important.  For
instance, it might not be a bad idea to know where various items are located
in the store-just in case a customer happens to ask.

Learning how to read body language is another important skill.  "You should
know when the customer wants to be bothered and how long you hold their
attention," he explains.

Supermarket bankers may want to provide the same products and services as a
conventional branch, but they have to work quicker.  "Because customers don't
want to stand in your lines long and don't have much time, you have to be able
to open checking accounts in five minutes.  You have to be able to provide
them with quick loan approvals," Ferris explains.

Technology:  EDS Nabs a Customer at Alltel's Expense


By signing a seven-year check-processing contract with EDS Corp., Republic
National Bank of New York gave Alltel Corp.  the cold shoulder.

Alltel had already sold most of its check-processing business to Fiserv Inc.,
but it held on to its account with Republic, which dated back to 1993.  The
Little Rock, AR, company, formerly known as Systematics, put its check unit on
the block early this year after it took a $32-million write-off from a failed
investment in imaging technology.

Fiserv executive vice president Dean Schmelzer would not disclose the amount
his firm paid for Alltel's check business, although an EDS executive put the
value of his firm's business with Republic at $40 million.  When looked at
together, the two transactions make it clear that the check outsourcing
business has boiled down to a two-way competition between EDS and Fiserv.
There are other players in this market, including Transys, which is part of
CoreStates Financial Corp., and the Global Processing Alliance, a joint
venture between Bankers Trust New York Corp.  and First Fidelity Bancorp.  But
EDS and Fiserv have been the most aggressive at signing up new customers.

That aggression is partly driven by a desire to build volume and generate
economies of scale.  EDS and Fiserv both seem intent on gaining a large enough
client base to make imaging technology cost-effective.

"We've made a commitment to provide image capability to our clients," says
Schmelzer.  But in order to make it work, "you've to have the volume."

Alltel's inability to deploy image technology successfully isn't discouraging
either EDS or Fiserv from going ahead with their own plans to use imaging,
although both data-processing companies will move forward slowly.  It will be
at least a year before EDS converts Republic to imaging.  For the time being,
EDS will process the New York bank's checks using conventional technology.
Two California thrifts for which EDS does item processing, Great Western
Financial Corp.  and First Nationwide, will be converted to imaging much
sooner, but they have been EDS customers for several years.

The problems Alltel ran into make it clear that imaging technology is far more
complicated than has been acknowledged, but EDS is still confident it will
avoid the same mishaps because it is working closely with IBM Corp.  to modify
that supplier's system to its own needs.  The Dallas company is taking an
approach that lets it avoid redesigning its check operations from top to
bottom, which is what most imaging installations have called for until now,
says Dan Talbott, EDS' vice president for its check operations.

Most of EDS' current check-processing system will remain intact, apart from an
imaging camera that will be inserted into the middle of the operation.  The
data sent to the mainframe that manages the check shop will look essentially
the same as it does with a system running conventional technology.

"What we're doing allows us to leverage our existing platform," Talbott says.

If done according to plan, imaging technology will help both firms reduce
their costs, says Fiserv's Schmelzer.  In the hotly competitive outsourcing
business, survival is quickly becoming dependent upon being a low-cost
provider.


A Small Shift Away From Big Business

There's been a modest but meaningful increase in the percentage of banks' cash
management revenue stemming from small business customers, according to the
latest cash management survey from Ernst & Young.

Some 17% of the proceeds in cash management-where banks manage corporations'
direct deposit, wire transfer and accounts payable and receivable-came from
small businesses in 1994, up slightly from 15% in 1993.

Large corporate customers still accounted for a significant plurality of cash
management revenue, about 38%, but that figure is off from the 44% they
contributed in 1993.

To some extent, this increase could have been anticipated.  In recent years,
Fortune 500 firms and other large bank customers have sharply reduced the
number of banks from which they purchase cash management services, according
to Larry Forman, a manager with Ernst & Young.  On the other hand, banks have
increased the number of products suited for their small business clients.

"Small business has become an important segment," Forman says.

This shift is even more pronounced for mid-sized regionals and smaller banks,
where small business customers contribute 29% of cash management revenue.  For
the largest regional and money center banks, small businesses only account for
7% of cash management.  These big banks are still heavily dependent upon the
biggest corporate accounts, getting some 46% of their cash management revenue
from them.  But even for them, that figure is down.  In last year's survey,
the industry's behemoths garnered some 50% of their revenue from their largest
accounts.

The greater dependence on small businesses helps explain why so many banks
have rushed into the market with cash management software, according to Linda
Vanadis, an assistant vice president with Boatmen's Bancshares Inc.  The
$32-billion-asset St.  Louis regional company is one of several banks that has
begun marketing a personal computer-based cash management software program in
the last few years.

Vanadis says that many small business clients have bought PCs already loaded
with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows for their accounting and other business
functions, and many banks have decided that if they are to serve this market,
they must sell a cash management system that runs on Windows.

Networks' Age And Size Cut Debit Card Fees

The largest debit card networks also have some of the lowest fees, according
to the latest data book from Debit Card News, a Faulkner & Gray publication.

Interlink, the debit card network owned by Visa International, not only
processes 15 million transactions a month, which is by far the largest number
of any network, it also charges a switch fee of only 3 cents a transaction.
By comparison, Explore, the next largest network that is owned by the West
Coast automated teller network, Star System Inc.  of San Diego, charges 5
cents.  Most of the other large regional networks charge roughly 5 cents to 8
cents per transaction.

"The older the programs are, the more the fees have come down," says Art
Clark, a partner with Business Dynamics, a consulting firm in Nyack, NY.
"It's a function of cost and market pressure.  There's just no way that a POS
transaction can carry the same cost" as a check or cash transaction.  About
the only way to entice retailers into accepting debit transactions is to make
electronic payments less expensive than paper ones.

The West Coast was one of the first markets where debit cards were widely
used, and the networks with a heavy concentration of accounts there, Interlink
and Explore, have the lowest fees.  By comparison, networks in the Midwest,
such as Cash Station and Magic Line, have some of the highest fees.  Their
home markets, Illinois and Michigan, were relative latecomers to the debit
card party, adopting this technology several years after the networks in
California and Texas.  Magic Line's switch fee is 13 cents, while Cash
Station's is 11 cents.


Fed Fills Its Technology Gaps

Now that the Federal Reserve System's massive computer system consolidation is
just about finished, the central bank's Automation Services group has shuffled
its organizational structure and hired a former KeyCorp executive as the first
chief information officer in its history.  He will supervise the nine
mainframes the Fed runs out of three data centers.

"In the first few years of FRAS (Federal Reserve Automation Services), there
was a focus on setting the organization up," says Robert Tucker, the Fed's new
senior vice president for computer operations and technical support.  Until
last fall, he had been an executive vice president for Key Services Corp.  in
Cleveland.

Prior to the formation of FRAS in 1992, each of the Fed's 12 district banks
had its own data center.  But the cost of maintaining them was very high, and
since the cost of long-distance telecommunications has dropped sharply, the
Fed closed nine of the existing centers and created three large ones in
Richmond, VA, where FRAS is headquartered; Dallas and East Rutherford, NJ.
Tucker, will report to Carl Powell, the Fed's director of automation
resources, until Powell retires later this year.

Two communications centers are also part of the FRAS network, one in Richmond
and another in Chicago.  There are four other groups within the FRAS
umbrella-support services, administrative services, national network services
and planning and customer support.

Big Changes At The FDIC

Don't look for business as usual at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., where
chairman Ricki Helfer is shaking things up bigtime.

First and foremost, the agency is shrinking-understandably so from
unrealistically high levels created during the last recession, when failures
were running at a near-record pace.  Helfer says that expenses were to be
trimmed 20% in 1995 and staffing was to be cut 14%; altogether, staff levels
will have fallen by more than a third from mid-1993.  She won't predict just
where core staffing will settle, but says "it will be far less" than it is
now.  In November, the agency announced a buyout program intended to spur 500
employees to leave voluntarily.

"I want to run the FDIC the way a business operates-by striving for greater
productivity and enhanced performance, by using rigorous cost/benefit analysis
and by relying on up-to-date management concepts and technology," Helfer told
the America's Community Bankers convention in a speech in late October.

In a subsequent interview, Helfer said she had brought the FDIC its first-ever
strategic and operating plans.  The first is a five-year plan; the latter,
which looks out 12 to 18 months, is more flexible and encompasses some 150
projects.  "We are viewing the familiar as if we had never seen it before,"
she said.

The chairman also noted that she is asking staffers to concentrate anew on the
ability to assess broad risk-not just clean up in its aftermath.  Too often
the agency has tended "to look at the trees (individual banks) and not the
forest," she argues, adding that it's critical to understand the impact of
state legislation, regional economic distinctions and rolling recessions.

Helfer cheered many in the ACB audience when she promised to reduce the
regulatory burden, especially that falling "disproportionately on smaller
institutions."  Time spent on examinations is dropping as the agency turns
more to computerization; she said that 10 hours have been trimmed off
compliance exams since last January, and five hours off Community Reinvestment
Act exams.

Not surprisingly, there are rumblings that agency morale is less than robust
as further job cuts loom.  But Helfer is marching ahead to an ambitious
refrain.  "We must," she says, "move from the New Deal into the new
millenium."


What Does Future Hold For The FHLBS?

Just what is the mission of the Federal Home Loan Bank System?  Most
knowledgeable people in Washington would say promoting housing finance.  But
the chairman of the Federal Housing Finance Board, which oversees the
FHLBanks, says that may not turn out to be its role, going forward.

Bruce Morrison, who became the FHFB chief last year, says a key role is to
provide "local credit availability in cases where that isn't necessarily
available"-in a community where deposits are scant, for instance.  Members of
the FHLB System routinely use it for advances for housing finance, as well as
for low-cost borrowings.

"I think the system would be likely to survive as it is, but it would be
under-utilized," he says.  Morrison argues that the system needs "regulatory
room to develop, and not a narrow blueprint from Congress."  But Republicans
in the House, in their budget-trimming zeal, have been eying
government-sponsored ventures like the FHLB System for an amputation, if not
outright execution.

Morrison contends that system membership should be fully voluntary-a notion
that pleases thrifts, many of whom have been mandatory members for many years,
carrying large FHLB balances as assets on their books.  Commercial banks,
however, have been admitted since 1989 as voluntary members, free to come and
go as they wish.

The FHFB chairman says the board is in the "bizarre position" of being both
regulator of the system and the statutory issuer of its debt, a position it's
trying to extricate itself from.  Meanwhile, the board has been working on
ways to delegate more management functions to the district banks.  "We'll set
the compliance standards, and they'll determine how" to reach those, he says.
A laudable goal.  Now we'll see if Congress goes along and spares the ax.

Getting Credit For Profits


The industry's strong profitability in recent years has done wonders for bank
balance sheets, not to mention credit ratings.  If you assigned a numerical
value to every rating on the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.  scale-one for
AAA, two for AA+ and so on-the average rating for a bank holding company in
the firm's universe in 1991 was 7.3, or between A- and BBB+.  This average had
improved to 6.3 (A/A-) by year-end 1993, and to 5.8 by the end of 1994-which
is a good solid A, leaning toward A+.

But the pace of upgrades has slowed dramatically since 1992 and 1993, explains
D&P group vice president Charles Orabutt.  D&P upgraded 24 banks in 1992, 15
in 1993 and only 12 last year.

Realistically, industry balance sheets may be as strong as they're going to
get.  A great many institutions are over-reserved for loan losses, and some of
them have so much excess capital that they've been buying back stock (U.S.
Banker, January 1995).  Any further improvements in credit ratings will
probably come from the earnings side, which is where Orabutt and his band of
bank debt analysts have turned their attention for now.  "We're really
focusing on business line profitability," he says.  "That's the linchpin to
further rating upgrades."

What businesses does D&P like?  It's keen on consumer lending because it tends
to have higher margins, although Orabutt cautions that banks need to have the
right controls in place, since too many of them still try to grow at a 10%
rate when the economy only offers 5%.  Orabutt also favors
technology-intensive, fee-based businesses like check clearing and payments
processing.  And for all the bad press that derivatives have garnered of late,
he figures that providing risk management products to end users will also be a
winner.

ATM USAGE EXPLODES IN '95


Transaction volume on automated teller machines nationwide shot up 14.6% for a
12-month period ending in September 1995, compared to 9.7% in 1994 and only
6.9% in 1993.  The deployment of ATMs also grew 11.3% for the year, and while
this was down from 15% in 1994, it was still the second best performance in a
decade.  The gold medal, however, goes to point of sale:  transaction volume
increased by 37%, while the number of terminals expanded by 47%.  These were
among the findings of an annual survey of the electronic funds transfer
industry conducted by Bank Network News, a twice-monthly newsletter published
by Faulkner & Gray Inc.

Many of the leading ATM networks also posted strong volume gains.  The
country's largest network-Star System-reported a 26.4% gain in transactions
for the 12-month period.

Among the factors cited for the strong growth in overall ATM volume was the
strong likelihood that ATM and POS usage tend to feed one another.  "The
consumer says, 'This card will do everything,'" Tom Bass, president of
Washington-based Exchange network told Bank Network News.  Another possibility
is that a sharp increase in the number of off-premise ATMs is driving the
growth in those transactions.

Internet Security:  The Saga Continues


They may get along with each other about as well as House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and President Clinton, but it seems that Visa International and
MasterCard International are once-again talking turkey about a common standard
for protecting payments over the Internet.

A September announcement that Visa and Microsoft Corp.  would cooperate in
designing a new standard-leaving MasterCard out in the cold-was apparently all
the result of a misunderstanding.  At least that's what the parties now say.

But it seems that at some point there was a disagreement over how the
suppliers of Internet security software would be compensated.  Microsoft was
said to have wanted 0.4% of the value of all card transactions made through
the Internet, according to a November story in USA Today.  The same piece also
alleged that Visa's members, outraged by Microsoft's asking price, forced the
card association back to the bargaining table with MasterCard.

But Microsoft never wanted to be paid on that basis, says Mark Kroese, its
director of electronic commerce; rather the software giant simply wants
royalties from software developers that write programs for Internet commerce.
This is the same source of revenue that IBM Corp., which is part of
MasterCard's camp, will seek.

Spokespeople for both card associations say they never really stopped
discussing the issue, but somehow Visa and Microsoft went ahead with
announcing their security standard without MasterCard's participation.  Back
in June, the associations had said they would announce a standard together.

"We never stopped talking, and we're optimistic about" a common standard, said
David Melancon, a Visa spokesman.  He also said Visa wouldn't pay Microsoft
any transaction fees over the long haul for the security standard, but it
might do so temporarily to cover some development costs.

Melancon also said that Visa was never that out of sync with its members.
"The feedback hasn't been 100% positive" he said, "but it's never 100%
positive on anything.  It's not like they made us do a 360 (degree turn)."

But William Randle, a senior vice president for Huntington Bancshares Inc.
Visa's electronic payments advisory board, says all 22 members of warned the
assdociation in the summer of 1994 not to pursue a relationship with
Microsoft.  Visa later changed the makeup of the board and transferred
responsibility for the board to its home banking subsidiary, Visa Interactive.

The Death Of Spread


Two years ago, bankers could make a pretty good living using cheap sources of
funding to invest in U.S.  Treasury securities.  They didn't have to lend to
get an adequate return; they could simply take cheap short-term funds and use
them to buy higher-yielding treasury bonds, while pocketing a nice spread.
And here was the real beauty of it all:  A U.S.  Treasury bond has no credit
risk (Washington's six-day shutdown in late mid-November over the budget
impasse notwithstanding).

Those days are long gone, of course.  Lenders have opened the credit spigot so
much since then-especially to consumers-that many people now fret they've been
too aggressive.  The spread game seems to have officially ended in mid-1995
when the yield curve-which is the difference between source of funds like Fed
funds or core deposits and the interest rate on investment securities like
treasuries-took on the appearance of a flat line.  Normally, the yield on
treasuries will be higher than the underlying cost of funds, and this margin
becomes more pronounced the further out you go on the investment spectrum,
since a 30-year bond pays a higher rate of interest than a two-year note.

Why did the yield curve flatten out?  The Federal Reserve started tightening
short-term rates in February 1994 and didn't stop until July 1995, when after
a long series of increases it finally cut rates by a modest 25 basis points.
Obviously, those increases put fierce pressure on margins from below.  At the
same time-and somewhat ironically-a generally optimistic view of inflation and
the economy helped bring down rates on long-term bonds, which squeezed margins
from above.

Theodore H.  Tung, Ph.D., chief economist at National City Corp., points out
that 30-year treasuries normally yield at least 1% more than two-year notes,
but that spread has now shrunk to 70 basis points.  "Even more unusual is the
recent disappearance of the spread between yields on two-year notes and the
Fed Funds rate," wrote Dr.  Tung in the November 1995 issue of Financial
Market Outlook, his monthly financial commentary.  "(This) spread has averaged
more than 1% over the past three years."

A flat yield curve is bad news for banks-or at least for their investments in
securities.  "Because the cost of funds is so high, there's no spread," Dr.
Tung explains.  And this largely explains why lenders became so much more
aggressive in 1995.  As the cost of funds went up, they had to turn to
higher-yielding loans instead.  "That's why you see the industry competing for
consumer loans-especially credit cards," he says.  Cards loans at, say, 10%
enable a lender to cover its funding costs and still make a profit.

"National Home Ownership Strategy:  Partners in the American Dream," an
amalgam of more than 50 housing organizations, continues to press toward its
goal of raising the national home ownership rate to 67.5% by 2000, from 64.7%
today.  Henry Cisneros, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, says the target rate would add eight million home owners in five
years.

Equifax, si.  The Mexican government has given the Atlanta-based credit
information company the go-ahead to create a consumer credit information
system that will offer on-line access to Mexican banks, retailers and
businesses.  Equifax, which had applied for permission last May, is already
operating in other Latin American nations such as Chile and Argentina.

Amerin Corp., the Chicago-based mortgage insurer that was the focus of a
December feature story ("Amerin Finds LPMI Isn't the Only Path"), completed
its initial public offering Nov.  29.  The stock quickly soared from its $16
offering price, hitting $27 by mid-December.  The company, which raised over
$213 million in the offering, called the response "a strong endorsement of the
concept of wholesale mortgage insurance."

You won't find many institutional investors crabbing about high CEO salaries,
according to a new study by Russell Reynolds Associates, the major recruiting
firm.  Fifty-six percent of those polled voted strongly against limiting such
pay, and nearly all respondents favored tying CEO compensation to company
performance-letting it ride up, untethered, as long as the corporation and its
stockholders are going with it.

Now accepting the American Express card is that most blue-collar of retail
outlets, Wal-Mart.  AmEx claimed in a news release that more than 14,000
cardholders had written or phoned in 1995 to urge an acceptance agreement with
the world's largest retailer.  Convenience aside, the deal is one more sign
that the elite image AmEx cultivated in the 1980s is giving way to something
more practical.

Branch Sales:  Branches:  There's Still a Market


Sanford Belden is one of those bankers who, with good reason, has every right
to call the industry's staid, familiar brick-and-mortar outposts more trouble
than their worth.

Belden, who is president and chief executive of Community Bank System Inc.  in
Syracuse, NY, had his plans to make the three-hour drive west to his branch in
the hamlet of Olean shredded by the early December storm that dumped three
feet of snow on Buffalo.  That would be enough to convince anyone that it's a
lot easier to bank electronically than in person.  Yet Belden remains devoted
to the 49 branches his company owns in small towns along the rural northern
and western fringes of New York State.

"Having the physical geographic presence is key to our strategy," Belden says.
"We'll look at enhanced ATMs, and we'll look at PC banking.  We view the
alternative delivery as a constructive adjunct to what we do in the branches,
but we think the branch remains the focus of our strategy."

Having a strategy focused on conventional branches was the main reason
Community Bank picked up 17 branches holding $450 million in deposits from
Chase Manhattan Corp.  last July.  A few months later, the $1.1-billion-asset
Syracuse-based company sold three of those branches to NBT Inc., a banking
company in Norwich, NY.  Those offices were in Utica, which is well east of
Community's geographic market.

Of course, central New York state was hardly the only corner of the country
where branches were traded like so much horseflesh.  Plenty of banks large and
small were active in the branch sale business, and few, if any, of them could
be described as iconoclasts swimming against the electronic banking tide, in
which increasing waves of transactions are being done by personal computer,
automated teller and even the Internet.

Rather, they described strategies that were very similar to Belden's-using
ATMs, telephones and PCs to offload most simple transactions like deposits,
withdrawals and balance transfers.  That leaves branches, and branch
personnel, available for the personal attention and the sales pitches that can
increase revenue.

All told, there were some $23 billion in deposits bought and sold in 1995,
according to U.S.  Banker's sixth annual ranking of branch sale advisory
firms.  Yet two-thirds of that total can be attributed to just one deal.  In
September, GreenPoint Financial Corp.  of Flushing, NY, purchased $8.1 billion
in deposits from H.F.  Ahmanson Corp.'s New York operations.  J.P.  Morgan
Co., which advised GreenPoint, and CS First Boston Corp., which advised
Ahmanson, each got credit for the full value of the deposits, and as a result
shared first place.  Without that exchange, there would have been only $6.7
billion in branch deposits changing hands.  In both 1994 and 1993, about $7.5
billion in deposits were bought and sold.

Different Climate

The last three years have been much tamer than the gold rush period of 1990
and 1991, when the Resolution Trust Corp.  was unloading thrift branches by
the truckload.  Now that the RTC is for all practical purposes defunct, branch
sales seem to be returning to a more predictable level of activity.

Interestingly, while most banks are increasing their investments in electronic
services and many banks are shuttering branches, those branches that are put
on the block are commanding high prices.

In 1995, branch deposits generated a 7.3% premium, according to Hovde
Financial Inc., an investment banking firm in Washington.  The premium is the
percentage of deposits that a purchasing bank must pay the seller.  In 1994,
premiums were 5.3%, while from 1991 through 1993 they averaged only 2.6%.

The lure of retail branches has steadily increased in the last several years,
says Bill Boyan, a vice president at Hovde.  One big reason:  It is much
cheaper to buy an existing branch than to start one up de novo.  For example,
Fifth Third Bancorp., which first moved into Cleveland five years ago,
announced it would essentially double its Cleveland franchise once it closed
on its purchase of 28 branches from First Nationwide Bank, the San
Francisco-based thrift.

Cleveland is a mature market, and there are few available sites for new
branches.  "That factors into the premium," says Robert Niehaus, the executive
vice president who runs Fifth Third's affiliate banking groups.  In 1995,
Fifth Third paid just a shade over the industry norm, or about 8% for retail
deposits, Niehaus says.

Fifth Third was one of the busiest branch acquirers last year.  In addition to
the $17-billion-asset company's September announcement of its deal for the
First Nationwide offices, it also bought PNC Bank Corp.'s 12 Dayton branches
in May.  In October, it bought NBD Bancorp.'s 25 Ohio branches, and finally in
November, Fifth Third bought seven Banc One Corp.  branches in Cincinnati.

Niehaus justifies the purchases with reasoning that Community Bank's Belden
would find familiar.  "There are still a significant number of our customers
who want to do face-to-face banking, and secondly it allows us to cross-sell
products to our customers," Niehaus says.

Fifth Third's branch-buying spree underscores the notion that conventional
branches still have an articulated purpose.  Few banks are more committed to
electronic services than Fifth Third, yet it was willing to pay a premium for
branches in some selected markets.

This was also true for Huntington Bancshares Inc., which bought four branches
with $138 million in deposits from Banc One in Springfield, OH, a community of
70,000 people about midway between Dayton and Columbus.

"Is there still room for a full-service branch?"  Thomas Prendergast, a
Huntington senior vice president asks rhetorically.  "Sure there is."
Huntington, despite its development of eight "Huntington Access" branches that
rely almost completely upon ATMs and video kiosks, still has more than 340
conventional branches in Ohio and seven other states.

Complementary Methods

From Prendergast's point of view, the purchase of the four Banc One
branches-two of which were promptly closed upon the deal's completion-hardly
undermines Huntington's commitment to electronic banking.  Rather, each of
Huntington's means of reaching its clientele-whether it's through conventional
branches, the all-electronic branches, PC banking at home, phone banking or
ATMs-all complement one another.

Prendergast, who is the senior Huntington executive for the Springfield
market, simply sees the acquired branches as a means of giving more Huntington
customers more ways to reach the bank.  Now that the bank has six branches in
Springfield, it will open a seventh outlet this year.  This site will not be a
branch, however, but a drive-up ATM in a shopping mall.

The message that comes through all this buying and selling is that electronic
banking has its purpose, but so does the branch.  More importantly, not only
can the two co-exist, but managed intelligently, they can complement one
another.  Despite the growing importance of electronic banking, there are some
communities where the branch will likely remain the primary means of serving
customers.

For example, few states are as top-heavy with behemoth holding companies as
North Carolina.  In Charlotte, there are NationsBank Corp.  and First Union
Corp.  Then there's Winston-Salem, where Wachovia Corp.  and Southern National
Corp.  are based.  Most of them are also among the industry's technological
elite, with PC banking programs and smart card initiatives that regularly grab
headlines.

Yet Triangle Bancorp, an $800-million-asset Raleigh company that does all of
its business in the state, has carved out a nice niche for itself in the rural
communities east of Interstate 95.  For the most part, its larger competitors
do the bulk of their business out of North Carolina, and most of the in-state
business they do is based in the large cities in the state's middle and
western sectors-Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Durham and Greensboro.

Triangle bought four Raleigh branches with $55 million in deposits from First
Union, and it also purchased three NationsBank branches with deposits of $49
million in two small towns in the eastern part of North Carolina.

"The acquisitions have mostly filled gaps in our markets," says Debra Lee,
Triangle's chief financial officer.  "We still consider ourselves a community
bank, and there are a lot of people out there who still want to walk in and
see the place.  That's not saying we're going to open a branch on every
corner, but in our market, we think that's the way to go."

If the track record of the last several years is any indication, there will be
ample demand for branches in 1996.  Many of the outlets put up for sale were
the offspring of in-market mergers, where the selling bank looked to whittle
away some excess capacity once it had completed a major acquisition.  With the
completion of some very large in-market deals like Chase and Chemical Banking
Corp., Fleet Financial Group and Shawmut National Corp., First Chicago Corp.
and NBD, there should be an ample supply of branches in several markets around
the country.

In spite of the demand for some branches, that rapid flurry of consolidation
could create excess supply and cause premiums to fall.  Fifth Third's Niehaus
says he's already seen some evidence of that.

Despite the lower premiums, it seems there will still be plenty of buyers for
brick-and-mortar, no matter how out-of-date some people might consider them.
Old habits die hard-and that's as true for customers as it is for bankers.  As
Triangle's Lee says, "There are still a lot of people who want face-to-face
service."

Industry:  Does Mutuality Offer Longevity?


It's not always easy being a mutual institution, but some mutuals clearly
believe it affords them something important:  a future.

Consider what Staten Island Savings Bank, a large New York mutual, went
through last year when it set its sights on buying a small Staten Island
rival, Gateway State Bank.  The process was something like a dance, says CEO
Harry P.  Doherty-in reality, more like a lurching tango than a minuet.

When executives at the mutual first approached the New York State Banking
Department for approval to buy Gateway, a stock commercial bank, they got a
"you can't do that" reaction.  Pressed as to why not, Doherty relates,
department officials "called back a half-hour later" to say they couldn't find
anything in the statutes to stop it, but a mutual buying a stock company just
"had never been done before."

The deal did get done at 1.5 times book, adding about $300 million to the
savings bank's asset base, now $1.7 billion.  Doherty says some Gateway
stockholders were perplexed that they'd be getting cash and not stock-in fact,
a few even asked if the closing could be delayed past Jan.  1 for tax reasons.
It wasn't.

Doherty insists SISB plans to remain a mutual.  As a stock institution, "we
wouldn't last long," he says, alluding to "the life expectancy of a mayfly."
For those who aren't fisherman or entomologists, the adult mayfly usually
expires within 48 hours.  An exaggeration, perhaps, but worth noting.

Commentary/ Trust:  Preparing for The Prudent Investor Rule


The law of investment management for fiduciaries is in the midst of a major
revision.  The change is based on a revolution in financial theory which has
long been embraced by the markets, but until recently ignored by the law.

The Prudent Man Rule is gradually being replaced by a new statutory standard,
the Prudent Investor Rule.  The new rule is intended to free fiduciaries from
rigid and outdated investment practices and to allow them to use the full
array of tools available in the modern investment world for the selection and
management of an investment portfolio.

The cost of this freedom is a greater responsibility in the selection and
management of portfolios.  The fiduciary must make those selections that are
appropriate for each particular trust.  What is prudent for one trust may be
imprudent for another.  The new rule is liberating in many respects but more
demanding in others than the old rule.  The prudent fiduciary and its legal
advisers must therefore have a full understanding of the broad ramifications
of this revision.

The revision is intended to bring trust law into accordance with the practice
of the investment management industry generally, which has been shaped by four
decades of important academic research as to the optimal methods of investment
management.  These theories and insights are generally referred to as "modern
portfolio theory."  At least 11 states have enacted some version of the
Prudent Investor Rule, as shaped by the American Law Institute in its 1992
Restatement (Third) of Trusts, and the National Conference of Commissioners on
State Laws in its 1994 Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA).  They are:
California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Washington, New
York, Illinois and Florida.  It is expected that most other states will soon
move to this standard as well.

Modern Portfolio Theory

Two of the cornerstones of modern portfolio theory can be reduced to timeless
adages.  "Nothing ventured, nothing gained" emphasizes that the other side of
risk is reward.  The market offers bigger rewards (and penalties) for the
unknown than for predictability.  "Don't put all your eggs in one basket"
emphasizes the critical importance of diversification of investments.

Under modern portfolio theory, economists and sophisticated market
participants look at risk differently than the traditional prudent fiduciary
investor.  Risk is a recognition of the uncertainty of future values.  It is a
two-sided coin with an upside and a downside.

The theory assumes that all investors desire the highest possible level of
return while bearing the lowest amount of risk.  Economists assume a certain
baseline for risk-free investors-the return on U.S.  Government securities.
Since the Treasury rate can be had without risk, the market forces an
additional return for the assumption of risk beyond Treasury risk.  An
investor cannot beat this return unless he is willing to assume an additional
level of risk.  Risk appetites will vary according to the circumstances, but
no one gets rich investing at the risk-free Treasury rate.  While assuming
risk does not guarantee riches, it is the only means for an investor to
participate in market returns greater than the baseline.

Modern portfolio theory is concerned not with risk alone but with the
relationship between risk and reward.  Investors must inject an element of
risk into their investments in order to be successful.  Since the market
compensates investors for accepting greater risk, investors will therefore
search for those opportunities which offer the greatest reward relative to the
risk assumed.  While investors must accept the risk of a particular investment
in order to have the opportunity to gain the compensation for such risk, a
portfolio of diversified investments has less overall risk than a single
investment.  Diversification reduces the overall variability of the
performance-which is to say, risk-of an investment portfolio since investments
tend not to all react the same if selected to minimize covariance.

Covariance is the tendency of certain investments to behave the same.  A crash
of technology stocks is likely to drag down most technology stocks, just as
most technology stocks last fall benefited from a bull market.  A portfolio
composed of a mix of different investments will therefore be more diversified
than one which is concentrated in certain types of investments.  A portfolio
composed of Chrysler, General Motors and Ford will have more covariance than
one composed of Citicorp, General Electric and Coca-Cola.

The focus of modern portfolio theory, then, is on portfolio selection rather
than on individual asset selection.  Diversification is important both within
and across different types of assets.  Risk can be judged only within the
context of the whole portfolio.

The common law rule regarding investment by fiduciaries has historically been
quite restrictive.  Investment in common stocks by fiduciaries is a relatively
new development, having been viewed as per se imprudent until the 1940s.
Until that time fiduciaries were generally restricted by statute to "legal
lists" which specified permissible fixed- income investments.  The collapse of
bond values in the Depression led to the adoption of Prudent Man Rule statutes
in most states.

Interestingly, these statutes were based almost verbatim on the language of an
1830 Massachusetts case, Harvard College v.  Amory:  "In acquiring, investing,
reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing property for the
benefit of another, a fiduciary shall exercise the judgment and care, under
the circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion, and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to
speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds,
considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of their
capital."

While seemingly a timeless statement setting forth a flexible yet accountable
standard, Prudent Man Rule statutes were interpreted by the courts as actually
setting forth a Prudent Trustee standard, in the belief that a Prudent Man
would be justified in taking risks in his own investments that would be
inappropriate for a prudent fiduciary.  Caution and conservative selection of
investments became the hallmarks of the Prudent Man Rule.

The interpretations of the Prudent Man Rule statutes have no tolerance for
speculation.  The old rule emphasizes the duty to "preserve principal" at all
costs.  A loss of capital can have catastrophic consequences for a fiduciary.
A fiduciary can become a guarantor of risky investments, even if it picks many
more winners than losers.  Each investment is considered on its own merits,
without regard to the rest of the portfolio.  Broad categories of investments
are considered as imprudent per se.  A fiduciary investing in growth stocks,
start-ups, options and futures might face a surcharge action if those assets
depreciate.

Under the Prudent Man Rule, delegation of investment authority by a fiduciary
is generally forbidden.  Thus, even if a fiduciary is selected for good
relationship reasons rather than for investment expertise, the fiduciary is
personally responsible for all investment decisions, regardless of his level
of expertise-although he is free to seek advice.

The Prudent Investor Rule

As modern portfolio theory became almost universally accepted in economics and
investment management, the law lagged behind.  In acknowledgement of this
problem, the trust bar began a comprehensive review process that resulted in
the Prudent Investor Rule.  The objective was to articulate a standard which
allows various sound investment strategies, yet is flexible enough to adapt to
the inevitable changes in the markets.  It also imposes a meaningful duty of
prudence and care on fiduciaries, forcing them to take steps to serve the
interests of settlors and beneficiaries rather than relying on traditional
investment practices that had as a principal benefit a safe harbor from
liability for the fiduciary.  Interestingly, the Prudent Investor Rule is in
many ways a return to the flexible standard of the original Harvard College
rule.

The heart of the Prudent Investor Rule is a focus on the portfolio as a whole
rather than on specific investments.  The rule recognizes that the key job of
the fiduciary is to determine the tradeoff between risk and return necessary
to realize the trust objectives.  The rule abolishes categoric restrictions
and disavows the emphasis in prior law on avoiding "speculative" or "risky"
investments.  Delegation is permitted, even encouraged.

The Prudent Investor Rule is a standard of conduct.  Liability is not based on
the performance of investments if the fiduciary takes informed and thorough
actions in its investment selection.  It is process-oriented rather than
result-oriented.  In this sense it is somewhat similar to the business
judgment rule of corporate law.  A process-oriented rule puts a continuous
burden on the fiduciary, who can no longer rely on rules of thumb.  The
fiduciary must analyze each situation and make a decision which is prudent
under the circumstances.  Under the Prudent Investor Rule, there is very
little that is per se prudent or imprudent.  The rule does not, however,
abandon trust law's favor of conservative investing.  It does, however,
require a fiduciary to justify whatever investments it makes, whether in
Treasury bills or derivatives.

The major points of the Prudent Investor Rule statutes are as follows:

* The standard of prudence applies to the trust as a whole rather than
individual investments, with a realization that particular investments that
would have been seen as surchargeable speculations under old law may be
sensible, perhaps even risk-reducing additions to a portfolio viewed as a
whole.  * The overall investment strategy should be based upon risk-and-reward
objectives suitable for the trust.  These objectives will vary widely,
depending on the circumstances in each trust arrangement.  * There is a duty
to diversify unless the fiduciary reasonably determines that it is in the
interests of the beneficiaries not to diversify, taking into account the
purposes and terms of the governing instrument.  * No particular investment is
inherently prudent or imprudent.  * No special status is accorded to original
investments received by the fiduciary, and the fiduciary must review them
within a reasonable time of receipt.  * Delegation is permitted, encouraged
and in some cases required.  The Prudent Investor Rule reverses the Prudent
Man Rule's anti-delegation bias.

Impact on Trust Departments

In many respects, the new rule will not change the decision-making process of
most bank trust departments when determining investments.  Most place
significant emphasis on the diversity of assets in the trust portfolio and try
to balance growth and yield to make their investments meet the needs of all
the trust's beneficiaries.  And most understand that their care in the process
of making choices-and not the actual performance of the assets chosen-is the
basis on which they will be judged.  Furthermore, trust departments are
already familiar with provisions of the Prudent Man Rule statutes that hold
the professional trustee to a higher standard of skill than the
non-professional, a concept carried over to the Prudent Investor Rule as well.

Nevertheless, the Prudent Investor Rule, because of its emphasis on the
portfolio as a whole and on the interplay between risk and reward, is a more
dynamic standard and requires consideration of more factors in making
investment choices.  The fiduciary must determine an investment strategy for
the entire trust portfolio, and be able to justify and document both the
reasonableness of that strategy and the prudence of each investment in light
of that strategy.  The strategy, furthermore, must protect the real value, as
opposed to the historic value, of the trust principal while providing for a
suitable return for the income beneficiary.  As a result, the strategy will
necessarily change over time, depending on changes in the economy, individual
investments and the needs and resources of the trust's beneficiaries.

To ensure that the necessary work has been done to review all the relevant
considerations, trust departments will need to establish consistent procedures
to gather and record basic factual information about the family needs and
finances, not only at the trust's inception, but on an ongoing basis.  The
same applies to general analysis of the economy and performance of the
investments.  Trust instruments will have to be analyzed carefully as to their
terms because powers to invade (or the absence of such powers) and precatory
language will take on heightened meaning under the new standard.  Records
should be maintained of the considerations and decisions resulting in a
particular strategy or investment.

The burdens on a trust department resulting from increased inquiry and
record-keeping may well be offset by the opportunities for increased contact
with family members and their input into the decision-making process.

New Opportunities, New Risks

The Prudent Investor Rule permits and even encourages unsophisticated trustees
to delegate investment decisions to professionals.  As a result, asset
investment departments of banks and trust companies will likely find more call
for their services to individual fiduciaries.

Many fiduciaries also will chose to meet the requirements of diversification
and risk assumption by participating in mutual funds.  In another area, banks
in Prudent Investor Rule states are now providing specific sophisticated
services to trustees, such as risk-management derivatives or review and
oversight of family assets.

There are a great many unknown areas in the application of the Prudent
Investor Rule.  It cannot be predicted how easily the courts will move away
from the more clear-cut standards of the Prudent Man Rule when faced with
actual lawsuits, or how they will reevaluate the fiduciary's decisions years
after they were made.  Other important issues include the extent of the
trustee's duty of affirmative due diligence to inquire about family
circumstances, and the scope of liability of the investment advisor.

In addition, it is not clear how the Prudent Investor Rule interacts with
other existing laws which have not been-and may not be-modified to fit its
concerns.  For example, under-productive property rules in many states require
each asset of a trust to produce a minimum amount of income to avoid
allocation of a portion of that asset's proceeds to the trust's income
beneficiary.  This is not consistent with the total return analysis of the
Prudent Investor Rule.  Other portions of state income and principal acts may
also be troublesome.  Furthermore, the effect of the Prudent Investor Rule on
pension trusts and charitable trusts and corporations that are regulated by
specific state or federal statutes has not been fully explored.  Indeed,
fiduciaries will be acting in a realm of uncertainty for some time to come.

Pushing a Global Brand


On a dank winter day in Red Wing, MN, a woman troops out through a chilly
drizzle to her mailbox and finds, among other mail, a statement from her
credit card company, Citibank.  Included is a notice that her credit limit is
being raised, and a reminder that its purchase protection plan offers price
savings if an item she buys is being sold more cheaply later.

Halfway across the world in steamy Singapore, an export executive returns to
his sleek apartment to find a different Citibank mailing, an offer for a card
tied to a frequent flyer program for Asian travelers.

From Bangkok to Bangor, and sundry points in between, the Citibank credit card
is proving itself to be truly a worldwide brand, with a scope that's sometimes
startling.  Citi issues secured cards and even private-label cards in Brazil,
frequent flyer cards in Argentina and Taiwan.  In many countries, Citibank and
Diners Club-the travel and entertainment card of which Citi is the primary
owner-are the chief consumer card brands.  Citibank processes more than 240
million card payments and has 90 million card customer contacts a year.  Its
overseas executives don't need to brush up on Portuguese or Thai; likely as
not, they're natives.

More than any other American bank-and arguably any bank-Citibank is a name
player in an array of overseas markets.  Long-established operations in Europe
and Latin America weren't shucked off some years ago, the way they were at
several other money center banks when profitability was squeezed.  Under
chairman John S.  Reed, parent Citicorp has made servicing the global consumer
a veritable mantra-and the credit card business is perhaps the biggest weapon
in its arsenal.

It is precisely this unparalleled reach that should keep Citi at the top of
the credit card receivables heap.  Nimble, aggressive issuers like MBNA Corp.,
First USA Inc.  and Advanta Corp.  have used a precision-bombing approach on
top credit targets to build U.S.  market share dramatically, and they'll keep
gaining share-but less so at Citi's expense than other large issuers.  Even if
the New York behemoth finds its domestic lead shrinking, its plethora of
relatively untapped overseas programs-some with explosive growth
potential-should preserve its top ranking.

"We believe that Citicorp is in a unique position to build upon its
multinational credit card experience in entering new markets, dealing with
their cultural differences and developing relevant products-even where credit
bureaus or other information sources are nonexistent," wrote Salomon Brothers
analyst Diane Glossman in a report last fall.

Citi's card operations may be its crown jewel, analysts say; plastic generates
a higher percentage of the bank's earnings than any other bank issuer's cards
do, and accounted for an estimated 29% of the bank's net income in
third-quarter 1995, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  It's a jewel cut
and honed by many years of large-scale marketing, telephone account servicing
and experimentation with differing offers.  Citi was among the pioneers in the
purchase protection plan area, as well as extended warranties.  Its
Citidollars program, offering catalog items to customers as a form of rebates,
also broke new ground years ago.

In the spring of 1994, this gem was placed in the hands of Roberta J.  Arena,
a 20-year Citi veteran who had most recently headed Citi's relatively small
European card operations.  As executive vice president in charge of the North
American and European card group, Arena replaced James L.  Bailey, the bank's
longtime card honcho.  Citibank declined to make Arena available for an
interview for this story, but industry observers say her experience outside
the U.S.  is underscoring Citi's commitment to pushing its global strategy
even further.

At a time when headlines in the U.S.  are trumpeting worries about mounting
consumer credit troubles, foreign markets may offer a useful counterweight.
Historically, Citicorp's card-loss numbers have been slightly worse than
industry averages because of its targeting of what Glossman calls "a
high-risk, high-return clientele."  Citi's U.S.  loss experience, however, has
changed little; at 3.72% of managed card receivables in the third quarter, it
actually improved two basis points from the second quarter and was up just 15
basis points from third-quarter 1994.

Moreover, KBW research finds that cards represented just over half of Citi's
net chargeoffs in the third quarter-53%-compared to 74% at Bank of New York,
75% at Chemical Bank, 87% at Chase Manhattan and 99% at First Chicago.  Still,
Citi has been boosting its provision for credit losses in the global consumer
bank.  That item hit $465 million in the third quarter, up $100 million from
the year-earlier number.

Credit the bank with seeing the trendlines.  "As the largest credit card
issuer in the country, we think it will be impossible for Citicorp to avoid
concerns about credit cards' credit quality," noted PaineWebber's Lawrence
Cohn in a recent report.

Citi's card prominence dates to the virtual dawn of the bank card in the early
1970s, and at this juncture its card is a very mature product in this country.
There's a bit of consumer ennui about the brand, perhaps, which will be a
challenge for Arena and her marketing forces.  So, too, will be catering to
the more service-savvy customer and finding the proper alchemy of rates and
rewards to keep profitability high amid fierce competitive pressures.

The legacy of leadership is certainly there.  "They reached a milestone in the
late 1970s when they realized that the card was the beachhead of least
resistance," says a consultant who worked for the bank years ago.  "They gave
up trying to be a national bank.

"Very early on, they decided the card business should be done on a volume
basis," he adds, and began multimillion-piece mailings.  "Even though Citi was
realizing significantly higher loan losses than the industry norms, by going
after active credit users, where the profits are, they were making more
because those people aren't as sensitive to rates and fees.  (Citi) accepted
credit losses as a cost of goods sold.  They also realized that they had a
great list, and they crammed everything they could sell down that pipeline."

Reputation as a Bully

"Cram" implies an element of bullying-and Citicorp still occasionally gets
demonized by consumer groups and smaller banks as the apotheosis of impersonal
service and a Marie Antoinette-in-pinstripes, "let-them-eat-cake" response to
criticism.  Some of that reflects a kind of Jeffersonian revulsion to bigness,
but Citi earned a lot of enmity in thev '70s and '80s, when it seemed eager to
bulldoze any regulation or law in its path.

But a seemingly chastened Citi-burned by waves of LDC, leveraged buyout and
commercial real estate losses in the late '80s and early '90s-is keeping a
lower profile these days.  It's no longer the merger scourge that smaller
banks once saw in their nightmares; institutions like NationsBank Corp.  and
First Union Corp.  have taken over that mantle.  As Citi has turned right
full-rudder into consumer banking, it's often been reducing fees (especially
for electronic services), not just jacking them up.

If Citi's consumer banking business isn't hitting on all cylinders, it's
close:  It generated over $500 million in global earnings in the third
quarter, a new high-water mark and 60% of the company's net income.  That's
broad-based, but the credit card is the biggest arrow in the quiver.  Citi
reported 56 million cards in circulation at the end of the third quarter, up
9% from the year earlier, with managed receivables up 19%.  Growth was
especially strong in the Asia-Pacific region, where managed receivables surged
40%, year-to-year, and applications hit a record level.  Since 1990, worldwide
cards in force have swelled more than 50%.

It's a big business, Citicorp's largest, and it requires hordes of
people-6,400 alone in three service centers in South Dakota, Maryland and
Nevada (Citi has offered 24-hour, 7-day phone service for almost a decade).
Throw in the operations in 31 other countries, and 14,300 employees are
involved-more bodies than the entire workforce at most large regional banks.

It's hard to downplay scale and experience in a business like credit cards.
In a recent survey of senior bank executives and directors by Towers Perrin,
Citibank was named most often as the best product manufacturer and distributor
in banking-attributes at the heart of card programs.  "The fact that Citi has
played at this level year in and year out is a remarkable thing," says Angelo
Palombi, senior executive vice president at Resource Bancshares Corp., a
Columbia, SC, firm that helps smaller banks run card operations.

For many years, Citi has been using scoring and portfolio modeling, then
blanketing the country with mail pieces, often with pre-approved applications
based on statistics and credit report data.  True, Citi doesn't know the
customer in Oshkosh as well as the local bank, and never will.  But the credit
card business is a scale-enhanced one in which it's increasingly impractical
to lend just locally.  Think Advanta and MBNA aren't using sophisticated
credit scoring techniques?  Think again.  Citi is using its technological
prowess to segment its marketing efforts and boost responsiveness, as well as
build average card balances.

With $42.1 billion in receivables at the end of 1995's third quarter, Citi's
program was half again as large as second-place Discover's $28.2 billion,
according to RAM Research.  MBNA, First USA and First Chicago rounded out the
top five (see table on this page).  Citi held 23.4% of total receivables for
the 10 largest issuers.

Several money-center analysts put its return on assets on its U.S.  card
business around 2.5%.  KBW's Berry says the business "continues to generate
superior returns," though Salomon Brothers' Glossman predicts returns will
trend down toward 2.0% over time.  That 2.5% ROA is double what aggressive
"pure-play" issuers Capital One Financial Corp.  (1.20%) and Advanta (about
1.30% on receivables made up 80% of credit cards) reported in the third
quarter.  Revenues would be even more impressive if Citi could develop better
cross-sell numbers; only 6% of the card base has another Citibank
relationship, and only half of branch customers have a Citi card, says
Glossman.

Profitability has received renewed attention, and that seems to be paying off.
"Historically, they were more aggressive and more sophisticated than any other
issuers," says K.  Shelly Porges, president of Porges/Hudson Marketing in San
Francisco.  But "they did not focus exclusively on revolving customers (those
who carry balances)-that would have made them more profitable.  They were out
there to gain total share."

Citi clearly isn't as dominant as it was a few years ago.  Its share of U.S.
credit card receivables slipped from 18% in 1991 to 13.5% at the end of 1994,
according to Credit Card Management, a Faulkner & Gray publication.  RAM
numbers put its Sept.  30, 1995 share even lower, at 12.8%.

Yet it's hard to underplay the importance of cards in Citi's earnings stream.
The bank reported 24.8 million bank card accounts in September 1995, and card
loans made up 23% of Citi's bankwide loans, up from 21% a year earlier; only
First Chicago (41%) had a higher percentage among major bank issuers.

Visa and MasterCard cards make up the vast majority of those accounts, but
Citi has issued some seven million Diners Club cards, and also issues and
services millions of private-label cards for department stores.  In the 1950s,
Diners was the travel and entertainment card for U.S.  corporations.  That's a
distinction it has lost-American Express is now six times as large, worldwide.
But Diners recorded its fourth straight record sales year in 1994, with
worldwide revenues of $22 billion in more than 175 countries.

Citi's ownership of the 45-year-old Diners brand is complex-Citi may have
control in various countries or share it with local franchisees.  It owns the
franchise in Germany, for instance, but In Chile has only a 20% share.  Diners
claims relationships with more than half of the Fortune 500 corporations, but
skeptics say it lives more on its past reputation than anything, and has more
clout in Europe in Asia than in the U.S.  "They haven't exploited Diners to
the point they can," says Michael Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting
in Westbury, NY.  "The energy and the effort seem to be missing."

But Porges points out that Citi has been developing new marketing for Diners-a
clear sign that it is committed to the program.  New commercials feature
younger, hipper travelers and an updated focus on women, she says.  In a
recent full-page ad in major newspapers, Diners takes on American Express,
calling Diners' "membership miles" program superior because it includes "every
major U.S.  airline"-including two Amex leaves out.

Big Switch

Analysts attribute Citi's relative passivity on the marketing front in 1991-93
to its internal problems, many related to real estate loan losses.  That was
also a period when Citi's card chargeoffs peaked, climbing to over 6% in
1991-92, according to KBW.  Yet card profits, as well as those from other
consumer businesses, helped pull the bank from the ditch it had landed in five
years ago.

The 1992 switch to variable rates and the year-end 1993 decision to eliminate
annual fees for Citibank Classic and Preferred Visa and MasterCard customers
with good credit histories sacrificed what some analysts estimated was
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues.  But it clearly gave Citi's card
program a shot in the arm.  "Repricing is restoring our momentum," Arena
announced in 1994.  In an interview last year with Brandweek magazine, she
said, "We invested more than we had planned in sheer marketing last year
(1994)...  so I think it's fair to say that we are back."

In its latest annual report, Citi said the steps were taken "to reinforce its
market dominance by building customer loyalty in this highly competitive
market."  Adding customers was a key objective.  Early in 1995, for instance,
the bank was offering new customers an introductory fixed rate of 6.9% for 12
months, considerably longer than most rivals.

Frank DeSantis, money-center analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, adds
that Citi has identified active customers who have $50 billion in balances on
other issuers' cards-and is targeting these accounts with balance-transfer
solicitations.  Its goal, he says, "is to regain half its lost market share
over the next five years."  Earlier last year, DeSantis singled out Citi's
usage levels, citing the figure of 79% of all accounts active (vs.  66%
industrywide) and higher-than-average balances per active account, $2,150 vs.
the $1,750 industry average.  Moreover, he says that the company's credit card
expense control "borders on spectacular"-recently, it was operating at a 34%
efficiency ratio in the U.S.

Citi has been "coming to terms with things that were part of its heritage,"
says Porges.  Citidollars, for instance, which was discontinued a year and a
half ago.  When it was introduced in the early '80s, Citidollars "had a lot of
power," she says.  "But in an age of co-branded cards, Citidollars had little
if any appeal."

The U.S.  portfolio has been highly segmented, offering consumers an array of
choices:  Classic (security and value); Preferred (higher credit line);
Choice, for price-sensitive buyers; and co-branded programs with such major
partners as American Airlines, Ford Motor Co.  and Apple Computer.  Another
successful selling strategy is the Photocard, in which the cardholder's photo
is digitally imprinted on the face of the card-a genuine security advantage
that Citi says cut its U.S.  bank card fraud losses by 62% in 1993-94.
Introduced in the U.S.  in 1992, it has been rolled out in all European,
Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets.

But the bank has hit a few pockets of major turbulence, too.  Its co-branded
card with MCI Communications was killed last year when consumers just didn't
line up.  And the Ford card, announced with a flourish three years ago, is
rumored in the industry to have collected most of its accounts from elsewhere
in Citi's empire, not from new customers.

Some attribute those difficulties to a focus on Citi's own brand, giving
co-branding programs-in which the bank shares proceeds with a nonbank-a lower
priority.  "The focus on the brand is an excellent strategy, but I think for
something that large they should have a two-pronged approach," says Auriemma.
"They're not focusing on some of the non-branded programs that might have
tremendous potential."

Great Expectations

Where issuers like MBNA and Household Bank have had tremendous success with
co-branded programs, the only one that has really clicked at Citi is the
American Airlines frequent flyer, or AAdvantage, experts say.  It's done so
well that it's been exported throughout Latin America.  But the other
programs?

"The Apple program ought to be huge, but I don't know one person that carries
(that card)," Auriemma says.  Similarly, he says never got an MCI card
solicitation, even though he was an MCI customer; he believes that's because
Citi is concentrating on its branded cards in the greater New York market.
Says Porges:  "When we talk about success in co-branding, the expectation is
that (Citi) would have something as big or bigger than anyone else's.  By that
standard, they weren't successful."  She quickly adds that this doesn't mean
the programs are failures, however.

On the flip side, Citi's own brand recognition is a huge asset-and coupled
with the bank's far-flung presence, it offers breathtaking potential.  Citi
issues bank cards in Belgium, Germany, Greece and Spain-and believes a
co-branded arrangement with the German national railway could catapult it to
first place there.  Plans are to consolidate the 15 card processing and
customer service facilities in North America and Europe into a small core of
centralized operations, trimming costs.

Asia, where Citi has a stronger presence than any other American bank, is its
most turbocharged card market.  Four million cards are in force there, and
Citi recently partnered with Passages, Asia's biggest frequent-flyer program,
in seven countries.  Arena has said that the credit card "is the biggest
introductory agent we have for the (Citibank) brand."

Even Eastern Europe, where capital infrastructures are still being built from
the rubble of Communism, holds card potential-though it may be a ways off.
Citi is in such countries as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Russia.
Salomon Brothers' Glossman noted in a recent report that Citi's Eastern
European operations "have been profitable from day one...  These economies
tend to be almost completely cash-dependent, and Citicorp is well-positioned
should development skip checks and move straight to credit/debit/stored value
cards."

Some observers wonder just how quickly these emerging markets can deliver,
however.  "It is important to develop them, but those markets are so small and
so immature that to spend a significant portion of management time on them is
dangerous, I think," Auriemma says.  "You certainly wouldn't want to do it to
the detriment of the U.S.  market."

Even in many highly developed areas in western Europe, there's plenty of
opportunity.  A New York banker with close ties to a large Dutch bank says
that many bankers there don't understand the popularity of credit cards in
this country; there, they've focused far more on debit cards-leaving an
autobahn-like opening for a high-volume card issuer like Citi.

In a number of overseas markets, Citi doesn't have to import its U.S.  card
logic, notes John Laurino, managing director at Westport Consulting in
Westport, CT.  "It has built retail businesses from the ground up, and they
are as well-established as they are in the States."  In fact, some of its
products in this country "were explored and validated overseas and brought
back here."  Citi calls that process "success transfer."

Success isn't necessarily measured in terms of customer satisfaction, however.
Citi tied for fifth in a recent U.S.  card satisfaction survey by J.D.  Power
& Co., long noted for its automotive surveys.  Power measured such attributes
as billing payment quality, interest rates, rewards and fees, cash advance
limits and point-of-sale processing quality.  Citi's score of 101-100 was
deemed average-tied it with Banc One.  Only one multiline bank scored higher,
Bank of New York at 102.  AT&T Universal Card led the pack, followed by
Discover and Household Bank.

In a RAM rating of the "best" consumer cards, Citi doesn't score in the top
group in any category except "best secured cards," where it was third behind
Wachovia Corp.  and Chase Manhattan.  But its move to eliminate annual fees
helps boost consumer satisfaction-though Citi, like most fee-charging issuers,
was dragged into those waters by a horde of no-fee rivals who were clearly
making big inroads.

Service Questions

Service quality issues remain, some customers say.  One customer with a
Citigold account-a packaged account that requires an opening minimum of
$100,000 and brings with it such goodies as a personal account officer, funds
sweep and trading privileges-complains that he's had difficulty with the bank
acknowledging separate accounts.  When he ran over his limit on a plain
vanilla card, he says, the card service people apparently never realized he
was a Citigold customer.  "From a customer perspective, (the card business)
seems to be managed autonomously from the retail bank," he says.  That
experience highlights the difficulty of managing information over massive
networks, but for an institution with Citi's technological prowess, it's
disconcerting nonetheless.

Technology does appear to be paying dividends, however, in keeping
delinquencies and losses in line.  As consumer loan delinquencies have shot up
in recent months, Citi's numbers have held up well.  Moreover, Lehman Brothers
analyst James Rosenberg maintains that even if Citi's U.S.  consumer
chargeoffs (including cards) jumped 100 basis points, that would extract at
most a 10% toll on earnings.  Similarly, KBW's Berry notes that Citi's $1.8
billion in consumer loan-loss reserves (most allocated for card losses)
represented 17 months of recent losses-far more than the seven months'
reserves that specialty card banks usually carry.

But it's incontrovertible:  cards are riskier than, say, home equity loans.
Citi's overall loss rate of 2.02% for all managed consumer loans at the
third-quarter close compares to 3.78% for worldwide credit card loans.

Risk management is a tough nut for issuers, and so is consumer loyalty at a
time of intense competition on the issuer's version of the Three R's:  rates,
rebates and rewards.  It's estimated that a record three billion credit card
offers were mailed out in 1995 alone.  "In the last 10 years, customer loyalty
to credit cards (in the U.S.)  has been destroyed, as holders were saturated
with offers," says Robert Skolnick, executive vice president at Behavioral
Analysis Inc.  in Tarrytown, NY.  "Issuers have turned credit cards into a
commodity in consumers' minds, and now they are launching major efforts to
develop long-term relationships, which historically had been presumed."

That's every major issuers' story; it is Citi's, too.  Growth potential in
this country is circumscribed by such commoditization, but it isn't strangled,
especially if current cardholders can be coaxed to build their balances.
Berry thinks Citi's card program can maintain its domestic share even as
overall credit card receivables mount at a 14%-16% annual clip through the
rest of the decade.  Roping in a new group-maybe even a new generation-of
customers is a key cog in that effort.

Arena told Brandweek that the student market is one of Citi's four major
marketing thrusts, the others being high-end spenders, "new Americans" and
"the great magic middle," which she said "is best characterized as being
married, or something, with children."  That great middle, she added, is where
Citi is "focusing our marketing weight."

In developing markets, far from the U.S.' saturated shores, growth could be
comparatively luxuriant.  "Adding new countries, improving penetration in
existing countries and increased usage of credit cards as a payment vehicle in
the locations are all sources of growth," wrote Glossman recently.  "Citicorp
already has enviable positioning in many of these markets with a known brand
name and the ability to draw upon its U.S.  and international skill base."
For instance, Citi recently introduced its American AAdvantage card in four
new markets-Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Panama.

Obviously, the developing world offers risk with a capital "R."  But Glossman,
who has exhaustively analyzed the bank's card operations, offers an
instructive example of Citi's experience in Colombia.  While savings banks
there have seen delinquency rates shoot as high as 25%, Citi's recently stood
at 4.4%.  Citi "has the advantage of centralized scoring, collections and more
targeted marketing," she noted.  One result:  Citi grew its credit card book
in Colombia by 116% in the first half of 1995, she says.

No Alarm Bells

Domestically, Citi can expect to see a modest uptick in delinquencies if
current trends hold-but nothing alarming.  Card executives at other banks
don't profess serious concern.  "Our forecasted losses are within our
expectations," says John A.  Klein, executive vice president for consumer
banking at People's Bank in Bridgeport, CT, which has a national low-rate
portfolio.  "They continue to track in a way we would expect with the
vintaging of our account base."

Another executive with a regional issuer attributes today's delinquency rise
more to the economic cycle than to a lack of portfolio "seasoning" over time.
"We're seeing people claiming bankruptcy who are not even past due.  That debt
is not showing up at the credit bureaus."  Still, he says that "most
successful players don't stop issuing in these markets, and the big guys like
Citicorp know that."

What's driving the most successful operations in this era of card saturation
is the ability to assemble information electronically and use it to maintain
the most profitable customer relationships, says James Quella, head of the
financial services practice at Mercer Management Consulting.  Citi continues
to reinvest heavily in the card business, adding client-server and voice
response technologies, and Glossman insists its current cost-per-account level
is what it was in 1982.  In a 1993 study by Booz, Allen & Hamilton, Citi's
cost advantage in the back office over other major card players ranged from
10% to 60%.

An executive with a regional card issuer says he heard that a few years ago,
Citi explored a mutual opening of back offices with First Data Corp.  Such
overtures, in which companies check out each other's technology, don't always
lead to ventures, and he says "Citi is notorious for stealing ideas."  After
that process, he says, "Citi felt it had perhaps the best cost structure" in
the business.  Being a low-cost producer has conferred tremendous advantages
by freeing up resources for new marketing and technology initiatives.

While Citi hasn't been duking it out in the courts far and wide as it was in
the 1970s and 1980s, it isn't loath to fight to protect its interests.  The
bank recently challenged a New Jersey law limiting late fees to $10 per card
account each month; Citi charges its customers $15.  The New Jersey Supreme
Court upheld the state limit in late November, and Citi immediately vowed to
appeal.

It's clear that Citi doesn't have the pre-eminent role it once did in the card
business; too many other talented players have come in.  But Citi is no Norma
Desmond, either, living only on past glories.  Freed from its earlier asset
woes and focused on the global consumer, it is in the process of erecting a
worldwide brand it hopes will rival Coca-Cola or Hewlett-Packard.

When that exporter in Singapore weighs his options for a card, that name
recognition and the image of Citi's four-pointed star will be no small
consideration.  So, too, will it weigh considerably with a manufacturing
executive in Germany.  Citi expects to grow its European card business to five
million accounts by 2000, from one million now, adding a new country every
12-15 months.  Since Arena's elevation, "They're taking a more global view of
the business," says Porges.  "Even though they talked global, the focus was on
the U.S.  My sense is there's a truer commitment now to non-U.S.  expansion."

That will require plenty of bodies and minds, and rivals won't be sitting
still.  But analysts see only encouraging signs.  You can't say the Citi never
slips, but it's spinning its wheels a lot less these days.  Pumped up by
global branding, its credit card business is like a battleship:  It may not be
nimble, but it has loads of firepower and a very long reach.

U.S. BANKER via NewsNet
JANUARY, 1996

Final Say:  CEOs Key to Sales Process


Banking's best CEOs and business unit managers have a passion for selling and
a well-defined process for managing sales.  They treat great selling as one of
their few sustainable strategic advantages.

At one of the nation's best-performing large banking groups, the president
makes over 300 sales calls a year and meets regularly with field sales
managers.  At another high-performing bank, the senior retail banking
executive personally coaches every one of his 120 retail salespeople in
selling for an hour each quarter as a model for his managers to follow.

Most bank CEOs are comfortable with selling, or they wouldn't have achieved so
much career success.  But often they're uncomfortable with the time required
to manage sales or with the functional skills of sales leadership, such as
sales planning and coaching.  As a result, they're often persuaded to champion
easy, non-integrated solutions to sales problems, such as single-event
programs that require little interdepartmental cooperation.  That's why most
bank sales programs aren't working.

Examples of traditional bank sales practices that don't work include the
industry's popular cross-sell measures, product sales incentives and officer
call programs.  These typically focus managers on activity rather than on
effectiveness.  Similarly, the structure and detail of activity-driven sales
training and mystery shopper programs make CEOs feel that a lot is being done
to increase sales and customer satisfaction, despite any hard evidence.

These "quick fixes" have actually encouraged formulaic selling and
product-pushing and have relieved managers of their sense of accountability.
None of those "easy" sales interventions by themselves can provide the focus,
motivation and accountability that's provided by a fully integrated sales
process.  Most line sales managers in banking know these traditional sales
programs aren't working, but few will say so aloud because so much money and
senior management prestige is invested in them.

Sales effectiveness begins at the top of the organization chart.  Research at
Harvard Business School has established that having a clear sales task is the
most important factor in sales motivation, coupled with feedback and
accountability.  If this is true, only the CEO and other senior executives can
influence large gains in sales production.

If a CEO doesn't communicate a clear vision of success and clear role
definitions for selling or doesn't hold line managers accountable for sales
revenue and developing salespeople through coaching, this lack of clarity
filters down through the bank.  Employees lose their motivation, and average
sales revenue per employee falls.  Repeated surveys of bank salespeople have
demonstrated that bank employees don't know what they're supposed to do
relative to sales and customer satisfaction.  They also say they're receiving
virtually no coaching, no feedback and no meaningful consequences for
performance, good or bad.

For a bank to make a quantum leap in sales, its employees must believe that
senior managers are placing a consistent focus and priority on sales and
customer satisfaction.

A Simple Answer

With so many banks failing at sales, what are the CEOs of successful
organizations doing to produce outstanding results?  The answer is
surprisingly simple:  Banking's best CEOs treat sales as a primary business
function, giving it the same commitment and attention to detail that they give
to pricing and expense control.

Banking's best sales organizations show a sense of urgency and accountability
for sales production and customer satisfaction that isn't present at other
banks.  This is driven by the CEO's uncompromising insistence that sales
revenue contributions and customer satisfaction be considered as key factors
in decisions affecting all functional areas of the bank.

This means that improvement in sales revenue and customer satisfaction are
measured and rewarded; that sales and customer satisfaction are key agenda
items for senior level management meetings; and that the CEO and business unit
managers are visible in articulating clear goals, strategies and preferred
ways of selling, and in serving as models of personal selling and sales
coaching.  None of this is rocket science, but it is increasingly clear that
active sales leadership by the CEO pays dividends and helps improve prospects
for long-term survival.

Funding:  Those Dwindling Deposits


Like a pond drawn down by drought, the nation's depository institutions are
finding their deposit bases shrinking as consumers take their savings money
elsewhere.  To some observers, this phenomenon has gone beyond a cyclical
event dictated by rate movements-and has profound repercussions on the future
of bank funding.

"The (core) deposits are not going to come back," says Michael Brosnan,
director of the Treasury and market risk division at the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).  "In my opinion, this is not a short-term
phenomenon; this is a secular change in the system.  The question is, are you
planning this out, or is it just happening to you?"

A recent study of this phenomenon by Charles N.  Cranmer, director of equity
research at New York broker/dealer M.A.  Shapiro & Co.  Inc., establishes
clearly that at best, core deposits at the nation's banks are stagnant, while
the low-cost deposit categories are experiencing significant run-offs as
depositors search for higher yields.  Illiquid assets as a percent of core
liabilities, the standard for liquidity in Cranmer's study, have jumped from
84% in year-end 1993 to 95% in the second quarter of 1995.

And according to data from the OCC, deposits of all sorts have declined in the
past three years, and are flat to significantly lower compared with 1990 (see
charts).  Most dramatically, all time deposits in the nation's commercial
banks fell from 31.74% of total assets in mid-1990 to 22.37% in mid-1995.  In
the same period, small time deposits fell from 20.07% to 16.43% of total
assets, while large time deposits fell from 11.67% to 5.94%.

Experts say that consumer flight to higher yields isn't the only cause.  Many
banks are rationalizing their branch systems and finding that core deposits
gathered through them aren't always the cheapest way to go.

"I think what's happened is that as banks have acquired robust information
systems, they've come to appreciate the fully-loaded costs of acquiring
certain deposits and have become less enamored of them, because it may
actually be expensive money," says Chris Formant, a Boston-based national
partner in the financial services group of Coopers & Lybrand Consulting.

But this phenomenon naturally sends the nation's banks into the capital
markets for money to lend, raising the cost of funds-and squeezing margins.
And while the industry as a whole is awash in capital today, says Cranmer, it
doesn't mean the subject is so boring that bankers can safely look the other
way.  Analysts certainly aren't.  In a recent report on First Bank System,
Citicorp fixed-rate analyst Blaine Frantz wrote that "available balance sheet
liquidity to fund loan growth is the most noteworthy constraint on the bank's
credit profile."

"If American bankers continue ignoring this (liquidity issue), one day they'll
get caught with their pants down," Cranmer says.  "People don't talk much
about liquidity, but these days, the Japanese banks have to pay 100 basis
points over the yield curve for funds, and I'm sure they wish they didn't have
to do that."

Japanese banks, which don't have as well-developed an asset securitization
market as U.S.  banks, have reportedly endured significant outflows of foreign
deposits in recent months as news of their deep-seated problems has surfaced.
These outflows have forced them into the arms of professional-and
skeptical-financiers.

A similar fate, say experts, awaits complacent U.S.  bankers who think they
can safely ignore balance sheet basics, and concentrate on the glamorous side
of the business, because they imagine that the bad old days of write-downs and
microscopic bank examinations are over.  This is exactly what will cause the
next liquidity crunch if banks don't pay more attention, says Roy Smith,
professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business.

"The real problem (today) isn't on the liquidity side-banks are
over-capitalized today," he says.  "The problem is, what are banks doing with
their capital?  And they're doing two things; buying other banks and paying
high prices, or squandering it on some of the syndicated loans they're
making."

"They just want to look good in the locker room," he continues.  "If they're
willing to take 11 basis points from a British conglomerate, they're surely
not covering the risks of that loan being degraded; that's a lower spread over
LIBOR than they got for some of the loans that went bad in the 1980s," he
says, citing a recently syndicated loan.

To a great extent, what is replacing the core deposits as an important source
of liquidity at the nation's depository institutions is no mystery.  Most
larger banks today are deeply into securitization and outright asset sales,
and are familiar figures at the Fed funds window and in the nation's money
markets.

As a result, most experts feel that while keeping an eye on liquidity is at
the very least well-advised, they also say that focussing on illiquid assets
as a percent of core assets as a liquidity measurement as closely as Cranmer
does in his study is too narrow.  "When I look at liquidity, I can't look at a
single ratio," says the OCC's Brosnan.  "I look at (borrowing) capacity, as
well as asset quality issues, management issues, and the stability of
earnings.  To the extent that these things, and capital, are solid, we're
happy."

There are important cost, regulatory and accounting issues, often unremarked,
that are driving the turning of U.S.  banks to securitization and asset sales
as a source of liquidity.  The cost of operating a branch system to gather
deposits, for instance, is a largely hidden, but real cost.  Also, says the
OCC's Brosnan, securitization improves a bank's capital position.  "You get to
fund off-balance sheet, and get a continually growing earnings stream without
raising capital by a proportional amount."

Auto loans, for instance, must be reserved against at an 8% rate, while
securitizing such a loan requires no reserves and releases that 8% to the bank
to re-lend, explains Brosnan.  But since earnings from securitizations and
asset sales flow to non-interest income on a company's annual report, it's
difficult to measure directly the impact of that activity on the bank's
liquidity position.

Cranmer doesn't disagree with this analysis.  "Securitization is a pretty
powerful force on the consumer side of the market, and a clear alternative" to
core deposits, he says.  "To the extent you're creating internally generated
funds, that's liquidity.  But while a company that's leveraged one-to-one or
even two-to-one can fund most of its needs internally, a company that's
leveraged 20-to-one never can."

The growth of these sophisticated financings have allowed bankers to likewise
become much more sophisticated in their use of the capital markets,
derivatives and risk management, which is leading them away from a reliance on
core deposits as a primary source of liquidity, says Cooper & Lybrand's
Formant.  And as a result, core deposit levels don't really reflect a bank's
true liquidity.

Approaching Obsolescence

"I think it's becoming an obsolete measurement," he says.  "Not completely
obsolete; but the stated composition of a bank's superficial liquidity and
matching funds may not be what it really is, if you look at some of the
off-balance sheet financings, and some of the derivatives, which may change
the composition of that liquidity."

The issue, then, isn't whether banks have money to lend, but how they get it.
"The real measure of liquidity is, what's the quality of the bank, and how are
people looking at it?"  says the OCC's Brosnan.

There's the rub; market perception.  When a bank turns from core deposits to
the money markets for much of their liquidity, everything depends on how it's
viewed on the trading floor.  And while securitization, and professional
markets, are perfectly reasonable venues for liquidity when properly managed,
they can also turn on borrowers like tigers, in a sort of extremely grown-up
version of high school popularity.

For a domestic example of how fast a good thing can go bad, look no further
than Continental Illinois Corp., say observers.  Once one of the nation's
premier banks, Continental Illinois was prevented under Illinois regulations
from having a branch system, and therefore direct access to stable core
deposits.  The result was that it had to fund itself in the money markets
every day, to the tune of billions of dollars.

Of course, other Chicago banks had to do the same, and prospered.  But in
1984, a connected series of events led to its being solvent on a Friday and
broke next Monday.  Headlines and a federal reorganization inevitably
followed.

Nightmares like that can be useful in keeping bankers from a terminal case of
complacency, but they're also easy to ignore, especially as the tides of
financial fashion sweep from coast to coast.  That, says Cranmer, is why now
is a good time to buttress a bank's balance sheet.

"There's always a credit cycle, and when times are good, you want to build
your balance sheet in anticipation of the next down cycle," he says.  He
advises bank to stop relying so much on overnight Fed funds and to stagger
maturities, so that a bank isn't caught one day carrying both a big market
basket and a low credit rating.

Sounds like common sense.  But are banks doing this?  Not really, says
Cranmer.  "The whole criticism I have of the industry overall, is that they're
tending to short-fund themselves.  It does cost more money to issue five-year
bank notes than to borrow overnight Fed funds, but the difference is only 50
basis points."

"This is something banks haven't really had to face up to, because they could
always fund with their core deposits," Cranmer adds.  "But they want to
accommodate their long-term customers and they want to go to the closing
dinners and they want to sit at the lead table.  There are all sorts of
motivations; it just doesn't seem to me that a lot of the syndicated loans
banks are making these days are real economical."

If this has a certain unhappily familiar ring to it, NYU's Professor Smith is
unsurprised-and unmoved.

"The premium in banking, as always, goes to those who know what they're doing,
and understand the problems they face, and don't squander their funds on
badly-priced loans just to gain some sort of ephemeral leadership in a market
that may not matter to them," he says.  "What they ought to be doing is
asking, 'How are we going to compete in the retail market with the mutual
funds, and how are we going to compete in the wholesale markets with the
investment banks?'"

Good questions, of course, and critical for the big picture.  But lending and
spread management are the bread-and-butter of banking.  Unless the entire
notion of banking is revolutionized, banks need to be occupied with funding
issues.  Core deposits may not have the starring role they once did, but it's
hard to imagine them fading into the background any time soon.

Industry:  Taking It To The Courts


Amid the hoopla over the proposed merger of Chemical Banking Corp.  and Chase
Manhattan Corp., there's an alarm sounded by several recent merger challenges
that threatens only to get louder.  Community activists are no longer willing
to simply lick their wounds when the deals get approved and their wishes go
unmet.  Now, they're suing to try to get the deals overturned.

The hotbed of this activity has been New York; it's been spearheaded by Inner
City Press/Community on the Move, a Bronx-based community group whose
executive director, Matthew Lee, has challenged a series of bank mergers in
the past few years.  Lee and his group went to court recently to fight both
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s approval of GreenPoint Bank's
acquisition of 60 Home Savings Bank branches and Chase's acquisition of mutual
fund advisory businesses from U.S.  Trust Corp.

In the former, a federal court actually issued a stay of the FDIC
approval-then concluded that no relief was warranted, largely because
GreenPoint had already made moot Inner City's chief complaint by establishing
a presence in the Bronx.  Inner City sued to block the Chase-U.S.  Trust
merger on the grounds that Chase has discriminated in its mortgage lending.
The court let the deal go forward, but agreed to review the administrative
record.

As the courts ruminate, the process for evaluating Chase-Chemical is going
through predictable paces.  The Federal Reserve Board and the New York State
Banking Department (the new Chase, as the banks call their merged entity, has
opted for a state charter) held a highly structured, two-day hearing in
mid-November at which some 150 people testified.

Anxious to cover all bases, the Fed extended the comment period by 11
days-then tacked on another three days.  The state banking department alone
received thousands of pages of testimony.  Much of what they heard and read
was utterly predictable, with executives from Chase and Chemical defending
their community service record and many activists challenging it.  A number of
legislators got into the act, with Republicans generally lauding the merger
and liberal Democrats from New York City raising objections.  In fact, a
consortium of Democrats later banded together to urge regulators to strike
down the deal.

Lee, who seems to chase Chase like Ahab pursued Moby Dick-Inner City has taken
the bank on in every merger and chartering issue in the past couple of
years-urged the regulators to deny the deal on fair lending grounds.  Chase,
he argued, "is the most exclusionary banking organization in New York."

What appears to be behind the legal truculence is activists' sense that
regulators remain loath to intervene in merger applications beyond a polite
throat-clearing and sotto voce advice to the banks to put up a bit more cash.
In a recent article in The New York Times, Ralph Nader wrote that
Chase/Chemical's pledge to boost lending in underserved areas "is
unenforceable, but it does provide cover for regulators eager to rubber-stamp
the mergers."

Nader urged a rewriting of the Bank Merger Act "by placing greater emphasis on
determining the 'public interest' in these mergers."  He added that the
Justice Department should adopt tougher standards for measuring bank
competition than those prevalent in the Reagan-Bush era.

Nader isn't likely to get his wish any time soon.  But massive mergers like
Chase-Chemical throw a spotlight on job losses and other byproducts of
consolidation that are impossible to ignore-and bring political considerations
into the equation (see Point of View, November 1995).  Add to that the new
level of legal scrutiny sought by Lee and his allies, and regulators may well
be pushed to put big mergers through a finer screening.

Lee's stated goal, an outright denial, is almost unthinkable.  Chemical has a
legacy of "outstanding" Community Reinvestment Act ratings, and the two banks
announced a five-year, $18-billion pledge for community reinvestment (though
much of it is nationwide, and targeted not at urban reinvestment but at
"affordable mortgages").

In an interview, Lee snorts that "it's the least well-defined of any of the
(bank) mega-pledges...  If they'd made a $2-billion pledge with a specific
commitment, it would have been much better."

Lee hints that if the Fed okays the merger-a decision could come as early as
late this month-his group may head back to court.  That depends in part, he
says, on how Inner City fares with its two ongoing suits.  If the only way to
get CRA enforcement is through denying an application, that's the logical
route to pursue, he adds.

"I expect the courts to slap him down, but one never knows," says Warren
Traiger, a New York attorney specializing in community reinvestment issues.
"The standard for overturning any administrative decision, of being arbitrary
and capricious, is a pretty high hurdle."

Traiger predicts that New York regulators will work "in tandem" with the Fed
on Chase/Chemical:  "I can't imagine a divergence."  The pitch and the volume
of the criticism isn't unexpected, given that the merger will create the
nation's largest bank, and the regulators can't tune it out.  Don't be
surprised if the new Chase winds up making loan commitments for a few billion
dollars more before the deal is sealed and delivered.

Mortgages:  Servicing Rights:  Still In Demand


In the third quarter of 1995, the transfer of servicing rights to loans
purchased by the nation's Congressionally chartered secondary marketing
agencies fell by 7%.

This barometer of activity in the lucrative field of mortgage servicing may be
an indication to some that the market for home servicing rights is leveling
off.  After all, in the past banks and large mortgage bankers have been
willing to pay up to seven times a loan's servicing fee for the right to
acquire servicing in the open market.  Lately, prices have fallen back to less
stratospheric levels.

Does that mean the golden days of mortgage banking are over?  Don't bet on it.

Although there has been somewhat of a lull in activity in recent months,
investment bankers and advisors that buy and sell servicing for their clients
cite a number of different reasons for the slowdown.

Some believe that buyers are waiting to see what happens with the sale of
Prudential Home Mortgage Corp., Clayton, MO, an $80-billion servicer owned by
Prudential Insurance Co.  "They want to see what type of price it commands and
who winds up with it," says one Wall Streeter.  "Once that is known, some of
the bigger players might want to rethink their strategy."

Greg Bennett, managing director for Los Angeles-based Hamilton, Carter, Smith,
believes there has actually been a supply shortage in servicing in recent
months, a situation he blames on an accounting change made by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board.  The change, referred to as FAS 122 (the number of
the rule), allows banks, mortgage bankers and other lenders to "capitalize" on
their balance sheets the servicing rights to loans they originate.
Previously, in the arcane world of accounting, only servicing rights that were
purchased on the open market could count as something of value on an
institution's balance sheet.  (The FASB rule is prospective, not retroactive.)

Bennett believes that a number of depositories that are heavily involved in
servicing "have been lulled into believing that FAS 122 has changed the
business, when in fact it has not."  Many firms are holding onto servicing
because they can count it as an asset without first having to sell it.  In
theory, this doesn't sound so bad-but capitalization does not immediately
translate into "real" cash.

"A mortgage servicer is still going to need cash," says Bennett, who has
brokered many a servicing deal in his day.  "The rule change didn't change the
economics of the business."

The HCS executive anticipates that it is only a matter of time before
companies that have been hoarding servicing begin bringing it to market once
again.  Once supply increases, prices likely will fall.

But other factors are affecting the market as well.  As U.S.  Banker went to
press in December, the bond market was continuing to rally, driving long-term
interest rates down even further.  John Wolf, a technology executive for the
mortgage division of Alltel Information Services, Jacksonville, FL, sees the
slide in rates accelerating mortgage refinancings-which, in turn, causes
servicing rights to "run off."

When this occurs, as it did during the refinancing boom of 1993, buyers of
servicing rights on new loans usually claw each other in the open market,
which increases prices.  That is good for servicing sellers, but bad for
buyers.

Currently, prices for new servicing rights on conventional, fixed-rate loans
are holding steady at about six times the servicing fee, brokers report.  (The
typical servicing fee on a Federal National Mortgage Association-purchased
loan is 25 basis points.)  But if rates fall just a bit, another price war for
newly originated product could accelerate.

In other words, the outlook for servicing rights is a bright one in 1996, and
experts anticipate that banks will continue to be big purchasers.  However, as
some banks continue to gobble up mortgage banking franchises (and the
servicing rights that go along with them), a few are exiting the business
entirely.  KeyCorp of Cleveland recently sold its servicing division, as did
Barclays American.

Bank of Boston Corp.  is spinning off BancBoston Mortgage Corp., Jacksonville,
FL, a $40-billion servicer, while First Bank System of Minneapolis is on the
verge of selling its mortgage division, FBS Mortgage Corp., St.  Paul.

Many of the current sales are being facilitated through a competitive bid
process, in which an offering circular on the target company is circulated to
prospective buyers.  However, some investment bankers feel that this year the
market could see an increase in privately negotiated transactions.  "I think
private, or 'direct' deals, represent a growing segment of the business," says
Ted Jadlos, a broker with United Financial Inc., Denver.


Based in Washington, D.C., Paul Muolo is a senior editor of National Mortgage
News, a Faulkner & Gray publication.

Embracing A Dynamic Market

JOHN A.  NIGH

Title:  President and CEO, MidAmerica Bank, St.  Paul, MN

New situation:  Comes to the Twin Cities from Wyoming, where he had been
president and CEO of Rocky Mountain Bank in Cheyenne before it was acquired in
1994 by Metropolitan Financial Corp.

Dynamic environment:  Nigh, an Indiana native, says he has had exposure over
the years to Minnesota and always admired the market.  "It's one of
strongest-growing economic areas in the country," he says.

Strategic thrust:  Plans to add new business services to MidAmerica, which has
27 branches and $650 million in assets in Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Says that
entails offering "a big basket of services," including cash management, to a
varied group of industries.  The margins in that business are attractive, and
"when you have such a diverse basket, you have a pretty diverse risk
situation."

Philosophy:  "We don't re-create the wheel.  We take a group of services, and
bundle and interlock them.  This gives the borrowers a lot better perspective,
sometimes, than they get elsewhere."  Believes that "the CEO is the number one
marketing person in the bank.  This is a sales business.  The whole game is
the manner of delivery."

Competition:  Acknowledges the prowess of superregional competitors like
Norwest Corp.  and First Bank System.  "We're not going to take that group
on," he says.  Believes there is a very viable place for a small bank that is
"both very high-touch and very high-tech."

Background:  Started in banking 23 years ago in Omaha, and ran two small
institutions in the 1970s.  Went to Wyoming in 1983, where he worked for Key
Bancshares (predecessor of KeyCorp) and rose to executive vice president.
Moved to Rocky Mountain Bank after it was formed in 1988 from the combination
of two failed thrifts.

Still in the Snow Belt:  Acknowledges that he can't expect warmer winters in
Minnesota, but says, "I think the wind is worse in Wyoming."


Plotting A Global Course

JOSEPH BARTOLONI

Title:  Managing Director, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's Wood Gundy
Securities Inc.'s Global Technology Unit

Responsibilities:  Supervises systems development and product support for the
investment bank of the Toronto-based commercial banking company.

The vision thing:  Working closely with his boss, Tom Kielty, Wood Gundy's
senior vice president for technology, on a new information technology strategy
to support the firm's global capital markets and other securities operations.

Small is beautiful:  "The whole client/server environment is the core of our
direction," he says.  During the past 15 years, Bartoloni has observed smaller
platforms like workstations and personal computer local-area networks assume
the dominant role in investment banking.  "I don't even know if we have any
mainframes in our current environment."  In the past, workstations and PCs
were often just stopgap solutions for setting up new offices in London or
Tokyo.  Now, the small systems perform almost all of the firm's computing
tasks.

Need for speed:  In a world where dollars fly past yen at the speed of light,
and the European countries are in the midst of creating a common currency from
scratch, someone in Bartoloni's job has to work fast.  "The markets are the
dominating factor," and there's never a lot of time to work on new projects.

Background:  Ran a management consulting business for commercial and
investment banks for the past two years.  Spent the previous 13 years in
investment banking, including successive six-year stints at Merrill Lynch from
1980-86 and First Boston from 1986-92.  Also spent two years at Lehman
Brothers.

Education:  B.S.  and MBA from New York University, where he also studied
computer science.

Spare time:  Spends his free time with his wife, son and daughter, and he also
coaches the kids' soccer and basketball teams.

A PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR?

While accountants in the US were celebrating the victory in narrowing
liability, some practitioners in the UK were starting to count hard the
cost of unlimited, as well as joint and several, liability.

The final shape of the US tort reform, which became law just before the
Christmas break, looks a sensible measure which should protect
accountants from the excesses of frivolous actions, but leaves them
exposed enough to want to maintain the highest professional standards
(see page 2 for full report).

Unfortunately, the issues are not so clear-cut in the UK where the
conjunction of several events has tangled the debate. Firstly, there is
the Binders/ADT legal case. The action related to an agreed bid by
Britannia Security Group, audited by Binders. After the acquisition ADT
found the profits and net assets over stated. The judge found that not
only had Binders been negligent but they owed a duty of care to ADT
because the lead partner told ADT in an 'off the cuff' remark that he
stood by the firm's audit opinion. Out goes Caparo where it was decided
an auditor did not have a duty of care to third parties - unless the
Appeal Court says something different.

There is only bad news and worse news

On to the damages: the bad news was that the judge awarded damages
totalling #105m ($160m): the worse news is that the firm only has
insurance cover of #71m leaving partners to pick up the tag for the
rest - an uncomfortable #300,000 each for the 100 or so partners
involved. Binders partners are left to sweat for a year or so and the
rest of the profession can declare that something must be done to solve
the problem they have, in part, created. The obvious solution would be
reform the law, but that looks unlikely to happen quickly, with a
government gearing up for an election, despite an official review of
the problem which is due to be published soon.

So the Big 6 firms lost patience and decided to take matters into their
own hands.

Incorporation seems the best way forward

Before the ADT decision, KPMG partners had already announced that they
were going to incorporate as the best solution they could find to the
liability crisis. And alongside incorporation they have promised full
financial disclosure. Whether the revelation over size of partners'
drawing helps or hinders the firms' cause remains to be seen.

At the same time as the ADT bombshell, Ernst & Young and Price
Waterhouse announced they intend to avoid possible financial disaster
by forming limited liability partnerships in the offshore haven of
Jersey. All they need is the legislation due this summer from the
Jersey Parliament which would be similar to Delaware law in the US and,
in theory at least, would protect partners' private assets.

Whether any of these moves will, in the long run, help firms
professionally, commercially or on the PR front, remains to be seen.
There are many examples of trends starting in the US and quickly
reaching the UK and elsewhere. In the case of tort reform, for UK
partners at least, this particular trend cannot cross the pond too
soon.

ACCOUNTANTS GET LITIGATION RELIEF FOR CHRISTMAS

Just days before Christmas, the US accounting profession's long held
wish for securities litigation reform was finally granted. It was the
best Christmas present imaginable for a profession that has been
battered by enormous legal expenses.

For the past four years, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) and the major accounting firms had intensely
lobbied Congress for litigation reform. 'We are extremely pleased with
the legislation enacted,' Margaret Simmons, legislative affairs
coordinator for AICPA, told WAR.

In recent years, the Big 6 firms have collectively spent as much as 12%
of their annual fee income defending or settling litigation. The new
legislation should significantly lighten that burden.

Two key provisions of the new legislation, formally known as the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, are expected to curb
the number of lawsuits brought against accountants. The first has to do
with what is known as the pleading stage of a case. The new law
requires that plaintiffs in a securities lawsuit make specific
allegations of management fraud at the time the suit is filed, said
Simmons.

This was not a requirement in the past. Plaintiff attorneys had been
accused of turning the discovery stage into fishing expeditions
designed to rack up huge legal bills. The mounting legal costs
encouraged many defendants to cut their losses by settling out of
court, even though they might have been innocent of any wrongdoing.
Legal scholars say that the new pleading standard raises the threshold
for a case to proceed to discovery, which should significantly reduce
accounting firms' legal expenses.

A second important provision of the reform bill does away with the
joint and several liability system that had been in place. Under the
new law, defendants can only be held responsible for the proportion of
the losses they are deemed to have caused. In the past, if a company
went insolvent and its auditors were deemed to have contributed to even
a small percentage of investor losses, the accounting firm could be
held fully liable for all investor losses.

Under the new law, joint and several liability remains in place only in
instances where the accounting firm is shown to have participated in
the fraud.

AICPA president Barry Melancon said the law now strikes a fair balance
between the rights of truly defrauded investors and outside
professionals 'who had become victims of a small group of
entrepreneurial lawyers abusing the legal system.'

Other important protections afforded by the new law include:

- A 'safe harbour' provision protects companies, and their advisers,
from claims of fraud in the event that their prediction of future
performance do not pan out.

- A provision requires courts to sanction plaintiffs and plaintiff
attorneys who initiate frivolous lawsuits.

- The statute of limitations for filing securities lawsuits remains
unchanged. Plaintiffs must file claims within three years of the time
the violation occurred or within one year of the time the violation is
discovered.

- A provision allows judges to select as lead plaintiff in a class-
action lawsuit the party with the greatest financial stake. Some
plaintiffs had been accused of taking small stakes in numerous
companies, thereby positioning themselves to become lead plaintiffs to
the largest number of potential class actions.

The accounting community's original reform wish-list included several
other provisions which became casualties of the legislative process and
did not become law. These included a fee shifting proposal that would
have required unsuccessful plaintiffs to pay all legal fees incurred by
the defendants.

All in all, the new law provides accountants all the protections they
could have reasonably hoped for, Simmons said.

As a tradeoff for the protections afforded by the act, accountants will
be subjected to additional oversight on the part of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). The new law gives the SEC the power to
prosecute accountants, lawyers and underwriters who wittingly help
corporate executives commit fraud.

The SEC had previously had that power stripped from it in a 1994
Supreme Court case. The court held that corporate advisers could not be
held liable for the actions of their clients.

Another significant concession made by the accounting profession is a
provision of the law which make accountants responsible to report
fraud. An auditor who uncovers fraud during an audit must report the
illegality to the company's audit committee, its board of directors or,
in some circumstances, the SEC.

The new legislation is notable not only for the protections it affords
accountants, but also for the dramatic manner in which it became law.

In early December, both houses of Congress voted on and passed the
final version of the litigation reform bill by wide margins. It was
presented to President Clinton, who had earlier expressed his support,
to be signed into law.

At the eleventh hour, the president unexpectedly vetoed the
legislation. The veto reportedly came after the president held a
private meeting with William Lerach, a prominent member of the
plaintiff bar and one of the largest contributors to the Democratic
party which funded Clinton's presidential bid.

In response, the AICPA fired off a terse press release decrying the
veto. It read in part: 'The President has once again neglected the will
of the people and caved in to a small group of wealthy, powerful
contributors.'

Despite the veto, the coalition supporting the bill held together. On
20 December and 22 December respectively, the House of Representatives
and the Senate voted to override the presidential veto (a two-thirds
super majority was required in each chamber) and passed the bill into
law.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 was the first veto
override suffered by the Clinton administration.

REPORT PUBLISHED ON PROVISIONS

FASB has published a report, Provisions: Their recognition, measurement
and disclosure in financial statements, in conjunction with standard-
setters in the UK, Canada and Australia as well as the International
Accounting Standards Committee. The report is aimed at developing
solutions to accounting problems based on common accounting frameworks.

FASB chairman Dennis Beresford noted that: 'Accounting for provisions
is an important topic for standard-setters around the world because
they are often material in reporting financial performance. Very little
accounting guidance currently exists for provisions, which may lead to
a diversity in practice.'

The report explores the basic issues of when provisions should be
recognised, how they should be measured, and what disclosures should be
made. Additionally, the report considers specific applications to
future operating losses and restructuring costs, areas in which
provisions are often recognised.

WORKSHOP DEFINES OBJECTIVES

An UNCTAD workshop on environmental accounting recently established
priorities for its current work programme. Participants decided to
prepare a synthesis of existing financial accounting requirements, look
at links between financial reporting and general environmental
monitoring information, and work on systems which produce environmental
cost accounting information for companies.

Following on from the 1995 conference of the Intergovernmental Working
Group of Experts in International Standards of Accounting and Reporting
(ISAR) which presented a series of studies on environmental accounting
(see WAR, April 1995, p2), participants from several countries met in
Geneva recently to discuss what further contribution UNCTAD could make
in this area. The ISAR conference had suggested that some form of
guidelines could be produced.

The working party defined environmental accounting as taking in
financial accounting (eg provisions for decommissioning costs), 'full
cost' management accounting, general environmental reporting, and
environmental audit. It decided that work could be done to present and
integrate existing financial accounting rules which bear on
environmental issues as a first step. Similarly, a study could be made
of environmental reporting indicators in use to see which were the most
meaningful, and examine whether any useful link could be built between
financial reporting and the present free-ranging, voluntary
environmental reporting which is being done by some companies.

Some companies are experimenting with cost accounting which provides a
picture of environmental costs. Participants observed that much of this
work was not published because of its confidential nature, but this
prevented rapid development. UNCTAD had a role there, but it was felt
that it should not involve itself further in environmental auditing.

It was also decided that UNCTAD should look at the possibility of
providing an electronic bulletin board for environmental accounting
literature, as well as developing education and training programmes in
due course.

TRADE IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

The World Trade Organisation (WTO) working party on professional
services, which is working on cross-border provision of accounting
services, had its third meeting in January. The meeting set out a list
of subjects to be addressed in a model agreement, and asked for further
information on professional qualifications in developing countries.

The WTO's council for trade in services was established as part of the
last GATT agreement to prepare the way for a liberalisation of cross-
border trade in services, with accounting as a priority. It has
established a working party which met for the first time last October
(see WAR November 1995, p3) whose objective is to prepare a model
agreement for cross-border trade in accounting services.

At its January meeting in Geneva, the working party, to which all WTO
members are entitled to send representatives, agreed on a list of
issues which would need to be addressed in any model agreement. This
list includes questions such as:

- mutual recognition of professional qualifications
- minimum periods of post-qualification experience
- minimum educational requirements
- professional liability arrangements
- relationships with local professional bodies
- use of IASC standards.

Members of the working party agreed to review these issues from a
national perspective and meet again in March to discuss them.

Although the working party had already been given extensive briefings
by IFAC and UNCTAD in October, some members felt that they need further
information about conditions in developing countries before they could
proceed. The collection of such data would take some time, and would
have the effect of considerably slowing progress, which could, of
course, be one reason for suggesting it.

WHO HOLDS THE GOVERNANCE REINS?

A taskforce of the International Capital Markets Group (ICMG) has
released a report entitled Who holds the reins?, focusing on the
international dimension of corporate governance, from a review of
corporate governance practices and issues in countries such as the US,
UK and Canada.

The taskforce encourages all major companies to disclose the key areas
of their corporate governance processes so that they have appropriate
checks in place to direct and manage businesses, and so that investors
understand that differences exist between countries. The taskforce
however ruled out the idea of prescribing an international standard for
corporate governance because, as ICMG members stated: 'Governance is
about behaviour. It is deeply rooted in national cultures which vary
widely, reflecting the economic, social and legal traditions of each
country.'

ICMG is encouraging debate on its recommendations among its constituent
members - the Federation Internationale des Bourses de Valeurs, the
International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and the Section on
Business Law of the International Bar Association.

Copies of Who holds the reins? are available from IFAC, 114 West 47th
Street, Suite 2410, New York, NY 10036.

IASC LOOKS AGAIN AT SEGMENTAL REPORTING

The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), has published
an Exposure Draft, E51 on segmental reporting which proposes major
changes to its existing standard, published 15 years ago.

E51 proposes to change the way in which segments are identified and add
several new segment disclosure requirements. It would also make an
enterprise's internal organisation and management structure and its
system of internal financial reporting to the chief executive officer
the basis for identifying the dominant source and nature of risks and
therefore the business or geographical segments reported.

A safety net provision will ensure that if there is evidence that
internally reported segments combine parts of the business with
different risks and returns, they must be disaggregated for external
reporting purposes.

The E51 proposals are the result of cooperation between IASC and North
American standard-setters, as well as extensive consultations with
financial analysts and multinational corporations.

EUROPE: FEE STATES GROWTH IN ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITING

FEE has published a survey called Environmental accounting, reporting
and auditing: Survey of current activities and developments within the
accountancy profession covering all 15 European Union countries, as
well as Iceland, Israel, Norway and Switzerland.

It concludes that there is clear and definite growth in the importance
attached to environmental accounting, reporting and auditing in
business across the EU, but environmental information is still largely
restricted to qualitative information with no assessment of the
financial impact.

The survey is based on the responses to a questionnaire circulated
among FEE's 34 member organisations in 22 countries.

FEE said that: 'The development of an accounting and management
reporting framework which specifically addresses environmental issues
is perhaps some way off. In the meantime, firms should be encouraged to
disclose more detailed environmental information in their financial
statements with an indication of the financial impact, while auditors
should cooperate more closely with experts and advisers from other
disciplines in the environmental field.

ECO-AUDIT STANDARDS ARE 'ACCEPTABLE'

EU Environment Ministers meeting in Brussels on 18 December raised no
objections to the British, Irish and Spanish standards for eco-audits.
The standards need formal recognition under the EU's environmental
management and audit system regulation, which came into being last
April. The British standard BS7750, the Irish Standard IS310, First
Edition and the Spanish standard UNE77-801(2)-94 were referred to the
Council of Ministers owing to disagreement in the EMAS regulatory
committee.

EU GREEN ACCOUNTING GUIDELINES PUBLISHED

Businesses in the EU can now include environmental expenditure in their
annual accounts. Guidelines have been drawn up by the Accounting
Advisory Forum as an advisory document for the EC, and focus on
applying the provisions in the EU's 4th and 7th Company Law Directives
on annual and consolidated accounts to environmental considerations.
Although not legally binding, they are the only green accounting
guidelines to be formulated at EU level so far. The EC is urging
companies to use them in response to a growing insistence by
shareholders and investors that companies shoulder their environmental
protection responsibilities, although it said that the report does not
reflect its official position.

The objective of the guidelines, entitled Environmental issues in
financial reporting is to ensure that company accounts paint an
accurate picture of:

- a company's attitude towards the environment, and

- the impact of environmental risks and liabilities on a company's
financial position.

The document provides recommendations on the definition and disclosure
of environmental expenditure and the recognition, measurement and
disclosure of environmental risks and liabilities.

AUSTRALIA: SOCIETY CALLS FOR E50'S WITHDRAWAL

The Australian Society CPAs is calling for the immediate withdrawal of
E50, the ISAC's proposed International Accounting Standard on
intangibles. In an unprecedented public attack on IASC actions, ASCPA
president Jim Kropp said the proposed standard 'out of touch with the
modern economy' and will 'discriminate against companies which have
assets of this kind'.

'There is a need to reassess how to measure, recognise and disclose
identifiable intangible assets - and this should not be done by
redefinition of terms nor by taking the issue outside the context of
existing standard.'

The Society has sent the IASC a submission based on a recent Society
report Accounting for identifiable intangible assets including
goodwill. The report argues that intangibles should not be treated any
differently from other assets.

Jim Kropp, a partner in Price Waterhouse, Sydney, maintains there is
increasing diversity among international standards addressing the
recognition and measurement of assets.

'In this draft, for example, there are many exemptions, as well as
inconsistencies with other international standards such as IAS 16
'Property plant and equipment' and IAS 22 'Business combinations' which
would penalise enterprises developing or holding intellectual assets.

'What we most strenuously object to is the impact on those enterprises
with intangible assets.' In most cases, these companies will be forced
to amortise the asset within 20 years - a period which is often much
less than the useful life of the asset - and a period which will force
companies with extremely valuable intangibles to suffer a paper loss in
real company value. 'Such a harsh approach is unwarranted and out of
touch with modern economic reality.'

Kropp said that some assets have an indeterminate useful life and would
be best measured by subjecting them to a recoverable test rather than
the amortisation regime advocated in E50. The Society also criticised
the restrictive approach taken to initial recognition of an intangible
asset being based solely on cost. The use of an 'other value' approach,
provided it can be reliably measured, is appropriate, particularly in
relation to intangibles, the submission states.

The ASCPA wants E50 to be withdrawn and reconsidered by the IAS
Steering Committee.

'In its current form, the Society would not recommend to the Australian
Accounting Standards Boards and the Public Sector Accounting Standards
Board to pursue Australian harmonisation with this draft standard,'
Kropps said. 'This is a good example of why Australian standard-setters
should maintain strong influence over the direction of international
standards.'

GOODWILL ED ISSUED

'The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), and the Public
Sector Accounting Standards Board (PSASB), have approved the issue of
an Exposure Draft which proposes changing the accounting standard on
goodwill to require entities to amortise goodwill on a straight-line
basis.

They say the effect of the amendments would 'make the Australian
standard and existing practice more comparable with standards and
practices in most other countries.'

The main effect of the proposal will be to preclude the use, by a small
number of entities, of the 'Inverse Sum Of the Years Digits' (ISOYD)
and similar methods.

The ISOYD method results in small amortisation charges in early years
and the defers the bulk of amortisation charges to later years. In
September 1995, the Urgent Issues Group placed a moratorium on the use
of ISOYD method until 1 July 1996, and requested the Boards to clarify
the standard.

The Exposure Draft proposes that the standard will apply to reporting
periods ending on or after 30 June 1996. AASB chairman, Ken Spencer,
notes that the scope of the current review of the standard is limited
to dealing with the issue referred to Boards by the UIG. Consideration
of this issue could not be delayed and considered as part of a more
comprehensive review of the standards. International developments, such
as the new approach to accounting for goodwill being debated in the UK,
are not likely to become clear before the UIG moratorium ends. The
Exposure Draft is open for public comment until 15 February 1996.

ED RELEASED ON NON-CURRENT ASSETS

AASB and PSASB have released Exposure Draft on accounting for non-
current assets. ED 70, proposes amendments to the depreciation and
revaluation standards to remove impediments for entities adopting
current values for non-current assets. The proposed amendments to the
revaluation standard would permit entities to revalue non-current
assets on a progressive basis, as long as all assets within the
relevant class are revalued consistently within a three year period.

The standard, which currently require revaluations of all assets within
a class to be completed as at the same date, is considered to impose an
onerous requirement on public sector entities which have adopted a
policy of revaluing non-current assets frequently and on an on-going
basis.

ED 70 permits entities, adopting a current cost or deprival value
bases, an option in the disclosure of asset value. ED 70 also proposes
that the definition of 'useful life' in the depreciation standards be
changed to reflect the period over which an entity expects to use an
assets rather than the period over which the asset could remain useful
in some other environment.

The Boards say this amendment will ensure that depreciation expenses
are more closely related to the pattern of economic benefits consumed
by the entity and that the amended standards will be more comparable
with pronouncements overseas.

The comment period for ED 70 is short. It closes on 29 February 1996.
The short period reflects the need for public sector entities to adopt
these amendments in preparing their financial reports for 30 June 1996.

EQUITY METHODS PROPOSED

AASB and PSAB have also approved the issue of ED 71, Accounting for
investments in associates by the equity method. The ED proposes that
entities equity account investments in associates in their financial
statements. The Boards note there is a perceived impediment in the
Corporations Law to applying equity accounting on the face of the
financial statements, and companies are disclosing information about
their associates in the notes to the financial statements.

The Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1995 proposes to remove
the perceived legal impediment to equity accounting.

Now the Boards have responded by developing an Exposure Draft which, if
adopted, would bring Australian practices in this area into line with
practice overseas.

The ED proposes that equity accounting be applied in the consolidated
financial statements for all investments in associates and, except in
limited circumstances, the cost method of accounting is to be applied
in the investor's separate financial statements.

Other features of the draft proposals:

- the equity method of accounting is to be applied in respect of all
associates. Associates are defined broadly to include associated
companies, partnerships, trusts and other forms of arrangement in which
the investor has an ownership interest and has the capacity to exercise
significant influence;

- the carrying amount of an equity accounted investment must not exceed
its net market value;

The ED proposes that the subsequent standard will apply for reporting
periods ending on or after 30 June 1997. Closing date for public
comment on the proposals is 31 March 1996.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO BE DERECOGNISED

The Urgent Issues Group (UIG) is continuing to examine the issue of
whether internally generated identifiable intangible assets can be
'derecognised'.

The group notes that the accounting standards AASB 1010 and AAS 10,
Accounting for the revaluation of non-current assets identify the
circumstances in which assets can be revalued downwards, and Statement
of Accounting Concepts ASC 4, Definition and recognition of the
elements of financial statements, identifies the circumstances in which
assets could be derecognised.

At its most recent meeting the UIG concluded that the issue under
consideration was much broader than that the derecognition of only
internally generated intangible assets. The group agreed that it should
clarify that a 'revaluation' included a change in accounting policies
related to the bases of measurement adopted for any class of assets.

A once only change in the basis should be allowed, and that a change
back to a cost basis should be permitted only within the transitional
period.

After this transitional period expires AASB 1010 and AAS 10 will only
allow a downwards revaluation arising from a change in the basis of
measurement when the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its
recoverable amount.

In these circumstances AASB 1010 and AAS 10 will require that the asset
not be revalued below its recoverable amount.

LACK OF CONSENSUS ON DEPRECIATION POLICY

The UIG has been unable to reach a consensus on the treatment of
changes in the rate of depreciation which arise from revised estimates
of useful life or residual value.

The alternatives canvassed by the UIG include depreciating the asset at
the new rate over its remaining life, or adjusting the carrying amount
of the asset by making a catch-up adjustment in the profit and loss or
other operating statement.

The relevant accounting standards AASB 1021 and AAS 4, Depreciation of
non-current assets do not specify how to deal with revisions of
estimates and the requirements of international standards vary as does
practice in Australia.

Discussion at the UIG indicated that most Australian companies adopted
a prospective approach and this was the practice in many overseas
countries.

To reach a consensus, 11 of the 16 UIG members must vote for, and no
more than two vote against, the proposed ruling.

A majority of members favoured the prospective approach but there were
more than two members who did not think it correct. The group does not
plan to discuss the issue any further.

- Peter Day has been appointed chairman of the UIG in place of Peter
Edwards who died last year. Day is currently managing director of Group
Business Services at CRA Ltd. He is a former chairman of the Australian
Accounting Standards Board and a former president of the Group of 100.

BULGARIA: ACCOUNTING FOR BANKS STANDARD APPROVED

A new National Accounting Standard (NAS) 16 has been approved by the
government in Bulgaria to replace the existing NAS 16. It deals with
accounting for banks and non-banking financial institutions.

The new standard focuses mainly on financial statements, but it also
deals with branches of foreign banks and non-banking organisations,
performing banking transactions in Bulgaria with a permit (licence)
issued by the Bulgarian National Bank.

In this standard the Bulgarian National Bank is defined as the
authorised organisation to determine rules of accounting for bank
operations. The most significant difference between the old standard
and the new one is that the detailed regulation of the principles of
accounting for bank operations - which were described at length in the
old standard - is absent in the latter. The other difference is that
the primary accounting documents and ledgers, such as journal of the
operations, trial balance, general ledger, operation ledger etc, were
described in detail in the old standard. The structure of the National
Bank Chart of Accounts, in effect since 1 June 1995, was elaborated in
the old Chart of Accounts, while the new standard only briefly mentions
the existence of such a Chart of Accounts.

Opinions differ. Some experts think that the new Chart of Accounts is
much more concise and clearer. Others - mainly bank experts - say that
it is much more incomplete and insufficient.

NAS 16 has the following structure:

- General provisions - describing the regulations and institutions they
are applicable for.

- Definitions - giving definitions to the term financial institution,
bank transaction, bank operation, individual item, accounting date,
values.

- Characteristics of the accounting policy.
- Specific rules of accounting for bank operations.
- Periodic financial statements. Financial statements.

FRANCE: PEER REVIEW RESULTS PUBLISHED

The auditors' association, the Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux
Comptes (CNCC), and the stock market regulator, the Commission des
Operations de Bourse (COB), have published their annual report for 1994
on the review of audit files of listed companies and investment funds.
The report notes that 94% of the cases were satisfactory, but they
noted problems concerning the treatment of intangibles in group
accounts, the methods for determining provisions, and the completeness
of the financial information provided by companies.

COB and CNCC operate joint committees which review the audit files of
listed companies. This year the committees looked at 90 companies on
the main market and 37 on the second market as well as 39 investment
funds.

The review committees noted that the evaluation of internal controls
had improved and overall the number of problems noted had fallen,
suggesting an improvement in audit quality. However, they said that the
most common problems concerned the calculation of goodwill in
consolidated accounts and other intangibles and their depreciation.
They also thought that the choices made by companies in excluding or
including companies within the consolidation were not well-documented
or explained. They criticised the methods used by some companies in
calculating provisions.

CNCC has a programme of peer review for all audit engagements, although
COB participates only in the examination of the files of listed
companies. In the year under review, in addition to the work on listed
companies, CNCC looked at 4,400 audit files throughout France,
involving the work of 2,200 auditors.

FRANCE: FREE SERVICES FOR NEW COMPANIES

The Ordre des Experts Comptables has undertaken a series of initiatives
designed to encourage newly-formed businesses to use the services of
accounting firms. These will involve free start-up advice and budget
preparation, as well as reduced fees for work during the first three
years of a company's life.

An agreement signed by Rene Richol, president Ordre, and the Minister
of Finance in 1994 provided for free services for individual
entrepreneurs in the first year of their activity, including budgets
and ultimately preparations of the first tax return. To this has now
been added two further agreements, with the Centres de gestion agrees
(management centres) and the chambers of commerce.

Historically the members of the Ordre have regarded the management
centres, a government initiative to provide free advice to small
businesses, as competitors, but they have now agreed to provide
management training for management centre clients, and develop
diagnostic models which would help new small businesses to develop.

The Ordre is offering up to three years of work at reduced fees for
businesses which are members of an Association for the Development of
Young Businesses. In addition it has agreed with the national
organisation of chambers of commerce to provide budgets for business
seeking finance. The chambers of commerce will help validate forecasts.

ISRAEL: COMMISSION REJECTS AUDIT STANDARD

In a surprise move, the Securities Commission has stated that it will
not accept accounts with new style audit report. In December 1995 the
Institute published a new version of the audit reports as part of its
plan to adopt many of the IFAC and IASC standards as soon as possible.

The extended report refers specifically to the extent of the auditors'
work. The standard which was to apply to all accounts ending or after
31 December 1995 was firmly rejected by the Commission which claimed
that the new report is an attempt to reduce the auditors'
responsibilities and liabilities.

The Institute has stated that its only intention remains to explain
clearly the extent of the work of the auditor and reduce the
expectation gap of shareholders and the public. The Institute has
always contended that it has the sole right to set standards and
therefore the Auditors' Council (an office of the Ministry of Justice)
stepping in to settle the dispute has taken the profession by surprise.
The Ministry of Justice is now preparing a legal opinion as to the
authority of the Institute to set standards. Meanwhile the Institute
has agreed that the new standard will only be used on auditors' reports
signed after mid February. Members of the Institute's central committee
and members in general fear that it is yet another example of the
Securities Commission trying to 'muscle in' on the standards making
process. After years of disputes concerning accounting standards, in
the end a joint committee with the Institute, Securities Commission,
Industrialists and the tax authorities was formed. It was assumed that
the audit standards would remain the sole prerogative of the Institute.

ISRAEL: QUALITY CONTROL RULE FACES REBELLION

Israel Pinini, treasurer of the Institute, has mounted a final effort
to prevent the adoption of the new standard for quality control in
accountant's office. He hopes that within a few days he will have
sufficient members (300) to call a special general meeting to block the
new standard, due to be adopted this month. Small practices contend
that the administration and requirements for specialised departments
will create a two tier practice or drive them out of the profession.
The Institute sees the standard as a prelude to adopting ISO 9000.

ISRAEL: LAW INCREASES AUDITORS' LIABILITIES

The new company law currently passing through the Knesset (parliament)
has further increased the profession's anxieties about professional
negligence claims. The new law proposes the auditors must report on all
the actions of directors. The proposal is that they must examine and
comment on not only financial matters but also all aspects of
management and administration and the affect on the company,
shareholders, other interested parties, and the general public.
Meanwhile the director is personally indemnified against his actions.

In addition it is proposed that auditors fees will be set in general
meeting of the members only. This right cannot be delegated to the
directors, even on a temporary basis.

ISRAEL: ROTATION OF AUDITORS IS A MYTH

Government companies are required to change auditors every three years.
In practice the management of the companies postpone the change
whenever possible. The latest example is the Electricity Corporation,
one of the largest and most profitable companies in Israel. Despite the
requirement to appoint a new auditor, the management have successfully
postponed the change indefinitely. As a result, Somekh Chaikan (Price
Waterhouse) remain the auditors and Kost Levary & Forer (Ernst & Young)
lose out.

ITALY: COOPERS' AUDIT APPOINTMENT REVOKED

Coopers & Lybrand have suffered a serious blow as a result of the
Gemina affair. In September a major merger operation - SuperGemina-
Ferfin - was announced followed soon after by revelations of heavy
losses within the Gemina group.

In a newsletter published last month (January), Commissione Nazionale
per le Societa e la Borsa (Consob - the companies and stock market
regulator which also supervises the roll of approved audit firms),
announced that it has instructed Coopers not to use the services of its
partner Renato Bellani for a period of two years. Moreover, the
accountants have had their three-year 1995-1997 appointment as Gemina's
auditors revoked.

In announcing its decision, Consob said: 'The penalty has been adopted
on the basis of the checks carried out on the audit work for the 1992
and 1993 financial statements of Gemina Ratealfactor, of the Gemina
group consolidated accounts for 1993 and consolidated accounts of RCS
Editori at 31 December 1992 and 31 December 1993.'

Following Consob's decision, Coopers said that it seems that Consob has
chosen the Gemina affair to set a pilot decision. 'For the first time,
in fact, a form of objective responsibility has been adopted with
regard to the principal auditors of a group, putting the blame onto
them for the work done by others.'

Making their complaint against the regulator, Coopers said that the
losses which were the subject of Consob's investigations in the Gemina
case, arose in the hire purchase sales sector of RCS Libri & Grandi
Opere and that these losses were not brought into evidence quickly
because of serious shortcomings in the internal controls of the
company. But RCS Libri & Grandi Opere was audited by another firm,
while Coopers audited its parent, RCS Editori, and the group parent
Gemina. Coopers, in accordance with current practice, relied on the
work done by the other, well-qualified, audit firm, which had audited
RCS Libri & Grandi Opere for many years.

Coopers claim that their work was wholly correct and say that the
losses investigated by Consob, in so far as they were reflected in
Gemina's consolidated accounts, arose from sources that were not within
Coopers' competence. 'Consob's decision is therefore unjust and Coopers
will appeal to the regional administrative tribunal to have it
annulled,' said the firm.

ITALY: PROFESSION DISPUTE RAGES ON

The long-running dispute between Italy's dottori commercialisti
(commercial practitioner accountants) and ragionieri (bookkeeper
accountants) on professional titles is continuing. In mid-December the
dottori commercialisti's national council wrote to Prime Minister
Lamberto Dini, in his temporary capacity as Justice Minister, to
express its concern and seek remedial action. The dottori
commercialisti are expected to mount a publicity campaign in which the
problem of professional safeguards for the public will be highlighted.
As university graduates, they object to the use of the title
commercialisti by ragionieri. On the other hand, the ragionieri, who
also wrote to Dini in mid-December, would like to see a single role of
accountants, with the two titles unified. They say that the dottori
commercialisti have brought too many onto their roll, creating an
employment problem that they are trying to solve by taking market share
from the ragionieri.

NEW ZEALAND: AGREEMENT REACHED ON JOINT ED

As part of the commitment by New Zealand and Australia to harmonise
accounting standards, the two accounting standard-setting bodies have
agreed to issue a joint exposure draft (ED) on financial reporting by
Life Insurance companies.

April Mackenzie, director of Accounting and Professional Standards for
the New Zealand Accountants Society, said the main issue is taking the
ED jointly through the final stages. She compared the problems posed by
different regulatory requirements in each country, with those faced by
EU members when tackling harmonisation on other issues.

Mackenzie said that in developing financial reporting standards
particular notice is paid to the position of the International
Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). She believes the achievements of
the IASC will influence New Zealand accounting practices even more over
time.

IASC was represented at a meeting of delegates from standard-setting
bodies in Australia, UK and South Africa, hosted by the New Zealand
Society last year.

NEW ZEALAND: NEW CHEQUE LAW AFFECTS ACCOUNTANTS

New Zealand accountants can no longer deposit crossed non-negotiable
cheques, which are made out in the name of client, in their trust
accounts. Under new banking laws, crossed cheques now cannot be
endorsed for payment to another person and can only be paid into the
account of the named payee. This means accountants who receive payments
on behalf of clients have to make special arrangements to ensure they
can continue to bank the payments in their trust accounts. Preferably
they must ensure the cheque is made out to the accountancy firm instead
of in the client's name. Alternatively they must arrange for open
cheques.

A request to the New Zealand parliament seeking exemption for trust
account operators to continue depositing cheques made out to clients,
into their trust accounts was refused. The law-makers decided that to
give accountants and lawyers this exemption from the new law, would
weaken the protection now provided by the new non-transferable
regulations.

While admitting accountants will suffer some inconvenience, parliament
decided it was more important for the writer of a cheque to ensure it
was paid only to the payee.

In the past there was a widely held belief that crossing a cheque
prevented it from being endorsed and transferred to a person other than
the payee named. In fact under banking law which existed up to 1
January 1996, it did not.

The new law, aimed at preventing fraud says that now a crossed cheque
bearing the words 'Not transferable', 'Non transferable' or 'Account
payee' can only be paid to the named payee. Thieves will no longer be
able to cash stolen cheques by forging an endorsement to themselves or
to a third party.

Another provision of the new banking law is that banks no longer have
to physically transfer paper cheques to the branches on which they are
drawn. Now the details can be done electronically - cutting costs and
speeding up cheque clearance.

NEW ZEALAND: SHARING THE COST OF STANDARDS

The president of the New Zealand Accountants Society, Colin Notley,
agrees with those who argue that the cost of researching and developing
standards should be shared by the business community and others who
benefit from their application.

This argument, said Notley, has been given added strength because New
Zealand's Financial Reporting Standards, when approved by the
Accounting Standards Review Board, now carry legal backing.

'In one sense the Society's Financial Reporting Standards Board - which
does the preliminary work reviewing standards - has become a research
and working arm of government,' added Notley.

UNITED KINGDOM: 'EFFECTIVENESS' SHOULD GO SAYS APB

Interpretation of the word 'effectiveness' when asking directors to
report on internal financial control effectiveness is a sticking point,
according to the Auditing Practices Board (APB). The APB has released
the text of a letter it has sent to Sir Ronald Hampel, chairman of the
newly formed 'Committee on Corporate Governance', setting out its
principal conclusions following consultation concerning reporting by
auditors on the matter.

To build on progress made to date, the APB considers that the Hampel
Committee should:

- Consider further how best to report on internal financial control. In
particular there is the need either to define much more closely the
meaning of the term 'effectiveness' or consider whether there are other
options that would meet the spirit of the original Cadbury proposal but
avoid the need to interpret the term effectiveness. Announcing the APB
conclusions, APB chairman Ian Plaistowe said: 'We believe that auditors
will find it difficult to report on internal financial control
effectiveness unless words are changed. The APB would support words
along the lines of statements used by the BOC Group plc and The Coca-
Cola Company.' The report of the BOC Group directors states: 'The
directors believe that the Group's system of internal financial control
provides reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets are
safeguarded, transactions are authorised and recorded properly and that
material errors and irregularities are either prevented or would be
detected within a timely period.'

- Study further the role of internal auditors in reporting on internal
control. The Cadbury Report did not deal, other than in passing
reference, with the role of internal audit. Internal auditors have an
integral part to play in any regime in which directors and auditors
report on internal controls. In particular, they are likely to consider
the wider concept of non-financial internal controls, whereas the work
of external auditors is focused more on internal financial controls.

The APB letter is a culmination of feedback and consultation which
began in December 1994 when the APB published Guidance for directors.
Implementation of the guidance has resulted in many listed companies
carrying out detailed reviews of their internal financial controls and
commentators believe that, as a result, controls are improving. The APB
held a public debate in June 1995, and in written responses to its
April 1995 discussion paper Internal financial control effectiveness,
commentators expressed strong reservations about the practicality of
auditors reporting on directors' opinions on the effectiveness of
internal financial controls. Philip Ashton, chairman of the APB
Internal Control Working Party said: 'Now the Hampel Committee is in
business, it is timely to look at the issues causing difficulty. Also 1
January 1996 was the date on which it became compulsory for directors
to report on internal controls.'

The APB also supports the majority of companies which responded to
Internal financial control effectiveness in calling for a two-year
moratorium on further reforms. 'This will give everyone an opportunity
to see the best way forward, particularly the Hampel Committee one it
gets fully underway,' said Plaistowe.

UNITED KINGDOM: ACCA SEEKS CHARTERED DESCRIPTION

The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) is one step
away from changing its name to the Association of Chartered Certified
Accountants, and calling its members chartered certified accountants.
The move follows a Privy Council decision, that in principle, it has no
objection to the inclusion of the term chartered in the descriptions of
members of any of the accountancy bodies which has a Royal Charter.

ACCA's Council will now seek the approval of members at the May 1996
AGM with a view to making a prompt application to the Privy Council.
Michael Harvey, ACCA's president said: 'The option chartered certified
accountant would enable the Association to retain the ACCA/FCCA
designation and build on the well-established certified brand.'

ACCA confirmed that from 1 January 1996, it is no longer a member of
the accountancy profession's Joint Disciplinary scheme (JDS). ACCA
claims to have paid 27% (around #850,000) of the costs of running the
JDS compared to 12% when funding arrangements were agreed in the early
1980s, despite not having referred one of its 48,000 or so members in
over ten years.

UNITED KINGDOM: PURE CASHFLOW STATEMENT PROPOSED

The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) proposes to introduce a pure
cashflow statements and to drop the present concept of cash
equivalents. FRED 10, Revision of FRS1 cashflow statements, states that
the definition of cash equivalents has been problematic because
treasury management practices can vary widely.

FRED 10 proposes that instead of including cash equivalents -
investments with repayment dates of up to three months, flows of cash
only would be measured - cash comprising cash in hand and deposits
repayable on demand, net of bank overdrafts. If the ASB's proposals are
adopted, the UK would be the only country to use pure cash as the basis
for preparing cashflow statements.

FRED 10 also proposes:

- A new section on management of liquid resources to provide improved
information on treasury activities.

- The order and headings for cashflows to be altered to accord more
closely with those most likely to be used in the directors' own
commentary.

- To tie the cashflow statement more closely into the balance sheet by
focusing on the effect of cashflows on the widely used financial
indicator 'net debt'.

Introducing the Exposure Draft, ASB chairman Sir David Tweedie said:
'The ASB believes that the changes represent a significant step forward
and will be of real benefit to both preparers and users of accounts.
Not the least of the improvements is the move to a pure cashflow
statement, which I am sure is a major advance.'

Comments on FRED 10 are invited by 8 March 1996.

COUNCILS APPROVE MERGER PROPOSALS

The Councils of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales (ICAEW) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants
have circulated detailed merger proposals to their members for
consultation.

The consultative document, A vision of excellence, sets out the case
for merging the two bodies and explains the key benefits to members of
what it describes as a 'new world class structure'. These benefits
include:

- greater resources to counter increased competition from non-
accountants

- improved services for members and their clients

- increased influence with Government and the European Commission

- common high standards for students in business and practice

- lower subscriptions for many members.

Discussion events have been organised around the UK and overseas and
plans have been made to undertake extensive market research into the
merger. The consultation and research findings will help the Councils
decide whether to ask members to vote on the merger formally at a
Special Meeting in June of this year.

ICAEW president Keith Woodley said: 'I am delighted that our two
Councils have voted in favour of these proposals as I believe that this
is the right way forward for the profession.'

But an ICAEW member based at a Big 6 firm in London told WAR: 'This
would be a step backwards for the profession. Management accountants
will never be treated at the same level as chartered accountants.'

UNITED KINGDOM: EXEMPTION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ON CARDS

Nine out of ten small companies may be freed from all existing
accounting standards if proposals put forward by a working party of the
Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB) are implemented.
The CCAB working party on Big GAAP/Little GAAP's proposed new Financial
reporting standard for smaller enterprises, nicknamed 'Fresse', would
dramatically reduce the disclosure requirements in small companies.

Fresse, which would be issued alongside standards for larger companies,
would replace more than 600 pages of rules with a mere 40. It maintains
the measurement principles in existing standards although they have
been simplified in other areas, and will cover companies entitled to
make use of exemptions under the Companies Act.

Fresse would apply to companies with a turnover of less than #2.8m,
fewer than 50 employees or less than #1.4m of assets but not to
companies where there is a public interest. It could also be applied to
small non-corporate entities.

The closing date for comments is 29 March 1996.

UNITED STATES: AMEX'S VICTORY ON FLORIDA LAW

American Express (Amex) Tax and Business Services prevailed in its
challenge of a Florida statute which prohibited the company's employees
from informing clients that they were Certified Public Accountants
(CPAs).

Previously, the Florida State Board of Accountancy only allowed CPAs to
advertise their certification if they were employed by a licensed
accounting firm with CPA ownership. As a corporation, Amex did not fit
that bill.

Amex's lawsuit against the state board claimed that the Florida statute
was a violation of its employees' constitutional right to free speech.
A Florida federal district court agreed with that charge and issued a
permanent injunction against the state enforcing its statute. 'Telling
consumers that our employees are qualified, trained CPAs is a
(constitutional) right,' said Sarah McKenzie, national director for
Amex. 'This information is important to consumers as they make choices
about their financial advisors.'

McKenzie said that statutes like Florida's were designed to insulate
traditional CPA firms from competition. Although the court's decision
pertains strictly to the state of Florida, she predicted it will have
far reaching effects on the accounting industry.

Florida's attorney general said that the State Board of Accountancy was
disappointed with the court's ruling and had not yet decided whether it
would appeal.

Amex employees provide accounting, tax and financial planning services,
but do not perform any attest functions. Audits and other attestation
engagements remain the sole province of licensed CPA firms.

UNITED STATES: ORANGE COUNTY CLAIMS KPMG WAS NEGLIGENT

Officials of bankrupt Orange County, California recently filed suit
against the county's former auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick. The lawsuit
claims that KPMG was negligent in performing its duties, that the firm
did not adequately warn county administrators of the high-risk nature
of certain investments.

Damages of up to $3bn are sought by Orange County. Defendants to the
action include KPMG partners and principals worldwide.

The negligence claim had been expected for several months. Earlier the
county had sued its former investment adviser, Merrill Lynch for a
similar amount.

KPMG officials said that the claim was just another attempt by the
county to hold someone else responsible for its investment losses. They
stressed that the firm was not hired as an investment adviser of the
county. KPMG's only role was to render judgement on the county's
financial statements and firm officials said the accounts accurately
portrayed Orange County finances.

UNITED STATES: BANKERS PRESS FASB FOR FAS 115 RELIEF

There is nothing like an interest rate swing to change a banker's
perspective.

During 1994, bankers were forced to make difficult decisions about
their investments. Implementing FAS 115, Accounting for certain
investments in debt and equity securities, required banks to classify
their investments as trading securities, available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity. Difference accounting rules applied to each class of
investments.

Some of the banks most volatile investments were classified as held-to-
maturity to insulate bank earnings from price fluctuations. Because of
the banks' stated intent to hold these investments, they were not
required to be written down to market values as bond prices plunged in
1994.

The interest rate scenario improved appreciable in 1995, however, as
did the value of the bankers' investments. So leading up to year-end
1995, bankers lobbied the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB),
for relief from their decisions of a year earlier. FASB accommodated
them by allowing a one-time reassessment and reclassification. Assets
in the held-to-maturity category were allowed to be moved into another
category between 15 November and 31 December 1995.

TORIES BRACED FOR MINORITY GOVERNMENT: SENIOR MINISTERS ADMIT MAJOR MAY
LOSE COMMONS MAJORITY BEFORE END OF 1996

   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby Correspondent

Government ministers yesterday contemplated the probability that Mr
John Major will lead a minority administration later this year, amid
fears that the Conservatives can expect to lose more seats in the House
of Commons.

As left and rightwing Tories indulged in mutual recriminations over the
recent defection of Miss Emma Nicholson, MP for Devon West and
Torridge, to the Liberal Democrats, senior ministers privately admitted
that the government could expect to lose its Commons majority before
the end of 1996 - and that it may rely for survival on the support of
the nine Ulster Unionist MPs.

Ministers played down claims by one left-of-centre Tory that at least
six other MPs were prepared to defect to opposition parties. Yet
several admitted that by-elections triggered by the deaths of MPs would
put the Tories into a Commons minority this year. The departure of Miss
Nicholson means the government can now expect two pending by-elections
to cut its Commons majority to just one, if Sir Richard Body, who
remains outside the Tory whip, is excluded from calculations.

However, despite increasing signs that his party may have to rely on
their support in any No Confidence motion, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland secretary, insisted there would be 'no special treatment' for
the UUP.

'I recognise no difference in the essential equation by reason of
events in the last few days or even a longer period,' he told BBC Radio
4's Today programme.

Other ministers, however, were already contemplating the need for
concessions to the UUP, with one privately conceding that relations
with the Ulster parties would be 'critical' to the government's
fortunes.

Calculations about the government's majority coincided with signs that
the delicate truce between left and rightwing Tories appeared to be
tottering in the wake of the defection.

Mr Michael Portillo, defence secretary, launched a strong attack on
Miss Nicholson, rubbishing her claims that the reason for her defection
had been the party's shift to the right.

'It is very silly to say that the party has tilted to the right - that
is completely incredible,' he told BBC radio. 'I think the party is
probably much the same. We have a broad breadth of opinion within the
party.'

Mr John Redwood, last year's beaten Tory leadership challenger, also
attacked the idea of a rightward shift by the government, claiming Mr
Major's cabinet reshuffle last July had promoted left of centre MPs.

However, Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister, rounded on Mr
Portillo, claiming the party had clearly taken an anti-European stance
and that Miss Nicholson's defection should be heeded. 'There is no
doubt at all that the party has moved to the right,' he said. 'That
can't be denied . . . it may be denied, but if it is denied it is a
false denial.'

Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a pro-European backbencher, also demanded a
halt to the 'torrent of personal abuse' heaped on Miss Nicholson and
called on ministers to rise above the warfare between the party's
wings.

'I would just like them to behave as if they were one cabinet, visible
for all to see and not in such a way where undoubtedly the unhappiness
produced has led to two defections in three months. We cannot afford
any more and I trust we will not have any more,' he said.

TAX SELF-ASSESSMENT WILL HIT SMALL BUSINESS, SAYS LABOUR

   By JAMES BLITZ

The Treasury's plan to allow self-employed managers of small businesses
to assess their own income tax liabilities will come under a strong
attack from the Labour party this week amid claims that it will add
significantly to company costs.

Labour claims self-assessment will place new burdens on small
businesses running into hundreds of millions of pounds. It estimates
the scheme will create extra recurrent costs of Pounds 130m to Pounds
250m a year for self-employed business managers and mean big increases
in red tape.

Mr Andrew Smith, Labour's shadow chief secretary, is also concerned the
scheme contains a 'hidden tax bombshell'. He said yesterday the
introduction of self-assessment later this year would increase the
Treasury's tax take by some Pounds 850m in 1997-98.

Labour is expected to raise its objections to the scheme in the Commons
on Thursday when the Finance Bill is published.

Mr Smith said the increase in tax revenue would occur because the
self-employed would make their assessments next year on the basis of
current-year activities rather than those for the previous year.

Because of anticipated increases in inflation and economic growth, the
change to current-year assessment would allow the Treasury to take more
in tax from the self-employed.

'While the principle of self-assessment makes sense, the way the
government is going about it on the current deadlines is a disaster,'
said Mr Smith.

He revealed that Labour would call for aspects of self-assessment to be
delayed to avoid confusion.

But Mr Smith would give no guarantee that Labour would abandon the
self-assessment plans, arguing that a new government might create new
difficulties by reversing changes of such magnitude.

A spokesman for the Inland Revenue confirmed that the government would
receive the additional Pounds 850m in 1997-98. But he said it was a
'one-off shift' that would not be repeated in future years.

'Overall, self-assessment amounts to a clearer system with more
definite deadlines - and one which people will find easier to operate,'
he said.

WALDEGRAVE GETS TOUGH ON SPENDING TO FINANCE TAX CUTS

   By ROBERT PESTON, Political Editor

Remorseless pressure to bring down public spending to finance next
year's widely expected tax cuts has been promised by Mr William
Waldegrave, chief secretary to the Treasury, in a new year interview.

The chief secretary said he had a long-term aim of seeing public
spending fall to around 35 per cent of gross domestic product, compared
with about 42 per cent at present.

He said this should not be seen 'against the background of a slavish
target of numbers' but because of a 'genuine belief that too much is
done (by government) and a good deal of it is act-ually hindering the
economy'.

His views on the potential for shrinking the government's share of the
economy are strikingly different from those of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, who is not persuaded that there is scope to get the
proportion much below 40 per cent of GDP without damaging public
services.

There is also a significant difference between Mr Waldegrave and Mr
Clarke on European monetary union. Mr Clarke believes that the decision
to participate in a single currency is primarily an economic one.
However, Mr Waldegrave said the decision to join was primarily 'an act
of political will and choice'.

He also hinted that Mr John Major's successful campaign to persuade the
EU to study the implications of two-tier monetary union - with only a
small minority of countries joining the proposed single currency - is
motivated by a desire to delay the project.

'I do think that it is possible to imagine technical questions which
will be raised which will worry those who are going in very much,' Mr
Waldegrave said. 'The damage from a badly established union will be
quite considerable.'

The chief secretary also made it clear that he will contest any
criticism he may face in the Scott report on arms sales to Iraq, due to
be published in the next few weeks. Leaked drafts of the report
criticised Mr Waldegrave for failing as a Foreign Office minister in
the late 1980s to announce an apparent softening in the government's
policy on the arms embargo with Iraq.

Mr Waldegrave, who has made further submissions to Lord Justice Scott,
said: 'My conscience is entirely clear.' He would only consider
resigning if he could be persuaded that his 'memory of the whole
business is so wrong'.

He added that it would not only be his memory that was at fault but
that of 'the whole Foreign Office'.

On next year's public expenditure negotiations, he said he would start
visiting ministries with a view to securing cuts in the early spring.

One of the initial targets of his scrutiny will be the Pounds 15bn cost
to government of public bodies at arm's length from ministries and
quangos. He said he was looking for savings of several hundred million
pounds in their running costs. He will also maintain pressure on
spending departments to substitute private finance for
government-financed capital projects. 'In terms of extra cash flow
there is probably more to come from that,' he said.

His other target will be to step up the government's fight against
fraud, especially in the social security budget.

AILING KING FAHD HANDS OVER POWER TO SAUDI PRINCE: MOVE ENDS
SPECULATION OVER SUCCESSION BUT FUELS DOUBT ON RULER'S HEALTH

   By ROULA KHALAF, Middle East Correspondent

Saudi Arabia's King Fahd handed over the running of the government
yesterday to his half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah, in a development
likely to raise further doubts about the king's health but end
speculation about succession in the kingdom.

A royal order carried by the official Saudi Press Agency said the
73-year-old monarch, who is believed to have suffered a minor stroke
last November, was handing over 'management of government affairs' to
the crown prince while he recuperates.

Prince Abdullah, who is two years younger than the king, is deputy
prime minister and head of the powerful 57,000-man National Guard. He
is seen as more conservative and less internationally minded than the
king, though diplomats said he was unlikely to change the kingdom's
foreign and economic policies.

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter and a close ally of
the US. The decree said the prince would take over while the king
enjoyed 'rest and recuperation'.

The decision makes official a role the prince has played since the king
fell ill.

Although he will officially now chair cabinet meetings and represent
the king on official visits, the move may prove temporary if the king's
health improves, diplomats said yesterday.

'It sounds more like a technical move, a kind of regency,' said one
diplomat in the kingdom. 'The king is still king. What we don't know is
how much he will still be involved and this will depend on his health.'

The king left hospital on December 8 after suffering what was
officially termed a 'sudden indisposition' but is known to have been a
stroke.

Diabetic and overweight, King Fahd was seen on television yesterday
aided by a walking stick as he received Crown Prince Abdullah and
Prince Sultan, the defence minister.

Saudi officials yesterday suggested the move was aimed at putting an
end to speculation of a power struggle within the kingdom.

The talk had been fuelled in recent months by two big shocks. The first
was the monarch's illness, the second a car bomb on November 13 which
destroyed a US-staffed Saudi National Guard communications centre in
Riyadh, the capital.

Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the regime have latched on to these
events from their base in London and claimed a power struggle has
broken out in the royal family.

They viewed the bomb attack on the national guards as an attempt to
undermine Crown Prince Abdullah.

Yesterday's move preceded the unveiling of Saudi Arabia's 1996 budget.
Early indications suggested the kingdom would continue public sector
retrenchment, maintaining expenditures at SR150bn (Pounds 25.8bn), the
same as in 1995.

Faced with a cash crunch resulting from the collapse of oil prices and
the cost of the 1990-91 Gulf war, Saudi Arabia has since 1994 embarked
on a policy of cutting government expenditures and raising non-oil
revenues.

CHIRAC CONCEDES DIALOGUE NEEDED ON REFORMS

   By ANDREW JACK

   PARIS


Mr Jacques Chirac, the French president, made a sharp break with the
practice of his predecessor, Mr Francois Mitterrand, on Sunday night by
raising the political content of the country's traditional New Year's
Eve address from its head of state.

In an address lasting nearly 15 minutes and broadcast on most
television news channels, Mr Chirac devoted much of his time to
defending his decisions over the last few months and how they tied in
to his election campaign promises.

He made patriotic play of France's historical mission and global
importance, and its continued commitment to brotherhood, tolerance and
justice.

Referring to the widespread strike action since last November, which
was prompted by his government's proposed social security reforms, he
called the resulting period one of 'crisis'.

In his strongest statement of support for Mr Alain Juppe, he praised
the 'courage and determination' of the prime minister, as well as the
rest of the government.

However, in a sign of implicit criticism, he said that one lesson to be
drawn from the experience was the need for greater dialogue and
consultation - something which he acknowledged had not been
characteristic of France in the past.

Another lesson - in a jibe at his political predecessors - was that 'it
is no longer possible to govern as we have for the last 20 years' with
only piecemeal reforms. He stressed the need for a country able to cope
with 'global competition'.

He said his aim remained to build a 'new France' based on justice,
unity and resonsibility, and his top priority remained to reduce
unemployment - which remains at more than 11.5 per cent.

He placed less emphasis than in a previous television interview last
October on fiscal rigour, but talked about the need to set up a
creative, productive economy. He pledged that taxes - which have risen
since his election - would be cut as soon as possible.

President Chirac made time to discuss the French commitment to Europe -
a point brought home by the EU's flag hanging alongside that of his own
country on the wall behind him.

However, he also stressed the need for change in the administration of
the EU so that it was 'more attentive' to the daily needs of the
French, including their 'social hopes' and the 'real priority' of
employment.

SCALFARO SEEKS CLARITY ON POLLS

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME


President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has appealed to Italy's political
parties to come forward with clear ideas on how long the government of
Mr Lamberto Dini should last and to give a firm calendar for the life
of the current parliament.

The head of state's appeal was contained in his annual message
delivered on New Year's eve.

The highly political message was delivered in advance of this week's
meeting of the parliamentary group leaders to fix the terms of a debate
on the future of the government following the resignation tendered last
Saturday by Mr Dini, the prime minister.

As expected President Scalfaro rejected the resignation, insisting
parliament must decide. In his message, President Scalfaro reinforced
this point. 'In a few days the debate in the chamber of deputies will
provide the right opportunity to know precisely what the various
political groups want and to see whether a consensus emerges that is
both clear to the general public and useful to the head of state.'

The debate is likely to be staged next week, allowing further time for
the political leaders to negotiate behind the scenes. Until now none of
the main political parties has come forward with a proposal either for
the continuance of the Dini government or a date for general elections.

But Mr Dini, who has been in close touch with the main party leaders,
appeared confident over the weekend that he would remain in office.
Backed by President Scalfaro, he has argued strongly that the country
cannot afford a government crisis and a general election during Italy's
six-month presidency of the European Union which lasts until June.

Despite underlining the importance of parliament, the tone throughout
President Scalfaro's 35-minute New Year's message was of a man who
intended to use his limited constitutional powers to the full. He made
his own preferences plain.

He went out of his way to praise the 11 month premiership of Mr Dini -
so indicating his desire to see the former deputy director of the Bank
of Italy remain at the helm during Italy's EU presidency. He also said
he would like to see the current legislature carry out a proper reform
of the constitution in time for the celebration in 1998 of the 50th
anniversary of its introduction. This was seen as a none too subtle
hint that parliament should not be dissolved before institutional
reform has been tackled.

Yesterday several political parties took exception to what they
regarded as President Scalfaro's overtly partisan stance. In particular
the president's message was attacked by the rightwing National
Alliance, by the Greens and by Reconstructed Communism, which was
formed from the hardline members of the former Communist party.

SAMPAIO LEADS AS PORTUGAL NEARS VOTE

   By PETER WISE

   LISBON


Campaigning for Portugal's presidential election on January 14 began
this week with Mr Jorge Sampaio, the Socialist candidate, showing a
clear lead over Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister for 10 years
until his centre-right Social Democrats were beaten in October's
general election.

Mr Sampaio, a former Socialist party leader who stepped down as mayor
of Lisbon to run for the presidency, was given 41.6 per cent of the
vote in a newspaper poll yesterday, compared with 34.9 per cent for Mr
Cavaco Silva. A weekend poll based on a broader sample of more recent
interviews gave them 50 per cent and 34 per cent respectively.

Since the return of democracy in 1974, Portugal has consistently
elected presidents from the party opposed to the government so that
each acts as a counterweight to the other. Mr Cavaco Silva says that
Portugal will 'capsize' if all political weight is shifted to the
Socialists, who are also dominant in local government.

However, the polls indicate that most voters are inclined to provide
additional support for the Socialists, who are four seats short of a
parliamentary majority, by electing Mr Sampaio. Under Portugal's 'semi-
presidentialist' constitution, the president has the power to dissolve
parliament and call an early election when governments run into
difficulties.

Mr Antonio Guterres, the prime minister, is campaigning for the backing
of a Socialist president. This would help his minority government meet
election commitments both to spend more on social reforms and exercise
the budgetary discipline required to meet the convergence targets for
European economic and monetary union.

Ministers say Mr Cavaco Silva would seize the first opportunity to
dismiss the government if he won the election, although he has pledged
to co-operate fully with the Socialists in the interests of stability.

The former prime minister's attempt at a transition from an aloof
decision-maker to the kind of benevolent figure of tolerance and
concern that Mr Ma rio Soares, the outgoing Socialist president, has
made popular is proving difficult to achieve.

Despite popular respect for his integrity, support for Mr Sampaio, a
less charismatic leader, appears to be based more on disapproval of his
rival, whose government had grown increasingly unpopular before its
defeat, and on backing for Mr Guterres.

The government is avoiding decisive measures, including the
presentation of the 1996 budget, until after the presidential vote. It
hopes the political honeymoon that followed its election can be
prolonged long enough to benefit Mr Sampaio.

RUSSIA PLEDGES TOUGH LINE ON ECONOMY

   By JOHN THORNHILL

   MOSCOW


Russia's economics ministry yesterday pledged it would continue to
pursue a harsh monetary policy designed to stabilise the economy and
cut the monthly rate of inflation to below 2 per cent despite the
strong anti-government protest vote in last month's parliamentary
elections.

However, the ministry's tough stance, contained in an annual economic
forecast, was seemingly at odds with the the softer rhetoric employed
by President Boris Yeltsin in his address to the nation on New Year's
Eve.

'The main task for 1996 is that those in Russia who today are poor
should begin to live better,' he said, promising the government would
rectify the problem of delayed wage and pension payments which has
caused great social distress.

Mr Yeltsin also lashed out at the corruption in financial circles which
was responsible for diverting money intended for social spending.

Last week, Mr Yeltsin criticised the economics ministry, employing
rhetoric reminiscent of the Stalinist era to denounce 'saboteurs' who
were responsible for undermining the reform programme.

He promised to increase payments to pensioners by compensating them for
savings eroded by the hyper-inflation of the early reform years.

Mr Yeltsin's pledges have led some economists to fear that the
government may consider loosening its monetary policy pushing up
inflation early this year. The government may come under intense
pressure to increase spending on social protection to curry electoral
favour before the presidential election in June.

But ministers have repeatedly argued that there is no contradiction
between tight monetary policies and a rise in the standard of living.

PARTIES WEIGH UP RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

Political decisions in Italy are rarely made in a hurry.

No one wishes to assume the responsibility - and risk - of the first
move. This is why the politicians will take their time in deciding the
fate of Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's government even though they have
had ample notice of the administration's limited duration.

Mr Dini tendered his resignation on Saturday to President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, after approving an additional financial package for the 1996
budget. This was his last self-appointed task.

President Scalfaro has now thrown the responsibility back to parliament
to decide what should happen next. This will take the form of a
parliamentary debate later this week or early next week.

Having acquired a taste of power over the last 11 months, Mr Dini is
more than willing to stay on. Moreover, President Scalfaro, who has the
final say on a date for the next general election, is clearly anxious
the former director general of the Bank of Italy should remain in
office.

President Scalfaro believes it is too late for a big political shake-up
now that Italy has the responsibility (since January 1) of the
presidency of the European Union. He thus wants Mr Dini to remain prime
minister - probably with a revamped cabinet - for the duration of the
six-month presidency. But this seems to be part of a broader strategy
by Mr Scalfaro, a former Christian Democrat interior minister, to allow
parliament to survive until 1997, thus permitting more time for a
recreation of the centre grouping which dominated post-war Italian
politics until 1992.

The parliamentary debate is expected to focus on three broad scenarios:

Mr Dini heads the government to ensure a stable EU presidency and
permit elections around June.

Mr Dini presides over a caretaker government with elections held in
late February or early March.

A broad-based government is formed lasting up to two years to permit a
programme of big institutional reforms.

The first scenario involves several variations. For instance, Mr Dini
could seek to maintain the backing of the centre-left parties, headed
by the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) who supported his government
of non-parliamentarians all last year. This would provide a fragile
majority in parliament unless a prior understanding was reached with
the rightwing alliance headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime
minister. The government would be little more than a caretaker, while
the parties indulged in a six-month election campaign.

Alternatively Mr Dini, who has no political base of his own, could try
to broaden the backing for the government to include the small centre
parties in the rightwing alliance. This would have the advantage of
lessening the exposure of the centre-left as the government's main
backer and would provide some chance of parliament pushing through a
few reforms in the next few months. It would also help offset the
destabilising effect of the populist Northern League, which, with
almost 80 deputies, retains considerable power to swing votes.

The second scenario is straight-forward and would mean parliament being
dissolved shortly after the debate on the government's future. Mr Dini
would remain in office but with no real executive power. Given that it
normally takes a good six weeks to two months to form a government
after an election, Italy would be without an effective administration
probably until May.

The third scenario is the most complex. At a minimum it would require a
commitment from the PDS, some of the centre parties and the bulk of Mr
Berlusconi's rightwing alliance to back the idea of carrying out over
the next two years important institutional reforms such as
strengthening the prime minister's position and ending the duplication
of the bicameral system. This would be done either by allowing a
'technical' government to continue as the executive while a special
bicameral commission was formed to draw up the reforms; or a new
government would be formed, drawing ministers from the parties
supporting it. The onus would then be on the government to draw up the
reforms.

Mr Berlusconi has been exploring this idea of a broad-based government
over the Christmas break. His scheduled trial later this month for
corruption probably played a part in his change of mind. But the PDS is
sceptical of his chances, and the rightwing National Alliance (AN), his
main ally, is openly hostile to the idea. The parties themselves are
changing too fast for a broad-based alliance to survive and be useful.

The PDS has the power to force elections simply by refusing to continue
backing Mr Dini; but of late Mr Massimo D'Alema, the party leader, has
dropped his insistence on an early vote. This is because the
PDS-dominated centre-left is increasingly divided on strategy and beset
by doubts about being led in an election by the uncharismatic Mr Romano
Prodi, the Bologna academic and former head of Iri, the state holding
company.

The centre-left staked much on striking an electoral deal with a
movement headed by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the former Milan magistrate.
But Mr Di Pietro may now be prevented from entering politics because of
his own problems with the law that have arisen as a result of
investigations over his abuse of office before he joined the Milan
magistrates' anti-corruption team.

Against this background, the simplest option for the political parties
is to allow Mr Dini to stay with the excuse that Italy needs an
identifiable government to play its full role as EU chairman. This is a
convenient fig-leaf behind which the politicians can hide their
confusion. But it will merely postpone the day of reckoning at the
ballot-box and is unlikely to provide an authoritative government, even
if Mr Dini has proven to be a skilled and ambitious operator of the
system.

PACT TO OPEN UP STATE CONTRACTS

   By GUY DE JONQUIERES

   LONDON


Public procurement contracts valued at several billion dollars a year
will be thrown open to international competition under a World Trade
Organisation agreement which took effect yesterday.

The agreement covers more countries and purchasers - and applies to a
wider range of contracts - than existing rules agreed under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 15 years ago.

In addition to covering services for the first time, the new rules
extend to procurement by sub-central purchasers, such as states,
provinces, departments and utilities, as well as to central
governments.

Though not all WTO members are obliged to participate in the agreement,
it has been ratified by more than 20 governments, including the US, the
European Union's 15 members, Japan, South Korea and Switzerland.
Singapore and several other countries plan to subscribe to it.

The accord excludes defence contracts, EU telecoms and the US regional
and urban public transport sector.

The complex new rules set a variety of thresholds, denominated in
Special Drawing Rights, above which contracts must be opened to
competition. The threshold for central government procurement is
SDR130,000 (Pounds 125,000), for sub-central purchasers about
SDR200,000, and for utilities roughly SDR400.000.

The agreement also lays down specified tendering procedures, to ensure
that foreign bidders and foreign goods and services are treated on the
same basis as those in the purchaser's home country.

GENE CLONING RAISES HOPES

   By DANIEL GREEN

   LONDON


A gene that has been linked with obesity has been cloned, a step that
brings closer a new generation of treatments for the chronically
overweight.

Two companies, Millennium of the US and Roche of Switzerland, describe
the cloning - effectively the manufacture - of the 'ob' gene in the
latest issue of the journal Cell.

The ob gene triggers the manufacture of a protein, leptin, which last
year was been shown to affect the weight of mice with no significant
side effects. But the relationship between leptin and weight in humans
has not yet been established precisely.

The two companies claim to have narrowed research to the gene's
activity in the brain, but further work is probably needed before
development of an obesity drug based on the ob gene could start.

Last year, the US biotechnology company Amgen paid Dollars 20m for to
the Rockefeller Institute in New York, which first identified the gene,
for the rights to products arising from it.

EUROPEAN PRESS REVIEW: BEACON FOR EMERGING DEMOCRACY - RUSSIA

   By JOHN THORNHILL

Democracy can be a baffling business. In Soviet times, Russia's voters
could vote for only one party whose political philosophy was force-fed
to them from birth. In last month's parliamentary elections they had a
choice of 43 parties with each one claiming to have the only answer to
Russia's woes.

Such a drastic democratic upheaval has clearly left many Russians
bewildered and may help explain why more than one-fifth of them opted
for the familiar and voted for the return of the Communists. But the
elections also proved an education for Russia's political leaders who
are now scrambling to learn the lessons before the all-important
presidential elections scheduled in six months' time.

The Magnitogorsk Worker, the local newspaper for the Urals industrial
town founded as part of Stalin's industrialisation drive, encapsulated
many of the confusions and controversies that came to dominate the
campaign. In so doing it reflected, in microcosm, the social pain and
ideological uncertainties that continue to bedevil Russia.

The newspaper, founded in 1930 and still proudly bearing a Soviet
emblem on its front page urging the proletariat of the world to unite,
provided full, lively, and generally fair coverage of the campaign,
encouraging those who see the media as an important factor in the
development of a healthy civil society.

Like most of Russia's local newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker could
have been under enormous pressure from many quarters. The list of six
parliamentary candidates for the city seat included the deputy head of
the local administration and a director of the steel combine which
employs 60,000 workers and dominates the region's economy.

But Mr Georgy Tikhonov, the chief editor, argued that the newspaper's
role was simply to provide an objective forum for the debate and
encourage readers to participate in the vote. 'This newspaper does not
agitate for or against particular candidates. . . it agitates for
something else: for the widest possibility for people to discuss openly
one or another candidacy and the course of the campaign itself. Read,
think, and make your choice]' the newspaper stated.

In comparison with most western newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker
provided few reports and opinions from its journalists but carried
extensive personal contributions from the candidates and scores of
letters from its readers.

Mr Alexander Pochinok, the incumbent deputy who represented the then
pro-government Russia's Choice party in the previous vote in 1993, was
the dominant figure in the campaign for one of Russia's 225
directly-elected seats.

Although he supported the government's harsh monetary policies which
many critics blamed for Russia's social ills, Mr Pochinok boldly
launched his campaign by concentrating on social problems and promising
to improve the lot of the elderly.

But his attempt to seize the mantle of social concern was fiercely
contested by the Communist candidate who wrote an emotional tirade
against the government's policies and promised a restoration of the
certainties of the Soviet era.

These themes were echoed in the opinions of the newspapers' readers who
expressed impassioned and disparate views.

'During the war, millions were evacuated here and resettled. They were
given work and a roof but now they have been thrown out. Every honest
person will vote for the Communists,' said one.

'I do not want to return to the miserable plague-stricken camp of the
past but I fear the thorny road forward to civilisation,' commented
another.

One reader planned not to participate in the elections at all given
they were merely a 'political spectacle distracting the country from
its true problems' while another condemned the newspaper itself for
giving too much space to the 'so-called democrats'.

The Magnitogorsk Worker made clear it was aware of some dirty electoral
tactics during the campaign but did not identify who was responsible
for them in order not to prejudice opinions.

In the week before the vote, it carried an item about a pensioner who
had been contacted by someone claiming to represent the local telephone
company.

'Vote correctly and your telephone bill will be paid in advance for a
year,' the mysterious caller promised.

On the eve of the elections, the newspaper urged its readers to go to
the polls although it recognised that many voters were still confused
by the extraordinary range of parties on the ballot paper.

The results were slow to trickle in and the Magnitogorsk Worker did not
publish the preliminary outcome until three days after the poll. The
electors of Magnitogorsk had returned the pro-market Mr Pochinok as
their local candidate but they had also lodged a strong protest vote
backing Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic
party and the Communists in the simultaneous ballot for the seats
assigned on the basis of proportional representation.

In all, 39 parties - including Russia's Choice - failed to garner
more than the 5 per cent of the vote required to win any of the 225
seats in the 450-strong parliament allocated by proportional
representation. Mr Pochinok, for example, has been elected as a
representative of a party which will be unable to form its own faction
in parliament.

One voter told the newspaper: 'Voting is most democratic. But you must
write that Hitler also came to power in Germany by democratic means. We
must go forward to the presidential elections but people must be
vigilant.'

ZEROUAL PICKS LITTLE-KNOWN DIPLOMAT AS PM

   By ROULA KHALAF

Algerian President Liamine Zeroual has chosen a little-known career
diplomat as the country's new prime minister.

Mr Zeroual, elected president in November, on Sunday named Mr Ahmed
Ouyahia, his 43-year-old head of cabinet, to replace Mr Mokdad Sifi who
had been asked to stay on until the end of the year.

Most Algerians met Mr Ouyahia, who comes from the Berber province of
Tizi-Ouzou, for the first time when he appeared on state television
last July to read a statement telling them that the last round of talks
with the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had collapsed. The FIS
has been battling the government since 1992. Mr Ouyahia is not believed
to have taken a lead part in the negotiations.

That he is among the youngest prime ministers the country has known
points to an attempt by Mr Zeroual to reach out to a younger generation
in a country where more than 70 per cent of the people are under the
age of 30. But Mr Ouyahia's appointment sheds little light on Mr
Zeroual's post election politics.

'Zeroual has opted for a safe pair of hands, a skilled functionary
rather than a political heavyweight,' said one Algerian expert
yesterday. 'It means the composition of the government is not what
really concerns him.'

Mr Ouyahia's government is not expected to last longer than a year
because Mr Zeroual has promised legislative elections, although he has
yet to commit himself to a specific date.

The prime minister's task will centre on overseeing economic reforms
agreed with the International Monetary Fund and preparing for the
elections.

Mr Ouyahia is perhaps best known among his colleagues for arranging an
accord to end the conflict between Tuareg rebels and the Mali
government in 1992, a task which won him recognition as a skilful
negotiator.

He was named ambassador to Mali to oversee implementation of the
accord, before becoming state secretary for co-operation and Maghreb
affairs in 1993.

Although some experts have suggested the choice of a diplomat with
negotiating skills points to a determination on the part of the
president to seek national reconciliation, any negotiations with the
FIS or other opposition parties which opposed the presidential election
are likely to be conducted directly from the president's office rather
than that of the prime minister.

In a system in which the presidency enjoys wide powers, the prime
minister's office is entrusted with more of a management role.

JAPAN PUBLIC PRESSED ON LOAN BAILOUT

   By GERARD BAKER

   TOKYO


Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minster, has urged an increasingly
sceptical Japanese public to accept the government's plan to spend more
than Y685bn (Pounds 4.37bn) in bailing out the country's failed housing
loan companies.

In a New Year message to the nation, Mr Murayama signalled the start of
what is likely to be a fierce political struggle over the bailout in
the new parliamentary session which begins later this month.

The prime minister acknowledged the unpopularity of the plan, which
will cost every individual in the country at least Y5,500, but said it
had been an unavoidable and 'painful' decision.

He promised a full investigation into the causes of the failure of the
seven companies. 'I will try from now on to shed light on the entire
problem,' he added.

Last month the cabinet agreed to allocate Y685bn from next year's
budget to pay for the cost of partially reimbursing creditors of the
bankrupt housing lenders. The government also committed itself to
spending more if the final costs of liquidation turn out to be greater
than is forecast.

The companies, which were established by the leading banks in the
1970s, are on the verge of collapse under a pile of nonperforming loans
which were advanced mostly in a bout of reckless lending to the
property sector during the bubble economy of the late 1980s.

Popular opposition to the principle of spending taxpayers' money has
escalated since the decision was announced and will be exploited by
opposition parties when the parliamentary discussion of the national
budget begins at the end of January.

Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected leader of the main opposition New
Frontier party, signalled his determination at the weekend to oppose
the bailout if the government did not provide a satisfactory and
detailed account of who was responsible for the costly mess.

The government has already attempted to propitiate the public's anger
by hastily removing the senior bureaucrat at the ministry of finance,
Mr Kyosuke Shinozawa. Mr Shinozawa, the administrative vice minister
for finance, resigned last week, in part to take responsibility for the
housing loan problem.

But the opposition wants the blame for the fiasco to be spread much
more liberally among both politicians and bureaucrats.

In its sights are Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, and most
intriguingly, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the international trade minister
and leader of the Liberal Democratic party, the largest coalition
partner. Mr Hashimoto was finance minister during the period when most
of the reckless lending of the housing loan companies was undertaken.

In 1990 the finance ministry issued guidelines to all financial
institutions to curtail their lending to property-related companies.
But the instructions did not apply to the housing lenders which
continued to pour money into highly speculative real estate projects.

The finance ministry has promised a full inquiry into the circumstances
of the housing lenders' demise, and has promised that those found
responsible, bankers, politicians and bureaucrats, will be held to
account.

But even a spate of resignations may not prove enough in the current
political heat. Many members of the socialist party, the second largest
coalition member, are profoundly unhappy about the bailout, as are some
officials in the finance ministry.

If the political pressure intensifies, some members of the coalition
may break ranks and oppose the deal.

Defeat for the government on such a crucial part of its budget plans
for 1996 would have potentially disastrous consequences for its
viability.

INDONESIA'S CONGLOMERATES LOOK TO MARKET FORCES

   By GREG EARL

   JAKARTA


Indonesia's big conglomerates, long regarded as 'crony capitalists'
receiving government favours, are becoming much more dependent on
market forces for their growth, according to a study.

The study of sales and asset growth of the country's top groups,
conducted by the Indonesian Business Data Centre, a private agency,
also shows that 300 businesses are responsible for about half the
country's gross domestic product.

The centre's director, Mr Christianto Wibisono, said the study showed a
distinct move away from reliance on government-awarded licences for
business growth in Indonesia. He said only 27 of the groups were now
dependent on managed trading and monopoly arrangements although many of
the larger groups had been established under those business conditions.

The 300 groups are estimated to have increased sales by 15 per cent in
1994 to Dollars 74bn (Pounds 48bn).

The figures point to some increased concentration in the hands of the
largest groups with the 10 largest recording a 17 per cent increase in
sales to Dollars 26bn. There were 31 groups with total sales of Dollars
350m, accounting for 55 per cent of total sales, whereas in 1993 there
were estimated to have been 24 groups with that level of sales
accounting for 49 per cent of total revenue.

Concentration is more evident on an assets basis with 56 groups
controlling three quarters of the Dollars 118bn in total assets of the
300 businesses.

The dominance of the economy by people of Chinese descent is underlined
by the fact that only 79 of the 300 groups are owned by ethnic
Indonesians and 203 by non-ethnic Indonesians, predominantly Chinese.

While there are few surprises among the company's largest companies,
several new players are fast emerging, with 11 groups estimated to have
grown by 50 per cent in 1994.

CONSERVATIVE ABDULLAH TAKES REINS OF POWER

   By ROULA KHALAF

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who was yesterday entrusted with
the running of the government by his half-brother King Fahd, has been
described as more conservative than the king, less likely to
accommodate the west and possibly prone to pumping less oil to raise
prices.

However, as experts and diplomats were quick to point out, Saudi Arabia
run by the crown prince is likely to follow the same economic and
foreign affairs policies the west has become accustomed to under King
Fahd.

If the king's health improves, the handing over of the running of the
government may be no more than a temporary measure and, until Crown
Prince Abdullah takes over for good, King Fahd will continue to have
the final word on big decisions.

One of more than 30 surviving sons of the late King Abdul Aziz, the
71-year-old crown prince is known as a traditional bedouin who enjoys
important ties to the tribes of Saudi Arabia. The fact that he had a
different mother from the king's other powerful brothers has meant that
he comes from a less prominent branch than the other sons of King Abdul
Aziz.

But as the closest in age to King Fahd, he was named crown prince when
the latter took over in 1982. Although this has been a source of
rivalry with the rest of the clan, the sons of Abdul Aziz are known to
stick together when times get rough.

The crown prince is well respected and known for a stutter which seems
to disappear when giving public speeches. The bedouin base is his main
source of strength. Since 1963, he has commanded the National Guard, a
largely bedouin force which looks after internal security and acts as
counterweight to the army.

In view of his strong links to Syria and the Palestinians, as well as a
reported reluctance to allow American troops to set up their base in
Saudi Arabia during the 1990 Gulf war, the crown prince is believed to
be less internationally minded than his half-brother. He is not known
to speak English, for example, and has played a role in cultivating
links with the Arab world.

This, however, say diplomats, is unlikely to have a bearing on the
Kingdom's close ties to the west, especially the US. 'The US alliance
is a vital strategic alliance which the Saudis will not do much to
change,' a diplomat said.

Moreover, according to Saudi observers, the crown prince played a
prominent part in drumming up public support within the Kingdom for the
Gulf war.

'He is more decisive than the king but less reflective perhaps,' said
one veteran Saudi observer who knows the crown prince. 'The king is
very cautious and tends to see procrastination as a virtue. Abdullah is
less hesitant in his style and quicker to judge.'

Such a style, said the observer, may translate into more forceful
dealings with Islamic fundamentalists who have bombarded the kingdom
with faxes from a propaganda base in London.

Islamic dissidents are also suspected of having perpetrated the
November 13 bomb attack on a US-staffed Saudi National Guard
communications centre in Riyadh.

As the budget unveiled yesterday suggests, economic reforms started in
1994 will continue. Faced with collapse of oil prices, Saudi Arabia has
had to clamp down on spending in recent years, give the private sector
a larger role and boost non-oil revenues.

In an address to the nation, Crown Prince Abdullah said: 'No doubt you
know the financial situation that emerged from the (1991) Gulf war and
that your government had (earlier) promised to continue its treatment
so matters could return to what they used to be - strength and
balance.'

The kingdom in recent years has been committed to keeping crude output
at 8m barrels a day in order to avoid a repeat of the mid 1980s, when
it was faced with falling prices and falling production. Diplomats said
yesterday that the crown prince was in the 1970s believed to favour a
policy of holding back production.

'I think the crown prince will continue the policy of keeping oil
prices stable, and the kingdom cannot relax on the economic front but
will have to continue with reforms,' a diplomat said.

As reforms are pursued, however, diplomats said that for as long as the
crown prince was only acting on behalf of the king, he would have to
find a way to accommodate the king's other prominent brothers to
minimise friction.

This may mean that he will resort to consultation and seek the
co-operation of powerful members such as Prince Sultan, defence
minister and next in line of succession.

TALKS TO RESUME ON US BUDGET IMPASSE

   By PATTI WALDMEIR

   WASHINGTON


US President Bill Clinton will meet congressional Republican leaders
later today to resume talks on ending the protracted federal budget
dispute, after extended negotiations over the New Year weekend failed
to yield agreement either on balancing the budget, or on the more
immediate problem of ending the partial government shutdown.

Mr Clinton and Republicans met throughout Saturday and Sunday, before
recessing for New Year's Day. Both sides said no significant decisions
were taken during those negotiations, which focused on outlining areas
of disagreement.

But Mr Bob Dole, Senate majority leader, said negotiators were now
ready to 'start making the tough decisions'. And there were signs of
some flexibility from radical freshmen Republicans in Congress: several
of them, interviewed on weekend television programmes, made clear that
they were willing to compromise on the Dollars 245bn (Pounds 159bn) tax
cut included in their plan, saying balancing the budget was more
important than cutting taxes. Mr Clinton favours a much more modest tax
cut.

Mr Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, said today's negotiations
would focus on 'trade-offs' between cuts in healthcare spending, taxes
and welfare needed to balance the budget over seven years, as agreed by
both sides in November. There was no sign at the weekend that the two
sides had resolved the basic philosophical dispute which underlies the
budget impasse: whether to shift power away from the federal government
to the states, as the Republicans want; and whether to curb guarantees
of healthcare for the poor and elderly.

Both issues are likely to influence the outcome of this year's
presidential election campaign, which will soon shift into top gear
with a concentration of state presidential primary elections in
February and March.

Parallel efforts will resume today to solve the more immediate problem
of getting federal employees back to work, and ending the shutdown,
which has already lasted more than a fortnight.

The President and First Lady spent New Year's Eve and Day away from the
frustrations of the budget impasse, celebrating with 1,000 friends at
the Hilton Head resort in South Carolina, where they attended a
traditional New Year seminar to debate subjects such as 'morals,
manners, and today's pop culture' and 'politics, media and the decline
of civility'.

RHODES' HEIRS RETURN TO ZAMBIA'S COPPER MINES: AFTER 25 YEARS OF
NATIONALISATION, BOARDROOMS IN JOHANNESBURG AND LONDON MAY AGAIN
DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF ITS MAIN INDUSTRY

   By TONY HAWKINS

Cecil John Rhodes would have relished the irony.

Twenty five years after Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's founding president,
nationalised the country's copper mines, the government of President
Frederick Chiluba may be on the verge of taking the first step towards
meeting its promise to put the industry back into the private sector.

Negotiations with Anglo American Corporation for a feasibility study
for the development of the Konkola copper mining project are close to
conclusion, say industry officials.

It would be a move as rich in symbolism as the 1969 take-over itself,
seen at the time as heralding a new era for a country that was once
little more than a fiefdom of Rhodes' British South Africa Company.

Rhodes' vision of the company blazing a commercial trail from the Cape
to Cairo, in the name of an empire run by Englishmen, 'is now buried -
I hope and pray, never to rise again in this part of Africa,' declared
Mr Kaunda, architect of what turned out a disastrous socialist
programme.

Once again, however, boardrooms in Johannesburg and London could
determine the development of an industry still at the heart of Zambia's
economy, accounting for more than 90 per cent of export earnings.

With reserves at the Nchanga copper mine, which supplies ore to the
state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), likely to be
exhausted by the end of the decade, the government is under mounting
pressure to give the go-ahead for the Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m)
Konkola project.

Although widely anticipated, the decision to invite the South African
mining house, which has a 27.3 per cent stake in ZCCM, to prepare a
study and lead a consortium to develop the new mine will be
controversial, not just because Anglo American is being invited back.
The Konkola decision will also have far-reaching implications for the
privatisation of ZCCM itself.

While Zambia's privatisation programme has accelerated in the past year
 - by the end of September, 87 out of 217 business units had been
processed, resulting in a significant inflow of new investment and
expertise - progress in dealing with the politically sensitive copper
mining industry has been slow.

Whereas privatisation of dozens of small state-owned businesses has
passed off with little controversy, the sale of the crown jewels, in
the form of ZCCM, is a different matter, not least because Mr Kaunda is
back on the campaign trail, preparing to contest next October's
presidential elections.

United Nations Conference on Trade and Development figures, published
last month in the World Investment Report, estimate an inflow of more
than Dollars 350m in new foreign investment since the 1991 elections.
In the last year a number of multinationals have returned to, or
expanded operations in, Zambia by buying state-owned companies.

The list includes Tate & Lyle in sugar, Unilever and HJ Heinz in food
processing and toiletries, the Commonwealth Development Corporation in
cement and agriculture, South African Breweries in brewing and Anglo
American in hotels.

The net result is that Zambia attracted more foreign investment in
1991/94 than any other sub-Saharan country, except oil exporters
Nigeria and Angola.

Nevertheless, the announcement of ZCCM's privatisation just months
before elections may seriously damage the prospects of Mr Chiluba's
Movement for Multiparty Democracy.

The past four years of structural adjustment have been extremely
painful, with falling per capita incomes, rising unemployment, high
inflation and interest rates and plummeting industrial production.

That all of this was necessary to turn around an economy brought to its
knees by 27 years of mismanagement by Mr Kaunda's United National
Independence party (UNIP) may count for little when voters come to cast
their ballots.

Economic reform would have paid dividends far more rapidly had the
privatisation programme, now beginning to show real results, been
implemented both sooner and more efficiently; had the country not had
two droughts; and, most important, had the copper mines been able to
exploit a period of strong demand and high prices.

Figures for the first nine months of 1995 point to copper output of
about 325,000 tonnes this year, down 8 per cent on 1994 and less than
half the average of over 700,000 tonnes a year in the late 1960s.

In cost of production terms, ZCCM is in the top 10 per cent of global
producers. Competitiveness will deteriorate further when costs grow as
Nchanga nears the end of its economic life, and the industry suffers
from the cumulative effects of undercapitalisation, inadequate skills,
reinvestment and maintenance spending, and weak management.

If all goes to plan, Konkola will be developed as a joint venture
between the government, whose contribution is likely to take the form
of providing already existing smelting and refining capacity - thereby
further weakening the rump of ZCCM itself - and a Anglo-led
consortium, which may take some 60 per cent of the equity in the
scheme.

While such an arrangement makes sound commercial sense, it will leave
Mr Chiluba open to the criticism of privatising ZCCM by stealth.

An agreement in principle to develop Konkola, however, will reassure an
increasingly restive donor community.

The response from the finance minister, Mr Ronald Penza, struck an
equivocal note, speaking of the need for 'the utmost caution' in
privatising the mines.

'We must have the necessary political support,' he said - which was
interpreted by some donors as political shorthand for more delay.

SRI LANKA'S WAR EUPHORIA FADES

   By AMAL JAYASINGHE

   COLOMBO


The euphoria that erupted when Sri Lanka's military scored a
significant victory last month over separatist Tamil rebels in their
northern stronghold of Jaffna has sharply diminished with steep price
increases coming into effect in the New Year to pay mounting war bills.

President Chandrika Kumaratunga yesterday promised to press ahead with
a carrot-and-stick strategy to end more than two decades of ethnic
violence which has claimed more than 50,000 lives.

'The economic cost of the war will have an all-round effect in terms of
higher prices,' Mr GL Peiris, deputy finance minister, said. 'This is
a war for peace, so there is no question that we have to find the
resources for it.'

The government estimates that the war against the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) will cost Dollars 760m (Pounds 495m) this year, up
from a provisional Dollars 640m in 1995.

The seemingly unending fighting was felt by the tiny Colombo Stock
Exchange, which shed 33 per cent of its value during 1995. Amid falling
foreign reserves, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 8 per cent
against the dollar in 1995.

Yesterday the government lifted a ban on local banks raising capital
abroad, in an attempt to reduce domestic interest rates, which last
month galloped to 105 per cent amid a cash flow crisis.

It is also raising telecommunications charges by 20 per cent, bus fares
by 50 per cent and electricity tariffs by 20 to 100 per cent, depending
on the rate of consumption.

However, Mr AS Jayewardena, the central bank governor, said the
economic picture should improve in 1996, with foreign capital inflows
expected to rise with the sale of state enterprises.

The government is hoping to attract Dollars 420m in foreign capital
from privatisation, including the sale of the telecommunications
operator and the national airline, AirLanka. The projections are
considered too optimistic by private analysts.

Government politicians said the rising prices and the government's
failure to turn the military success into a political victory had
turned initial enthusiasm into despondency.

Despite the fall of Jaffna, the Tigers have shown that they are still
able to carry out spectacular guerrilla attacks using suicide bombers.
Army camps and convoys have been targeted by lone Tiger guerrillas
laden with explosives.

Tamils who fled the fighting in Jaffna are sheltered in areas of the
country's north still under rebel dominance. The Tigers say they will
not allow civilians to cross over to government-held areas of Jaffna,
though defence analysts say that doing so would help the Tigers to go
home and revert to hit-and-run attacks against the army.

The military on the other hand is ill-equipped to supply its
35,000strong force in Jaffna because all land routes to the region are
dominated by the rebels. They depend on the minuscule air force and the
navy.

Mr Anuruddha Ratwatte, deputy defence minister, said the army would
soon open a land route to Jaffna. It would mean a fresh offensive that
would cost many more lives, officials said, and the army was already
bracing for it.

ZEDILLO RESHUFFLES CABINET

   By DANIEL DOMBEY

   MEXICO CITY


A year to the day after he lost his finance minister in the fall-out
from Mexico's botched devaluation, President Ernesto Zedillo last week
made further changes to a government still struggling with the
unpopularity unleashed by the currency crisis.

Mr Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, who as energy minister was criticised for
links to the old guard of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party,
has been replaced, along with Ms Norma Samaniego, the country's
comptroller general, who was thought to be keeping too low a profile to
get to grips with Mexico's allegedly rampant corruption. Mr Carlos
Salomon, the head of Mr Zedillo's press office and frequent target of
complaints about the administration's news management at times when
speculation about government changes unsettled the peso, has also been
removed.

The alterations leave key economic posts unchanged and do not indicate
any big shift in strategy. While the new energy secretary, Mr Jesus
Reyes Heroles, spent much of the previous administration advocating a
more interventionist economic approach, the new comptroller general, Mr
Arsenio Farell, helped push through the wage-labour pacts that then
provided the centrepiece of economic policy.

Mr Zedillo's supporters claim the alterations draw a line under the
political difficulties of the government's first year and set the stage
for further reform. But other observers deem the changes a tardy
reaction to months of criticism.

'This is a defensive move. It does not take the initiative as a more
thorough going reshuffle would have done,' said Mr Juan Molinar, a
politics professor at El Colegio de Mexico, a graduate research
institution.

Mr Zedillo does not face a nationwide electoral test until
congressional elections due in 1997. But he can ill afford a repetition
this year of 1995's election results, which saw the main right-wing
opposition party establish control over roughly a third of local
government, and win three of five governorship elections.

With the government predicting an economic recovery of only 3 per cent
growth this year, Mr Zedillo's new appointees will find themselves the
focus of added attention in their tasks of managing the government's
relationship with the press, reducing bureaucratic profligacy and
reforming and attracting new investment to the country's energy sector.

FT GUIDE TO 1996


JANUARY

1st Italy takes over the presidency of the European Union, the EU's
customs union with Turkey starts, and Copenhagen begins its term as
European Cultural Capital. Austria celebrates its 1,000th anniversary
as a nation this year.

8th The return of George Michael, whose new single, Jesus To A Child,
goes on sale today. It is his first release since he ended his contract
with Sony Music, and also the first record release for DreamWorks, run
by its billionaire co-founder, David Geffen.

12th - 17th Fifth World Hot Air Airships Championships in Aosta, Italy.

14th Portuguese presidential elections - first round. Outgoing
President Mario Soares, who is completing his second five-year term,
cannot stand again.

17th Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia movement, goes on
trial in Milan, charged with bribing officials of the Guardia di
Finanza (financial police). A guilty verdict could destroy Forza Italia
and damage the right-wing alliance of which it is the core.

19th Annual summit of Comesa (Common Market of Eastern and Southern
Africa) in Windhoek.

Japan - US aviation talks in Tokyo.

20th Palestinians elect their own assembly for the first time in
history. Over a million registered voters in Gaza and the West Bank
will choose a legislative council and a president of the council.
Yassir Arafat leads the betting to become president. His Fatah party is
expected to do less well, but will almost certainly emerge as the
single biggest bloc.

21st The approximate start of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting.
The precise timing depends on the first sighting of the crescent moon.
Office hours in some countries are limited.

23rd Another Milanese corruption trial. Giorgio Armani, Gianfranco
Ferre and other Italian fashion stars face the court charged with
corruption over allegations that fashion houses paid tax inspectors for
lenient audits.

28th Superbowl XXX in Phoenix closes the American football season.

FEBRUARY

1st - 6th The annual gathering of the political and business clans at
the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

2nd Daiwa Bank due to withdraw from the US for concealing bond trading
losses.

7th Haiti continues its crawl towards democracy, as President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide hands over power to Mr Rene Preval, his
ideological clone, who won the December election. But Mr Aristide is
not ready for retirement and will stand again in 2000.

9th A look at one of the few artistic phenomena to have run the course
of the century: 'Abstraction in the 20th century: Total Risk, Freedom,
Discipline', an exhibition at New York's Guggenheim Museum until May
12.

14th The cricket World Cup starts, to be played in India, Pakistan and
Sri Lanka. Traditionally the World Cup chains most of south Asia to the
television set while evoking only modest interest elsewhere.

Now is the time to claim that you are the long lost heir to the Tsarist
crown. At New York's Metropolitan Museum from the 16th, the exhibition
Faberge in America features Imperial Easter Eggs commissioned by the
last Tsars. Later in February, the remains of Russia's final Tsar,
Nicholas II, will be buried in St Petersburg.

18th Polish referendum on methods of privatisation.

19th The Chinese Year of the Rat begins. Rat years have been auspicious
for Japanese stock prices.

20th A good day for rice growers outside Indonesia. This year Idul
Fitri, the celebration at the end of Ramadan, the Islamic fasting
month, falls before the main Indonesian rice harvest is completed. Rice
demand peaks during Idul Fitri, so the country's rice bowl managers are
scouring the world for supplies.

20th New Hampshire opens the US presidential primary season proper,
though Iowa will have chosen the first delegates in party caucuses on
February 12. Bill Clinton is unopposed on the Democratic side so the
main interest centres on whether any Republican can stop Senator Bob
Dole. After New Hampshire the primaries come thicker, faster and
earlier than ever, with 24 states holding them by March 26. The two
main parties' nominations could thus be decided by Easter.

MARCH

1st - 2nd Heads of state meet for the first ever Asian-EU Summit in
Bangkok.

2nd Alan Greenspan's second four-year term as chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board expires. President Bill Clinton will probably nominate
him for a third term, in order to minimise disruption in the financial
markets during the election campaign.

3rd Spain holds general elections a year before schedule, with the
conservative Popular party expecting its first crack at government.
Knee-deep in scandals, Felipe Gonzalez's minority Socialist government
could not postpone the day any longer, as its allies have walked out.
But Gonzalez is still a man to watch, and the outcome could be closer
than the conservatives think.

8th United Nations troops to leave Rwanda.

Japan's budget to be passed at an ordinary parliamentary session.

15th - 17th Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson formally hands over
power to his successor Goran Persson at a Social Democratic party
congress.

16th - 17th Robert Mugabe seeks a new term in Zimbabwean presidential
elections.

Gianni Agnelli, 74, is expected to hand over as Fiat chairman to Cesare
Romiti, 72, perhaps some time around Agnelli's 75th birthday on March
12. Romiti, only the second non - family chairman in Fiat's history,
will preside over an interregnum, probably preparing for the fourth
generation: Giovanni Alberto, Gianni's nephew.

23rd Taiwan holds its first presidential election by universal suffrage.

25th - 27th Inter - American Development Bank annual meeting in Buenos
Aires.

29th The EU's inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht
treaty opens in Turin. The conference later switches to monthly
meetings between EU foreign ministers. The IGC will consider beefing up
the EU's common foreign and security policy, and extending powers to
the European Parliament. Germany is leading calls for more majority
voting, but the UK is resisting. Insiders therefore predict an IGC
deadlock in late 1996, followed by an agreement with a new government
after the UK general election, to be held by April 1997.

APRIL

1st The world's largest bank, the newly merged Bank of Tokyo -
Mitsubishi, opens. The bank will not just be big - by Japanese
standards it will also be financially strong, with one of the lowest
proportions of non-performing loans on its balance sheet and a wide
presence in international markets.

The merger is expected to herald a broader consolidation of the
Japanese banking industry, as the other large banks seek partners to
enable them to compete with the new giant.

1st China plans to slash import tariffs on 4,000 items to an average 23
per cent in its quest for WTO membership.

9th - 12th International Atomic Energy Agency conference in Vienna on
10 years after the Chernobyl disaster

11th Uniquely in recent European history, a former prime minister goes
on trial charged with complicity in a murder. Giulio Andreotti of Italy
faces a Perugia court over the death in 1979 of the journalist Mino
Pecorelli.

11th - 12th US Masters golf in Augusta

14th South Korean parliamentary elections

15th - 16th European Bank for Reconstruction and Development annual
meeting in Sofia.

15th - 16th Ministerial meeting between the EU and Rio Group countries
in Cochabamba, Bolivia.

16th - 18th President Clinton visits Japan.

20th to May 11th Unctad four-yearly conference in Midrand, South
Africa. The heads of state of 187 countries are invited.

21st Queen Elizabeth II turns 70

India will probably go to the polls in April for a general election
unlikely to deliver a strong, single party government. The campaign
will be dominated by opposition allegations of Congress party
corruption. Congress will portray the right-wing, Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata party as being divisively based on religion. Economic
issues may not feature heavily, aside from BJP appeals to 'economic
nationalism'.

30th Deadline for completing negotiations on liberalising basic
telecommunications services, under auspices of the World Trade
Organisation.

MAY

9th The day by which South Africa has to unveil its new constitution.
Among the issues to be resolved are whether there will still be a
government of national unity and the powers of the provinces.

9th - 20th The Cannes Film Festival

16th The Dominican Republic votes in a presidential election which, for
the first time in 30 years, will involve neither Joaqun Balaguer nor
Juan Bosch, the two octogenarians who have dominated the country's
politics. Mr Bosch has retired because of poor health, while Mr
Balaguer cannot stand for a seventh term because changes in the
constitution prevent consecutive terms.

17th The trial of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the Oklahoma
City bombing of 1995 is due to open.

17th to August 25th. The Glyndebourne Festival Opera in southern
England. The pick of the 1996 festival will be Handel's 'Theodora' and
Berg's 'Lulu'.

21st - 22nd Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development
annual meeting of finance, foreign and trade ministers.

22nd Degas: Beyond Impressionism exhibition. Degas achieved fame with
his work of the 1870s and 1880s, above all with pictures of the ballet
and the racecourse, but his experimental later work has never been
properly studied, and this will be the first big show devoted to it. It
runs at the National Gallery, London, until August 26, and moves to the
Art Institute of Chicago in September.

22nd World Health Organisation publishes the World Health Report, which
is expected to highlight the danger of bacterial resistance to drugs.
Such infections as tuberculosis and gonorrhea have become resistant to
drugs and have outpaced the development of antibiotics to control them.

22nd - 24th The African Development Bank annual meeting in Abidjan.

31st The World Health Organisation marks World No-Tobacco Day.

31st - June 1st The Czech Republic's first general election since its
'velvet divorce' from Slovakia in 1992. The centre-right Prime Minister
Vaclav Klaus leads the polls.

JUNE

5th Opec general conference in Vienna.

Vietnam's eighth Communist party congress is due to take place in Hanoi
this month.

8th - 30th European Championship soccer. Can the persistently mediocre
England team use home advantage to win its first important trophy in 30
years? The game against the Netherlands should be testing, and the one
against Scotland colourful. The match with the least tourist potential
is Bulgaria versus Romania in Newcastle. The Germans, the Italians and
the Dutch are the best bets to win the championship, and the Turks are
the worst.

10th Annual meeting of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),
attended by central bankers from around the world.

The Italian general elections, expected this February, May, June or
sometime later. It is a mystery when Italy's political parties will
agree to hold the early polls. If the elections are not held in the
first half of 1996, the life of parliament will probably be prolonged
until the spring of 1997.

16th Scheduled date for the Russian presidential elections, and the
year's most likely source of political shock. The Russian constitution
vests vast powers in the presidency, and some analysts fear that a
Communist candidate, or, even worse, an ultra-nationalist, may win.
However, businessmen and politicians close to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin are already urging him to postpone the poll. Will Yeltsin be
fit to fight?

21st - 30th Gays and lesbians hold the Europride conference in
Copenhagen.

22nd - 23rd EU summit of heads of state and government in Florence.

24th The Wimbledon tennis tournament starts, and the search for British
heroes (anyone who reaches the second round) is on.

27th - 29th Heads of government and finance ministers from the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries gather in Lyons for their annual
economic summit. In recent years the G7 has tried to scale back the
pomp and ceremony which accompanies these jamborees, but it is not yet
clear that President Jacques Chirac, the host, will be able to resist
arranging something spectacular. France, which is chairing the G7 in
1996, wants the meeting to concentrate on development, while the
leaders are also expected to use the meeting to accelerate reform of
United Nations institutions.

30th Hong Kong enters its last year under British rule.

JULY

1st Ireland takes over the EU presidency.

7th - 12th Eleventh International Conference on Aids in Vancouver.

19th The Proms. The world's biggest music festival enters its second
century under new director Nicholas Kenyon. At London's Royal Albert
Hall until September 14.

19th The centenary edition of the modern Olympics meets a steamy
southern summer in Atlanta, Georgia, which perhaps explains why the
most sought-after seats have been for the swimming and diving
competititions. Going on the off-chance is not advised since just about
all tickets are long gone by lottery or to sponsors. A total of 26
sports will be on display, with only women's softball as a newcomer
(don't sniff, the fastballs come in at 90mph). Some refinements
elsewhere: for instance, mountain bikes have been added to the cycling
classification. The Games end on August 4.

20th The Salzburg Festival, until August 31. Of the three new opera
productions, the most intriguing is Beethoven's 'Fidelio', which pairs
octogenarian conductor Georg Solti with radical German
producer-designer Herbert Wernicke. The other show to catch is the
Pierre Boulez-Peter Stein production of Schoenberg's 'Moses und Aron'.

Some time this summer Stanley Kubrick, one of Hollywood's most
influential but least productive film makers, starts shooting Eyes Wide
Shut starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in London. Kubrick, a
legendary figure in the film world, has written, directed and produced
a string of successes from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Dr Strangelove. He
is a notorious perfectionist - the actor Jack Nicholson said he 'gives
new meaning to the word meticulous' - and has not made a film since
Full Metal Jacket in 1987.

31st Japan-US semiconductor accord to expire.

AUGUST

11th - 31st The 50th Edinburgh International Festival. Productions by
Robert Wilson, Robert Lepage and Peter Stein, orchestras from
Cleveland, Moscow, New York and Oslo, plus Houston Grand Opera.

12th Liberian presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled.

12th - 15th US Republican party national convention in San Diego,
California, followed from August 27 to 29 by the Democratic party
national convention in Chicago, Illinois. Both are later than usual
because of the Olympics. The main order of business for both is to
crown candidates for president and vice president, with the latter
usually providing what suspense there is. But conventions, by also
endorsing party platforms, can set a tone for the autumn campaign for
the White House. The harsh rightwing notes sounded by the Republicans
in Houston in 1992 got George Bush off on the wrong foot, while the
left's anti-war riots in Chicago in 1968 gave Hubert Humphrey a
handicap he never overcame. Party managers try to script convention
business to the last minute, ensuring that candidates get maximum
exposure, but perfect discipline is often hard to impose on committed
delegates.

16th Indonesia's President Suharto delivers the annual State of the
Nation address, marking his country's Independence Day on August 17. He
is not a man for saying a lot in public, so few of his citizens will
watch anything else on television today. This year's speech will be
more interesting than most, because Mr Suharto will outline how he
thinks the country should behave as it prepares for the five - yearly
elections which begin in 1997. Deciphering a speech from the man who
has run the country for 28 years usually requires the delphic qualities
of a Javanese dukun. But identifying who he thinks should win the
elections shouldn't be difficult.

19th Bill Clinton turns 50. If he loses the White House in November, he
faces the prospect of a great many rounds of golf.

25th - 26th London celebrates the 31st Notting Hill Carnival. On the
second day, Britain takes a summer Bank Holiday.

SEPTEMBER

1st The second anniversary of the IRA ceasefire, if peace holds in
Northern Ireland.

9th The 20th anniversary of Mao's death will be cause for cautious
recognition by the Chinese Communist party, which has a deep fear that
anniversaries will be turned into occasions for popular protest. Even
the party faithful have mixed views about Mao - he is officially
reckoned to have been '70 per cent right, 30 per cent wrong' in his
role as the Great Helmsman.

9th - 13th Britain's Trades Union Congress holds its annual conference
in Blackpool.

14th Jewish New Year 5757 starts.

17th United Nations General Assembly opens in New York.

19th Fiftieth anniversary of Winston Churchill's call for a 'United
States of Europe'.

20th - 22nd The Pope visits France.

30th Crunch time arrives for Spain's prospects for joining the European
single currency. This is the deadline for submitting the crucial 1997
budget. The Euro was launched in Madrid, but Spain won't be a founding
member unless the government - possibly a new conservative
administration - manages to slash the public sector deficit. Not that
Spain is the only EU member facing this particular problem.

30th The British Labour's party conference runs in Blackpool until
October 4. If Labour can avoid turbulence, it will surely romp home in
1997 - or possibly earlier. This means that the party's detailed tax
plans are expected to be kept in reserve until the last minute, while
the conference will only be asked to rubber stamp the final elements of
Labour's policy review, including a long-awaited statement on social
security reforms. Tony Blair should already be profiting from two
by-election victories early in the New Year, and will attempt to
exploit the government's vanishing majority on key issues such as
Europe.

OCTOBER

1st - 3rd The annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington.

8th - 11th The British Tory party conference in Bournemouth. Possibly
John Major's last as prime minister, so pretenders will bid for the
succession.

15th-29th: British International Motor Show at the National Exhibition
Centre near Birmingham. The days of bikini - clad models draped across
shiny bonnets at motor fairs have generally given way to sober
salesmanship. This show opens to the public from October 18.

16th Organisers of 1995's Million Man March are planning a Million
Family March in Washington for today.

29th Last possible date for Israeli elections to be held.

29th The winner of the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious
literary award, is named in London. Expect critical face-gouging. Last
year, super-heavyweight Salman Rushdie (4-5 favourite for The Moor's
Last Sigh) was stylishly outpointed by fast-punching middleweight Pat
Barker (5-1; The Ghost Road). Things can only get bloodier.

30th Helmut Kohl will have been German chancellor for 5,144 days, as
long as Konrad Adenauer, who took the job in 1949 aged 73. Having
outrun his idol, Mr Kohl must hang on until 2001 to become the longest
serving chancellor ever, upstaging Bismarck, who held office for 6,940
days from 1871 to 1890. Will he make it? Mr Kohl says he expects to
quit in 1998. But Der Spiegel, the news magazine Mr Kohl refuses to
read, already calls him 'Bismarck in a cardigan'.

NOVEMBER

5th US election day - for president and vice president, all 435 seats
in the House of Representatives and 33 in the Senate, plus a full card
of state and local races. This could be a pivotal election if
Republicans win the White House and hold on to majorities in Congress.
Bill Clinton is still favourite for a second term, but not by much.
With eight of 15 incumbent Democrats not seeking re-election,
Republicans hope to increase their current 53 seats in Senate to a
filibuster-proof 60. The House, now with 236 Republicans, is often more
volatile. Voter turn-out may approach 60 per cent only if the field is
fleshed out by interesting independent or third party candidates (Ross
Perot helped lift it to 55 per cent in 1992).

10th - 12th The Confederation of British Industry annual conference in
Harrogate.

11th Germans begin their annual goose-eating binge. Germany may be a
highly developed industrial nation, but it still fusses over customs
and likes to observe saints' days, possibly because these have
developed a commercial momentum. The feast day in this case is St
Martin's, and the carnival starts in the Rhineland at 11.11am.

13th - 17th The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's World Food
Summit in Rome. Heads of state and government meet from November 16 to
17.

26th Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, will deliver his fourth
Budget or Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, will deliver his first.
If Mr Clarke is still at Number 11, the 1996 Budget should be much like
1995's: modest tax cuts paid for with modest cuts in public spending
plans. If Mr Brown has moved in, the content is less clear. Not only
has Labour avoided revealing much about its tax plans, but Mr Brown may
discover that Mr Clarke has left him little room for manoeuvre.
Incoming governments traditionally say they have had to scale back
their plans because 'the books have been left in much worse shape than
we expected'.

The Bibliotheque Nationale de France, dubbed the 'tres grande
bibliotheque', is scheduled to open to the public in Paris late this
month. Approved by former President Francois Mitterrand in 1988, and
built at a cost of FFr8bn, four angled tower blocks symbolise open
books, surrounding a suspended garden. The public will have access to
400,000 books.

DECEMBER

6th-7th EU summit in Dublin. The Netherlands takes over the presidency
at the start of 1997.

9th - 13th Singapore hosts the first World Trade Organisation
ministerial meeting.

10th The Nobel peace prize is awarded in Oslo.

On a date in December yet to be fixed, the US Electoral College meets
to certify the results of the November election. The winner in the
national popular vote can still lose the election if his opponent
carries states with a majority in the Electoral College. These are
apportioned, winner-take-all, according to state population, ranging
from California's 54 delegates to three each for various smaller
states.

The world's tallest office buildings are due to be completed in the
centre of Kuala Lumpur in 1996, and to be dedicated this month. At 450
metres, the twin Petronas Towers will be slightly taller than Chicago's
Sears building. The project forms part of the plan of Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the prime minister, to turn Malaysia into a fully
industrialised country by 2020. Opponents accuse him of indulging in
grandiose schemes of questionable economic benefit. Furthermore, they
add, the towers will soon be overtaken by other Far Eastern rivals.

Russian economists and western agencies have predicted that 1996 will
be the first year that Russia's nascent market economy experiences
positive growth. The Organisation for Economic Co - operation and
Development, for instance, forecasts a growth rate of 2 per cent. An
economic upswing could boost the flagging political fortunes of Russian
reformers; on the other hand, political instability could still
undermine the country's economic prospects.

Some time towards the end of 1996, or otherwise early in 1997, 10m
savers and borrowers with Britain's Halifax Building Society will get
free Halifax shares when the society floats.

FIAT STEPS UP DRIVE FOR IMPORT POSITION

   By JOHN GRIFFITHS

Fiat Auto UK is restructuring its dealer networks as part of a campaign
to regain its status as one of the UK new car market's biggest
importers.

The company is reorganising its 220-strong Fiat dealer network and
increasing its Alfa-Romeo dealerships by 25 per cent.

The moves strengthening the dealer networks come as the Italian group's
wholly-owned UK subsidiary prepares today to launch its Bravo and Brava
models. They are intended to challenge Ford's Escort, Vauxhall's Astra
and other similar-sized models in one of the biggest sectors of the UK
new car market. Fiat spent more than Pounds 1bn developing the new
models.

The models appear set to return the Fiat brand to the 4 per cent-plus
market share levels not seen since the early 1980s. Mr James Blades,
Fiat Auto UK's managing director, now expects final figures to show
that Fiat's market share in 1995 reached 3.6 per cent, with total sales
approaching 75,000 including about 3,000 Alfa-Romeo sales.

Fiat's UK market share peaked in 1979 at 4.9 per cent, with sales of
Lancia models at the time lifting the group's share above 5 per cent.
Yet for much of the 1980s, its share slid downwards - mainly because
of the parent group's failure to invest in new models. By 1992 it had
slumped to less than 2 per cent.

So poor were Lancia sales that Fiat has stopped importing them to the
UK altogether, while sales of Alfa-Romeo - bought by Fiat in 1987 -
currently represent less than 0.2 per cent of the UK market.

However, the launch of two small cars, the Punto and Cinquecento, has
already brought about a strong revival. Mr Blades said: 'We are now
working hard to ensure that further growth is stable and sustainable.
That means making further inroads to fleets so as not to be subject to
the whims of private buyers.'

Fiat's concern in this respect is illustrated by Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders statistics showing that the total new car
market in the UK grew 2 per cent in the first 11 months of 1995. Within
this total, fleet demand grew 7 per cent whereas sales to private
buyers have stagnated.

The importance of the fleet sector to manufacturers and importers is
underlined by the fact that around 47 per cent of new cars in 1996 are
expected to be bought by fleets.

Fiat's sales to fleets in 1995 played a big part in its outperformance
of the new car market overall. At 67,400, Fiat's total sales in the
first 11 months were 20 per cent higher than in the same period in
1994, compared with only a 2 per cent rise in the UK new car market
overall. Within the total, however, sales to fleets have jumped 43 per
cent. The importance of Bravo/Brava to Fiat's further UK growth is
underlined by the fact that the model segment in which they will
compete accounts for more than 30 per cent of the fleet market.

Under the dealer restructuring, Fiat is retaining the overall size of
the network at about 220 dealers but replacing many of the smaller,
less committed outlets with facilities owned by the bigger retailing
groups.

As a result of the shake-up, now in its final stages, some 30 per cent
of the network is owned by members of the UK's top 100 retailing groups
which are capable of making the substantial investment that Fiat wants
to see.

POOREST DEPEND ON BENEFITS 'FOR 70% OF INCOME'

   By GRAHAM BOWLEY

The poorest 20 per cent of households get almost three-quarters of
their income from state benefits, government statisticians have found.

Cash benefits made up 70 per cent of the gross income of the bottom
fifth of Britain's households in the past financial year (1994-95),
according to the Central Statistical Office's latest survey of economic
trends.

Taxes and government benefits trebled the share of total income of the
poorest 20 per cent of households, the study shows.

Their share of total UK income grew from 2.3 per cent before taxes and
benefits to 6.9 per cent after taxes and benefits.

Before tax, the top fifth of households earned 20 times more than the
lowest fifth but only four times as much after taxes and benefits.

The top 20 per cent of households paid 19.6 per cent of their gross
income in income tax compared with 11 per cent paid by other
households.

State pensions accounted for almost three-quarters of the cash benefits
received by retired households, the study finds.

The distribution of income before tax is more equal among those still
at work than those who have retired.

But the distribution of after-tax income is more equal among retired
than among working households.

The CSO gives, for the first time, a regional breakdown of gross
domestic product and investment. This shows that in 1994 - the latest
year for which complete figures are available - the south-east, home
to 31 per cent of the population, accounted for about 36 per cent of
GDP.

The north-west, which was the second most productive region, produced
9.9 per cent of the UK's total GDP.

Northern Ireland accounted for the lowest proportion of GDP at 2.3 per
cent.

The south-east also had the highest GDP per capita at Pounds 11,407 per
head - compared with the UK average of Pounds 9,768.

The lowest was Northern Ireland where it was Pounds 8,027 per head and
Wales where the figure was Pounds 8,274.

But this gap is narrowing. Growth in GDP per head has been higher in
Northern Ireland than any other region since 1990.

Income from employment was the source of more than 65 per cent of GDP
in Scotland, whereas it accounted for less than 61 per cent in East
Anglia and the south-west.

TORIES WARN OVER NICHOLSON ATTACKS

   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby Correspondent

Senior left-of-centre Con-servatives yesterday warned the government to
tone down its attacks on Miss Emma Nicholson, the MP for Devon West and
Torridge, following her defection to the Liberal Democrats last week.

As her decision to quit the Conservatives continued to inflame the
long-running battle between leftwing and rightwing Tories, Mr Peter
Temple-Morris, the MP for Leominster, condemned the 'torrent of
personal abuse' being heaped on Miss Nicholson. He argued that the
criticisms were not helping to settle pro-European Tory MPs in the wake
of her defection.

In recent days Mr Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, has
claimed that Miss Nicholson's departure followed her repeated and
unsuccessful attempts to gain a ministerial post in the government.

Mr Michael Portillo, the defence secretary, compounded the criticism
yesterday by arguing that Miss Nicholson had 'demonstrated a history of
disloyalty' - in part by deciding to vote against Baroness Thatcher in
the 1990 Conservative leadership contest.

However, Mr Temple-Morris, a Euro-enthusiast who, ironically, is often
associated with Mr Heseltine's cause, warned that the attacks on Miss
Nicholson were further damaging party morale.

'If someone does defect from the party, then that is bad enough without
personalising things,' he said. 'But ministers are creating a situation
in which the public probably has some sympathy with her.'

Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, attacked the language with
which Mr Portillo had castigated Miss Nicholson, insisting that
ministers needed to understand why she had made such a move.

'This is what I regret, that members of the cabinet should be indulging
in this sort of language and this approach,' he told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme. 'We should be making sure that other people who have
anxieties should have those anxieties removed so the public should see
we are not a bitterly divided party, that we have pulled ourselves
together and can work together.'

Ministers were yesterday hoping that the circumstances of Miss
Nicholson's move were exceptional and would not be followed by further
defections.

But party whips will be heeding the recent claim by Mr Hugh Dykes, the
MP for Harrow East, that a further six Tories could defect to
opposition parties before the next general election. Mr Dykes, one of
the most staunchly pro-European of Conservatives, will have his every
move watched closely by Tory whips in the next few months.

Others whose names have been speculated upon as possible defectors are
Mr Temple-Morris; Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East; Sir
Keith Speed, MP for Ashford; Mr George Walden, MP for Buckingham; and
Mr Tim Rathbone, MP for Lewes.

None of these has been prepared to admit that he is seeking to move to
another party. However, two of them - Mr Hicks and Mr Walden - have
indicated dissatisfaction with the direction of politics at Westminster
by announcing that they will not be standing at the next general
election. Sir Keith Speed is also standing down at the next election.

SALES SUCCESS LESS SWEET AS CHEWERS AVOID SUGAR

   By JOHN AUTHERS

Consumers tried to cut down on their sugar in 1995, according to the
annual survey for the chocolate and sweets markets carried out by
Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery company.

While Nestle's Kit Kat bar consolidated its lead over the Mars Bar -
perceived as more fattening - in the chocolate market, the most
popular sweet was Wrigley's Extra, a sugar-free chewing gum.

Total consumption of chocolate declined slightly compared with 1994,
from 530,000 tonnes to 526,000 tonnes, a trend which manufacturers
attributed to the hot weather during the summer. But total spending on
chocolate reached a new high of Pounds 3.2bn.

Kit Kat sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 200m while those of Mars Bars
fell 2 per cent to Pounds 150m.

A report in June by Datamonitor, the market research company, said Kit
Kat's share of the chocolate snack market had stayed at about 17.4 per
cent between 1990 and 1994, while the Mars Bar's share had dropped from
16 per cent to 11.7 per cent.

Mars made changes to its product in 1995 in an attempt to appeal to
women and to make its bars seem less fattening, introducing bite-sized
versions and changing the recipe to make it taste lighter.

Cadbury's Dairy Milk consolidated its place as the third most popular
chocolate.

In the market for sweets, Wrigley's Extra gum finished ahead of Polo
mints and Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles, according to the annual review by
Trebor Bassett, the sugar confectionery division of Cadbury's. Orbit by
Wrigley, another sugar-free gum, came fourth, well ahead of the better
known Wrigley's Spearmint, which was 17th.

The total size of the market was less than half that for chocolate,
with total sales of Pounds 1.4bn and 283,000 tonnes sold. Average
spending per capita for the year was Pounds 24.

The hot summer weather also affected sales of sweets, which include
cough lozenges in the top 20, according to Trebor Bassett. But it
added: 'There remains enormous future potential for market growth - we
still have quite a way to go before we match the per capita consumption
for sweets of our European neighbours.'

ECONOMIC GROWTH PROSPECTS SUFFER DOUBLE BLOW

   By GRAHAM BOWLEY, Economics Staff

A gloomier outlook for the UK economy emerged today with a leading
forecaster predicting that growth will slow in 1996 and with the
publication of a poll which shows that business confidence is at its
lowest since 1992.

The latest report by Cambridge Econometrics, the economic consultancy,
says a slowdown in the rest of the world will depress Britain's exports
this year. It says companies will also cut output as they try to sell
the stocks they built up in 1995.

As a result, UK gross domestic product will grow by less than 2.5 per
cent in 1996 compared with 2.75 per cent last year. This prediction
clashes with the official Treasury forecast of 3 per cent growth in
1996.

But growth will rebound in 1997 to 2.8 per cent, the forecasting group
says. It thinks that spending by consumers will grow modestly in 1996
and then expand strongly next year - partly because of expected tax
cuts in the next Budget.

Meanwhile, a survey of 2,000 businesses published today by Lloyds Bank
shows that confidence is at its lowest level since the poll began in
1992. For the first time, the survey shows an increase in those
businesses reporting cashflow problems and a slowdown in export
orders.

Orders for goods and services continue to grow - but at the slowest
rate since the second half of 1992. The poll shows that confidence has
dropped because economic growth has been disappointingly slow.

Mr Michael Riding, the director of commercial banking at Lloyds Bank,
said that although companies 'are still experiencing growth, they are
having difficulty in coming to terms with managing in a low inflation
economy. This, coupled with failed growth expectations, has made them
somewhat pessimistic - possibly unnecessarily'.

Companies in the construction and retail sectors reported the slowest
growth in orders, while manufacturing companies and hotels and catering
businesses reported strong growth. Companies told Lloyds Bank that
investment spending has slowed because of slower profit growth and
increased pressure on cashflow. However, Cambridge Econometrics
predicts that investment will pick up in 1996 as the private finance
initiative fills much of the gap left by cuts in government capital
spending.

The forecasting group says there is evidence of a build-up in stocks in
the motor vehicle, chemical and non-metallic mineral product
industries. It predicts that headline inflation will fall in the short
term in response to lower mortgage interest rates, although the
underlying rate will remain broadly unchanged.

In the longer term, headline inflation will rise to 3.7 per cent in
1997 from 3.1 per cent at present.

WALDEGRAVE RESOLVES TO START EARLY: NEW YEAR AIMS INCLUDE PUSHING THE
PFI AND TACKLING FRAUD

   By ROBERT CHOTE

Like the arrival of Christmas in the shops, negotiations between the
Treasury and government departments over public spending seem to get
earlier every year.

The detail of the last public spending round was published only a month
ago, at the time of the Budget. But Mr William Waldegrave, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, is already preparing for the opening
skirmishes of this year's battle.

Mr Waldegrave said in an interview with the Financial Times that he
planned to emulate his predecessor, Mr Jonathan Aitken, by looking at
the spending of larger departments in spring, before the haggling
proper gets under way.

The Department of Social Security will come under particular scrutiny,
according to Mr Waldegrave. Its Pounds 90bn budget next year will be
Whitehall's largest by far, so it is bound to be an important target in
any search for savings.

'It is essential that they are feeling the full force of the
possibilities of new ways of doing things,' Mr Waldegrave said. 'Peter
Lilley has exciting things to say about how benefits can be delivered
in a few years' time. What the Treasury has to see is whether 'a few
years' time' can be made any shorter.'

Mr Waldegrave has been criticised by some MPs for allowing too big an
increase in the DSS's running costs during the last spending round. But
he argues that some cuts have actually cost money by weakening control
of the benefit system.

Mr Waldegrave said it was clear that the proportion of social security
claimed fraudulently - estimated at between 5 per cent and 10 per cent
for some benefits - was much larger than most observers had thought.

He noted that a pilot scheme to issue some claimants in London with
swipecards was already saving money. 'One of the things I have to do
early in the new year is see what is a practicable, do-able,
non-fantastic programme here which might generate another few hundred
million,' he said.

Mr Waldegrave said there was also scope to push the private finance
initiative, which attracts private sector funds and expertise into
public sector infrastructure projects.

'One thing we have broken the back of this year is institutional
resistance to the PFI, although it only generates a saving for public
expenditure in terms of delivering better value for money,' he said.

Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, believes that
economic activity may be slowed in the short term by an 'infrastructure
hiatus' as private finance replaces direct public funding. But Mr
Waldegrave said he expected private money to be attracted more quickly
than the Treasury assumed in the Budget.

There were no 'wonder drugs' which would deliver savings from
government spending next year, Mr Waldegrave added. He ruled out the
idea of taking a tougher line with the Department of National Heritage
because of the extra revenue from the National Lottery.

But Mr Waldegrave admitted he was attracted - although this was a
personal rather than a Treasury view - to the idea that arts
organisations could be funded through endowments. This would limit the
centralisation of public support for the arts, although it would not
necessarily save money.

Mr Waldegrave said that in framing a long-term strategy for public
spending, it was unrealistic to aim for the low government shares of
national income achieved in some Asia-Pacific countries.

Nations such as the US, New Zealand and Switzerland were better role
models, implying a government share of national income of 35 per cent
or 36 per cent. Public spending stands at 42 per cent of national
income, compared with the formal target of less than 40 per cent.

Mr Waldegrave said every chief secretary had the ambition of reaching a
stage where it was no longer necessary to hold public spending
negotiations every year. He said it was worth investigating the idea
that departments could agree a tough settlement on the understanding
that their budgets were guaranteed for a number of years. But he
conceded that departments would fear that a future chief secretary
would not feel bound by the pledge.

So the annual ritual of the public spending negotiations remains with
us. Every year departments will squeal about the pressure they are
under, and the chief secretary will proclaim one of the toughest rounds
in living memory.

POLICY FOR TERRORISM INSURANCE UNDER ATTACK: AS THE IRA CEASEFIRE HAS
LITTLE EFFECT ON PREMIUMS, BUSINESSES QUESTION THE ROLE OF REINSURER
POOL RE

   By RALPH ATKINS

When the IRA bombed the City of London in 1992 and 1993, causing more
than Pounds 1bn in damage, businesses were thankful that anyone was
prepared to provide insurance against further attacks.

With insurers set to exclude unlimited terrorism cover from commercial
policies, the setting up of Pool Re - a state-backed 'reinsurance'
company which would underwrite policies sold by conventional insurers
- was seen as a sensible response.

Nearly three years later, as many companies renegotiate policies due
for renewal, the mood has changed.

Pool Re is criticised as expensive and inflexible. The Association of
Insurance and Risk Managers, which represents commercial insurance
buyers, reckons the high rates Pool Re charges are forcing companies to
choose between spending large amounts on terrorism cover - or risk
going without.

The IRA ceasefire has had a limited impact. Premium rates have fallen:
a 20 per cent discount has been announced for next year. Pool Re also
collects only 60 per cent of the policy premium at the start of the
year; the remaining 40 per cent is waived if total claims during the
year do not exceed a certain level (Pounds 75m in 1996).

But terrorism cover used to be included in standard commercial property
policies at no additional cost. As Mr Leslie Lucas, Pool Re chief
executive, admits: 'Any policyholder is going to say that, if we once
had it offered for nothing, any price is going to be too much.'

There is also concern that the structure of Pool Re is preventing the
development of an alternative terrorism insurance market.

When Pool Re started in 1993 it had no capital and operated as a
mutual, pooling the resources of those who depended on its services. It
insists member insurance companies only sell terrorism cover at rates
and on terms set by Pool Re. Premiums are pooled into an insurance fund
which at the end of 1994 stood at Pounds 410m but is likely now to be
substantially higher. Because most insurers are Pool Re members,
companies have little option but to buy Pool Re policies.

Moreover, corporate groups cannot 'cherry pick' - buying insurance
policies backed by Pool Re only for vulnerable properties. Apart from
smaller sites, they have to buy cover for all or none.

Rates are set according to formula varying by location. There is only
limited scope for taking account of measures individual companies might
take to reduce their exposure to terrorist attack.

Mr Alan Gavaghan, the deputy chairman of insurance broker Willis
Corroon, says: 'A lot of companies spend a lot of money on risk
prevention action, not just things like sprinklers and shatter-proof
windows. They have put a lot of thought into it, but they are treated
in the same way as people with clapped-out warehouses.'

Alternatives are available. Willis Corroon is one of five brokers which
combined to provide terrorism insurance underwritten by syndicates at
Lloyd's of London which are not Pool Re members.

Last month the facility was improved and policies paying out up to
Pounds 100m per terrorist attack are available. That means large
companies could choose to insure just their most vulnerable properties.

But the total amount of insurance coverage available is limited. Prices
may also not be sufficiently attractive for companies to switch from
Pool Re policies which provide unlimited cover. As Mr Jeremy Lowe, of
Willis Corroon, says: 'It is a viable alternative to Pool Re for those
who want to be selective, rather than a competitor.'

In spite of its criticism, the Association of Insurance and Risk
Managers do not want to kill the idea of a pool.

'The concept is a good one,' says Ms Ina Barker, executive director.
'The premiums of the many pay for the claims of the few.' There is also
little sign that insurers and reinsurers are willing to return to
providing full terrorism cover without state back-up.

The association's idea is that Pool Re should be funded by a flat
contribution, or levy, on all commercial property policies. That should
allow a return to the automatic provision of terrorism cover. As funds
are built up by Pool Re - assuming there is no escalation of terrorism
 - there would be scope for contributions holidays.

Potentially, Pool Re could evolve into a state-backed reinsurer
providing cover against other perils where the incidence is low but
potential costs could be catastrophic - London flooding is a possible
example.

The aim would be to achieve the basic principle of insurance -
spreading big risks on the shoulders of many. Ms Barker says:
'Terrorism insurance ought to be automatic for the benefit of society.'

BIG THAW LEADS TO WATER CUTS

   By PRESS ASSOCIATION

Thousands of homes throughout the UK were flooded and whole communities
faced water shortages yesterday as the Christmas freeze gave way to a
dramatic thaw, bursting water mains and domestic water systems. In some
areas, temperatures soared from - 20'C to around 7'C.

In Scotland, 500,000 Strathclyde homes suffered burst pipes at some
point over the holiday. Water rationing was introduced in parts of
Northern Ireland as reservoirs ran low because of water leaks and burst
pipes. More than 100,000 homes were affected and water tankers were
being used in some areas.

The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which is responsible for public
housing, dealt with more than 5,000 calls. Plumbers ran short of
materials and the executive had to arrange special openings of supply
stores to allow work to continue. Vast quantities of water were lost
because affected schools, factories and offices were closed for the
holidays.

Thousands of consumers in the Carmarthen area of west Wales spent
yesterday without water because of a burst main taking supplies from
the river Towy. In England North West Water brought in extra staff to
cope with phone calls, and other areas affected by the thaw included
Northumberland, Tyneside and Wearside, East Anglia, Essex, and Suffolk.
Thames Water said customers were cut off at various times but teams
were working to restore services.

NEW YEAR PLAN CONDEMNED: SCOTTISH BANK HOLIDAYS

   By PRESS ASSOCIATION

Scottish nationalists yesterday attacked plans to bring Scottish
banking industry holidays into line with England. The move could make
this the last traditional new year holiday period north of the border
and set a precedent for other employers, warned Ms Anne McNair, the
Scottish National party's employment spokeswoman.

Scotland has two new year bank holidays - January 1 and January 2 -
whereas England and Wales have only January 1.

Announcing SNP backing for a campaign by the main banking union Bifu,
she said: 'Once again it seems that Scottish families and society are
taking second place to English clearing banks and the London Stock
Exchange. Making Easter Monday a bank holiday instead of January 2, as
is proposed, would make no sense since demand for banking services is
far greater at Easter than at new year.'

PLEA FOR HELP OVER FRAUD PROBE: NHS TRUSTS

   By JOHN AUTHERS

The National Health Service Executive has written to all 458 NHS trusts
asking them to co-operate with a police investigation into an alleged
fraud by locum agencies. The investigation follows routine checks last
year by the Audit Commission, the NHS watchdog, at four hospitals in
north Wales.

The Metropolitan Police's company fraud unit is now investigating the
claims. It believes that up to 80 trusts could have fallen victim to
the alleged fraud, which is said to have involved charging excessive
fees or sending duplicate invoices for the services of locum doctors
and therapists. Four people have been arrested in connection with the
allegations, and released on police bail. The total sum involved is
alleged to be about Pounds 3m.

SAINSBURY CUTS 200 PRICES: FOOD RETAILING

   By PRESS ASSOCIATION

J. Sainsbury fired a new year salvo in the supermarket price war
yesterday by cutting the cost of more than 200 items by up to 50 per
cent during January. The move comes three days after frozen food
chainstore Iceland announced it was reducing some prices to those of
1986. However, Sainsbury and other leading food retailers denied that
the initiatives would trigger another round in the price war.

FISHING PATROL MOVES INTO DISPUTED AREA

   By BERNARD GRAY

HMS Lindisfarne, a UK Fisheries Protection Vessel, yesterday went on
patrol in the controversial Irish Box fishing area between western
England and Ireland to mark the first day that Spanish trawlers were
legally entitled to work in the disputed zone.

Also on standby to monitor the situation were three commercially
chartered patrol aircraft which are used to oversee fishing fleets in
British waters.

However, in spite of predictions of confrontation, none of the 20
Spanish boats which have so far registered to work in the Irish Box
appeared.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food pointed to the holiday
season as a possible explanation and added that fishing conditions were
not particularly favourable in the area at present.

Meanwhile, arguments continued between British politicians about the
agreement, which allows the large Spanish trawler fleet to use the
area, traditionally the preserve of Cornish fishing fleets.

Mr David Harris, a Conservative MP whose constituency includes the
Newlyn fishing port, said yesterday that Spanish access to the Irish
Box would inevitably lead to further cuts in quotas, hurting the UK
fishing industry.

Mr Harris said he had written to Mr John Major, the prime minister,
arguing that more control of fishing zones should be handed back to
individual European Union member states, rather than being regulated by
the European Commission through quotas.

'The end result is going to be massive over-fishing of stocks already
under pressure,' he said.

Yet Mr Tony Baldry, the fishing minister, said that Spanish boats would
not be able to catch any additional fish by choosing to trawl in the
Irish Box, rather than in other areas.

'They will be policed equally fiercely on the catches that they take to
make sure the fish are the proper size and are within quota, as much as
ensuring that there are no more than 40 trawlers at any one time in the
Irish Box,' he said.

The two politicians also disagreed about whether Spanish boats would
abide by the rules of the agreement to use the disputed waters.

Mr Harris predicted that Spanish trawlers would use 'every trick in the
book' to skirt the rules, while Mr Baldry argued that the Spanish boats
would comply.

'It will be a very stupid Spanish skipper who seeks to break the
rules,' said Mr Baldry. 'If he does so he will be brought into court,
he will be prosecuted and he will be fined up to Pounds 50,000.'

THIS WEEK:
NERVES BEGIN TO FRAY OVER BUDGET IMPASSE - DATELINE / WASHINGTON, ANGER
THE THE 'CLOWNS OF CONGRESS' IS RISING

   By JUREK MARTIN

It is probable that the US government will still not be fully
functioning again this morning - and it is not possible to ignore the
rising tide of public and personal disgust with the wilfulness of those
on the right wing of the US Congress who have brought about this pretty
pass.

Note, from the outset, where the finger of blame is pointed: not at
President Bill Clinton, though he may have contributed to the overall
budget impasse and is reaping political benefit from it; nor at Senator
Bob Dole, though the majority leader might have been more resolute in
standing up to his party's vizigoths if he did not need them for his
presidential ambitions.

No, responsibility lies squarely with those so convinced of their own
rectitude and so insulated from the real world outside their
conservative salons and support groups that they cannot understand the
damage they are doing - not only to those affected by the longest, if
partial, closure of the federal government ever, but also, ultimately,
to their own cause of balancing the budget in seven years.

It is doubtful that the impact of the suspension of government business
will lop more than a fraction of 1 per cent off GNP. Important
industries and cities have not ground to a halt because 280,000 federal
bureaucrats have been laid off. No college football game, the opiate of
the New Year season, has been cancelled.

There has been damage, however: to the civil servants, not exactly fat
cats, unpaid for two weeks over Christmas; to small federal contractors
dependent on government; to the 20,000 people who apply for passports
every day and the 23,000 who register with social security; and to the
small towns and businesses that live off the seasonal trade of great
national parks like Yosemite in California, where the adjacent Mariposa
County has declared itself a disaster area.

They may not amount to a collective blip in the national statistics,
but their livelihoods are affected - for months ahead - and all are
some politician's constituents. To judge by their comments in streams
of US media interviews, they are mostly mad with what they frequently
call 'the clowns of Congress', and soon some poll will doubtless
measure their anger.

Perhaps more serious for the congressional right is the offence they
have given to the chattering classes, who, when aroused, can still do
much to shape public opinion. Nothing has offended them more than the
denial of unfettered access to the most comprehensive collection ever
assembled in one place of the works of Johannes Vermeer, the Dutch
master, at the National Gallery here in Washington.

Last week, Rusty Powell, the gallery's director, was able to open its
doors by releasing Dollars 30,000 from a private donor fund earmarked
for future exhibitions. This was enough to make the Vermeers - but not
the rest of the formidable standing collection, nor the concurrent
Winslow Homer exhibition - available to the public. And did they come,
with lines in frigid weather stretching round the block for precious
passes.

But the money is only good for a week, which means that unless Congress
comes up with funding for the gallery pronto, the Vermeer exhibition
cannot complete its scheduled run until next month. And, like the small
businessmen in Mariposa County, just about all the gallery-goers have
vented their spleen at Congress. One angry TV commentator suggested
that, as a punishment, the 73 Republican freshmen in the House of
Representatives be permanently barred from looking at Vermeer's
masterpieces (though the impact of such contemplation might well be
salutary).

A more severe critic could go further by noting that few of the
affected are natural allies of the hard right. Art appeals to the elite
and is often decadent; passports are for foreign travel and thus
somehow un-American; social security is for the weak; national parks
might be more profitable if opened up for oil drilling and commercial
exploitation; and Washington itself, a veritable modern Sodom and
Gomorrah, would be better off turned into a pillar of salt.

The last word should lie, surely, with the bureaucrats. While they are
on unpaid furlough, members of Congress are receiving their salary
cheques and, as is their wont during recess, travelling the globe. So a
group of US diplomats in Latin America ordered back to work to arrange
one such six-nation trip, sent this distinctly undiplomatic message to
the state department:

'Frankly, we are disturbed by the thought that while American school
children are being turned away from Smithsonian museums, national
parks, monuments and memorials, some members of the US Congress are
looking forward to seeing exotic attractions like Copacabana, Iguazu,
Cuzco, Macchu Picchu and Otavalo - largely at the expense of the
parents of those school children.'

Perhaps they should push the congressional delegation off a cliff, in
the manner of the Incas.

THIS WEEK:
FT GUIDE TO THE MILLENNIUM COMMISSION?

   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

What, exactly, is this Millennium Commission we keep hearing about? The
body set up to plan the UK's celebration of the year 2000. Most other
countries hope to let off a few fireworks but the UK is taking it very
seriously indeed, and spending about Pounds 1.5bn.

Whose idea was it? Lord Palumbo, former chairman of the Arts Council,
thought the millennium a good excuse to spruce up Britain's national
heritage - Stonehenge, the cathedrals, that sort of thing, and perhaps
add one or two modern landmarks. Prime minister John Major agreed, and
Palumbo's idea has gathered great momentum.

Organised by a quango of the great and the good, presumably? Spot on.
Seven worthies, mixed to reflect the aristocracy, business, heritage
lobby, science and women, plus a couple of politicians (Virginia
Bottomley and Michael Heseltine) who are charged to give to it a
vote-gathering twist.

Where on earth is the money coming from? From the UK national lottery,
now a little over a year old. Projects to mark the millennium are one
of the five worthy causes that are getting great chunks of lottery
cash, along with the arts, sport, the heritage industry and charities.
To date the Millennium Commission has received almost Pounds 300m. But
unlike the other good causes, its good fortune ends on December 31
1999. After that, its share of the lottery cake will be divided among
the other four.

Hasn't the commission upset the Welsh? Yes, some of them. It was
decided to spend about Pounds 600m on 12 landmark projects, the 20th
century's gift to the future. These are to be spread conscientiously
around the UK. Wales was owed one, but the national rugby ground at
Cardiff Arms Park, and a proposed opera house for Cardiff Bay, each
applied for Pounds 50m. Forced to choose between the two Welsh
passions, rugby and music, the commission said 'No' to music and
'Maybe' to rugby. The money will probably be spent refurbishing Cardiff
Arms Park.

So all this millennial cash is not spreading universal happiness? No
way. There are as many people whingeing as celebrating, especially in
the media. The commission is accused of being short on big ideas and
long on cautious pragmatism. It has imposed severe restrictions by
demanding that applicants should be able to provide half the cost of
any project, although some of this can be in land or labour. This makes
things hard for imaginative loonies.

But some good must be coming from it? Well, the Tate Gallery is happy.
It has Pounds 50m for its proposed gallery of modern art on Bankside;
Kew Gardens has Pounds 21m for a millennium seed bank for plants; and
Portsmouth Harbour picked up Pounds 40m to convert itself into the
world's classiest marina. Scotland has been sweetened with Pounds 46m
for a 'new' Hampden Park. These are among the landmark schemes.

But I live in Twistelton-on-the-Marsh. I'll never get along to these
national monuments. The commissioners have also set aside another
Pounds 600m to engender turn-of-the-millennium optimism at the grass
roots. Over 300 groups of local activists have already received a go
ahead for good ideas. For example, there will be a new village hall for
Ingleton in Derbyshire, thanks to a millennium grant of Pounds 150,000;
a coastal railway linking the Giant's Causeway and Bushmills in
Northern Ireland will please locals and tourists, at a cost of Pounds
700,000; and Pounds 588,000 has been set aside for salmon ladders in
the River Thames.

Strengthening communities and greening the land are buzzwords the
commissioners have taken to heart. The Pounds 42.5m for Sustrans, which
aims to cover the nation with 2,500 miles of cycle paths, just about
sums it all up.

What is going to happen in 2000? Good question. No one knows, although
Imagination, a group of creative whizzkids from London, and M2000,
financed by Touche Ross and MAI among others, should have a good idea.

They are the two consortia short-listed to organise the year-long
celebration, likely to be a cross between the Festival of Britain and
Disney World. The winner will be chosen this month. Four sites have
also been short-listed: Greenwich, near London; the National Exhibition
Centre near Birmingham; Derby; and Stratford, in London.

Greenwich, the chosen venue of M2000, is favourite, while Imagination
has plumped for Birmingham.

It depends whether the commissioners go for a site in London plumb on
the international dateline, or Birmingham, near the centre of the UK.
With Pounds 100m of millennium money to oil the profit-making event, it
should be some celebration.

And on December 31 2000, is it all over? The commissioners hope not.
There will be the landmark buildings to enjoy, although there is no
equivalent to the Crystal Palace or the Eiffel Tower on the horizon to
amaze citizens of 2096. There will also be hundreds of village halls,
urban parks and small woodlands.

And there will be some bursaries, which are planned to continue ad
infinitum. What are they. Can I have one? No reason why not. The
commission is setting up a Pounds 100m endowment, which should produce
about Pounds 5m a year to be distributed in dollops of Pounds 2,000 and
upwards to citizens who want to improve themselves, and then pass on
the improvement to their communities.

More details will be announced this month, but you will probably have
to apply to a charity or a voluntary organisation for vetting. Good

THIS WEEK:
FILM AND VIDEO

   By NIGEL ANDREWS

You can always tell a new movie year. It stomps into view overturning
Christmas trees and growling 'No more Mr Nice Guy'. 1996's first
audiences are invited to choose between Seven (serial killer with
horrific murder methods), The Kingdom (ghoulies in a haunted hospital)
and Four Rooms, which climaxes with Quentin Tarantino presiding over
chopping a finger.

Nevertheless, there are compensations to be found. The faint hearted
can take refuge in France's The Horseman On The Roof - more buckle and
swash from director Jean-Paul Cyrano De Bergerac Rappeneau - and in
Something To Talk About, a marital comedy-drama with Julia Roberts. She
twangs a pretty southern accent while Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands
provide power casting as Mom and Pop.

In truth, even the nasties are not that nasty. The Kingdom, a weirdly
hilarious TV mini-series turned four-hour movie from Danish director
Lars Von Trier, is more black comedy than spine chiller. And there is
humanity between the stomach-testing moments in Seven. Brad Pitt and
Morgan Freeman play detectives sleuthing through a series of murders
patterned after the seven deadly sins.

The moral is, if you want quality cinema you must take the rough with
the smooth. But you need not take Four Rooms at all. This quartet of
stories proves there are days when even wonder children like Tarantino
should be locked in the nursery until they get the script right.

On video, meanwhile, two films allow you to be adult and childlike at
the same time. Ed Wood is Tim Burton's funny-elegiac homage to the
world's greatest 'bad' director, with Martin Landau eating the scenery
as the horror actor Bela Lugosi.

And Dianne Wiest similarly eats the scenery in Woody Allen's splendid
showbiz comedy Bullets Over Broadway. The two actors won last year's
best-supporting Oscars.

PEOPLE: JOHN BROWNE, BP'S MASTER OF RECOVERY - A CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO
DEBT DOES NOT RULE OUT A NEW PHASE OF GROWTH

   By ROBERT CORZINE

John Browne, British Petroleum's chief executive, has marked the
completion of his first six months in office with the conclusion of a
Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.27bn) natural gas deal in Algeria.

The project, which analysts say will help turn BP into a significant
international gas company, attracted headlines mainly because of its
location in a country struggling with an Islamist insurgency. But the
deal is also noteworthy in that it will form one of the foundations for
a new phase of growth and capital investment at BP, whose last
expansive foray triggered a debt crisis in 1992 and the departure of
Robert Horton, former chairman and chief executive.

That episode still influences the thinking of John Browne and that of
Sir David Simon, BP's chairman and the man who engineered the recovery
of the company's fortunes. 'We must not leverage this company ever
again,' said one senior executive last week.

But the company says a cautious approach to debt does not mean that BP
is afraid to act decisively to ensure future growth. It has embarked on
big oil and gas projects in politically unsettled parts of the world
such as Colombia, Azerbaijan and Algeria.

Such projects are a marked departure from BP's traditional core areas
- Alaska and the UK sector of the North Sea. But during Browne's tenure
as head of the company's upstream arm, the board came to accept that
political risk is best spread across a range of projects in different
countries. 'The real risk is having too much in one basket,' says one
BP executive, 'not in going to risky countries which could have a
material effect to the company's bottom line.'

Browne also placed emphasis on the 'phased development' of such
projects. That allows the company to limit its financial exposure
during the early stages of a project, when there is likely to be
greater uncertainty about whether it will prove technically,
politically or commercially viable.

Industry observers say Browne's greatest success was in re-shaping the
strategic direction of the exploration arm and ensuring that it had a
string of possible projects to choose from. It now has sufficient
assets to ensure that reserves can be replaced for another 10 years.
That means that while many other oil companies hunt for new reserves,
BP can focus on projects that are likely to offer the highest return.

Yet analysts wonder whether Browne will have equal success tackling the
problems in BP's downstream division, the one part of the company of
which he has no direct experience and a sector in which big changes may
have an impact on BP's customer base.

He has recently devoted time to downstream issues, in particular to the
future of the company's refineries. They, like much of the industry,
suffer from thin margins and offer little scope for any technological
advantage over competitors. An announcement on the further
restructuring of the company's refining assets is expected this month.

Browne, an engineer who believes technology can continuously enhance
BP's financial performance, is upbeat about chemicals - a segment in
which proprietary technology can increase competitiveness and the
division that BP has chosen to lead its expansion in Asia.

An announcement on broader corporate aims is expected in March. There
have been rumours in the industry that Browne has contemplated radical
changes to the way BP conducts its business, with some observers
speculating that Browne, a former corporate treasurer, would like to
adopt more of a 'merchant bank' approach to the industry.

BP executives say he is more likely to maintain a step-by-step
approach, and emulate Simon by setting simple targets related to BP's
financial and performance ambitions.

One of his biggest challenges will be to maintain BP's strong financial
performance. 'You can grow from an uncompetitive base by cutting
costs,' says one executive. 'The hard task is to grow from a
competitive base, and not just capture the chemicals cycle at its top.'
That means BP will have to focus on efforts to keep margins as high as
possible even in a downturn.

Browne's strategic aim is to create a 'distinctive' company - one with
elements that competitors would have difficulty copying and one which
would provide unusual financial returns to investors. He emphasises the
importance of relationships with host governments, partners and
suppliers.

Browne also wants a 'unique' set of assets, including markets. But big
acquisitions of the type that landed BP in so much trouble in the past
appear to have been ruled out for now, although executives say BP will
continue to make small-scale acquisitions.

Browne's first six months have been made easier by BP's strong
financial performance. But in future there is likely to be greater
investor interest in how he and his colleagues deal with the narrower
issues of the downstream assets and with capital investment decisions.

Senior BP executives say investors are right to demand the highest
capital efficiency possible. After all, says one, 'the industry as a
whole has a pretty bad track record. It hasn't spent money wisely.'
What of BP specifically? 'We should expect to withstand tough
scrutiny,' he says. 'But I don't believe BP will repeat the past.'

MANAGEMENT:
BIG IDEAS, BIG BOOKS - SEVEN WISE MEN GIVE THEIR OPINIONS ON THE
CHALLENGES COMPANIES ARE LIKELY TO FACE IN 1996


What will be the big management challenge of 1996? And what was the
best/most enjoyable/most instructive business book you read in 1995?

On this page we print seven answers to these questions.

Sumantra Ghoshal, professor of strategic management at London Business
School:

Challenge: Over the past few years many companies have focused on
rationalisation and restructuring. Often this has required
fragmentation of their organisations into small units and some radical
decentralisation. Now, with much of the fat out of the system, the
challenge will be to reintegrate their fragmented organisations to
pursue new growth opportunities.

Book: The Boundaryless Organisation by Ron Ashkenas, Dave Ulrich, Todd
Jick and Steve Kerr (Jossey-Bass, San Francisco).

This is a wonderfully practical and down-to-earth book that is both
idea-rich and implementation-focused. It provides insightful ideas,
clear examples and simple tools - a rare combination in the world of
business publications.

Gerry Robinson, chief executive, Granada Group:

Challenge: Not to run out of steam. The 1980s was a period of huge
growth and expansion through new markets, new technology and a global
view of business. The 1990s have been dominated by cost control, cost
cutting, streamlining and tighter management control in order to
maintain profitable growth. This must not become the main role of
management - we must also use creativity, enthusiasm, leadership and
sound strategic direction to improve a company's health and growth.

Book: I have to confess that I did not read any business books at all
last year. This is not because I feel I have nothing to learn about
business but because I did not find the time.

The most important book I read last year was unquestionably Wild Swans
by Jung Chang (HarperCollins). Reading about China's cultural
revolution is more enlightening and satisfying than reading about the
corporate revolution.

I am a strong believer in broadening the mind in spheres other than
business.

Tim Simpson, managing director, Arthur D Little:

Challenge: 'Seventy per cent of all re-engineering projects fail',
people will tell you, misquoting one of the big change gurus. My view
is not so pessimistic. Many companies have made large-scale change work
for them, and their performance has jumped as a result.

But with the recovery faltering, and markets ever opening to world
competition, sustaining this performance improvement will be the
management challenge of 1996.

Book: 1995 was again notable more for books I wanted to read than those
I found time for. But one which did hit home was the Fifth Discipline
Fieldbook, by Senge and friends (Nicholas Brealey Publishing). Ease of
reading is one attraction - it's written for browsing and provides
usable suggestions on almost every page.

And its central proposition - that learning, and particularly team
learning, is a key part of building competence in companies - is
intuitively obvious. The book goes further, suggesting practical ways
to manage the learning process and build competence faster. And it
complements Senge's earlier, more theoretical work, with much more
practical experience.

Peter Sutherland, chairman and managing director, Goldman Sachs
International:

Challenge: To cope with the effects of globalisation. Within a very
short time the world has decisively changed and management will
increasingly be required to focus on opportunities in, and challenges
from, the emerging markets that will provide much of the economic
dynamism for the world into the next millennium. An understanding of
relatively familiar cultures and relationships will have to be
augmented by an under-standing of relatively different environments.

Book: I am not proud to admit that I have virtually never read business
books (unless written by Sir John Harvey-Jones). In 1995, however, I
have read some that I would recommend.

The first of these is Corporate Level Strategy by Goold, Campbell and
Alexander (Wiley), which looks at managing multi-business companies
such as GE, ABB and Canon.

My second and third books are not business books per se but I recommend
them because, in today's world, a good manager has to be tuned in to
dramatic political change in terms of national sovereignty. Andrew
Marr's Ruling Britannia (Michael Joseph) is about more than Britain.

It is about a world in transition. One doesn't have to agree with all
his conclusions to find his opinions both provocative and relevant.

I would also include Where Did We Go Wrong - From the Gold Standard to
Europe (Faber & Faber) by the remarkable Eric Roll, who analyses past
errors in policy relating to the British economy and, above all, to
British negativism towards European integration.

Adair Turner, director-general, Confederation of British Industry:

Challenge: Growing. British businesses have got very very good over the
past 10-15 years at being lean and mean, at increasing productivity.

They need now to get better at investing for the long term, at
marketing, at creating new products. A stable economic climate should
make this possible.

Book: Not business but economics, and not one but two. The State We're
In by Will Hutton (Cape). Disagreed with lots of it and almost gave up
after the first two pages of polemic, but provocative and insightful if
you persevere. And The World in 2020 by Hamish McRae (HarperCollins),
crystal-ball gazing with insight.

David Wellings, chief executive, Cadbury Schweppes:

Challenge: The same as always. Putting forward the best face possible
on the past in order to attract investors; scanning the latest mountain
for that elusive and obstacle-strewn path to shareholder value; and
ensuring that managers of vision, tenacity and stamina are there to
step in when you eventually fall off the mountain.

Book: Neville Bain's Successful Management (Macmillan Business). Sound,
practical advice from a businessman to businessmen. Blessed relief from
consultants peddling the latest irrelevant buzzword for keeping in
shape 'corporate re-engineering' or motivation 'empowerment'.

George Yip, adjunct professor of strategy at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA):

Challenge: Multinational companies will continue to face in 1996 the
challenge of globalisation and of building global capability.

A successful global company today needs the capability to access and to
transfer anywhere in the world technology, ideas, factors of
production, and other sources of competitive advantage.

In this regard the biggest challenge will be moving executives around
the world in the face of escalating costs.

Book: Strategic Alliances: An Entrepreneurial Approach to Globalization
by Michael Y. Yoshino and U. Srinivasa Rangan (Harvard Business School
Press).

Strategic alliances are a major method for globalisation and this is
the best book I have read to date on the international aspects of this
subject.

MANAGEMENT:
A PRODUCT OF POETRY - RUPERT MORRIS WONDERS HOW FAMOUS VERSE COULD BE
USED IN ADVERTISING

   By RUPERT MORRIS

Readers of the Management Page may have noticed that Union Bank of
Switzerland has been using poetry in its advertisements.

'Thoughts that transcend time from Union Bank of Switzerland' have
appeared on global satellite and cable channels, featuring Sir John
Gielgud and others reading classic poems like Ozymandias, Ulysses and
so on.

The poetry was chosen, according to project manager Vincento
Travaglione, to embody corporate values of 'responsibility, openness,
courage and perseverance'.

Of course, there is nothing new about poetry in advertising. In the
early years of this century, we were regaled with gems like these: The
Onoto, the Owl and the Waverley pen, They come as a boon and a blessing
to men . .

Or the following, proclaiming the attraction of Everybody's, a popular
magazine of the inter-war years: Oh Mr Porter, whatever shall I do? I
was reading my Everybody's and got carried on to Crewe] Copy-writing
was in its infancy in those days, I suppose, which may explain why
these excruciating verses lasted for several years; and yet they were
probably extremely effective, imprinting themselves on the popular
consciousness in much the same way as the catchiest pop songs.

Nowadays, alas, advertisers are more image-conscious. You can't imagine
the Body Shop using some naff rhyme, can you? Ovaltine is the
honourable exception, resurrecting the delightful song of those 'happy
girls and boys', the 'Ovalteenies'.

But Advico Young and Rubicam, the Zurich agency which dreamed up the
UBS campaign, have been doubly smart. Not only have they regaled TV
viewers with some decent poems for a change, subtly enhancing their
client's image; they have also done it on the cheap by using authors
who are long out of copyright.

There is no end to the number of commercial interests that might
benefit from a quick glance through the Oxford Book of English Verse.

Brewers, for instance, need look no further than AE Housman. Indeed,
Ind Coope should surely consider funding an AE Housman chair of poetry
at its Burton-on-Trent headquarters.

No modern copy-writer could improve on this passage from A Shropshire
Lad: Say, for what hop-yards meant, Or why was Burton built on Trent?
Oh many a peer of England brews Livelier liquor than the Muse. And malt
does more than Milton can To justify God's ways to man. Ale, man, ale's
the stuff to drink For fellows whom it hurts to think.

Your AB audience might blench somewhat at the last line, but
self-conscious intellectuals are not usually beer drinkers anyway, so I
don't think we need worry.

Haircare has been a fruitful medium for advertisers, and yet one does
feel that there is a certain creative vacuum in this field.

Purveyors of hair bleach must despair of that stubborn group of
independent-minded modern women who refuse to emulate the models with
flowing locks on their screens and become bottle blondes. Perhaps they
should try a touch of Wordsworth: Earth hath not anything to show more
fair  .

And if that doesn't work, there's always Eliot: Stand on the highest
pavement of the stair - Lean on a garden urn Weave, weave the sunlight
in your hair On reflection, this verse might be more appropriate for
wigmakers. But that's the joy of poetry as an advertising medium. It's
so flexible.

Other products and services might not be so easy. It is certainly time
the army came up with something better than that macho stuff with young
lads driving tanks, swimming, skiing and and generally behaving like
would-be contestants on Gladiators. How about something that brings out
those unchanging values of selfless patriotism? The Soldier, by Rupert
Brooke, has the right combination of gravitas and romanticism. But that
first line is a bit of a downer: 'If I should die . .' You might as
well make it a commercial for funeral services.

Now there's a thought. Undertakers have been loath to advertise up to
now, but poetry might give them just the opportunity they need. The
words of the American Stephen Vincent Benet spring to mind: You may
bury my body in Sussex grass, You may bury my tongue in Champmedy, I
shall not be there, I shall rise and pass. Bury my heart at Wounded
Knee.

At Berry & Birnam we always respect the wishes of the departed. Organ
refrigeration a speciality. Or something like that.

MANAGEMENT:
LIQUID THERAPY FOR THE NEW YEAR

   By LUCY KELLAWAY

Ihave not been myself recently. Not since I filled my body with a
strange orange liquid at the start of the festive season. The incident
was quite out of character and the memory of it leaves me feeling
sheepish and puzzled even now. Lest you conclude that I went wild on
the mandarin liqueur, I should assure you that my liquid was imaginary
and that it has made me calmer, unflappable, ready for the new year.

The bizarre story began when a lady named Deborah Marshall-Warren
offered me a free trial of something called Orange Liquid Therapy. She
said this was a 'mental de-tox' session that involved hypnotism, deep
relaxation and direct suggestion to sooth all my stresses away. Halfway
round the bend with pre-Christmas strain at the time, I felt willing to
try anything. When she told me her practice was in Regent Street, that
clinched it: I could sort myself out and do some Christmas shopping as
well.

Yet when I arrived at her office, I started to feel uneasy. There was
an unnatural calm about Ms Marshall-Warren. Her eyes were red and she
looked as if she had been crying for weeks. We sat in a tiny cubicle as
hot as the Sahara and lit by a large bright globe. 'I'm going to put
you under quickly', she said. Obediently, I sat in the chair and tried
to relax. I looked at the spot on her hand. I closed my eyes. 'Feel
your calves filling with a warm, orange liquid', she crooned. 'It is
soothing, tingling, and it is moving, up, up into your knees. Feel your
knees filling with a warm, orange liquid. It is soothing, tingling. It
is moving, up, up into your thighs . .' You get the picture.

When I was full to the brim with orange liquid, I had to imagine it
scrubbing out my cares, fears, anxieties, fizzing and dissolving them
in much the same way that Domestos gets to work with stubborn household
stains. Then, when there was no more work for it to do, I was told to
picture it slowly draining out through my fingers and toes. Clean and
emptied, I was informed that I was feeling lighter, more confident,
better able to cope and happier.

Set down in black and white, orange liquid therapy sounds daft as a
brush. I am constitutionally opposed to New Age nonsense. I do not
believe in trendy miracle cures for complex problems. The sort of
stress relief that makes sense to me is to work less, drink less or to
go on holiday.

So imagine my bewilderment to find myself feeling much better after 45
minutes of semi-conscious sloshing around in make-believe coloured
fluid. Before entering the cubicle I felt tense, on the verge of
hysteria. Afterwards I was cheerful, unbothered even by Oxford Circus
in the rain at rush hour, and more or less equal to Christmas.

Yet when I tell my friends and colleagues my wonderful hypnotism story
they give me a wary look. As far as they are concerned, I've started on
a slippery slope, and soon I will be pushing all kinds of dubious
management gimmicks. I insist I am still the same person. They are not
so sure. We shall see.

1995 was the year in which the re-engineering craze died. A
replacement, developed by McKinsey and explained in the consultant's
latest quarterly bulletin is called: Do It, Then Fix It. I like this
new fad more than the old one, because it comes in words of one
syllable. The idea behind it is equally hard to argue with: companies
should work out what changes to their business need to be made, then
they should carry them out without more ado. Once done, they should
assess the result, and if it has flaws, they should swiftly put them
right. Indeed, this seems to be such a sensible way of going about
things, it is a mystery to me why companies need McKinsey to spell it
out to them.

In the middle of all the change that companies are supposed to be
undergoing, one thing remains constant: workers feel their bosses do
not have their best interests at heart.

Never mind all the empowerment, teamwork and egalitarian structures,
employees take the same dim view of their managers as they always have
done. According to actuaries Watson Wyatt, less than half believe their
company is well managed, or think that their bosses make the right
strategic decisions.

The only thing that has changed in recent years is that workers now
view their superiors as hypocrites: good at drawing up a set of values
for the company, less good at living by those values themselves.

I realise it is not for me to volunteer new year's resolutions for
others, especially as I have not made any for myself. But might it not
be time for senior managers to start practising what they preach? I
used to think that human behaviour was difficult to change, in
particular that old dogs could not be taught new tricks. But now I am
not so sure. Dare I recommend a little hypnotherapy? On second thoughts
it would only work if they wanted to change. And that, surely, is the
problem.

MANAGEMENT: TEGE - FAST TRACK

   By IAN RODGER

Why not start the new year by acquiring a share in Tege, the Swiss
company that is developing a french-fries vending machine?

That's right, insert a Pounds 1 coin, wait about a minute and out pops
a fresh, hot portion of french fries. Well, almost. The vending machine
is still in the prototype stage and unlikely to be on the streets of
Europe until next spring.

Nevertheless Tege's shares soared to a high of nearly SFr74 (Pounds
41.50) on the Geneva Stock Exchange last May, valuing the company at an
impressive SFr68m. They slid recently to SFr48 after it became apparent
that the planned launch would be delayed by about six months.

The machine - or rather the french fries production system - is the
brainchild of Richard Sorensen, an American inventor. Sorensen joined
six European investors, including Jacques Hennessy (of the Cognac
house) after an initial association with a US venture-capital company
turned sour.

They claim to have put about Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.8m) into the venture
to date. Early last year they reversed into a derelict quoted Swiss
funicular company, Tege, and transferred all the patents to it.
Together they hold 55 per cent of Tege's 920,000 bearer shares.

Patrick Bigger, a Swiss who is chief executive, said they chose a Swiss
incorporation because many of the institutional investors in the
project are Swiss and wanted a Swiss franc share. Operations, however,
are based in England, where a three-month market test with 25 machines
is scheduled to start next March.

The problem with producing french fries is that the fries quickly
become soggy. Thus a vending machine can only work if it makes a fresh
portion every time. Sorensen's solution is to use potato powder.

Once an order is made, a given amount of powder is measured and mixed
with water to achieve a dough-like substance. The dough cube is pressed
through an extruder into french fries which fall into four steel
baskets in a pot of hot oil. The baskets revolve slowly around the oil
pot and a minute later tip the fries into a chute where they fall into
a cardboard sleeve.

The clever bit, claims Bigger, is the composition of the powder, which
contains patented additives that make it form into a perfectly
consistent dough within five seconds. Any dough left lying about
quickly reverts to harmless dry powder.

The oil is kept at 220'C, well below its boiling point, and is
frequently stirred even if no orders are being taken. It is also
automatically filtered and topped up for losses that go with the fries.

Tege executives are now setting up licensing and marketing arrangements
in many countries and spinning out creative sales and profit forecasts.
In one projection, 1999 net income comes in at SFr92.9m.

They plan both to sell and lease machines and supply the magic powder.
A machine will sell for about SFr15,000 and revenue and earnings
projections are based on portions being sold for Pounds 1, DM1.50
(Pounds 0.67), FFr4.50 (Pounds 0.58), or SFr1.80. They assume the
average machine will sell 50 portions a week.

The company needs another Dollars 6m or so to cover its costs until
revenues start flowing in. A convertible bond issue is the most likely
route, says Bigger.

BUSINESS TRAVEL:
HOTELIER'S STARCK CHOICE - IAN SCHRAGER'S HOTELS ARE FOR THOSE WHO CAN
AFFORD CHINTZ BUT WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT

   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

On paper, Ian Schrager looks like the sort of self-indulgent
businessman who is rather too self-indulgent for his own good.

He did, after all, fly 80 palm trees from Washington to the Delano
hotel he opened in Miami last summer, because they were more attractive
than the local crop. And, after taking a closer look at the sand on
nearby Miami Beach, he shipped in a ton-and-a-half of a superior
variety.

Yet Schrager is not just another architecture junkie who allows
aesthetic excess to cloud his business judgment. He can rattle off the
profit margins on almost every aspect of the Delano and of his three
New York hotels. He has harnessed his love of design to turn them into
the hotels of choice for what he calls 'the generation that wants
something different' - artists, actors, designers and musicians who can
afford four-star or five-star establishments but find them rather
boring.

The three New York hotels - the Royalton, Morgans and the Paramount -
are almost always fully booked. The Delano in Miami is so popular that
last month's American Vogue prefaced an article on other Miami hotels
by saying: 'If you can't get into the Delano . . . .'. Schrager is now
renovating the Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles and searching for a site
in London.

The progress of his business career has been erratic, to say the least.
He made his name in the late 1970s with Studio 54, a New York nightclub
that he ran with his university roommate, the late Steve Rubell. Studio
54 captured the hedonistic spirit of the late 1970s. But in 1980
Schrager and Rubell were sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for tax
evasion.

After their release they opened a nightclub, the Palladium, and
diversified into hotels. Neither had any experience of the business,
but they knew what sort of place to open. 'There was no point in
opening another luxury hotel,' says Schrager. 'That end of the business
was well served by Claridges in London, the Bel Air in LA and the
Carlyle in New York. They serve room service course by course at
Claridges. You can't beat that.'

They sensed a need for a new type of luxury hotel for the sort of
people who used to go to Studio 54 - people who wanted, and were
willing to pay for, the comfort and service they got in conventional
luxury hotels, but would prefer a less formal setting more in tune with
their taste than the chintzy interior of Claridges.

They started by renovating Morgans, a discreet mid-town hotel with 154
rooms built in the late 1920s. Schrager commissioned Andree Putman, the
French designer, to refurbish Morgans in her understatedly elegant
modernist style, but they were more adventurous in their choice of
designer for the next hotel, the Royalton, which they entrusted to the
flamboyant Frenchman, Philippe Starck. Schrager worked with Starck
again on the Paramount, an equally extrovert but less expensive hotel
that opened in 1990.

Each of the New York hotels has its own character. The Royalton is the
most audacious. The Paramount is for people who love the Royalton but
cannot quite afford it. And Morgans is the most discreet. Schrager
ensures there is a difference of at least Dollars 50 (Pounds 32)
between the room rates: Dollars 250 for the Royalton, Dollars 200 for
Morgans and Dollars 100 for the Paramount. They all have an average
occupancy rate of more than 90 per cent, against the US industry
average of 71 per cent.

'Coming from the nightclub business was great training for running an
hotel,' says Schrager. 'You're selling a commodity product. A nightclub
sells the same drink and plays the same music as the competition. The
only thing that differentiates them is production values. It's the same
with hotels.'

Production values are Schrager's forte. Starck, with whom he
collaborated on the Delano's all-white interior and Alice In Wonderland
garden, is prodigiously talented but notoriously difficult to work
with. Schrager's solution is to set up a project management team of
architects, art directors and buyers to implement Starck's ideas and
bring them in on budget.

'After doing three hotels with Philippe, we know what to expect,' says
Schrager. 'We don't panic when we get these weird faxes from him.' This
system has produced some of Starck's best work. He is one of the
world's most sought-after designers who receives three or four requests
a month to design hotels, but says 'no to all of them, except Ian'.

All Schrager's hotels look expensive. The fittings are specially
commissioned and the renovation budgets seem high - Dollars 28m for the
Delano, Dollars 35m for the Royalton, Dollars 60m for the 610-room
Paramount. But Schrager is careful to buy existing hotels which will be
easy to convert. 'We replace everything, even the plumbing, but leave
the rooms intact. You can get into trouble by banging on walls.' He
says it would cost 'much more' to kit out his hotels in conventional
chintz than in a sumptuous Starck design.

His latest project is the Mondrian in Los Angeles. It was purpose-built
as a 1960s apartment hotel and is now being redesigned by Starck, who
says he wants it to be 'very, very white with one or two symbols of
colour' to emphasise the 'dreaminess of LA'. Schrager has asked artist
James Turrell to create a 'three-dimensional living art piece' for the
foyer 'so it will be like walking into an artwork.'

As his hotel chain expands, Schrager has cut costs by pooling areas
such as purchasing and marketing. He is careful to concentrate on room
rental, and licenses out services such as bars, restaurants and gyms.
Brian McNally, who has turned the Royalton's '44' into one of
Manhattan's most chic restaurants, runs the Delano's Blue Room with pop
star Madonna as a co-investor. Schrager even licenses the newsstands.
'When we ran the newsstand at the Paramount, it lost Dollars 1,000 a
month. We've given it to a guy who knows the business and it makes
Dollars 4,500 a month.'

The Mondrian is scheduled for completion in October and Schrager will
then expand outside the US. He has hunted for sites in London without
success, although Granada's hostile Pounds 3.3bn bid for Forte could
create some opportunities.

'My customers travel on a certain axis,' says Schrager. 'New York,
Miami and Los Angeles are on it, so are London and Paris. You couldn't
open hotels like mine just anywhere because there wouldn't be enough
people to fill it. And I'd put as much effort into a place with 17
rooms as I would into one with 700.'

BUSINESS TRAVEL:
BANGKOK GETS TOUGH ON MOTORISTS


More than 100 people were arrested on the first day of a campaign by
Bangkok police to force motorists to heed traffic regulations as part
of an attempt to unsnarl the city's gridlock.

In Bangkok, known for the world's worst traffic jams, drivers routinely
flout the rules. Violators often slip the police small bribes and are
swiftly on their way.

Car sales in 1995 are expected to have topped 500,000, making Thailand
the largest car market in south-east Asia. But only 8 per cent of
Bangkok's land surface is covered by roads, compared to 25 per cent in
New York and Paris. Short trips in the city can take hours.

Bangkok's traffic problem is affecting the city's development. Some
foreign businesses have decided to locate elsewhere, and tourists spend
less time and money in the capital, citing their aversion to the
traffic. The campaign is part of a plan by Thaksin Shinawatra, a
billionaire businessman and deputy prime minister, who was elected last
July on a pledge that he would solve Bangkok's traffic problems in six
months or resign. Thaksin's deadline - January 26 - is approaching with
no noticeable improvement in traffic conditions.

However, the World Bank recently announced it will provide a Dollars
150m (Pounds 97m) loan to Thailand to help alleviate its traffic
problems. Maurice Le-Blanc of the bank said: 'The government of
Thailand has taken a leading role in the region in addressing
environmental and road safety issues in an aggressive manner, which to
date have proved very successful. This will further those efforts.'

For those who can make it through the traffic, Bangkok's first
Cyberpub has just opened, providing a focus for the party-loving
after-work crowd. For Dollars 12 an hour, customers can sit at one of
10 glass-topped tables equipped with a Compaq Presario.

Getting into the spirit of things, an opening night trio of women
clicked on to a virtual dating service which bills itself as 'Your link
to true love'. As the picture and vital statistics of a young hunk from
New York appeared on the screen, one adjusted her glasses and took a
closer look.

The Cyberpub is in the same ownership as the local upmarket Dusit Thani
hotel chain.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CARRIERS CUT FARES


British Airways is cutting fares to almost 100 destinations until
January 17 as part of of its World Offers. The largest saving, Pounds
358, is on return flights to Harare, with prices starting at Pounds
599. Fares to Nairobi start at Pounds 439, down Pounds 356. BA fares to
Australian cities Darwin and Perth will be Pounds 561, saving Pounds
161 on the regular lowest fares, with Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns,
Melbourne and Sydney prices cut by Pounds 124 to Pounds 699. USAir has
reduced its everyday advance purchase ticket prices for spring and
summer travel by up to 44 per cent. The move came a day after a flurry
of winter fare cuts of up to 50 per cent initiated by Delta Air Lines,
which was swiftly matched by most of its competitors.

Italian air traffic controllers have signed a new wage agreement,
ending their long fight for more money, a union official said. The
accord will give controllers a 6 per cent salary rise for the period
1994-95. More talks will be needed to hammer out a settlement for
1996-97.

AIRPORT ON TRACK


Hong Kong's new USDollars 20bn airport project, including
infrastructure and reclamation, is almost half finished, the government
said yesterday. At the start of last month the 10 core projects were 46
per cent complete.

Billy Lam, director of the new airport's co-ordination office, said the
project, which will replace congested Kai Tak airport, was on schedule
and within budget. Seven of the projects are government-funded.

'Our target remains that the first planes will be flying out of Hong
Kong's new international airport at Chek Lap Kok in April 1998 and I am
confident that the total cost will be within our budget of Dollars
20.3bn,' Lam said.

BUSINESS TRAVEL:
CASH IN THE SKY


A high-tech business partly owned by a former Israel Air Force
commander has miniaturised the technology needed to recognise
banknotes, and introduced a product it hopes will turn aircraft into
flying banks.

Inflight Financial Services is negotiating with Israel's El Al airline
and US-based carriers such as United Airlines and Delta to install its
Aero-Cash automatic currency exchange machine on regular flights.

The company has developed a way of reducing bulky automatic exchange
machines to a lightweight, suitcase-sized package that easily

operates on aircraft, it said. Company president Mony Lichman said the
machine, which exchanges US dollars and seven European currencies for
any other money, 'will become a fixture on airplanes and change the way
travellers bank'.

United Airlines said it was considering using Aero-Cash on its flights
but had not yet finalised terms. The machine accepts credit cards and
will charge no commission, Lichman said.

Inflight Financial Services is a multinational company partly owned and
managed by Israelis. Some of the development work on Aero-Cash was done
in Belgium.

AIRPORT THREATENED


Russian airport police intervened last week to prevent a group of
businessmen from taking control of the VIP lounge at Moscow's main
international airport.

Anatoly Koryakin, director of the Sheremetyevo-2 airport, said the
businessmen had appeared in the lounge with a bailiff and police in
what seemed to be a property dispute. Some were armed with Kalashnikov
automatic rifles.

'Thanks to the intervention of airport security officers, order was
restored and work on receiving official delegations continued,'
Koryakin said.

MEDIA FUTURES:
POBOX AND THE MAGIC COOKIE

   By TIM DICKSON

Which company will have the greatest effect on the development of the
Internet this year? My answer is neither Microsoft nor Netscape. It is
a tiny new company in Philadelphia called Pobox. com - spelt as if it
were an abbreviation of Post Office Box, but pronounced as the single
word 'Pobox'. Its product consists of a simple forwarding service that
is an electronic equivalent of a post office box.

The system works as follows. Customers give out an e-mail address
ending in pobox. com - like the one that appears at the bottom of this
column. When their friends or colleagues send them e-mail at that
address, a computer in Philadelphia looks up the recipient in a data
base and forwards the message immediately to their Internet provider.

This service allows people to give out an e-mail address that is
independent of where they work or where they choose to buy Internet
access. Moving from one Internet provider to another is simply a matter
of sending a message to pobox. com giving a new forwarding address and
quoting a 'magic cookie', a number that establishes the customer's
authenticity.

I have already discovered an advantage of the service. Having recently
moved from London to Silicon Valley in order to work on a book, I have
switched Internet providers. But my address has remained the same, and
messages sent to me as if I were in London are forwarded to me in
California without my having had to tell anyone how to reach me.

Yet people moving house are not the sole market. Other potential users
includes customers of CompuServe, which allows people to use only an
indecipherable string of numbers as their e-mail address.

Equally attracted will be those who are embarrassed by the cumbersome
length or strange letter-and-number combination of their real e-mail
address.

The entrepreneurs behind Pobox. com are a pair of students at the
University of Pennsylvania, still living in a college dormitory: Reuven
Bell, 23, whose subject is religious studies, and Meng-Weng Wong, 21, a
computer science major born in Singapore. The two launched their
service in early 1995, and already have 3,000 users. In keeping with
the principle that most of the best Internet businesses start off by
giving things away, the pair offer a generous free trial lasting three
months.

Thereafter, the price for forwarding mail starts from Dollars 15 a
year, payable by credit card - with the incentive of six years for the
price of five to those who choose to pay Dollars 55 in advance.

Three months is exactly right for the trial period. It is long enough
for customers to become comfortable with the service and to give their
new e-mail address to all their friends, but not long enough for anyone
to find it worthwhile to start again with a new name from scratch.

So far, 850 electronic invoices have been sent out, and almost half
have been paid. Because of a glitch in the billing software, Bell and
Wong have not yet had time to send out reminders. But early indications
are promising, and the pair claim that an automated trawl of Internet
newsgroups has turned up more than 1,000 mentions of their service,
only one of which was negative.

Whether Pobox. com will make serious money or not is too early to
predict. Its founders certainly hope so. Bell has just taken time off
from his degree to work on the business 12 hours a day, and is planning
to pursue some Wharton MBA courses on his return to academia. Moreover,
the company already has imitators: a sign, surely, that others see the
potential in its idea.

Even a modest success could have a sharp effect on the Net. It would
remove the fear of changing e-mail address that forces many to stay
with an unsatisfactory service provider. In doing so, Pobox. com's
success would make a large global industry significantly more
competitive.

Talking of magic cookies, someone recently sent me the following
story by e-mail. A woman who had eaten a delicious cookie at the cafe
of a department store in Dallas asked for the recipe. 'We don't give it
out,' said the waiter. However, the customer persisted and offered to
pay for the recipe.

On hearing that the price would be 'two fifty', she agreed to charge it
to her credit card along with the bill for her lunch, and was then
handed the recipe on a printed sheet. Thirty days later, her Visa
statement revealed she had been charged Dollars 250.

The furious cookie lover called the company's head office, thinking
that the real figure should have been Dollars 2.50, but was told there
was no mistake.

The Dollars 250 was to insure that not just anyone could afford the
recipe. Accordingly, her request for a refund had to be turned down,
but the woman got her own back in the end.

She copied the recipe into an e-mail, which she posted to all her
friends. They posted it to their friends, and they in turn to theirs.
'I paid for it,' her e-mail said, 'so you can have it for free.'

I find it hard to imagine that the department store named in the e-mail
would behave in such a pig-headed way.

But even if apocryphal, the story illustrates the power of the
Internet. By the time you read this, tens of thousands of people may
have baked cookies according to the recipe without paying Dollars 250.
And the name of the store chain will have been blackened on computer
screens all over the world.

MEDIA FUTURES:
HOME SHOPPING TAKES A TUMBLE FROM ITS TROLLEY - ENTHUSIASTIC PREDICTIONS
OF A COUCH-POTATO FUTURE WERE PREMATURE

   By WINSTON FLETCHER

A funny thing has happened. Home shopping, that supposedly
trail-blazing benefit of interactive television, has fallen out of its
supermarket trolley.

Less than a year ago the pundits were predicting a couch-potato future
for us all. Sitting comfortably in front of our screens, we would surf
the stores and trawl the malls. Never again need we venture into the
rough, tough world of Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. We would
click-on, cruise-thru', and our cyber-shopping trollies would be filled
by techno-magic.

Well, it hasn't happened yet. But is it on its way?

The picture is confused as there are two types of televisual home
shopping. First, conventional satellite/cable channels offering
merchandise in a fairly traditional way. Second, shopping emporia -
mostly American - are burgeoning on the Net.

The more knowledgeable US home shopping gurus have long been suspicious
of the forecast explosion in their marketplace. QVC, America's largest,
highest profile home-shopping channel, mostly sells jewellery (42 per
cent of its turnover) and clothing (18 per cent). For clothing, the
return rate is about 40 per cent.

A couple of years ago QVC's then retiring chairman, Joseph Segel, said
in a notable speech: 'The number of people tuned to a particular
channel when your advertising runs is likely to be a small fraction of
the number you could reach with direct mail. The cost of running a
shopping channel is much greater than most people realise. Some system
developers and their software programmers assume that consumers are
itching to be converted from passive to interactive TV viewers.
Certainly there are some people who fit that mould. But I venture to
say that the great American public prefers just to watch television and
let someone else do the work.'

In turn, futurologist John Naisbitt's well-informed Trend Letter - a
publication understandably keen to embrace almost anything and
everything new under the sun - recently asked: 'Is the much-hyped age
of online shopping about to bloom? Not really.' The same issue of Trend
Letter reported that 'merchants on the Internet are reluctant to
solicit credit-card numbers for payment, lest hackers steal account
numbers' - a little cybernetic difficulty that has by no means been
resolved.

Nonetheless, research estimates suggest that 2m online purchases were
made in the US in the last year. That sounds an awful lot until you
remember that it equates to a single purchase by less than 1 per cent
of America's population. And Americans, particularly those living way
out nowhere, have always been catalogue shoppers, so direct marketing
has always been big business in the US.

It is a far-flung country, and even with gasolene as cheap as Coke it
doesn't make a lot of sense to drive hundreds of miles for a rubber
grommet. In other words, established home shoppers may just be
switching media, from print to Net - without new shoppers being
inveigled into the couch-potato lifestyle.

Where Americans are slow to lead, Europeans are even slower to follow.
At the end of 1994 a study of the multimedia marketplace in Europe
carried out by leading research group Inteco reported that the demand
for home shopping was non existent. 'No one in the study,' it
proclaimed, 'showed any interest in being able to order goods
electronically.'

The progress of home shopping in Britain confirms that. QVC started
with a bang in the UK but sales appear to be stabilising at about
Pounds 50m annually - not a lot with which to run a full-time channel
and supply some 300,000 customers.

Part of the reason for this disappointing growth is the result, I
suspect, of the hype attached to the phrase 'virtual reality'.
Televisual shopping, it is claimed, provides 'virtual reality'. In a
virtual reality supermarket you can whiz round the aisles picking up a
pack of this and a jar of that as you skid past the shelves. It sounds
so futuristic, so clever, that we have been seduced into believing it
would be wonderful. But would it?

It would certainly be fun once or twice, like a video game. But we all
know what has happened to the sales of video games. The problem is that
virtual reality really doesn't bear much resemblance to reality.

We encounter reality through our five senses: sight, sound, smell,
taste and touch. So-called virtual reality offers reality in - at best
- two dimensions: sight and sound. Sight is the most important single
sense involved when we go shopping. But it is not the only one.

As supermarkets are well aware, smell is all-important. That is why
they put fruit and vegetables at the front of the store, and bake their
own bread. For many products, touch is as important as smell. ('If you
don't want the goods, don't muck 'em about', went the old
costermongers' injunction, to restrain customers from manhandling the
produce).

Paradoxically, it is in the area of sight that virtual reality is least
real. If Bill Gates, the boss of Microsoft, believes that projecting
huge cyber-blowups of great masterpieces on to his walls will convey
even a tad of their artistic merit, it is as well he never tried to
major in aesthetics.

But never mind great paintings. Would you even buy fresh meats or fish,
or even fruits and vegetables, without seeing them in the flesh? If
people didn't want to inspect the goods carefully and choose the
freshest, why would they shop at the deli counter? The newest Tesco
stores now have large old-fashioned butcher's sections. And if you want
to inspect groceries before you buy them, why not shop for the lot at
one stop?

Apart from groceries, the sector that has generated most chatter among
the marketing classes - but again, little action so far - is cars. (The
marketing classes are not much interested in jewellery - not in selling
it, anyway).

Automotive gurus constantly predict that the end of the showroom is
nigh: motorists, it is said, will compare and contrast different models
on-screen before selecting their test-drive short-list. And one day,
even the test-drive will be taken on-screen.

The assumption is that video information is more appealing to motorists
than printed or personal (showroom) information. Maybe. But feel,
comfort, guidance - even smell - are important reasons for showroom
visits, and cannot be duplicated by 'virtual reality'.

Which may explain why the only area in which home shopping seems to be
taking off is one in which virtual reality is virtually non-existent -
the marketing, not of goods, but of services, particularly financial
services.

As financial products are, so to speak, invisible and intangible, they
are ideal for telephone selling. While financial service providers
increasingly use direct response television advertising
cost-effectively, their commercials could hardly be described as
virtual reality. Or indeed, in many cases, as reality of any sort.

Not that home shopping is not going to grow. It will, but it will be
slow and highly specialised. Delivery takes time and costs money. Many
people, perhaps most, will never feel comfortable with computers.
Forget those middle-class parental boasts of brilliantly sophisticated
computer-literate kids; think, instead, about all the underprivileged,
computer-illiterate kids.

Nor is home shopping quite as revolutionary as cyberbuffs believe.
Almost exactly a century ago the Victorians were opening up their own
version of the information superhighway (and with at least as much
hyperbole). The UK postal service, the railways, the telephone and the
telegram were bustin' out all over. Telegrams were described - as new
media so frequently are described by their sponsors - as 'the boldest
advertisements in modern times.'

By the turn of the century, all the great London department stores had
mail-order departments. Harrods, which pioneered home shopping by
telephone, rejoiced in the telephonic address EVERYTHING, LONDON.
Whiteley's in Bayswater boasted they could supply anything 'from a pin
to an elephant' door-to-door.

And the Army and Navy store sped huge mail-order catalogues to its
customers in every corner of the globe, carrying within their covers a
cornucopia of sumptuous and succulent merchandise. Moreover, delivery
was often a good deal faster and cheaper than it generally would be
today.

Home shopping may yet be the bonanza of the future. But I wouldn't bet
my Tesco shares on it.

MEDIA FUTURES: CYBER SIGHTINGS

   By STEPHEN MCGOOKIN

Kicking off this US presidential election year, the Doonesbury Town
Hall site (www. doonesbury. com/ main. html), based on Garry Trudeau's
consistently brilliant strip cartoon, looks a fine way of keeping tabs
on the campaign as it unfolds. The site (slogan: 'Join the fight
against cluelessness') has a daily news briefing and links to the
PoliticsUSA resource, as well as a chat hall and a straw poll. Top
notch.

As access increases to the former Soviet Union and eastern and central
Europe, the Prague-based Open Media Research Institute (www. omri. cz) -
a successor to Radio Free Europe - offers useful resources including a
daily digest of economic issues affecting the region.

A new site from United Airlines (www. ual. com) is an example of how a
primarily corporate marketing site can be user-friendly and
informative. Very well done, nice graphics, not too much text per page
and easy to navigate around.

The Taiwan Business Directory (http://business. com. tw) is a searchable
guide to products and companies from Taiwan. It's indexed by company
name and, comprehensively, by product classification. There are eight
contact entries alone under the heading Food and using the sub-category
Soy Sauce.

Empower (www. megalinx. net/empower) is 'Black America's Magazine for
the
Information Age', with a newswire, articles about the affirmative
action debate, and a good business profile feature, focusing on
African-American achievers.

SPORT:
GREEN TURNS DARK FOR THE STRUGGLING GOLF CLUB PRO

   By KEITH WHEATLEY

Peter Alliss recently observed that the average club golfer expects the
local professional to play like Nick Faldo, teach like John Jacobs and
be as good a shopkeeper as Marks and Spencer.

Very few club members realise how much of an endangered species the
non- tour golf professional is about to become, especially in Britain,
the home of golf. Traditionally, the pro has received a small retainer
from his club but earned the bulk of his living selling equipment and
giving lessons.

Yet selling equipment to club members is becoming virtually impossible
as the tiniest of retailers strives to compete against specialist chain
stores such as American Golf Discount and Nevada Bob's.

'The members don't realise what a financial strain it is to carry the
stock on a big overdraft and they can be such fickle customers,' says
Haydn Darrell, the pro at the small Devon club of Sidmouth. 'I'll see
them turn up to play with a new set of clubs and I won't even have had
the chance to match the price they've paid from one of the big chain
stores.'

Darrell's experience is echoed nationally. A recent report from the
specialist Golf Research Group predicted that the 2,400 retail outlets
supplying the UK golf equipment market will have shrunk to only 200 to
300 shops within a year or two.

'The traditional pro shop just cannot survive,' says Colin Hegarty,
head of GRG. 'The average gross turnover is around Pounds 110,000 a
year and they cannot stock the shop and survive on that kind of
volume.'

His figures show that the bigger retail outlets are growing fast, with
a matching shrinkage at the smaller end. Hegarty says the club pro has
two options: 'Get out of the business quickly: it's better to take a
big loss than stay and starve to death. Or become an Alan Walker.'

Walker is a former club pro - 10 years at the coalface - who realised
he was a doomed species in a thriving industry, so he now has a
high-volume shop adjoining his Warren Park driving range in Essex, plus
a management company looking after a nearby pay-and-play course.

Walker says that club pros have lost their retail business
'frighteningly quickly. Five years ago it was a Pounds 130,000 average
turnover with a 35 per cent margin. That's all over.'

His own shop turns over slightly more than Pounds 1m a year, but a
branch of American Golf Discount has just opened on Walker's doorstep.

'We're being hurt,' he admits. 'Teaching alone isn't the answer to
replacing lost income. Firstly, statistics show that the British are
the worst golfers in the world in terms of readiness to take
instruction. Secondly, it's too seasonal. Who's having a lesson today?'

He looked out of his office window as an arctic snow shower blasted
across the 14th green. Few issues currently occupy the Professional
Golfer's Association as intensely as the livelihoods of its 3,500
members. As a result, a PGA working party is radically re-thinking the
raison d'etre of the pro.

It doesn't help that while the public image of the golf professional is
Nick Faldo or Ernie Els, superstars like those are a light year away
from the everyday work of the pro at the local club.

When the PGA wanted a leading figure for a publicity campaign, it found
Faldo's fee unaffordable, so ended up using Nigel Mansell, one of the
game's better-known amateurs.

Alan Walker is a committee member at the PGA and is deeply involved in
the process of reviewing future direction. As one experienced insider
put it: 'We have to stop training people for futures they are never
going to have. They're not going to be Woosnam or Norman, and now
they're not going to be a successful shopkeeper, either.'

Walker acknowledges the problems. 'At the end of the day we're all
failed players,' he says. 'I went into the game thinking I could play
and was going to spend my days on the course winning tournaments, and
I've ended up an accountant.' Later this month the PGA opens an Pounds
8m training academy at its headquarters, The Belfry, the hotel course
in the English Midlands that has hosted several Ryder Cups.

Leisure management and course architecture are much more important now
than learning how to spend several hours repairing a persimmon-headed
driver for a tiny fee.

The qualifications dished out at The Belfry will be equivalent to a
degree. 'We've always been reluctant retailers, and the tour is for a
tiny minority, of whom 75 per cent won't cover their costs,' says
Walker. 'The jobs we've got to aim for are those of actually managing
the facilities, which in the past have gone to food and beverage
specialists or greenkeepers.

'In the future, if your local club pro can't drive a computer and work
the local media, forget admiring his short game around the green.'

If the pro can re-engineer himself to survive, what of the shop? We may
not buy much, but which weekend golfer doesn't enjoy a mooch around his
club shop's over-stocked shelves?

'It's history,' says Colin Hegarty. 'Marks and Spencer are already
moving into clothing in a huge way and the big chains will be selling
all the clubs and equipment. A starter's hut where you can buy a glove
and a ball - if you've forgotten to bring them - is the most likely
outcome.'

ARCHITECTURE:
YEAR OF THE MILLENNIAL RE-THINK

   By COLIN AMERY

At least 1995 ended on a note of pure wisdom. For once, the old English
system of independent representative groups of well-informed
individuals appointed by the crown to guide our affairs worked
brilliantly, with the millennium commissioners proving themselves worth
their salt by refusing to allocate national lottery money for the
proposed Cardiff Bay opera house.

For too long Lord Crickhowell and his opera house trustees have been
led by the nose by London architectural groupies and admirers of the
designs of Zaha Hadid, who won the competition to design the proposed
opera house.

The common sense of the minister, Virginia Bottomley, and her
commissioners will save Wales the embarrassment of a design that is not
supported by the people of Wales and is already dated.

A Cardiff Bay opera house as a new home for the Welsh National Opera is
a good idea, and no doubt a large theatre will be built there. The
mistake was for the opera house trustees to believe they had to build
something approved by a narrow segment of the international
architectural mafia.

The jury for the competition was unrepresentative and innocent,
seemingly prepared to let Miss Hadid's quaintly modern period piece go
ahead even though she had never built a serious building. Miss Hadid is
really a talented futurist painter - her work would have been avant
garde in turn of the century Russia. Today it is labelled
'uncompromising' and 'exciting'. It is neither. The trendy London
chatterers who influence people like Lord Crickhowell should be seen
for what they are: rearguard types trying to protect a briefly
fashionable designer. But Miss Hadid is no genius.

The tragedy of the inevitable row about Cardiff Bay is that the failure
of Miss Hadid's design will be seen as a triumph for the philistines.
It is actually a dated, awkward design that only got this far through
endless lobbying. The millennium commissioners, who distribute part of
the proceeds of the UK national lottery, have called the bluff of the
trendies.

Sensible opera house trustees should look at the newest opera houses in
the world; meet their architects and managers; and choose someone with
experience. The trustees must start again with a good new architect.
Life is tough, but Virginia Bottomley is tougher, and in this case she
and her commissioners are right.

Last year, national lottery money gave a fillip to the UK's
architectural profession. The turnover of the British construction
industry should benefit by some 5 per cent or so in the years to the
millennium. It is large-scale projects that attract attention, but some
90 per cent of lottery grants are for projects of less than Pounds 1m.

Yet 1995 saw construction still in recession and architects only
beginning to see green shoots of recovery fertilised by lottery cash.
The secretary of state for the environment, John Gummer, belatedly
recognised the value of towns. His new planning policy guidance notes,
to be issued early this year, will stress the value of mixed
developments. That is an almost complete volte face for the entire
planning system. If he is serious, Gummer will presumably be
re-educating the entire planning profession at the new University of
Greenwich.

He will have to start with the Corporation of the City of London which,
since the inspired but disastrous experiment of the Barbican, has
abandoned any pretence that the City is more than a Square Mile of
offices. The recent announcement of two big office schemes in EC4, and
the decision to encourage Mitsubishi to go back to the drawing board on
the Paternoster site, means the City may be in danger of becoming a
horizontal version of Canary Wharf.

The opportunity at Paternoster to build a mixed development, giving
Mitsubishi the chance to build as many offices as it likes on, say,
London Wall, must not be missed. In turn, the chance to move the Museum
of London to a marvellous site next to St Paul's should be grasped, and
why not have hotels and residential accommodation overlooking Wren's
wonder?

Architects in 1996 need to learn to be different kinds of animals.
Those like Miss Hadid and Sir Richard Rogers (imminent adviser to the
new Labour party) who are wedded to dogma, are now old fashioned.
Architects like Sir Michael Hopkins, Sir Norman Foster and Richard
MacCormac are the leaders of the profession, and also admired by the
public.

That is a breakthrough, and one that has come about because the public
are under-estimated by architects at their peril. The public - you and
me - understands the difference between quality and a dead cow in
formaldehyde. Virginia Bottomley and her commissioners understand the
difference, too. In 1996, quality and common sense may replace dogma
and fashionable nonsense. I live in hope.

MAN OF MUSIC WITH PERIOD APPEAL - ANDREW CLARK TALKS TO THE CONDUCTOR
WHO CHALLENGES OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND OPENS OUR EARS TO THE PAST

   By ANDREW CLARK

This looks like Roger Norrington's year. He opens and closes it in
Salzburg, conducting the Vienna Philharmonic there later this month and
returning in December to rehearse Mozart's Mitridate for the 1997
festival. In between there will be Berlioz with the London
Philharmonic, Dvorak in Boston, Henze in Basle, Elgar in Washington,
Beethoven in Chicago, Nicholas Maw at the Proms and Brahms in Vienna -
not forgetting three European tours with his own period-instrument
orchestra, the London Classical Players.

Did someone say Norrington was a period specialist? If so, the period
ranges pretty wide - from 1600 to 2000. That distinguishes him from
most early music pioneers. And he uses the same forensic skills to
unravel Vaughan Williams and Part as he does for Beethoven and Bruckner
- which sets him apart from other high-profile conductors. No British
musician has done more to challenge our assumptions or open our ears to
the past. At 61, Roger Norrington fully deserves the international
limelight.

He clearly enjoys it. The early music revolution, he says, is not about
period instruments or a particular type of repertoire. 'It's a habit of
mind. Even if I didn't know anything about early music, I would still
be the conductor I am now. I just can't look at a piece of music
without taking it back into the garage and stripping it down, finding
what the hell is going on and putting it back together again. Vroom]'

Earthy enthusiasm has always been a Norrington hallmark. It inspired
his singers and orchestra at Kent Opera, where his 13 years as music
director gave him a vast repertory and an intimate understanding of how
a company works. Enthusiasm has also been the key to his 'Experience'
weekends, where he and the LCP discuss, rehearse and perform a
composer's work to the amused enlightenment of all. And it continues to
permeate his day-to-day contact with conventional orchestras.

'You don't often come across that kind of enthusiasm for the way the
music is realised,' said a member of the Basle Symphony Orchestra after
Norrington's latest visit. 'His contact with the players is amazingly
lively - the orchestra had a great time. He got a humming performance,
the music really took off.'

Longstanding colleagues say Norrington has mellowed over the years. He
has had two operations for cancer and become a father again: his wife,
the choreographer Kay Lawrence, and their two-year-old son often travel
with him. 'But when it comes to the music, he's just as strict and
demanding as ever,' says an LCP stalwart. 'He has an incontrovertible
idea of how it should be. His point is that this is real music written
by real people, and he gets that 'immediate' element across. He wants
to get round the traditional interpretation, demythologise the music,
remove the waffle and ballast.'

That is one of the reasons why Norrington now enjoys such a high
profile outside the UK. Long popular in the US and Italy, he has only
recently begun to make his presence felt in the Austro-German
heartland. He says CDs have had a proselytising influence - 'they're
sinking into the subconscious. People there are getting used to the
idea that there are things they need to know about. Despite my rough
German, the orchestras have been very responsive.'

Norrington has not forgotten the UK. A former choral scholar at
Cambridge, he lives in Berkshire, organises the LCP's schedule with a
couple of helpers and conducts 10 programmes a year with the London
Philharmonic. He says he is perfectly happy to work with modern
instruments. 'If you're changing the score - because many of the
published scores are inaccurate - and you change the seating, the
tempo, the phrasing, the light and shade, the Weltanschauung, it
already makes a huge difference. But once they get used to the style,
they may hesitantly say 'We're doing everything else, shouldn't we drop
the vibrato?'. That happened with the LPO, and the result was
absolutely marvellous. As they begin to trust you, they realise you're
not going to turn up in a gown and mortar board. They see you're a real
musician.'

Norrington's interest in historically aware performance began in the
early 1960s, when he went round the churches of Europe performing
Schutz with his own amateur choir. There was no Schutz style: he had to
invent his own. From there it was but a short step to Bach, Telemann
and Handel - and on to Gluck and Haydn, Beethoven and Berlioz, Schubert
and Schumann. The journey has now reached Wagner and Bruckner, and the
results astonish Norrington as much as they do his admirers.

In his LCP recording of the Meistersinger overture, Norrington knocks
two to three minutes off the standard performance length. 'I keep
thinking that with the next thing we do, there won't be quite the same
things to discover,' he says. 'A year ago, we didn't know how Wagner
would sound on period instruments. I thought the tempo wouldn't be a
big question, it would be a matter of just hearing the same music on
these instruments. Then I started my research. In Ueber das Dirigieren,
Wagner writes that when he conducted the Meistersinger overture, it
lasted a few seconds over eight minutes. I thought wow] What will it
sound like if we do that?'

It was a revelation - less pompous and more humorous than usual, with a
spring-in-the-step in the climaxes. There were similar results in
Bruckner's Third Symphony, which Norrington conducted at the Linz
Bruckner festival last autumn. He opted for the first version - the one
Bruckner never heard, with none of the 'improvements' carried out by
his pupils for later performing versions. And he delved into Bruckner's
own recorded comments, which include references to a polka in the
finale.

'What do most conductors do? They play it like a dirge. But if Bruckner
says it's a polka, it's a polka. So I take it at a steady polka speed,
which makes it sound like a dance - and the chorale suddenly becomes
singable. All I'm trying to do is put the record straight, to believe
in the past. You don't set out to prove people wrong - you start as an
innocent, asking questions, and you stumble across these glaringly
obvious things.'

Norrington says he deals with every composer's music in the same way:
'I feel it, I get as much information as I can about it, and then I do
it. I want to obey both sides - the heart and the head, they're in
constant creative tension. You can have the best intentions to follow
what the composer wants, but after a couple of days in rehearsal you
may find you're doing it quite differently - and that's how it should
be. In the end, feeling is king. It has to be your own vision.'

For the past two summers he has conducted at the Rossini festival in
Pesaro. Was there much for him to contribute there? 'The management was
keen I should continue de-cloying Rossini - no high notes at the end,
cadenzas as written, decorations with taste, tempi not too slow. He
doesn't need to be livened up, but there's more allure in the phrasing
than he's given credit for. He's usually hijacked into 19th-century
style. But Zelmira was written in 1822. He went to Vienna and met
Beethoven. These are fully classical works, in the sense that Beethoven
is fully classical.'

Norrington's journey into the past is far from finished. He visits
Prague in May to give the first historically aware performances of
Smetana's Ma Vlast. Given the chance, he would also take the LCP to the
Festspielhaus at Bayreuth - 'the right orchestra in the right hall'. He
wants to play Tchaikovsky in St Petersburg, to do an 'Experience'
weekend on Berg, and to conduct Lulu, Les Troyens and Meistersinger in
the opera house. He dreams of reviving the Early Opera Project, with
which he toured Monteverdi's Orfeo in Italy in the 1980s. 'Historical
staging is in the same state as early music was in 1960. The material
is all there. It just needs a mad entrepreneur with the right theatre.'

Norrington admits that much of what he does is guess-work: it is a
hazard of the road he has chosen to take. He may go wildly wrong at
times - that is the result of his risk-taking - but none of his
performances has ever been dull or routine. Long may it stay that way.

TALES FROM ARABIA - THEATRE

   By SIMON READE

There is no better place to tell a spell-binding story than in the
theatre, especially around Christmas, when we are at our most
childlike. This is the motivation behind Battersea Arts Centre's
ambitious current programme 'Telling Tales'. Alongside new Christian
fables and fresh glosses on the European tales of the Brothers Grimm,
it is refreshing to experience the contrasting oral tradition of
Persia: Alf Laylah Wa Laylah - Arabian Nights: The Tales of
Sheherazade.

The excitement starts when you enter the modest studio to find it
re-formed. We sit cross-legged in-the-round, raised above the courtyard
arcade beneath, peering into a shimmering arena which transforms from
king's bedroom to bustling bazaar, the banks of the Nile and the plains
between Cairo and Basra in the tiniest flicker of our mind's eye. 'This
hot land called Egypt' is conjured from nothing more than a fistful of
sand draining through a woman's fingers. Michael Gordon's direction and
Liz Cooke's design create a compelling environment for their dedicated
company of ten focused performers. 'Listen,' they command: 'Listen.'

It is the whim of King Shahrayar to execute his virgin brides after
only one night, as a means of purging his kingdom of unfaithful Woman.
He scapegoats them because of his own self-loathing: he murdered his
first queen in a fit of ill-founded jealousy. A strong-willed princess,
the Sheherazade, is determined to end this needless sacrifice, and
volunteers to be his bride, but only after she has told her sister a
bedtime story - beautifully in Arabic - which intrigues the King. So
she tells him more.

The stories selected by the company are not of the Boys Own 'Ali Baba
and the Forty Thieves' variety, but all craftily develop the
proto-feminist theme. Each tale has jealous husbands wrongfully
murdering their wives for imagined infidelity, or women enduring sex
and childbirth, and even broach pre-ordained marriage. This
interpretation of the exotic Arabic world of the Middle Ages as one
riddled with miscarriages of natural justice against women, pursues a
clear agenda, but not one which is worn on the sumptuous sleeves of the
women. The stories are elliptical, graceful and enchanting.

There are stories within stories, tales chasing their own tales, richly
interwoven like a magic carpet. The 75 minutes of storytelling does not
only reinvigorate a moribund king, but revivifies the wider audience.
Suitable for older children, it could run for 1001 nights.

At the BAC, London until January 7 (0171-223 2223).

TODAY'S TELEVISION

   By MARTIN HOYLE

Local heroes (7.30pm BBC2) is a little hymn to English eccentricity,
both in style and content. Adam Hart-Davies is a one-man store of
trivia (or general knowledge as it used to be called in less ruthlessly
mercenary days) about inventions of the past including laughing-gas (I
always thought invented by Humphry Davy out of sheer boredom with
Bristol; eminently likely) and a spanking-machine.

For those who remember Richard Harris' play Outside Edge, first on
stage then on television with the incomparable Maureen Lipman, the
sitcom with the same name has been something of a disappointment. Its
characters verge on the caricatured and lack that consistency that even
sitcom creations should have. Still, a show that avoids aping American
comedy and even takes cricket as its theme is worth a plaudatory
chuckle (8.30pm ITV).

Great Ormond Street continues its gripping survey of the great
children's hospital (8pm BBC1); and Wild Britain (8pm C4) is a repeat
about the bramble bush and its dependent wildlife.

AN ABSENCE OF INFLATION: THE FEELGOOD FACTOR IS SET TO REMAIN ELUSIVE
IN 1996

   By MARTIN WEALE and GARRY YOUNG

By most measures, 1995 was a good year for the UK economy. Inflation
remained subdued, output grew by more than 2.5 per cent, unemployment
declined by more than 200,000 and government borrowing fell, albeit by
less than was expected at the beginning of the year. In addition, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was able to take a penny off the basic
rate of income tax and cut interest rates by a quarter of 1 percentage
point.

This very favourable mix of growth and inflation is rare by British
historical standards and, while we think it likely to continue, there
are risks that the economy will not be as successful in 1996.

The most striking aspect of the present economic situation is the
virtual absence of domestically generated inflation at a time of
relatively fast growth and falling unemployment. This is partly a
reflection of the extent of disinflationary pressure in the UK labour
market. Since the peak in unemployment in 1993, wage increases have
shown no sign of picking up and real wages have scarcely grown. This
means that the benefits of increased productivity have been
appropriated into profit margins. These have risen substantially:
profits as a proportion of gross domestic product - at 36 per cent in
1994 - are higher than in the early 1970s.

One important question in present circumstances is whether the
surprising lack of growth in wage rates is evidence - as claimed by the
Treasury - that the sustainable rate of unemployment has fallen. In the
1980s and early 1990s it seemed that this figure was about 8 per cent
of the labour force. Certainly, when the unemployment rate fell to 5.5
per cent by 1990, there was a sharp acceleration in inflation which was
only squeezed out by the rise in unemployment during the last
recession.

Assuming productivity growth of 2 per cent a year, the rate of increase
in wages could probably rise from its existing level of 3.25 per cent
to 4.5 per cent per annum and still be consistent with annual inflation
of 2.5 per cent and very high profit margins. This suggests that
unemployment at 8 per cent is still above its sustainable rate.

It would be premature, however, to assume from this that the
sustainable rate of unemployment has indeed fallen. Unit labour costs
picked up noticeably in 1995 and in manufacturing were growing in
October at an annual rate of 4 per cent. This probably reflects the
stagnation of productivity associated with the slowdown in output. But
it may be an early indication that unemployment is reaching its
sustainable level.

If the sustainable unemployment rate has fallen, it will be possible
for output to grow for some time to come at more than its underlying
trend rate without generating inflationary pressure. This does not
guarantee that the chancellor's inflation target of 2.5 per cent by the
end of the present parliament will be met - the weakness of domestic
prices has been offset by increases in import prices arising from
sterling's depreciation of close to 7 per cent through 1995.

We expect the underlying inflation rate by the end of 1996 to be
slightly over 3 per cent. A better way of putting this is to say that
we think there is only a 40 per cent chance of meeting the inflation
target. There is also a risk that inflation will be substantially
higher if faster growth in import prices feeds through to domestic
prices.

This assessment depends on the outlook for demand, which appears to
have stalled in the second half of 1995, leading to fears that the
overall rate of growth in 1996 will be considerably slower. This time
last year the National Institute forecast growth of 2.7 per cent for
1995, and this is likely to be very close to the eventual out-turn. For
1996, we are predicting growth of 2.4 per cent, much lower than the
Treasury's forecast of 3 per cent.

Our forecast assumes that continued weakness in domestic demand will be
offset by higher export demand, helped by the fall in sterling in 1995.
Individual monthly figures are erratic, but it was gratifying to see
higher exports in November as an early indication of this trend.

We do not expect much of a feelgood factor to develop in 1996. This is
partly due to the very slow growth in wages.

There is at present much discussion about whether the economy will be
lifted by a surge in consumer spending, with the suggestion that
spending is depressed by consumer gloom inspired by fears about
employment prospects. But the truth is that consumers are behaving
perfectly normally. It looks as though they will have saved about 9 per
cent of their income in 1995 and we are expecting a similar figure for
1996. This is lower than in any year since 1971, except during the boom
period of 1986 to 1990 - and we doubt consumers are ready for a binge
like that of the late 1980s.

In spite of the pause in growth, we expect a continuing fall in
claimant unemployment to about 1.9m, or just under 7 per cent of the
labour force. This is partly due to changes in the administration of
benefits. While we expect some acceleration in wage growth, this will
be consistent with a downwards drift in the inflation rate as the rate
of increase in import prices subsides. Profit margins will stop rising,
but there will be no great pressure on them.

The main risk of this forecast is that demand will be weaker than
expected as a consequence of companies adjusting to an unintended
build-up of stocks, tight fiscal policy and possible weakness in demand
for British exports. In this event, inflationary pressure should weaken
further and we would expect to see cuts in interest rates to maintain
the economy's momentum as the next general election approaches.

In the longer term, we expect these favourable trends to continue. The
improved picture in the labour market will be backed up by slightly
faster productivity growth as the economy starts to benefit from the
recent expansion of higher education and, we hope, the more stable
macroeconomic environment established since sterling left the European
exchange rate mechanism. We can see the growth rate accelerating to 2.8
per cent and unemployment falling to 1.2m. This would not exactly be an
economic miracle, but it would at least make a pleasant change from the
years of stop-go.

Martin Weale is director of the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, a UK research institute, and a member of the
Treasury's panel of independent economic forecasters. Garry Young is a
research fellow at the institute.

NEITHER BOOM NOR BUST: CONDITIONS ARE NOT RIGHT FOR SHARPLY LOWER US
INTEREST RATES

   By STEPHEN S. ROACH

The financial markets always want more of a good thing. And that seems
to be the case in looking to 1996. It is fashionable to worry that the
US economy is soft and getting softer, and that inflation is heading
dramatically lower. In such an environment, the Federal Reserve is
expected to reduce short-term interest rates aggressively. Moreover,
with the budget deal of a lifetime finally thought to be at hand, most
forecasters expect a dramatic further rally in the bond market.
Needless to say, such a scenario hardly poses a threat to the glorious
bull market of 1995.

Our prognosis for the US economy in 1996 is at odds with many of these
presumptions. I expect neither a boom nor a bust. Real gross domestic
product is likely to expand in a 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent range -
essentially in line with what I believe to be the US economy's
underlying long-term growth potential. The case for upside growth
surprises is relatively straightforward. It is based on solid support
from three important macroeconomic forces: real income generation (at
present running above trend at 3.7 per cent); interest rates (which are
near historic lows); and the currency (which is vastly undervalued).

In such a constructive environment, I expect the US economy to show
surprisingly broad-based gains in 1996. With mortgage interest rates
down about 200 basis points over the past year, the turnround in the
residential construction sector should continue well into the new year.
And there should be no let-up in US business's record-setting boom in
capital spending.

This is a structural phenomenon - triggered mainly by spectacular
productivity breakthroughs - that should continue to be surprisingly
immune to the whims of the business cycle.

Upside surprises in the export sector can also be expected, reflecting
the combined effects of a supercompetitive US economy and more diverse
trade flows. The strong impetus for export growth in 1995 - with unit
volume growth accelerating from 4.8 per cent in the first quarter to
10.6 per cent in the third - stands in sharp contrast to widespread
fears that there will be an export collapse in a sluggish global
economy.

The good news is that the US is less dependent on its traditional
trading partners: sales to Europe and Japan have fallen to 34 per cent
of overall US exports, down sharply from 42 per cent at the end of
1990.

Finally, reports of the demise of the American consumer are vastly
exaggerated. With consumption well supported by income generation, I do
not share the widespread conviction that households are being dragged
down by excess debts. The ratio of annual debt servicing expenses to
income stands at present at 16.8 per cent, well below the highs hit in
the latter half of the 1980s. While I do not expect a consumer buying
binge, the forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in real consumption through
1996 is sufficient to account for over 1.5 percentage points of real
GDP growth.

The inflation prognosis is particularly intriguing. While I continue to
believe the cost-efficient, productivity-led US recovery remains
intact, I am now of the view that the inflation rate is slowly moving
up from its cyclical lows. The consumer price index rose 2.9 per cent
in 1995, up 0.3 percentage points from the low of 1994, and a little
more acceleration in 1996 is expected, to an annual rate of 3.2 per
cent.

I do not share the view that price stability is now at hand. The bulk
of the disinflation of the 1990s has been a by-product of an
extraordinary compression of labour costs. With productivity and
corporate profitability surging, with the unemployment rate at 5.6 per
cent, and with real compensation virtually stagnant for over a decade,
I do not accept the notion that a submissive workforce has no choice
but to capitulate further on wages.

In spite of the supposed threat of the dollar-a-day Chinese worker,
this strain of productivity enhancement has now gone far enough. The
days of asking the labour force to keep sacrificing for the noble cause
of disinflation appear to be largely over. The risk of a backlash from
workers is a growing concern - one that might have an important impact
on the sociology, politics and economics of the US for years to come.

As for the Fed, it is hard to accept the widespread conviction than an
aggressive monetary easing is now at hand.

Given the outlook for the economy and inflation, the urgency for a
further dramatic easing just is not there. Granted, the central bank
may offer a token easing in the aftermath of a budget accord. But if
market expectations of sharply lower short-term interest rates were
realised, the Fed would have to throw its traditional caution to the
wind. If it takes its commitment to price stability seriously, and I
believe it does, it is difficult to imagine the Fed turning away from
the restrictive policy bias that worked so well in the 1980s.

The budget is obviously the wild card. The problem is that it is still
business as usual in Washington. The best we are likely to see is a
plan based on back-loaded spending cuts, front-loaded tax cuts,
immunity for social security and dubious economic assumptions (for
example, that the perfect path of trend growth, low inflation and
declining interest rates continues forever). I have come to the
reluctant conclusion that the same creative mathematicians who gave us
Gramm-Rudman I and II and the great budget accord of 1990 are hard at
work today. Credible deficit reduction remains a dream, not a
certainty.

Adding it all up, it is hard to be thrilled about US Treasury bonds.
Everything good is just about priced into the market. On the chance
that a budget deal is struck - even if it is a classic smoke-and-
mirrors compromise - a final bull run to bond yields of 5 1/2 per cent
is possible.

But as reality sinks in, and the economy and inflation fail to conform
to market hopes, I continue to believe that the next big move in bonds
is back towards an equilibrium level of 7 per cent. I expect such a
correction to take place by mid-year, at the latest.

WAYS TO VIEW SUPPORT FOR STEELMAKING PLANT


Sir, In the US we have been reading with interest the reports that
British Steel is seeking to close an Irish steel plant on account of
subsidies that the Irish government is to provide.

In the US British Steel is seeking one of the biggest subsidies from
the taxpayer ever recorded in order to operate a steel plant in
Alabama, which British Steel is proposing to build in partnership with
an American and a Japanese company.

Support worth Dollars 250m is being sought from - and granted by - the
state legislature of Alabama in order to persuade British Steel and its
two partners to open the steel plant in the state. If built, the plant
will directly threaten the jobs of at least 3,500 steelworkers in other
parts of the country.

Without entering into the merits of the Irish steel plant's case, we
find it puzzling that British Steel is so hostile to subsidies in
Europe and so ravenous for them in the US.

Transatlantic trade and co-operation can not be built on this kind of
tilted playing field.

CANADIAN PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THE TRAPPER'S SNARE


Sir, Thank you for Bernard Simon's comprehensive article ('Hunting for
a kinder kill', December 13). The trap research compound near
Vegreville is a ploy that illustrates how far the Canadian government
and the fur industry will go to preserve this barbaric industry.

The fur industry professes to champion Canadian native people, but it
has been the most destructive force in their history. It has exploited
them, their culture and their way of life. Native people do not
process, sell or store furs but are at the bottom of the fur industry
chain.

Because of the sympathy people feel towards the plight of the Canadian
native people, the Canadian government and the fur industry are
promoting the myth that trapping is culturally and economically central
to the native people.

Fewer than 50 per cent of native homes are fully serviced with sewerage
and water, native infant mortality is 60 per cent higher than the
average among other Canadians, and 70 per cent of natives have not had
a high school education.

Fur trapping has not and will not relieve these problems. It will
perpetuate them.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:
DIAGNOSING MIDDLE-CLASS ANGST


Sir, In his otherwise excellent article on middle-class insecurity
('Bang go the great expectations', December 27), John Plender is surely
incorrect in claiming that an occupational pension is 'not an asset at
all'.

For the great majority of members of occupational pension schemes, the
pension is tied to the salary earned during the years immediately prior
to retirement and is unaffected by whether or not the company pays its
full contribution in every year.

It is certainly true that the benefits could be improved were
pension-fund surpluses to be used for that purpose, but the basic
payment is secure and does indeed form a substantial asset for the
pensioner.

The whole point about personal pensions, which yield direct ownership
rights, is that whereas the benefits are not tied to salary, and may be
much greater than under an occupational scheme, the risk element is
also much greater and hence the pensioner cannot rely upon the size of
the asset.

It is most unlikely that members of occupational pension schemes are
overly concerned about being 'disenfranchised', although they most
certainly detest those 'bosses' who manipulate their own pensions for
personal advantage.

Insofar that 'frustrated expectations' are the cause of 'middle-class
angst', it is not negative equity which is of direct concern since, as
John Plender notes, this has affected relatively few middle-class
households, but rather the possibility of falling house prices.

This is a very new phenomenon, and often accompanied by great
difficulty in achieving a sale, but it has no parallel in respect of
occupational pensions since their value is unknown prior to retirement.

OBSTACLES FACING THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY


Sir, Martin Wolf's piece on whether democracies are growing in number
and influence, and to what extent democracies are less warlike than
autocracies ('Mightier than the sword', December 28) reminds me of
discussions 30 years ago on whether history moves inexorably in the
direction of communism, and to what extent communist governments would
decrease international tensions.

There are indeed powerful 'forces that are driving countries towards
representative political institutions', but there are equally powerful
forces undermining democracies from within. Democracies have been voted
out, and there is no evidence that the increasing gap between rich and
poor will not weaken many democracies.

It is curious that Protestant societies were the first to nourish
democratic institutions, and that no non-Protestant society has
sustained democracy for longer than 70 years. There is nothing
automatic about progress, and nothing inexorable about the direction in
which history will go: that will depend on the choices each of us
makes.

LEADING ARTICLE:
WHEN POLITICS REPLACES POLICY


Britain's general election campaign is under way in earnest. The
defection from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats of Miss Emma
Nicholson could not have been a more potent reminder of the fragility
of Mr John Major's government. The prime minister's parliamentary
majority is now down, in effect, to three. Further deaths or defections
could soon eliminate it entirely.

Mr Major appears determined to defer the election until the last
possible date in the spring of 1997, relying if necessary on the
support of the Ulster Unionists to sustain him in any vote of
confidence. Privately, opposition leaders admit that he may well
succeed in that objective. But, amid rumours of further defections,
ministers equally are obliged to acknowledge they can no longer be
certain of the parliamentary arithmetic. An autumn election is now a
real possibility if not yet a probability.

The prime minister would be wise to pay close attention to the message
of Miss Nicholson's defection. Since his leadership victory last
summer, Mr Major has been too anxious to appease his opponents by
speaking the language of the Eurosceptic right of the Tory party.
Whatever her personal motives for joining Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal
Democrats, Miss Nicholson's charge that the government has been
deserting the political centre ground finds a dangerous echo among
voters.

Rhetoric calculated to appeal to the more hardline Conservative
activists will not recover for Mr Major the support of the less
committed voters who will decide the outcome of the election. Mr Blair
has learned one of the golden rules of British politics - elections are
not won from the extremes of left or right but from the centre.

Gruelling business

Either way, the looming campaign promises to be a gruelling and
unedifying business. Politics, it seems, leaves little room these days
for policy. The normal business of government has been suspended. Mr
Major's legislative programme is designed above all to minimise
controversy within his own party and to highlight areas of difference
with Labour. Mr Tony Blair meanwhile concentrates on inflicting
tactical defeats on the government at Westminster. Those expecting
Labour to unfold a detailed blueprint for government are likely to be
disappointed.

As they make their promises and level their charges in the scramble for
votes, however, Messrs Major, Blair and Ashdown should pause for a
moment to reflect on a more worrying feature of British political life.
Politicians of all parties have rarely been held in lower public
esteem. They have themselves, mostly, to blame.

Wider developments

It is true that wider developments have contributed to a general
weakening of faith in the ability of politicians to 'solve' national
problems. Global markets have delineated more clearly the limits of
economic independence. The necessary sharing of sovereignty in Europe
has robbed Westminster of other pretensions. But to acknowledge such
trends is not to exonerate the politicians.

The important gap is not that between the limits imposed by the harsh
realities of modern life and the unreasonable demands of the voters.
The real disillusion stems from the gulf between promises and
performance. If politicians more readily acknowledged the constraints,
the voters would be more willing to adjust their expectations. Instead,
the parties wittingly exaggerate their power, promising easy solutions
to complex problems.

To take the most obvious example: the central debate about the right
levels of public spending and taxation is conducted with shameless
mendacity. One side promises painless tax cuts, the other perfect
public services. The reality is that modest rates of economic growth
will allow neither for the constant ratcheting down of income tax rates
promised by Mr Major nor the cost-free and comprehensive welfare state
pledged by Mr Blair.

It is perhaps too much to expect the politicians to mend their ways so
close to an election. But this erosion of trust and confidence in
parliament is inimical to good government and dangerously corrosive of
democracy. Ultimately, the politicians as well as the voters will be
the losers.

LEADING ARTICLE:
ITALY AND THE EU PRESIDENCY


For the fourth time in a row, the six months' presidency of the
European Union has fallen to a member state whose government is
severely distracted by domestic difficulties. It seems to be becoming a
bad habit. First there was Germany, with a general election in
mid-presidency back in 1994. Then there was France, with presidential
elections last May. The Spanish government in the past six months
managed to postpone its demise in order to complete its EU
chairmanship, in spite of losing its parliamentary majority.

Now Italy is supposed to take the chair, not even sure if it has a
government. Mr Lamberto Dini offered his resignation on Saturday after
completing his limited mandate. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro wants
him to stay on, but he is leaving it to the fractious Italian
parliament to decide. It hardly makes for firm leadership and a clear
agenda for Europe.

Those four Euro-enthusiastic governments were supposed to co-ordinate
their plans for the two-year period. They intended to lay the
groundwork for a clear-sighted and coherent inter-governmental
conference this year, which would mark another important step towards
the goal of European political union. Instead, the EU is stumbling
towards that target in a familiar state of muddle.

Spanish achievements

Admittedly, Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government in Spain achieved rather
more in the past six months than one might have expected from its
political weakness at home. It completed preparations for the IGC,
albeit with more modest ambitions than committed integrationists would
like. It persuaded the other 14 member states to agree a blueprint for
the launch of the single currency in 1999. It finalised a programme to
reinforce the fragile relationship between the EU and US. And it
organised an impressive gathering of Mediterranean states to cement
better co-operation between Europe, the middle east and north Africa.
Not bad for a lame-duck administration.

The challenge for Mr Dini, or any other head of an Italian government,
is to keep that good work going. At least he does not appear
over-ambitious. Italy has not tabled any heavy agenda of national
priorities, as other member states are sometimes tempted to do. A
successful launch to the IGC at the end of March is one priority;
agreement on a reconstruction plan for Bosnia is another. The former
should be a formality, but the latter could be a very difficult
negotiation: the European Union must be generous if it wants the peace
initiative in Bosnia to succeed, but every member state faces tough
domestic budget constraints, limiting the room for manoeuvre.

Difficult issues

There are always other difficult issues on the EU agenda which require
clear leadership from the presidency. In the next six months those
include the plans to liberalise the EU energy market; reform of the
Tacis aid programme for countries of the former Soviet Union; and
reform of the EU wine market. There is also strong German pressure for
agreement on a stabilisation package to regulate the behaviour of
member states after creation of economic and monetary union. These are
all issues on which Italy has clear national interests, and on which a
weak government in Rome may find it difficult to compromise, let alone
negotiate a deal.

A strong Italian government is out of the question for the foreseeable
future. At this moment, early elections would not solve the problem:
under the present electoral laws, they are unlikely to produce a result
much different from the present stalemate. President Scalfaro is right
to urge the main political factions to stop bickering and agree on a
programme of essential constitutional reforms. That could be enacted by
a broad-based cross-party coalition, as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
former prime minister, appears to favour - though this seems somewhat
unrealistic.

Alternatively, Mr Dini could be asked to serve on for another six
months, dedicated to the EU presidency and to securing the
constitutional reforms. That would be an acceptable compromise, in the
interests of Italy and Europe.

EUROPE UNLOCKED FOR DEALERS: ON THE FIRST DAY OF TRADING UNDER NEW
RULES BREAKING DOWN EU BORDERS, JOHN GAPPER AND RICHARD LAPPER ASSESS
WHO THE WINNERS AND LOSERS WILL BE

   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD LAPPER

This morning NatWest Securities will commence trading on the Swedish
Stock Exchange from its offices in the City of London. For the first
time, the stockbroking arm of the British bank will buy and sell shares
in Swedish companies without having to do so through local brokers. 'We
can sit in London with a screen on our desks, and trade as if we were
in Stockholm,' says Mr Scott Dobbie, chairman of NatWest Securities.

The ability to trade securities across borders in this way is a product
of the European Union's Investment Services Directive (ISD), which
takes effect today. The directive aims to give Europe's thousands of
broking firms a 'passport' to trade anywhere in the Union, and is
accompanied by the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) which imposes fresh
capital requirements.

Progress in implementing the two directives is likely to be slow - by
December 31, only seven of the 15 EU states had passed the necessary
legislation. But whatever the delays, the changes are happening faster
than previous efforts to harmonise banking supervision. 'It is far more
complex, and it is having to be accomplished in a much shorter time,'
says Ms Jane Welch, head of legal advice at the UK Securities and
Investments Board.

And the impact on Europe's stock exchanges and derivatives markets will
be far-reaching. The directives are likely to favour larger investment
banks and stock exchanges, at the expense of smaller firms and
exchanges.

There are two key measures in the Investment Services Directive. The
first is that firms will be able to operate in any EU member state,
provided they are regulated in one of them. When operating outside
their home countries, they will be subject to rules on the conduct of
business devised by the local regulators for all banks and brokers.

For the larger banks already operating in more than one EU country, the
'passport' rule will reduce costs and ease the regulatory burden.
However, the directive is unlikely to make a significant difference to
their operations. Although there have been instances of member states
imposing strict requirements on foreign banks, most of them have been
able to operate where they want. 'We have never felt constrained about
crossing national borders,' says Mr Wilco Jiskoot, senior executive
vice-president for merchant banking at ABN Amro, the Dutch bank.

But for smaller firms operating in countries with no regulation for
securities traders, the directive will mean being regulated for the
first time - together with the accompanying costs, even if they are
operating purely in their domestic markets. They are also likely to
lose the share of commission and fees they make in carrying out local
business for large investment banks. From today smaller brokers will
have to find a substitute for such earnings if they are to survive.

The second key measure of the directive is to allow stock exchanges and
futures and options markets to trade throughout the EU. With increasing
volumes of equity dealing, derivatives business and bond market
transactions carried out electronically, this should in effect allow
brokers to conduct business from offices located anywhere in Europe.

The effect will be to increase competition between Europe's 32
securities exchanges and 24 derivatives markets. Already, for example,
the Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock and derivatives
markets, plans to extend its electronic network to several other
countries. Early this year it is opening an access point in London,
which will reduce the telecommunications costs for London-based
Deutsche Bo rse members to transact their business directly with
Frankfurt.

It is widely expected that many smaller exchanges could fold as these
pressures intensify. Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, chairman of the Matif, the
Paris-based futures market, expects a wave of restructuring with some
derivatives markets disappearing, either through merger or takeover.
'It will mean some substantial modification in the landscape of futures
and options exchanges in Europe,' he says.

Matif is planning to launch an ambitious joint electronic network with
the Deutsche Borse and two other French exchanges later this year which
would allow traders to deal in French and German equities over the same
screens. It would also cover a range of futures and options products.
'With the prospect of a single currency it all amounts to a new big
bang in Europe as far as the markets are concerned,' says Mr Pfauwadel.

One target for European exchanges such as Paris and Frankfurt is likely
to be the London Stock Exchange's Seaq-I electronic bulletin board,
which marketmakers use to advertise large blocks of European shares for
purchase and sale. Already, European bourses which have invested a
large amount on modernising their trading and settlement systems have
won back dealing business in local equities from Seaq-I.

But many market participants argue that large exchanges - particularly
London - are likely to gain rather than lose from the directive.
NatWest's strategy of trading increasingly on local exchanges rather
than on Seaq-I does not lessen its commitment to its main base in
London. Remote trading on overseas exchanges could help London's role
as the physical location from which traders operate by electronic
means.

Mr Giles Vardey, director of markets development at the London Stock
Exchange, argues that remote trading is now 'commercially inevitable'.
Mr Vardey accepts that competition from large exchanges will intensify,
but says smaller exchanges could suffer. 'Trading power is likely to
become concentrated in London, and the directive will hasten this
process,' he says.

The most immediate effects of Capital Adequacy Directive are likely to
be felt by the investment banks. They will be required for the first
time to allocate capital to cover risks of losses through adverse
movements in the markets for shares, bonds or currencies. At the
moment, banks have to allocate capital only to cover lending risks
under the 1988 Basle accord of international supervisors.

The new rules also demand that banks and securities firms monitor their
risks at all times keeping a permanent watch on large exposures. For
example, trading exposures to a single customer will have to be limited
in most cases to less than 25 per cent of capital base - and can only
be exceeded with the national regulator's permission. The larger banks
are best placed to comply with such demands, having invested huge
amounts over the past few years in systems to allow them to monitor
their exposure.

Smaller banks are less prepared. 'Developing the ability to spot large
exposures across the business is a significant headache for many
players,' says Mr Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury and capital
markets at Price Waterhouse, the accountants. 'It imposes a level of
integration that only the top few players have.'

In theory, the Capital Adequacy Directive could lead to some banks
having to set aside significantly more capital. But most banks believe
that the directive's impact will be minimal. Mr Ian Linnell, banking
analyst at Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, says for most
the impact has been 'neutral to marginal', and believes that some banks
will be able to operate with less capital than before.

However, there could be extra burdens for those banks which are heavily
involved in equities trading, for which Capital Adequacy Directive
rules are stiffer in some cases. For example, BZW, the investment
banking arm of Barclays, will have to put aside a little more capital,
according to Mr David Band, chief executive.

But the biggest impact so far has arisen from the need to invest in
upgrading technology to comply with the directive's requirements to
monitor group operations globally. Some of the bigger banks have spent
up to Pounds 5m on systems and software, and even the smaller firms
face minimum costs of Pounds 50,000 to pay for software. Mr Band says
there has been a shortage of technicians in London able to work on bank
systems. 'That has been a big problem for the market,' he says.

As the directives come into action this morning, the immediate
beneficiaries look to be the large investors who increasingly trade
across European borders and are likely to see a reduction in charges.
In the longer term, the winners will be the large investment banks,
many of which are now based in London. The losers will be the smaller,
less efficient brokers and the smaller exchanges that cannot find a
role as the EU's stock and derivatives markets become increasingly
integrated.

OBSERVER: NATWEST SEEKS TOP GUN


What will the NatWest Group do with Dollars 3.6bn that it is raising
from the sale of its US retail banking business to Fleet Financial? Not
so long ago NatWest was the biggest of the Big Four UK banks. Now it is
the smallest. So the money should come in handy helping fulfil its
ambition to transform NatWest Markets into one of the top 10 global
investment banks.

Although NatWest appears to have ruled out bidding for a well-known
Wall Street name, like Lehman Brothers, it will have to buy something,
or someone, if it wants to be a serious player in the big league. In
October it paid a hefty Dollars 135m for Eric Gleacher's five-year-old
US mergers and acquisition boutique. Gleacher, 55, made his name
running Morgan Stanley's M&A department during some of the biggest
hostile takeover battles in the 1980s. Now he has made his fortune by
selling out to NatWest.

As long as Gleacher hangs around, NatWest Markets has a chance of being
taken seriously in the domestic US investment banking market. However,
Gleacher is not an international player and NatWest Markets desperately
needs to beef up its global investment banking team if it wants to
compete with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley etc.

Hence the owners of some European corporate finance boutiques must be
hoping that NatWest will be as generous to them as it was to Gleacher.
After all, when Morgan Grenfell was looking for a new chief executive
in 1987, it had to pay Pounds 15m for John Craven's Phoenix Securities
to secure Craven's services.

The obvious UK candidate is Hambro Magan's George Magan who worked for
Morgan Grenfell before starting his own boutique in 1988. He is a good
five years younger than Gleacher and has an equally impressive record
in the UK M&A market. But would Magan join NatWest Markets for less
than Gleacher?

Surely not. Once again NatWest may have to make do with second best.

Another New Year's honour's list has come and gone and dear old Andrew
Buxton, Barclays' chairman, has still not picked up his knighthood.

There are lots of other good guys, such as the chief executives of

different. He is a chairman of one of the top dozen companies in the UK
and all his fellow chairman have titles. What has he done wrong?

Whether Buxton deserves a knighthood after 33 years with Barclays is
neither here nor there. But the latest honours list just goes to show
how little progress has been made in tidying up the present system of

Peter Wood, who created Direct Line, gets a CBE, whereas Graham
Kirkham, a fellow entrepreneur, gets a knighthood. Alan Jackson, the

One can only hope that the leaders of big business who have not got

EU STATES SLOW TO ADOPT DIRECTIVE ON INVESTMENT: ONLY SEVEN COUNTRIES
READY FOR CROSS-BORDER REFORM

   By ANDREW JACK, ANDREW FISHER, ANDREW HILL and EMMA TUCKER

   PARIS, FRANKFURT, MILAN, BRUSSELS


Only seven of the European Union's 15 member states were ready to
implement the Investment Services Directive when it came into effect
yesterday, the European federation of stock markets reported.

The directive is designed to allow non-bank investment groups to carry
out several activities more easily across borders.

It aims to create a 'passport' system allowing an institution regulated
in one EU country to operate in all the others without having to comply
with additional requirements.

Stock market officials in some countries say they have restructured and
are ready to meet the requirements of the directive but their
governments have not yet passed the necessary legislation. Other
governments have expressed concern about accepting the 'passport'.

Market officials say the seven which have to all intents and purposes
met the requirements of the directive on time are the UK, the Republic
of Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.
In some of these, however, the legislation itself still needs to be
passed. Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and France are expected to
introduce the legislation by the middle of this year. Germany, Greece
and Spain will not be prepared for full implementation until 1997.

Some countries such as France and Italy have used the enabling
legislation for the directive to push through broader financial
regulatory reforms, which has held up progress.

There are already strong links between the Frankfurt and Paris
derivatives markets which are expected to deepen in the coming months,
but the directive should extend links throughout Europe.

In Germany, this will create considerable new work for the Federal
Supervisory office for Securities Trading (BAWe), which was set up only
a year ago to root out insider traders and enforce compliance with
stricter disclosure requirements. Analysts believe the main effect of
the directive may be less to encourage financial institutions to open
offices in other countries than to change the location of where
transactions are carried out - reinforcing the position of those
markets which already have the greatest liquidity for any particular
security.

Mr Giuseppe Zadra, director general of the Italian banking association,
said he feared the focus of trading in Italian instruments could shift
to other markets if his country's institutions did not invest and
modernise. 'National markets don't have a future, and that's why they
will have to be changed and compete on a European scale,' he said.

The new rules have also raised fears there will be new risks for
investors because institutions receiving their passport in the country
with the weakest regulatory requirements will be able to obtain
recognition elsewhere.

'I have already heard anecdotally that some dubious firms from outside
Europe are looking for the best place to get initial authorisation,'
said one stock market official. 'The strength of the whole will rely on
the standards imposed by the least experienced regulator.'

GOING FOR GROWTH


It is perfectly reasonable to feel sanguine about the prospects for the
world's main financial markets in 1996, but it is difficult to get
excited. Inflation is low and apparently under control; growth may have
slowed, but most economies will still expand this year; and the US
economy's soft landing looks convincing enough.

But after last year's bull run, there is much less to go for. In 1995,
inflation fears proved overdone, allowing interest rates to be cut. The
resulting bond market rally, coupled with bid activity, fuelled
advances in stock prices.

Even though there are more interest rate cuts to come, the pace is
slowing and much of the benefit is already priced into both bonds and
stocks. Furthermore, the US market, which led the way last year, looks
rather overvalued. The stock market, having risen more than 30 per cent
last year, faces a proliferation of earnings downgrades. Since earnings
are not likely to fall off a cliff, a slowdown in economic growth does
not necessarily mean stock prices will stall. But the market looks
expensive relative to trend earnings and bond yields. Dividend yields
are low, even when share buy-back programmes are taken into account.
The benign economic environment probably rules out a 1987- style crash,
but a correction is not only likely, it would probably be beneficial.
And there are several potential triggers: the US budget agreement, for
example, has still to be thrashed out.

EUROPE


A correction in the US would hit the UK hardest, since it has benefited
most from the bull run. Although strong earnings growth is likely to
continue into 1997, the UK has other problems, including the growing
possibility of an early election, as the Conservative party's majority
dwindles. In fact, Prime Minister John Major is likely to hold on to
power until 1997 even without a majority, but any weakening of his
control over the election's timing will be viewed as a negative by the
stock market.

The UK also has more to fear from inflation than most other markets,
given its relatively rapid economic growth and an expected rise in
consumer spending. This will benefit some sectors, such as
housebuilding and retailing, but the danger is that any further rate
cuts in the first half of the year will have to be reversed in the
second - or worse that the government may try to ignore overheating of
the economy, since raising rates in the run-up to the election would
hardly be politically expedient. With gilts currently yielding twice as
much as equities, the balance looks about right. But inflation jitters
could cap gilt prices, halting further equity advances.

Further bid activity, as in the US, will help underpin stock market
prices, but estimates that the FT-SE 100 index, whatever early gains it
makes, will end the year around 3,750, less than 100 points above its
current level, are probably sensible.

In continental Europe, the problem is too little growth. This bodes
well for bonds. Even without further short-term rate cuts in Germany,
there is room for bond yields to fall. More generally, any signs that
the structural problems of high social spending and unwieldy budget
deficits are being addressed should encourage investors. Bunds and
other European bond markets may well outperform the US market in 1996 -
the problem is the strongest outperformance is often on the way down,
so it may be safer to bet on yield differentials than on absolute price
movements.

JAPAN


Tokyo's Nikkei-225 has ended the year roughly where it started, just
below 20,000, inviting the question of whether US and European fund
managers are right to increase their weighting in Japan. Few markets
have performed as well over the past six months. The index has gained
37 per cent since its July low, though the yen's decline over that
period has eroded more than half that gain when measured in dollars.
Currency risk will continue to bedevil foreign investors as economic
recovery sucks in more imports, further driving down the trade surplus.
But the attraction of Japan in 1996 is that it is the only leading
market set to benefit both from the early stage of an economic revival
and a pick-up in corporate earnings. A rise in sales should kick in, on
top of the margin improvements achieved over the past year.

On the surface, much of this recovery has already been discounted, with
the index standing at around 83 times prospective earnings - high even
by Japan's historical standards. However, a more useful guide to the
Nikkei's value is the ratio between equity and bond yields. Currently,
Japanese government bonds yield 1.5 times as much as equities, well
below the long-term average. As a result, Japanese institutions, heavy
net sellers of equities last year, may well favour equities over bonds
in 1996. The top Japanese life insurers and brokers have shed recent
pessimism and forecast a 1996 high for the Nikkei in the mid-20,000s.
They may be right.

EMERGING MARKETS


Emerging markets look cheap. On most valuation measures, a rebound is
already overdue. Last year's lacklustre performance partly reflects the
crisis of confidence following the collapse of the Mexican market at
the start of the year. In fact, international investors had little
reason to take the higher risks associated with emerging markets. US
fund managers in particular were able to make impressive returns in
their own domestic market.

But there are signs that US money is starting to move offshore again.
As fund managers are forced to look for growth outside the domestic
market, emerging markets are bound to get at least some of that money.
Typically, US managers have looked south of the border. But there are
still good reasons for avoiding Latin America, not only because of the
dire economic problems which continue to afflict some countries. The
main bond market is the dollar-denominated Brady bond market, which
would suffer from a US market correction. Slow growth, particularly by
emerging markets standards, makes stock markets relatively
unattractive, given the associated currency risk.

Asian stock markets look a better bet. Not only does Asia enjoy strong
economic growth and a cash surplus; the markets are likely to benefit
from funds from Japan, as well as the US and UK.

PENSION FUNDS RAISE RETURNS BUT MISS OUT ON BIG US GAINS

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

UK pension funds recovered from their poor performance in 1994 with
investment returns averaging 19 per cent last year, according to a
survey by the WM Company.

Pension funds benefited from a return of almost 24 per cent on UK
equities, which make up more than half of their portfolios.

But they missed out on the big gains in the US stock market, which
returned 33.8 per cent last year. Only 4.3 per cent of the Pounds 380bn
of funds measured by WM was invested in US equities.

'Everybody thought the US was overpriced at the end of 1994 but it
really took off,' said Mr Peter Warrington, a director of WM, which
specialises in performance measurement.

He added that the longer-term performance of UK pension funds
demonstrated consistently impressive results. Whether measured over
five years or 20 years, they showed the same average annual return of
15.3 per cent, nearly twice the rate of inflation.

'In the mid-1980s, people were saying that equities couldn't go on
producing these high returns. We had disappointing years in 1990 and
1994, but over five years there is still a positive return of 16.7 per
cent on equities,' Mr Warrington said.

Property has proved a more disappointing investment for pension funds.
Although it was the best-performing sector in 1994, in 1995 property
produced a return of only 5.3 per cent, compared with a return for all
other sectors of 20.1 per cent. Over five years, property returns have
averaged 6.0 per cent, and property sank to 5.1 per cent of total
pension fund assets at the end of the year.

WM's survey, which covers about 80 per cent of UK pension funds,
reveals little change in the mix of assets held by managers, despite
widespread discussion of a tendency to 'rebalance' portfolios with more
fixed-income investments and less equity.

Some actuaries and investment managers have argued that pension funds
are maturing, with fewer members now actively contributing and more
receiving benefits. That should mean funds will increase bond holdings
to provide a more guaranteed stream of income.

But the funds measured by WM held 77.5 per cent of their portfolios in
equities last year compared with 76.6 per cent at the end of 1994.
Holdings of UK and overseas bonds, other than index-linked, also
increased, but only to 9.9 per cent.

'All the talk we have heard about funds maturing and moving into bonds
hasn't materialised,' said Mr Warrington.

CHANGES SOUGHT IN TERRORISM INSURANCE FOR CITY

   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent

Reform of the government-backed terrorist insurance scheme, which was
introduced after the 1992 IRA attack on the City, is being urged amid
fears that some companies may be inadequately covered.

The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers is worried that
businesses are having to pay excessively high premium rates, which are
forcing them to make a difficult choice between buying cover or risk
having to bear the cost of a terrorist incident.

Insurance industry estimates suggest that less than half of those
businesses which buy commercial property insurance purchase full
terrorism cover, although many have their own 'captive' insurance
companies providing dedicated insurance cover. Others could cover the
cost of an incident from other resources.

However, Ms Ina Barker, executive director of the association, said:
'The danger is that a lot of big businesses do not have enough
terrorism cover and are therefore putting business at risk.' Such fears
could intensify if the IRA ceasefire broke down.

Airmic hopes to hold talks with the Department of Trade and Industry
about possible reform to Pool Re, the state-backed mutual reinsurance
company. This was set up in 1993 to ensure that conventional insurance
companies could provide terrorism cover to commercial clients.

Pool Re members - which include most of the main UK-based commercial
insurance providers - have to supply terrorism insurance on fixed
terms and rates. Premiums collected by insurers are pooled and used to
pay any claims. If Pool Re ran out of money, the government would make
up the shortfall.

Since the IRA ceasefire was announced last year, premium rates have
fallen. But buyers and brokers say the system remains inflexible and
expensive.

Airmic is proposing a scheme in which all commercial property policies
would include a flat contribution towards the costs of Pool Re,
allowing a return to the automatic provision of cover against terrorist
attack.

COMPANY NEWS (THIS WEEK):
CHRISTMAS BRINGS CHEER TO TRADING STATEMENTS - UK RETAILERS

   By NEIL BUCKLEY

Expect to hear news of another strong Christmas as large retailers make
their January trading statements, writes Neil Buckley. Christmas
accounts for a large part of many retailers' annual profits. Reports of
a buoyant December and good start to the post-Christmas sales have
breathed life back into a sector depressed by gloomy results in the
autumn.

Three retailers thought to have had the liveliest festive seasons -
Argos, Dixons and Next - report next week. Argos should unveil a total
sales increase in double digits for the third Christmas running, while
Next is expected to have at least maintained the 10 per cent increase
reported in September. Dixons is forecast to report a 10 per cent
increase in like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, over
Christmas.

Also reporting the same week are Boots and Sears. In the former, strong
performances from Boots the Chemists and Halfords will be tarnished
slightly by sales declines in Do It All, and the Fads/Homestyle home
decorating business. For Sears, total sales are expected to be slightly
up, but like-for-like sales down.

The following week, Body Shop, Storehouse and Marks and Spencer are
forecast to report sales increases of at least 5 per cent. At House of
Fraser a like-for-like increase of perhaps 3 per cent is expected.

One year after the poor trading statement that sparked the departure of
four directors, Kingfisher is expected to reveal recoveries in
Woolworths and Comet, but falling sales in Darty, the French electrical
chain.

WH Smith is forecast to report a Christmas sales increase of up to 7
per cent in its interim results on January 24, while Burton, at its
annual meeting the following day, is expected to announce a continuing
improvement in sales and gross margins.

NEW LOOK RETAILER SOLD TO INSTITUTIONS FOR POUNDS 170M

   By TIM BURT

New Look, the privately-owned fashion retailer founded by entrepreneur
Mr Tom Singh was yesterday sold to a venture capital buy-out group for
about Pounds 170m.

Mr Singh, who started the company in 1969 with a Pounds 5,000 loan, has
agreed to sell the 323-store chain to institutional purchasers led by
BZW Private Equity and jointly underwritten by Prudential Venture
Managers.

The sale follows New Look's abortive attempt to come to the market in
October 1994, which it abandoned the day before its scheduled flotation
amid fears it would not raise the estimated Pounds 150m it was seeking.

Under the terms of yesterday's deal, New Look's shareholders -
dominated by Mr Singh and his family trusts - will initially receive
about Pounds 105m in cash and shares worth about Pounds 50m in Vallsar,
an investment vehicle set up for the transaction.

That will leave the Singhs with 25 per cent of Vallsar, which is to be
renamed New Look. BZW Private Equity has also offered a further Pounds
15m payment contingent on New Look's performance in the three years to
March 1998.

Mr Gavin Aldred, New Look's director in charge of corporate strategy,
said proceeds from the disposal would fund expansion: 'In the 12 months
to March this year, we will have opened 76 stores in the UK and 10 in
France, and we aim to continue growing at about 50 outlets a year.' He
claimed New Look - advised by J. Henry Schroder - was Britain's most
profitable specialist women's wear retailer. In the year to March last
year, pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 6.01m to Pounds 15m
on sales of Pounds 141m (Pounds 83.4m).

Its rival Etam, by comparison, reported first-half losses of Pounds
3.85m in the autumn, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.74m.

Mr Graeme White, a director of BZW Private Equity, praised New Look's
operating performance and said the existing management would remain.

Mr White has joined an enlarged board of New Look as a non-executive
director, as has Mr Martin Clarke of Prudential Venture Managers. He
said the two backers had no timetable for an exit, but did not rule out
a fresh flotation attempt.

COMPANY NEWS (THIS WEEK): GREENBURY GUIDELINES WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST
- OTHER COMPANIES

   By WILLIAM LEWIS

The Greenbury committee's report on executive pay
will move into the spotlight in January and February, with the
publication of a consultation document and several companies' annual
meetings held under Greenbury rules for the first time, writes William
Lewis.

Next Monday, a consultation document on possible methods for disclosing
the true value of directors' pensions will be launched. The Faculty of
Actuaries and the Institute of Actuaries, together with the Stock
Exchange and the Department of Trade and Industry, are to send the
paper to public companies and are seeking their views by February 9.

The Greenbury committee's report, published in July, recommended that
pension costs be disclosed to shareholders to reflect the value to the
individual as well as the true cost to the company.

The Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries put forward a
preferred method but there were calls for wider consultation.

Many companies feared that directors' remuneration could appear to
increase by startling amounts under the new code. The consultation
document will include a number of options - including allowing for the
'smoothing' out of the effects of Greenbury.

Other Greenbury recommendations have already been put in place by some
companies and are due to be tested at annual meetings in the next few
weeks.

Bass and Burton, in their annual reports sent to shareholders last
month, were the first companies to give a separate remuneration
committee report on executive pay. Both companies' remuneration
committee chairmen will be answering shareholder questions on pay at
the meetings on February 8 and January 25 respectively.

Greenbury also recommended that companies seek shareholder approval for
new long-term incentive schemes. Burton and Capital Radio on January 17
will ask shareholders to vote through new schemes for executives.

Following the rule changes announced in the November budget regarding
the taxation of executive share options, Euromoney and Berisford are
asking shareholders to approve changes to their executive share option
schemes. Berisford's meeting is on January 22 and Euromoney's is on
January 18.

FORTE TO EXPAND THROUGH MERIDIEN

   By DAVID BLACKWELL

Forte, the UK's biggest hotels group, is planning a further 26 Meridien
hotels in a push to expand internationally.

The move is expected to be announced in today's final defence document
against the Pounds 3.3bn hostile bid from Granada Group, the
television, catering and leisure group.

Forte is also likely to promise a special dividend or share buy-back if
the Pounds 1.05bn sale of its roadside businesses to Whitbread goes
through. Last week, the group agreed to sell its Little Chef and Happy
Eater roadside restaurants, Welcome Break motorway service areas and
Travelodge budget hotels to the UK brewing and leisure group. The deal
is conditional on the failure of Granada's bid.

The document is expected to include a promise to increase annual
dividends, which were cut from 9.91p to 7.5p for the year to January 31
1993 and were last raised five years ago.

The document will show that Christie & Co, the property surveyor, has
revalued the hotels upwards by Pounds 355m to Pounds 3.35bn, just over
10 per cent above the last estimate in January 1994 and representing
net asset value per share of 325p. This excludes the stake in the Savoy
Group, which Forte plans to sell.

The revaluation was dismissed by Granada, which said if the increase
had been added to assets on July 31 last year, the return on assets
would have fallen from 7.4 to 6.5 per cent. 'Frankly, this looks like a
bit of an own goal by Forte,' said Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief
executive.

Forte paid Pounds 280m to acquire the Meridien chain of 58 hotels from
Air France just over a year ago in order to give it a bigger
international presence. Of the 26 new projects under consideration, one
is in Manchester and all the others abroad, including Beirut and
Bangkok.

Most will be management contracts, although equity stakes have not been
ruled out. Expansion in the US remains a priority.

Sir Rocco Forte, chairman, said the main thrust for Meridien would be
overseas. The first year had been spent in integrating the business,
and Pounds 14m had been taken from head office costs.

'We have only just started,' he said. 'Now we will be much more
pro-active.'

Today's document will concentrate almost entirely on the hotels, giving
details of performance. Meridien is expected to have contributed 20 per
cent to group operating profits.

Operating profits from Forte's Exclusive hotels - including the
Georges V in Paris and the Grosvenor House in London - are expected to
account for 10 per cent of hotel profits, with other London hotels
accounting for 25 per cent. The Posthouse (including Crest) and
Heritage traditional hotels are likely to show contributions of 25 per
cent and 20 per cent respectively.

LONDON BRACES ITSELF FOR A REPO REVOLUTION: AN OPEN MARKET IN SALE AND
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR UK GOVERNMENT BONDS STARTS TODAY

   By RICHARD LAPPER and PHILIP GAWITH

Dealers in UK government bonds are today braced for one of the biggest
changes in the City since Big Bang 10 years ago.

The introduction of an open market in gilt repos, agreements to sell
and then repurchase government bonds, will allow all participants in
the market to borrow and lend stock, removing the monopoly over such
activity that a select number of firms have long enjoyed and bringing
the UK market into line with practices in the US and France.

The Treasury and Bank of England hope the changes will make it easier
for investors to trade gilts, increasing their attractions to overseas
investors and ultimately reducing the cost of funding government debt.
But in the longer term, the development of repos could also lead to
broader changes in the structure of the UK's short-term money markets
and in the way that the Bank of England manages liquidity.

'I'm not saying that repo is going to take off overnight but it is the
brave new world,' says Ms Una van Dorssen, director of repo marketing
at NatWest Markets.

In simple terms, a repo is an agreement to sell a security and then
repurchase it at an agreed future price and date.

One party to the deal 'borrows' money, using the security as a
collateral. The other party 'lends' the money and 'borrows' the bond,
in much the same way as a pawnbroker would take temporary possession of
valuables in return for a personal loan. But although the repo looks
like a loan, in reality it encompasses a disposal and a subsequent
acquisition, reducing credit risk in the event of default by either
party.

And in the international bond markets, repos play a more complex
economic function. Dealers frequently borrow money through repos to
fund the purchases of the same bonds, which are then committed as
collateral. Securities firms usually rely on this means to finance
their operations as they do not have access to the interbank markets
where banks lend to each other.

At the same time, dealers 'lend' money through repo agreements, in a
similar way to how they might place money on deposit with a bank,
although in this case they have the additional security of holding a
bond as collateral. At the same time, the 'borrowed' bonds can be used
to meet short-term trading needs. In the bond markets, dealers
frequently take short positions (sell bonds they do not own), when they
feel prices are likely to fall.

In the UK, the ability to carry out repos or to borrow or lend
government stock through stock lending agreements has been restricted
by law to stock exchange money brokers - effectively middlemen. In
addition, only gilt-edged market-makers, a group of more than 20
securities firms licensed by the Bank of England, have been allowed to
'short' the market.

The new, more liberal rules will make it possible for a much wider
range of traders and investors to operate in the UK gilts market. 'The
fact that it is now seen as a clear and open market will make it
attractive. It will encourage people into the marketplace. They no
longer see it as an esoteric market with rules of its own,' says Mr
David Brayshaw, managing director LM Money Brokers.

Ms van Dorssen at NatWest Markets says that with a deep and liquid
underlying market and a robust futures market in place, repo's
development will increase the range of strategies open to traders.

The impact of repo on the UK's money markets should also be
significant. 'It will be beneficial for the money market and should
help to restore liquidity,' says Mr Brayshaw. 'There has been a lack of
short-dated government paper that can be traded. Also, the overnight
market, which determines funding costs, has come to be dominated by a
small group of players.'

Ms Van Dorssen says cash managers will be able to place larger amounts
of money on 'a repo line' than on an 'unsecured deposit line'.

And in the short term, at least until liquidity in the market picks up,
dealers expect repo rates to be close to the London interbank rates,
offering investors the double advantage of security and extra yield.

Nevertheless, traditional market participants may take time to adapt to
the new environment.

Some UK institutions, which currently earn a fee by lending stock on
their books to money brokers, may have to modify their systems and
learn new skills. Specialists in managing medium and long-term
investments, they may be less prepared for the demands of short-term
money market management necessary in the repo market. And dealers may
prefer to obtain finance through existing relationships with money
brokers.

In the long term, however, dealing directly with other dealers and
investors through repos should become cheaper and more attractive. Mr
Simon Briscoe, chief UK economist at Nikko Europe, says money market
operators will respond to repo in a similar way to how British
motorists responded to the opening of the motorways in the early 1960s.

'It wasn't an immediate transition. Even though motorways allowed for
more traffic and bigger lorries people still use the A roads.'

DISNEY AIMS TO PUMP UP THE VOLUME

   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which recently bid Dollars 19bn
(Pounds 12.2bn) for the Capital Cities/ABC television company, plans to
strengthen its presence in the music business.

It is believed to have joined forces in the autumn with PolyGram, the
world's largest record company, in an attempt to sign up Janet Jackson,
the US singer. Mr Michael Eisner, group chairman, wanted to sign her in
the hope that a high-profile star would raise Disney's stature in the
music market and attract other acts.

Under the terms of Disney's agreement with PolyGram, Ms Jackson would
have split her recording contract between the two groups. She would
have signed to Disney in North America and to A&M, the PolyGram
subsidiary which was her original record label, for the rest of the
world.

It now looks as though Janet Jackson will sign a new contract with
Virgin Music, the record label to which she has been contracted since
1991 when her A&M deal ended. Virgin, owned by Thorn EMI, the UK
leisure group, is thought to have out-bid Disney and PolyGram just
before Christmas, although it has not yet signed a contract with Ms
Jackson.

Mr Eisner is still keen for Disney to expand in the music market, which
is one of the fastest growing and most profitable areas of the
entertainment industry. Until now the focus of the group's music
interests has been its Hollywood Records subsidiary founded six years
ago.

Hollywood's performance has been erratic. It has released a number of
highly successful soundtrack albums under the Walt Disney record label.
The Lion King, the soundtrack to the 1994 animated hit, has sold more
than 9m copies in the US. But it has failed to become a force in the
marketplace.

One option for Disney would be to continue to try to attract
high-profile stars. This could be slow and expensive as there is fierce
competition among rival labels for best-selling acts. An alternative
would be to bid for EMI Music, the Thorn EMI division that owns Virgin,
which is expected to be demerged from the rest of the Thorn EMI group
next autumn. But Disney could face fierce competition from other North
American companies.

MEDIOBANCA TO GIVE FERFIN OFFER TERMS

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME


Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, is expected to reveal
shortly the terms of its public offer to buy 158m shares of Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin), the holding company that controls the Montedison
industrial group.

The move has been forced upon Mediobanca after it lost two judicial
appeals against a public offer for an amount of shares equal to those
acquired in an October raid to gain control of Ferfin. The completion
of the offer will mean Mediobanca will hold 15.26 per cent of Ferfin,
with an estimated disbursement of L582bn (Dollars 367m).

Mediobanca finally accepted the ruling of Consob, the stock exchange
watch dog, late last Friday. It had initially lodged an appeal with the
regional administrative court of Lazio, and when that failed with the
higher court of the state council.

Pricing of the offer presents several problems. Principal among these
has been the L953bn Ferfin rights issue in mid-December. This came well
after Consob's first ruling that Mediobanca must make a public offer.
Before the rights issue, analysts suggested L1,580 per share
represented the average price paid by Mediobanca in its October raid on
Ferfin.

But just before the rights issue they were suspended at L1,056; and
Consob announced only shareholders on the register before the issue
could be the subject of Mediobanca's public buy offer. This point is
apparently being questioned by Mediobanca's lawyers.

Analysts also pointed out that by being obliged to acquire 15 per cent
of Ferfin, the outlay represented over 10 per cent of Mediobanca's
assets, a large exposure.

HEALTH GROUPS ABANDON MERGER

   By RICHARD WATERS

   NEW YORK


After a busy year of consolidation, the US healthcare industry ended
1995 on a sour note with the formal dissolution of a Dollars 1.6bn
merger that would have created the country's largest managed care
organisation.

WellPoint and Health Systems International, two Californian healthcare
groups, abandoned a merger agreement reached last April. Friday's
development came two weeks after the two organisations announced they
were in discussions to break off merger talks, and follows indications
that executives from each side were unable to reach agreement on how to
share power in the new company.

The merger would have created a West Coast giant with the financial
muscle to acquire other managed care groups around the country. The two
had listed the ability to grow beyond their Californian base as a key
reason for the combination.

Under the terms of the all-stock deal, shareholders in Health Systems
would have received 45 per cent of the shares in the combined group.
However, the two sides are believed to have been unable to agree on
what role the smaller company's managers should play after a merger.
The deal would have provided the springboard for a far more widely-held
public company than either is at present.

VICTORS AND VICTIMS OF BOARDROOM UPHEAVAL - TIM BURT LOOKS AT THE HIGH
NUMBER OF COMPANIES STARTING THE YEAR WITH A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP

   By TIM BURT

An unprecedented number of Britain's leading companies are beginning
1996 with newly-installed chairmen and chief executives following a
year of boardroom upheaval.

Groups such as BAT Industries and Inchcape have new chairmen, while
British Telecommunications, BTR, BOC, WH Smith, and electronic
components manufacturer Bowthorpe are among those to bring in new chief
executives.

Their arrival - mostly part of a smooth succession - comes after a year
in which other high-profile directors became boardroom casualties,
including Lord Young and Mr James Ross, chairman and chief executive
respectively of Cable & Wireless.

Mr Tiny Rowland left Lonrho after losing his long-running battle with
Mr Dieter Bock, the trading group's chief executive. Other departures
included Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential; Mr Richard
Reynolds, a director of GEC; Mr Howard Robinson, chief executive at
Calor Group; and Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman of Wembley.

Russell Reynolds, the UK's largest headhunter in revenue terms, said
the number of arrivals and departures reflected the growing influence
of institutional shareholders and non-executive directors in bringing
in new management.

'We're seeing a trend that when companies are having a very difficult
time the executives are being brought to account,' said Mr David
Shellard, managing director.

He cited the Cadbury committee on corporate governance as one factor
behind the increased turnover among company directors, while adding
that the Greenbury committee on executive remuneration had focused
shareholder attention on performance-related pay.

Heidrick & Struggles International, the London-based executive
recruitment agency, said the rash of outside appointments also
signalled a growing skills shortage at board level. Mr John Viney,
chairman, said: 'There are simply too few people to go round. So we're
seeing the best, such as Sir Colin Marshall, taking on two or three
roles.'

Sir Colin, chairman of British Airways, yesterday became non-executive
chairman of Inchcape, the international marketing and services group.

'Inchcape has not been in the best of health,' Mr Viney added. 'They
know it's much better to have a top-class person - even if only for one
day a week - than someone less effective,'

Among the other new arrivals this month, Lord Cairns, who last year
resigned as chief executive of SG Warburg, the investment bank, becomes
chairman of BAT Industries.

Mr Ian Strachan succeeds Mr Alan Jackson as chief executive of BTR. Sir
Peter Bonfield, knighted in the New Year honours, moves from computer
group ICL to be chief executive of BT. Mr Bill Cockburn has become
chief executive at WH Smith.

Mr Tim Parker is taking over as chief executive at CJ Clark, the
shoemakers. Mr Nicholas Brookes is the new chief executive at
Bowthorpe. And BOC, the industrial gases group, will mark its annual
meeting later this month with the appointment of Mr David John and Mr
Danny Rosenkranz as new chairman and chief executive respectively.

NATIONWIDE LOOKS TO LIFE OPERATION

   By ALISON SMITH, Investment Correspondent

Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, is looking to its
new life assurance and unit trust subsidiaries, which open today, to
enable it to reduce its dependence on mortgage-related financial
services.

The new operations replace the relationship in life assurance that
Nationwide has had with Guardian since the beginning of 1990s.

Mr Tom Boardman, managing director of the two new subsidiaries, said
that whereas in selling Guardian's financial services about four-fifths
of Nationwide's business was mortgage-related, he hoped that within a
couple of years this could be reduced to about half.

This strategy seems to acknowledge that endowment mortgages are
becoming less popular and that any recovery in the housing market over
the next couple of years is unlikely to match the pace of the 1980s.

Nationwide has also set itself the target of winning 70,000 financial
services customers in the first year - about 1 per cent of its total 7m
customer base.

This is more ambitious than the 40,000-plus financial services
customers it is thought to have gained each year during the six-year
tie with Guardian.

The new life company will sell term assurance, a mortgage endowment
policy, a guaranteed equity bond and a personal pension plan. The unit
trust operation will sell two unit trusts - a UK growth fund and a
balanced fund which includes an element of overseas exposure.

Apart from the policies it designs itself, Nationwide Life will also
sell a permanent health insurance policy bought in from PPP, the
healthcare company.

This is a smaller and simpler range than the Guardian policies which
Nationwide has been offering, but Mr Boardman said the straightforward
nature of the products should help to keep costs down. He believed the
range was still broad enough to meet most customers' needs.

For Nationwide, as for other mortgage lenders which have set up their
own financial services businesses, a key element will be to market
these products to the entire customer base - savers as well as
borrowers.

Initially, Nationwide's salaried financial services sales force will be
made up of about 340 agents and will grow to 380 by the end of
February. Just over half of these will be branch-based, with the
remainder available to visit customers.

FRENCH BANK SEEKS SHORT-TERM FINANCE

   By ANDREW JACK

   PARIS


Credit Foncier de France, the specialist French property bank, is
considering obtaining a substantial short-term bridging loan while it
undertakes a wide-ranging restructuring plan.

Bank executives are believed to be discussing the idea of seeking a
loan from a commercial bank, secured on its assets, which would last
about three years.

Separately, they are holding talks with the government about short-term
ways to stave off the growing financial crisis triggered by the
withdrawal of its monopoly rights over certain state-backed housing
loan schemes.

The idea is to provide the bank with time to introduce a restructuring
programme which could reduce costs by 30 to 40 per cent in as little as
the next two years, including job cuts and the possible sale of some of
its central Paris offices.

However, executives want to reduce staffing without any redundancies so
they are likely to extend the length of their programme to at least
three years.

They are also discussing refocusing the bank, possibly by withdrawing
from activities such as loans to property developers and local
authorities, and concentrating on core activities of loans to low and
middle-income housing projects.

Credit Foncier's ability to raise funds on the capital markets has been
tightly restricted recently because its share price has dropped sharply
and its credit rating has fallen.

It was dealt a severe blow during December when the French stock market
regulators recommended against it proceeding with a proposed merger
with its 55 per cent-owned subsidiary, Societe des Immeubles de France.

The deal would have provided a much-needed FFr1bn (Dollars 204m) boost
to its balance sheet. It is now looking at other ways of achieving a
recapitalisation.

The bank is also likely to discuss with the French government, in the
medium-term, a change to its legal statutes to make it more like its
private sector competitors.

Although it is a quoted company without any state shareholding, the
government appoints its chairman or 'governor'.

HYUNDAI TO ACCELERATE DECENTRALISATION - SOUTH KOREA'S BIGGEST
FAMILY-RUN 'CHAEBOL' IS MOVING WITH THE TIMES

   By JOHN BURTON

Mr Chung Mong-koo, Hyundai's new chairman, is likely to preside over
the gradual break-up of the giant family-owned South Korean industrial
group his father established in 1947.

That, however, is the way Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, wants
it. In an attempt to avoid a family fight over the Hyundai empire after
his death, Mr Chung decided several years ago to divide it among
several of his sons and nephews by transferring his stock in most of
Hyundai's 45 companies to them.

The result has been the creation of smaller and decentralised groups
within Hyundai that amount to a confederation of allied companies.

The process is expected to accelerate with the recent formal transfer
of management control from the elder Mr Chung and his brother Chung
Se-yung, who succeeded him as chairman in 1987, to their sons.

Hyundai's restructuring, which is expected to benefit the group, could
serve as an example to Korea's other conglomerates, or chaebol. The
chaebol have been widely criticised for being too big and inefficient
while fierce competition, for example, has led to duplication of
activity.

Government officials have long urged them to abandon many of their
marginal businesses and concentrate on a few specialised industrial
sectors to improve their global competitiveness.

Splitting Hyundai into smaller groups is expected to help achieve these
goals. Each mini-Hyundai group focuses on only a few industries, and
these units are less able to support unprofitable activities than they
were within the old monolithic structure.

Under a reorganisation plan announced a year ago, Hyundai was divided
into six main groups, with almost all now controlled by one of Mr
Chung's sons and nephews.

The most ambitious of the new sub-groups is the one controlled by Mr
Chung Mong-koo, the new Hyundai chairman and eldest surviving son of
the Hyundai founder.

In 1977, he established Hyundai Precision & Industry as a cargo
container company, which became the world's largest. Hyundai Precision
now produces railway engines and carriages, sports and utility
vehicles, and military equipment. It also plans to enter the aerospace
sector, assembling aircraft and satellites.

Mong-koo also controls Hyundai's small steel operations, which he wants
to expand by building a large mill that would supply steel to Hyundai's
car and shipbuilding operations.

Mr Chung Mong-hun, his brother and the new Hyundai vice-chairman, has
developed Hyundai Electronics into one of the world's biggest producers
of computer memory chips in less than a decade. Another brother, Mr
Chung Mong-jun, controls Hyundai's shipbuilding operations, the biggest
in Korea.

Hyundai Motors, Korea's largest car company and considered the group's
crown jewel, is being taken over by the family of Mr Chung Se-yung, the
brother of the Hyundai founder. His only son, Mong-kyu, has been
appointed as the car company's new chairman at the age of 33.

Mr Chung Mong-hyuk, another nephew of the Hyundai founder, has been
named new president of Hyundai's petrochemical and oil refining
companies, another growth area.

Other main Hyundai companies, including its trading house and
construction company, remain under the control of the group founder.

A formal break-up of Hyundai is likely to take some time since the
group is held together by a complex web of cross-holdings. These ties,
however, should weaken as the government imposes limits on
cross-holding arrangements in attempt to reduce the economic dominance
of the chaebol.

Family solidarity is also expected to prevent an early break-up of
Hyundai. The Hyundai companies are likely to operate on the same basis
that Mr Chung Ju-yung has established with several of his brothers, who
have created their own small industrial groups that partly depend on
Hyundai for business.

Hyundai Motors, for example, is the biggest customer for the motor
vehicle parts company of the Halla group, founded by Mr Chung In-yung.

Nonetheless, internal conflict may also increase as rivalry grows
between the Hyundai companies. Hyundai Precision, for example, is
challenging Hyundai Motors by producing four-wheel drive vehicles and
mini-vans.

A looser organisational structure may also make it more difficult to
push through large projects that were once easily tackled under the
autocratic management style of the Hyundai founder.

Analysts will also be watching closely to see whether the new Hyundai
chairman can gain group support for his projected Dollars 10bn steel
mill, which has been criticised by some Hyundai subsidiaries as
unnecessary.

NETSCAPE LEADS THE FASHION FOR US NEW ISSUES - FT WRITERS LOOK AT THE
BEST PERFORMING SHARES AROUND THE WORLD IN 1995 / BEST AND WORST SECTORS

   By Our New York staff and ANDREW FISHER

   FRANKFURT


New issues - if you could lay your hands on them - were the hottest
performing stocks in the US last year, with Netscape Communications,
the Internet company, racing to the fore, writes our New York staff.

The market for initial public offerings was more active than it had
ever been, but the few sceptics that remained claimed this was a sure
indication the US market was way out in front of most traditional
valuations measures.

Netscape, which produces a browser for the Internet, was floated in
August at Dollars 28 a share, and by year-end it was trading at Dollars
139, having reached a peak in early December of Dollars 174.

Other strongly performing new issues included Pixar, which handled the
animation for Disney's latest hit film Toy Story. It floated at Dollars
22 just after the film's opening at Thanksgiving, and quickly reached a
high of Dollars 49 1/2, although by year-end it had fallen back to
around Dollars 28 7/8.

Many of the new issues were in the technology sector, which had led the
market higher for much of the year, although towards the end of the
year many of these stocks faltered as growth in semiconductor sales
slowed.

The technology sector's performance should not obscure notable gains in
other sectors. Lower interest rates and hopes for productivity gains
made bank and insurance company shares among the best performers.
Banks, deep into a round of mergers, recorded gains of more than 50 per
cent.

Steel companies, most of which crawled back into profit only in 1994,
managed the dubious distinction of forming the worst-performing stock
market sector.

Another poor performer was the retail sector, which ended another
difficult year with a disappointing Christmas.

CONSTRUCTION FALLS

Building sites abound in German cities and cranes cover the Frankfurt
skyline, but construction shares headed remorselessly downwards in
1995, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. The sector's share performance
slumped by 33 per cent and 1996 is not expected to show much, if any,
improvement.

By contrast, the electrical and electronics sector had a strong year,
adding 34 per cent. Apart from Siemens, reaping the benefits of its
aggressively profit-oriented restructuring, the sector contains SAP,
the fast-growing producer of business software. SAP's share performance
has been meteoric in the past two years, though it has slowed recently.

Commerzbank, whose own new headquarters is taking shape in Frankfurt,
estimates that profits of quoted construction companies will rise a
mere 2 per cent in 1996 after 6 per cent in 1995. The German commercial
and homes building boom is now over, with public sector construction
also held back by budget constraints.

Mr Ingo Mainert, a Commerzbank analyst, says stocks likely to perform
in line with or better than the overall market this year include
motors, steel, electricals and electronics, and insurance.

The bank foresees the DAX index rising to 2,500 or even 2,600 points
after it closed on Friday at 2,254, a rise of 7 per cent on the year. A
year ago, the bank had hoped for 2,400 but the weak dollar and higher
than expected pay rises threw out its calculations.

For electrical and electronics companies, Commerzbank expects an
overall profits rise of 21 per cent this year after 22 per cent in
1995. Earnings in the steel, engineering, motor and metal industries
should show steeper rises, it says.

Further markets will be covered
over the following days.

THOMAS LOCKER'S BID FOR PENTRE ATTACKED

   By TIM BURT

The largest shareholder in Thomas Locker yesterday claimed the
engineering group was seeking a reverse takeover with its proposed
Pounds 7.5m bid for Pentre, the industrial drums manufacturer.

Mr John Carr, who holds 22.6 per cent of Thomas Locker's ordinary
shares, said the purchase price overvalued Pentre: 'The shareholders of
Thomas Locker not only get no premium for the very significant value
inherent in the company they own, they are being asked to approve a
scheme that will lose them control.'

Mr Carr, who acquired his stake in the company last May, urged
shareholders to reject the acquisition, which is being funded by the
issue of 8.62m new and 25.9m A ordinary shares. He also condemned as
inadequate a proposed 3-for-10 scrip issue of additional ordinary
shares, designed to compensate ordinary shareholders for the loss of
voting rights.

The dissident shareholder, advised by KPMG, said there was no logic for
Thomas Locker in acquiring Pentre, which he claimed was burdened with
Pounds 6.9m borrowings.

Neither company was available for comment.

ANXIOUS EYES FOCUS ON COPPER - COMMODITIES

   By RICHARD MOONEY

London Metal Exchange dealers returning from their festive break today
will be anxious to ascertain the new year mood of the copper market,
which is likely to set the tone for other base metals contracts as
well.

Last week's lightly-traded inter-holiday period ended with the copper
market close to its 1995 low as stocks soared towards the excessive
level at which they ended 1994. At 296,425 tonnes they were more than
double the July low.

With further rises in stocks expected, analysts and traders were
predicting further falls this week. '(Stop loss selling orders) were
triggered below Dollars 2,665 earlier today,' one trader told the
Reuters news agency on Friday afternoon, 'and more are likely to be
lurking below Dollars 2,650. . . copper is back on shaky ground.'
Several analysts forecast that copper would drop to Dollars 2,500 in
the medium term as new production capacity came on stream and stocks
continued to accumulate.

The steady increase in stocks over recent weeks has been encouraged by
big premiums available for immediate delivery at the LME. As the stocks
have risen these premiums - known as 'backwardations' - have narrowed.
'If stocks keep rising, and we do expect they will, then the spreads
should come in even more,' Adam Rowley of Macquarie Equities told
Reuters.

'At some stage in the first quarter of 1996 we are looking for quite a
sharp fall in copper prices,' he added.

'With February/March at Dollars 80 to Dollars 90 backwardation it looks
as if this period will stay tight,' said Wolfgang Becker of Iceni
Commodities Brokerage. 'Obviously at some stage the whole thing will be
reversed, but this sort of stock rise may be a bear trap.'

Options traders told Reuters prices could overshoot downside targets if
hedging against large put (selling) positions below the market gathered
pace. 'We are just waiting for copper's resilience to end and when it
does the market could collapse,' one said.

ASSESSING THE POWER OF MULTINATIONALS - GLOBAL INVESTOR

   By TONY JACKSON

   NEW YORK


A noisy debate has broken out in that quiet retreat for the weekend
reader, the book review section of the New York Times. It revives an
issue which some might have thought buried: the power of the
multinationals. It is also a useful reminder that the triumph of free
trade - an idea implicit in most investment strategies today - cannot
be taken for granted.

The opening salvo came in a review by the political theorist Mr Francis
Fukuyama of a book called Opposing The System. The book, by a veteran
leftist Mr Charles Reich, reportedly argues that the current social
malaise - poverty, unemployment and so forth - has been engineered by
large corporations for their own benefit. Therefore, it says, the
powers of government should be increased to control them.

Mr Fukuyama regarded this as 1960s claptrap. The remedies proposed by
Mr Reich, he argued, had got us into this mess in the first place.
Poverty and crime were caused not by big companies, but by big
government.

Enter stage left another 1960s veteran, the consumers' champion Mr
Ralph Nader. Big corporations, he wrote in reply, erode democracy,
export jobs, and weaken the legal safeguards for workers, consumers and
the environment. 'Until Mr Fukuyama understands that a society rots
from the head down and that corporate power needs analysis, he will
never understand Mr Reich's thesis,' he concluded.

So far, so familiar. But the role of the multinationals is becoming
part of a wider issue: that of free trade. If you believe that free
trade is destroying jobs and damaging society, you are bound to blame
the multinationals as its agents.

As another book recently put it, global free trade 'will impoverish and
destabilise the industrialised world, while at the same time cruelly
ravaging the third world.' The author is no 1960s leftist, but the
erstwhile corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith.

As a blend of right-wing populist and born-again environmentalist, Sir
James forms an unlikely bridge between the two wings of protectionism.
On the right, he is joined by the US presidential candidate Mr Pat
Buchanan and by the fellow-billionaire Mr Ross Perot.

On the left, he links with those who argue that free trade enables bad
environmental practice to drive out good: that through the agency -
again - of the multinationals, production will gravitate to countries
free from costly environmental controls.

Those who feel paranoid about the unholy alliance of free-trade
governments and big business can point to one central fact. As the
chart reminds us, world trade has indeed been growing rapidly in
relation to the world economy since the late 1980s, having previously
grown in line.

But are corporations growing in proportion? The evidence is mixed. Last
year, the three biggest US companies by revenues, as listed by Fortune
magazine, were General Motors, Ford and Exxon. Their combined sales of
Dollars 384bn (Pounds 249.3bn) were equal to 5.7 per cent of US GDP.
The figure for the same trio 20 years before was 6.7 per cent.

But if US multinationals are not bigger, they may still be more
powerful. Arguably, modern communications and the lowering of trade
barriers give them much more opportunity to arbitrage labour and
capital around the world. Hence the solution of such as Mr Buchanan:
put the barriers up again.

It might be thought that the impulse to free trade is politically
unstoppable: and indeed, that in the coming world of the Internet the
genie cannot be put back in the bottle anyway.

Not everyone in the investment community agrees. The highly successful
investor Mr George Soros, for instance, argues that electronic trade is
not intrinsically different from the old kind, just faster. It would be
perfectly feasible to re-impose exchange controls, he says. Single
countries could not do it, but groups of countries could.

Mr Soros is gloomily convinced that the present world order, which he
regards as a golden age of capitalism, will ultimately break down. The
last comparable period, he says, was the end of the 19th century. In
those days, 'the British Empire was at the heart of the system, and had
an interest in maintaining security. When there was trouble, it sent a
gunboat. Now there is no chief beneficiary (from stability): certainly
not the US.'

Should the average investor worry about all this? Not for the time
being, perhaps. Both of the likely protagonists in next year's US
presidential elections, Mr Clinton and Mr Robert Dole, are professed
free traders: although both will bear watching for signs of concessions
to their respective outer wings.

The point is rather that the case for a prolonged global bull market
contains an internal contradiction. On the one hand, we are told that
multinational corporations are enjoying a one-off shift to greater
productivity and cheaper labour, based largely on the globalisation of
markets. On the other, we are told the globalising process does not
entail empoverishing one set of workers to the benefit of another. Free
trade means faster growth, so the pie gets bigger.

This worked very well for small countries like Taiwan and Korea, which
were able to develop and open up at their own pace. It is another
matter, to paraphrase Sir James Goldsmith, when political upheaval,
modern communications and the liberalisation of capital movements hurl
4bn workers into the world economy in the space of a few years.

Hence the internal contradiction. Proponents of the bull market argue
that the shift in power between capital and labour is profound enough
to last for a generation. The question is what that generation will
make of it. If it feels disposed to rebel, global free trade could be
the first casualty.

MARKETS:
TIME TO REWRITE INFLATION TARGET - ECONOMICS NOTEBOOK

   By ROBERT CHOTE

Over the last five years many countries have adopted formal targets for
inflation as the centrepiece of their economic policies. But turning a
vaguely expressed enthusiasm for low inflation into a precise numerical
objective is not as straightforward as it sounds.

For one thing, policymakers face a trade-off between the need to
establish credibility and to demonstrate humility. Any target has to be
demanding enough to persuade people that the authorities are serious
about achieving low inflation; but it cannot be too demanding because
credibility will then be lost again when the target proves impossible
to hit.

In 1992 Britain adopted a formal inflation target comprising three
objectives: underlying inflation between 1 and 4 per cent until spring
1997; between 1 and 2.5 per cent in spring 1997; and below 2 per cent
in the long term. The most demanding element soon slipped from public
consciousness, but the first two stayed in place. By last summer,
however, the remaining target had to be updated. Interest rate changes
take about two years to affect prices, so it was becoming too late to
do much about inflation within the target period.

Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced therefore in his Mansion
House speech that he would aim for underlying inflation of 2.5 per cent
or less beyond spring 1997. He predicted this would keep inflation
between 1 and 4 per cent most of the time, recognising that unexpected
events might push inflation higher when it was too late for
policymakers to react.

This formulation has caused confusion ever since and influential voices
have argued that it needs rewriting again. Sir Terry Burns, the
permanent secretary to the Treasury, said shortly before Christmas that
the government should move away from targeting a range for inflation,
concentrating instead on a single figure. Some senior officials at the
Bank of England agree.

The Mansion House speech left many questions unanswered in the minds of
City and academic economists. Was the new target looser or tighter than
its predecessor? Was the inflation objective 1 to 2.5 per cent, 1 to 4
per cent or 2.5 per cent and below?

The conduct of interest rate policy in subsequent months only deepened
the mystery. Mr Eddie George had told the chancellor in May that
inflation was set to exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time and that he
should therefore raise rates. The chancellor refused because he thought
inflation would be lower. Economists were unnerved by the disagreement,
but at least both sides appeared to agree on the definition of the
target - 2.5 per cent or below.

But in September the Bank muddied the waters. It continued to predict
that inflation would exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time, but
dropped its demand for a rate rise. Shortly afterwards, Mr Mervyn King,
its chief economist, argued that the target would be satisfied if
inflation averaged 2.5 per cent or less over a long period. To
observers who had thought the authorities were supposed to be erring on
the side of caution - keeping inflation below 2.5 per cent except in
unavoidable circumstances - this looked like a loosening of policy.

But in a sense it was simply a recognition of the inevitable
limitations of inflation targeting. These limitations were demonstrated
by Andrew Haldane and Christopher Salmon, from the Bank, in a study
published last month*. They constructed a model of British inflation
since 1960 and reran history as though the authorities had pursued a
2.5 per cent inflation target by setting interest rates on the basis of
a forward-looking forecast.

The study suggested inflation would have been lower and less variable
had the authorities followed this policy, as the graphic illustrates.
But Haldane and Salmon also used the model to assess the possible
outcomes for inflation had the economy been buffeted by the whole range
of unforecastable outside disturbances which was typical of the period.
They concluded that even if monetary policy had always been well
directed, the authorities would have had only a one-in-four chance of
hitting a 1 to 4 per cent inflation target: 'Other things equal, these
results would argue for an inflation target band width at least as wide
as that operating in the UK - and possibly much wider.'

This study provides further evidence that it may be counter-productive
to express the inflation target as a range at all - be it 1 to 4 per
cent or 2.5 per cent and below. If the range were wide enough for even
a well-intentioned policymaker to be confident of hitting the target,
it would have to be so wide as to provide little gain in credibility.

Finland has recognised this problem and aims simply for inflation of 2
per cent. The Bank of Finland concedes that it would be impossible to
hit the target precisely in any given month, except by chance. But it
argues nonetheless that a single figure provides a better anchor for
private-sector expectations than a target range.

Mr King's comments and the Bank of England's advice this autumn suggest
that the authorities in the UK may be behaving as though they have a
point target for inflation slightly below 2.5 per cent - even though
that is not what the formal statement of the target says. If so, the
chancellor would do well to rewrite his target again so that it
reflects reality in a rather clearer way.

EMERGING MARKETS: HONG KONG - NEWS ROUND-UP


The Hong Kong stock exchange will review regulations on options trading
in the first quarter of 1996 and does not expect to launch new options
during the review period.

The review would cover the proposal that market makers should be exempt
from stamp duty when they conducted arbitrage with the spot market to
spread risks.

The exchange will also study changes to rules governing opening bids
and how to increase the number of market participants, including market
makers

The exchange began listing individual stock options in September and
currently trades options on nine stocks.

EMERGING MARKETS: INDONESIA - NEWS ROUND-UP


Further state asset sales, an updated legal framework and automation
could mean a bright start to the year for the Jakarta stock exchange,
brokers and analysts believe.

The exchange switched to a fully automated trading system from manual
operations in May, after long delays. This coincided with a move to new
premises in the central business district, and the extension of trading
by 90 minutes each session.

Brokers and analysts said the automated system had helped raise
efficiency and transparency and add liquidity. The fully automated
trading system would also provide a springboard for a planned move to
fully scripless trading, expected in the next few years.

The government is expected to list many of the more than 200 state
companies in the next few years.

EMERGING MARKETS: PHILIPPINES - NEWS ROUND-UP


The Manila equities market, which languished for much of last year, is
expected to rebound strongly during 1996 as more companies are listed.

The authorities expect the creation of a central depository, the start
of scripless trading and tighter rules to prevent insider trading to
boost sentiment.

Some brokers said they expected up to 30 companies to list.

However, inflationary pressures in the first quarter could be brought
about by an impending increase in domestic oil prices.

At present, about 200 companies are listed.

A central depository would begin operations for treasury bills and
government bonds in March before expanding to shares by the third
quarter of 1996.

EMERGING MARKETS:
TRADERS PIN HOPES ON DOLLAR - CURRENCY MARKETS

   By PHILIP GAWITH

If foreign exchange traders have their wishes granted, 1996 will be a
year of volatile markets. Last year was much better than the dismal
spectacle of 1994, but the last few months were characterised by the US
dollar trading in a very narrow range.

There is a fair amount of bullishness among currency forecasters about
the outlook for the dollar, though in recent years it has managed to
confound the best intended explanations for why it should rally.

Analysts at Lehman Brothers think that the dollar stands to benefit in
the coming months from: perceptions that inflation has become
structurally lower, a modest improvement in the current account deficit
as a proportion of GDP, and resolution of the budget negotiations.

They caution, though, that any rally could run into the buffers in the
second half of the year, which may be dominated by a turn-round in
German interest rate expectations.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the dollar,
forecasting levels of DM1.55 and Y112 in the next six months. Against
the yen, their thinking is based upon trends in the trade and current
account data of both the US and Japan, which suggest that the big
bilateral balances between the countries are turning in the dollar's
favour.

Against the D-Mark, their thinking departs from the premise that the
German economy is suffering from the mis-alignment of the D-Mark in
Europe, and this will require the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy in
order to curb D-Mark strength.

Politics will be a key variable. US presidential elections will affect
the dollar, while the progress towards monetary union in Europe will
also be an important determinant of D-Mark and Swiss franc performance.
The proximity of elections in the UK, and a possible Labour government,
could make life difficult for sterling.

EMERGING MARKETS:
LOOKING AHEAD TO BRIGHTER PROSPECTS - THE EMERGING INVESTOR

   By JOHN PITT

The year just ended has not been one that investors in the world's
emerging equity markets will care to remember. Far better to look ahead
to the brighter prospects that many strategists believe beckon in 1996.

But there were some winners during 1995 - a year in which what have
become known as the 'pre-emerging' markets came into their own.

Take Jordan, for example, capitalised at less than Dollars 5bn (compare
this with Mexico's market capitalisation of about Dollars 90bn), and an
annual turnover estimated at less than Dollars 1bn. (Mexico has an
average daily turnover of at least Dollars 100m.)

A far sighted investor who took a position in the country's fledgling
stock market at the start of last year would have seen
dollar-denominated assets appreciate by 23 per cent. Compare this with
a loss of 35 per cent in both India and Hungary, or 40 per cent in Sri
Lanka.

Certainly one of the prominent themes of 1995 has been the growing
interest in these pre-emerging markets: countries which are just
beginning to organise their financial structures, but are endeavouring
to do so as quickly as possible.

As the main emerging markets of Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey,
for example, retreated in the face of a flow of funds back into the
developed world, so interest turned to lesser known regions. In
particular, a race began among a number of US and European investment
banks and brokerages to establish contacts and trading positions in
Africa. It became clear that in this 'new scramble for Africa' returns
on investments could, in many cases, far exceed those in the more
mature markets. But the risk would also be much greater.

This did not deter the launch of a number of African funds during 1995,
although most were naturally skewed towards the largest market on the
continent - South Africa. With an estimated market capitalisation of
Dollars 274bn Johannesburg is the world's seventh largest stock
exchange.

Russia was another growth area and some commentators believe that 1996
will see this market come of age, especially after the presidential
election is out of the way. ING Barings global strategy unit led by
Michael Howell, for instance, believes that both eastern Europe and
Russia show attractive valuation levels, and thinks fund managers are
ready to significantly increase their exposure.

'Of the Dollars 50bn expected to flow towards emerging equity markets
in 1996, I expect some Dollars 5bn to head towards eastern Europe and
Russia,' says Mr Howell. 'This is equivalent to more than 10 per cent
of existing market capitalisation, and, perhaps, as much as 25 per cent
of the existing free-float.'

Other factors likely to lift investor sentiment in Russia include an
improvement in custodial operations, with expectations that an
independent central depository will finally be created.

Mr Mark Mobius, president of the Dollars 7bn Templeton Emerging Markets
Fund, is another enthusiast for Russia, although he is aware that the
country's turbulent political climate is likely to get worse before it
gets any better.

Nevertheless, he is confident that potential for investment is bright,
given that the country has embarked on what he calls a 'revolutionary'
approach to financial market reforms.

But what of the core emerging markets?

Mr Arnab Banerji, chief investment officer of Foreign & Colonial
Emerging Markets based in London, believes that in spite of a
disappointing return on investments in 1995 the outlook remains
positive. He picks South Korea, India, Brazil and Taiwan, among others,
as having strong prospects.

India, for example, continues to have good compound earnings growth, he
says.

He is also among a number of strategists who favour Brazil among Latin
American markets.

Garantia, a leading Brazilian investment bank, warns that slower
economic growth during the first half of the year will put a brake on
the stock market's momentum; while for the year as a whole it will be
very much a matter of selecting specific sectors. Garantia favours the
food, beverage, packaging and retail sectors, on the basis that the
recent decline in inflation means that many people now have a
disposable income for the first time in years.

At UBS the emerging markets team is keen on Chile, South Korea and
Turkey, all for different reasons. Chile will continue to see an
improvement in the economic picture and political problems are forecast
to dissipate; South Korea is expected to benefit from an easing in
monetary policy; and Turkey should be able to move forward once again
now that the parliamentary elections are out of the way.

Chile will also benefit from the increased weighting - from 1.9 per
cent to 7.3 per cent - which the equity market will attract in the
IFC's investable index which starts this month. Mr Nigel Rendell at
James Capel, who classifies Chile as 'an Asian tiger living in Latin
America', forecasts that despite the recent rise in interest rates,
corporate earnings will rise by 25 per cent in nominal terms, valuing
the market on a prospective p/e of 16 times.

Whether or not this year will see a pick-up in activity among the
world's emerging markets depends on a host of factors, not least the
movement in US interest rates. Further easing in US monetary policy,
many analysts believe, could trigger a fresh wave of institutional
money out of the US and Europe, and into Latin America and the Far
East.

EQUITY MARKETS:
INVESTORS FACE A DEARTH OF ECONOMIC DATA - NEW YORK

   By RICHARD WATERS

Thanks to the latest Federal government shutdown, US stock market
investors start the new year facing a dearth of official economic data
against which to judge the economy's performance.

The only significant new information this week will be the National
Association of Purchasing Management report for December, due today.
The headline NAPM index for the month is expected by most economists to
be around 47.5 - higher than November's 46.5 but still below the
50-mark which would point to expectations of manufacturing growth. That
would provide a firm backdrop for the bond market, whose recent gains
have underpinned share prices.

While keeping one eye on bonds, the stock market will begin to fix its
attention on the corporate earnings season starting later this month.

Three months ago, a generally strong set of quarterly results helped
set the stage for the stock market's fourth-quarter rise. This time
around, the figures will be pored over for signs of how the US's
economic slowdown is affecting earnings growth.

Most market followers expect earnings growth to taper off during 1996.
But corporate cost-cutting and share repurchases have left plenty of
room for earnings to come in ahead of expectations. And with US
investors still buying mutual funds, there seems to be plenty of cash
around to chase share prices higher.

EQUITY MARKETS: STRATEGY - OTHER MARKETS


The start of the new year has brought the usual crop of recommendations
from brokers. Spain and Sweden feature among the lists as potentially
good performers in 1996 while the time may now be ripe to take profits
on Switzerland after its strong run last year.

Views on Italy are divided, with some analysts thinking the time is
right to give the market another chance but others finding the
political outlook still unappealing.

JP Morgan expects equity markets to remain volatile, with positive
responses to interest rate cuts probably offset in part by continuing
bad news on earnings.

Morgan reiterates its underweighting of Paris, saying France is
expected to experience one of the slowest growth rates in Europe next
year. It is taking profits on a previous upgrade of the Swiss market
and switching the money into Italy, which it believes is discounting
the bad news and could react positively to a relaxation of monetary
policy.

Morgan says the low valuation on its forecasts and scope for interest
rate cuts makes the Swedish market look attractive after its recent
underperformance.

Lehman Brothers still recommends being overweight in the Spanish,
French, Swedish and Dutch markets. It says the first two are cheap,
relative to debt, while slower French growth has been more than
discounted by the market.

Sweden looks attractive on a prospective dividend basis, while the
Dutch market is the cheapest among the core European economies.

The UK, Swiss and Italian markets remained relatively expensive.
Liquidity flows had helped the first two, but value would come through.
In spite of its underperformance, Lehman saw little value in Italy.

ABN-Amro Hoare Govett, meanwhile, continues to prefer Germany and the
Netherlands in core Europe while Spain is its peripheral market of
choice. And while Italy's valuations have improved, ABN still does not
trust the politics.

EQUITY MARKETS: TOKYO - OTHER MARKETS

   By EMIKO TERAZONO

With the Year of the Pig ending on a note of slight recovery, some
market participants are hoping that the Year of the Rat will be a good
one for the Japanese shares, writes Emiko Terazono. Past Years of the
Rat have seen the market rise by an average of 54.6 per cent, and the
animal is regarded by believers of traditional omens as a favourable
sign for investments.

Stocks may need all the help they can get since banks and life
insurance companies are expected to sell their share holdings ahead of
the March book-closing. Analysts point out that there has been heavy
trading around 21,500 and regard that figure as a strong resistance
level.

EQUITY MARKETS: HONG KONG - OTHER MARKETS


Further gains are expected among equities this week after Friday's
year-end window dressing and solid gains in the futures market, which
took the Hang Seng index to intra-day and closing highs for 1995.

Analysts are concerned, however, that the near-term outlook for
recently active newspaper stocks remains cloudy in view of their weak
earnings prospects. They add that the decision to relax conditions
governing the pre-sale of uncompleted flats will benefit developers,
although it will not have much stimulative effect on the local property
market.

EQUITY MARKETS: FRANKFURT - OTHER MARKETS


The Bundesbank meets on Thursday, but having cut key rates at its last
meeting, no action can be expected on the discount or Lombard rates
this week.

James Capel says the Bundesbank Council will wish to assess the impact
of the monetary easing on M3 and the real economy over some weeks.

The most interesting feature of the meeting was likely to be what the
council said about the repo rate.

'We would expect a fairly prompt return to a variable repo rate, which
is likely to drift lower over the coming weeks,' says Capel.

On the corporate front, analysts are expecting a let-up in the number
of new bourse listings in 1996 after last year's flood, although
November will bring the flotation of Telekom, Germany's telephone
monopoly, which is expected to raise DM15bn.

Companies raised a record DM8.5bn in new funds in 1995 from 20 IPOs,
including the listing of Merck, the drugs group, that was Germany's
largest post second world war stock offering, which raised DM2.4bn, and
the Adidas placement, which raised DM2.1bn.

EQUITY MARKETS: DUBLIN - OTHER MARKETS


Even after last year's performance, which saw the Irish equity market
climb by 20 per cent to end among the best performing markets in Europe
for the third successive year, Dublin retains its enthusiasts.

Mr Robbie Kelleher at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin says the market has
more than doubled since the trough of October 1992 but still expects
the ISEQ to be among the top performing indices in 1996.

'Valuations remain low, both by historic and international standards,
the Irish economy is likely to be the fastest growing economy in in
Europe again in 1996 and the strength of corporate cash flows and
balance sheets is likely to restrict the supply of new equity to a
minimum,' he says.

How this better relative performance translates into absolute
performance depends on developments in other markets.

Mr Kelleher believes the international equity market rally can be
sustained in the early part of 1996, on the back of continuing support
from low interest rates, low inflation and rising bond prices.

EQUITY MARKETS:
YEAR EXPECTED TO OPEN ON POSITIVE NOTE - LONDON

   By PHILIP COGGAN

The UK market starts what could be a general election year in a healthy
spirit. A base rate cut in December, accompanied by reductions in
European and US interest rates, creates a positive background for
equities.

With most observers expecting base rates to fall further in the early
months of 1996, shares could yet set some more all-time highs. While
the FT-SE 100 index did well in 1995, it still lagged well behind Wall
Street's phenomenal performance.

The first test of the year will be the spring results season, not so
much for the figures themselves, but for chairmen's statements about
trading conditions in early 1996. The market shrugged off some profits
warnings in late 1995, mainly on the hope that UK economic growth was
pausing for breath, rather than grinding to a halt.

As the year moves on, thoughts will inevitably turn to the date of an
election, and the chances of a Labour government.

Concern will probably focus, not on macro-economic policies, but on
micro-economic matters such as the minimum wage or dividend taxation.
If Labour maintains its strong lead in the opinion polls, shares may
start to come under pressure.

Much went right for the UK stock market in 1995 - takeover activity, a
strong Wall Street, falling bond yields and worldwide interest rates.
It will be a surprise if all those factors are still as positive in
1996.

EQUITY MARKETS:
CVRD MANDATE SUGGESTS END OF THE GOLDEN 3% FEE - INTERNATIONAL OFFERINGS

   By ANTONIA SHARPE

The debate about fees which investment banks charge for arranging
international equity offerings is set to be a lively one in 1996,
judging from the aggressive bids which emerged in the recent
competition to win Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) mandate.

Shortly before Christmas, the Brazilian government said it had chosen a
consortium including Merrill Lynch, NM Rothschild, KPMG and four
Brazilian partners to handle the sale of its 51 per cent stake in CVRD,
one of the world's largest exporters of iron ore.

The winning consortium is charging a fee of 1.9 per cent to arrange
what is expected to be one of the most significant international equity
offerings of 1996. According to market valuations, the government's
stake is worth about Dollars 5bn but the sale is likely to be spread
over at least two offerings.

If the winners' fee looked low, it was by no means the lowest. Bankers
involved in the bidding said a consortium led by Lehman Brothers had
offered to do the business for a fee of 1.75 per cent and another
including CS First Boston for 1.9 per cent.

It is also believed the fee bid by the consortium including Morgan
Stanley and SBC Warburg (disqualified because the first part of its fee
estimate was too far below the average) was in this region.

By contrast, Goldman Sachs, which had come top in the technical part of
the bidding contest, had bid a fee of 3.125 per cent, bankers said.

Bankers involved in the consortium which won the CVRD mandate say the
level of the fee was justified because the sale will be a secondary
offering and not an initial public offering, which usually commands a
higher fee.

Half of the CVRD stock is already traded, making CVRD the most
widely-held stock after Telebras and Petrobras. As a result, it already
has a wide following among foreign analysts and investors.

They also point out that there is a history of low fees in Brazil,
where past international equity offerings have been done for fees of
just over 2 per cent. But the two most important reasons bankers give
to justify the fee are: first, the size of the offering; and second,
the importance of being involved in the first of many privatisations in
Brazil.

Although bankers do not expect the government to sell its CVRD holding
in one go, the arranging banks stand to earn close to Dollars 100m from
the whole process.

On the second point, the bidding highlighted the willingness among
international banks to drop their fees in order to be at the forefront
of Brazil's privatisation programme.

The government wants CVRD to pave the way for further sell-offs in the
country's electricity and telecommunications sectors over the next few
years.

The fact that three leading investment banks were willing to arrange
the CVRD sale for a fee of less than 2 per cent, despite the risks
associated with an emerging market such as Brazil, is also a reflection
of the increasingly intense competition in the international equity
market.

Once one of the most lucrative sectors of investment banking, fees for
arranging deals, particularly privatisations, have been eroding
steadily over the past two years.

This has come about as governments seek to maximise the proceeds of
selling off state assets and new players try to break into the market.

The downward pressure on fees has been mainly on privatisations, where
there is likely to be follow-on business for the banks, and less so on
corporate IPOs or secondary offerings. However, there are signs that
corporate fees are also coming under pressure.

In view of the ever-greater number of privatisations in Europe and
elsewhere in the world and the growing number of investment banks
wanting a slice of the action, it is inevitable that fee levels have
become one of the main bargaining tools.

With competition set to stiffen further, many bankers now believe the
golden 3 per cent level, once the norm for European privatisations, has
gone for good.

GOLDMAN SACHS REMAINS AT THE TOP

   By ANTONIA SHARPE

Goldman Sachs maintained its position as the leading global co-ordinator
of international equity issues in 1995, according to data from Euromoney
Bondware, Antonia Sharpe writes.

Goldman's involvement in Germany's
privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, scheduled for November, should ensure
it retains the top slot in 1996. However, winning the CVRD mandate in
Brazil, which is also set to emerge in the second half of the year, has
increased Merrill Lynch's chances of taking the lead.

Although Morgan
Stanley, Merrill Lynch, SBC Warburg, CS First Boston, Dresdner
Bank-Kleinwort Benson and Lehman Brothers remain among the top 10 global
co-ordinators for 1995, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Paribas and BNP have
been displaced by UBS, ABN-Amro and BZW.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
TOKYO

   By EMIKO TERAZONO

While the country's financial institutions' woes are likely to prompt
the Bank of Japan to maintain an accommodating stance in its money
market operations, it is expected to push up interest rates on the long
end.

Banks are expected to step up their profit-taking on bonds and stocks
ahead of the March book-closing in order to cover losses stemming from
the write-offs of bad loans.

Many of the leading banks have pledged to clear their balance sheets of
bad loans related to jusen, or housing loan companies, and some have
announced that they may fall into the red for this business year to
March.

Life insurance companies may also want to take profits on their bond
holdings due to the decline in insurance premiums. While the leading
insurers posted healthy rises in their recurring profits for the first
half to September, this was largely due profit-taking on their
investments.

The seasonal repatriation of funds from the US ahead of the March
book-closing may briefly put upward pressure on the yen on the foreign
exchanges, but this is unlikely to have a lasting impact on bond
prices.

Lehman Brothers in Tokyo estimates yields on the 10-year government
bond, which closed the last year at 2.9 per cent, to end at 3.4 per
cent at the end of the first quarter of this year.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
A STEP AWAY FROM CITY TRADITION - OPEN GILT REPO TRADING

   By PHILIP GAWITH and RICHARD LAPPER

The launch today of the open gilt repo market may be something less
than a 'second Big Bang', but it does represent a further step away
from a City where custom and tradition have played an important role,
towards one governed by the more homogenised standards of a global
financial services industry.

The privileges and arcane idiosyncracies associated with such core City
institutions as gilt edge market makers (GEMMs) and stock exchange
money brokers (SEMBs) are ebbing away.

Already there is evidence of some of the more marginal GEMMs throwing
in the towel, while SEMBs will have to cope with the fact that an open
repo market comes in tandem with an open stock-lending market.

Ironically, the advent of the gilt repo market is being
enthusiastically welcomed by that other supposed City anachronism - the
discount house. These institutions have, for as long as anyone can
remember, served as the intermediaries through which the Bank of
England channels liquidity to the commercial banks.

Often the butt of ridicule for their quaint practice of having
employees don top hats every morning in order to do the rounds of the
City's main banks, they have also become increasingly marginalised in
recent years as the clearing banks have gained ascendancy in the money
markets.

More than 80 per cent of the eligible bills - those which the Bank is
prepared to discount in its daily money market operations - are held by
the clearers.

As a result, the role of discount houses over the past 10 years has
been little more than to serve as brokers on behalf of the clearing
banks.

There is a widespread belief, however, that the Bank of England will
start to use the repo as its daily medium of intervention in the money
markets (at the moment it conducts repo operations every two weeks, but
the bulk of its daily operations are done through the bill market).

This will not be immediate - the Bank will first want to see a depth of
liquidity in the repo market, both in terms of the number of
counterparties, and the volume going through - but is believed to be
inevitable.

For its part, the Bank is playing a very straight bat. It said this
week that 'it did not have plans to change the form of its money market
operations', but that the development of gilt repo trading 'could make
it sensible to contemplate change later'.

The Bank has to tread very carefully, because, in the words of one
observer, 'any change is a sea change'.

A hint that the Bank plans to start using repo alongside eligible bills
in its daily operations is sure to be taken as a signal that a move to
sole reliance on repo is likely.

Some observers believe the Bank will try to run repo and bill
operations in tandem.

There are two main reasons why such a move is considered likely. First,
there is widespread belief that intervening via the repo will be a more
effective method of managing short-dated interest rates than the
current practice of intervening, often three times a day, via the bill
market.

Second, it seems most likely to be the modus operandi of a future
single European central bank and the UK is unlikely to want to do
anything which is at odds with what it might have to do in Europe, if
it participates in monetary union.

A study last year by Mr Norbert Schnadt for the London Business School
found that the money market operations of the Banque de France,
Bundesbank and Federal Reserve differed from those of the Bank of
England in that they were conducted less frequently, utilised only
repurchase transactions, and were spread over a very wide range of
financial institutions.

It also found that even though the Bank intervened more frequently in
the money markets than the other central banks, sterling rates were
much more volatile than elsewhere.

Recently, however, UK overnight rates have been steadier. Intervention
via repo is also unlikely, in itself, to be sufficient to make
overnight rates more stable.

Any shift towards daily use of repo will be welcomed by the discount
houses, because by so doing the Bank will increase the number of active
participants in the money markets, diminishing the dominant role of the
clearers.

The introduction of an open repo market also creates a new trading
instrument which puts more emphasis on the idea of secured money - a
high priority in the aftermath of the Barings episode.

At the moment, most secured lending and borrowing is done either to the
discount market, or via SEMBs, and through them to GEMMs.

Discount houses see an opportunity in this because of their expertise
in secured lending.

Mr George Blunden, chief executive of Union plc, says: 'Discount houses
have a head start because our job has been secured money markets since
the beginning of time.' As much as 95 per cent of the discount market
is secured.

Mr Ross Jones, chief executive at Gerrard and National plc, adds: 'This
is the biggest opportunity we have had for years. We see it as a
potential new lease of life for the secured sterling money market.'

A group like Gerrards has the added advantage of having a SEMB within
the group, which will be merged with the discount house operations.
While the pivotal role of SEMBs will be diminished, stock borrowing and
lending will continue, alongside repo, so the relationships they have
will still count.

A number of the largest holders of gilts - pension funds and
institutions - have dealt exclusively with SEMBs, and early indications
are that they will be happy to continue doing business this way.

As new entrants garner market share, institutions will have to widen
their counterparties beyond the small set of SEMBs they have
traditionally dealt with, but loyalty to old relationships looks likely
to be the watchword initially.

Discount houses are also confident that if the Bank of England starts
to use the repo as an intervention mechanism, it will want a manageable
set of counterparties, dedicated to making markets in all conditions.
They believe that their chances of playing this role are good.

Another development which will encourage the development of the repo
market is the introduction of the European-wide Capital Adequacy
Directive, which also takes effect today. CAD encourages a secured
money market, because the capital requirements for repos are much lower
than for unsecured ones.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
FRANKFURT

   By ANDREW FISHER

The German bond market market ended the year quietly but positively,
with bund futures generally expected to remain firm.

Inflation, now below 2 per cent, is clearly under control and economic
growth is modest at best. Thus the Bundesbank can sit tight after its
pre-Christmas interest rate cuts.

With the discount rate now down to 3 per cent, the chances of a further
reduction are rated as no more than slight by most economists.

It has only once fallen below 3 per cent in the last three decades -
just after the 1987 stock market crash, when it stayed at 2.5 per cent
for six months.

Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Union Bank of Switzerland, said
the discount rate was not likely to fall so low in this cycle.

'However,' he added, 'this does not mean that monetary easing is over.'

The securities repurchase (repo) rate should fall below the current
3.75 per cent. Also, the 5 per cent Lombard rate could also be lowered,
since the bottom of previous cycles has seen it at 4 or 4.5 per cent.

If the money supply remains weak, the Bundesbank could cut interest
rates further, said Mr Bill Smyth of BHF Trust. But the 1987 discount
cut to 2.5 per cent did not produce a powerful bond rally, he noted.

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
LONDON

   By CONNER MIDDELMANN

All eyes in the UK government bond market this week will be on gilt
sale and repurchase agreements, or repos, which starts today.

'A whole new world of leverage trades, reverse repos, term stock loans,
buy/sells, matched books and, hopefully, very little mayhem will
transform the gilt market,' say analysts at HSBC Greenwell.

'We are entering a new evolutionary phase in the market. Repos will
impact on pricing, liquidity management, swaps, curve plays and
ultimately, we suspect, on official intervention in the money market.'

But in the near term, trading is unlikely to be heavily affected by
repos and after trading in a narrow range last week, gilts will have to
look elsewhere for life to be breathed back into the market.

The data front offers slim pickings, with M0 figures and the purchasing
managers' report for December scheduled as the only releases this week.

'M0 will be viewed with interest for what it reveals about consumer
demand in December - a month which accounts for over one-quarter of
total annual retail sales,' notes Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi
International. 'The weekly notes in circulation data suggest that there
was a seasonally adjusted increase in M0 of almost 1 per cent on the
month - this would appear to confirm retailers' reports of strong sales
in December.'

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
INVESTORS ASSESS THEIR STRATEGY FOR 1996 - GOVERNMENT BONDS

   By RICHARD LAPPER

The scale of the rally in international government bonds over the last
six months surprised the markets and left many investors scrambling to
increase their exposures.

In assessing their strategy for this year, investors must weigh up the
extent to which benign economic fundamentals, especially for the US and
European markets, are already reflected in valuations.

At the same time, the markets could be affected by a number of
political uncertainties linked to the US presidential elections and the
creation of European Monetary Union.

European bonds provided investors with some of the best returns in 1995
- with returns (in local currency terms) to December 15 ranging from
around 15.3 per cent in France and 15.5 per cent in Germany to 19.3 per
cent in Sweden.

Over the last few weeks there has been a wealth of evidence that the
growth of core economies such as Germany and France is grinding to a
halt and that inflationary pressures are continuing to ease.

Furthermore, at their Madrid summit last month European leaders and
finance ministers reaffirmed their commitment to monetary union,
suggesting the reduction of fiscal deficits will remain a priority for
governments across the continent.

'Europe is shaping up for a common currency and that suggests
governments will wrestle to bring public finances under control. These
are developments bond investors will be pleased to see,' says Mr Craig
Shute, bond analyst at Bear Stearns International in London.

Similar 'bond-positive' forces are visible in the US, where Treasuries
provided investors with total returns of more than 17 per cent in 1995.
And the current market rally has very different characteristics to that
of 1993, which gave way to a sell-off early in 1994.

During 1993, the markets were expecting further monetary tightening -
now by contrast, further cuts in interest rates are expected. The
inflation rate is falling - it was rising in 1993 - and some analysts
argue that investors have yet to fully adjust their expectations to the
extent of the downward trend in inflation.

Mr Nigel Richardson, international bond strategist at Yamaichi
International, says US inflation - as measured by the consumer price
index - has not been as low as its current level of 2.6 per cent since
1972. The present situation 'holds out the possibility that there may
be a permanent return to 1960s-style price increases,' suggests Mr
Richardson.

Yet according to the a survey of economic forecasts by Consensus
Economics Inc, investors expect US inflation to rise to 3.1 per cent in
the longer term.

'They are responding fully to the current inflation background on the
grounds that they appear to doubt it will be maintained. In essence,
therefore, the bond market has 1980s style yields against a background
of 1960s style inflation,' says Mr Richardson.

However, there are also good reasons to be cautious. For a start, the
scale of the surge in bond prices in 1995 means much of the good news
is already reflected in valuations.

Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell by nearly two percentage points
in 1995, touching 6 per cent by the year end, while in Germany yields
on 10-year bonds had dropped to 6.07 per cent by December 27, a fall of
more than 1.5 per cent.

'With the US and European central banks virtually moving as one to cut
interest rates before year-end, most of the good news for the bond
markets has been delivered,' says Mr Graham McDevitt, international
bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.

Mr McDevitt predicts an increase in volatility, arguing that there is a
high risk of a correction in the first quarter with bond yields rising
by 25 to 50 basis points. Economic slowdown could also create
difficulties by undermining fiscal deficit and debt reduction schemes,
in turn putting at risk the achievement of Maastricht criteria for
monetary union in some countries.

The impact of the slowdown will be most clearly apparent in France,
where a fall in tax revenues could impair the government's efforts to
reduce its fiscal deficit from the current level of more than 5 per
cent.

The industrial action by French railway workers last month is expected
to have reduced growth in the final quarter of 1995 to 0.1 per cent.

Finally, while leverage has been an element of the current bull market,
it is not thought to represent as serious a threat to the markets'
stability as in 1994, when highly geared trades built up in 1993 were
suddenly unwound, aggravating the extent of the sell-off.

A popular geared play last year, according to analysts at BZW
Securities, was to finance purchases of US assets with yen borrowings
on the grounds that the 'perceived potential for currency loss is small
relative to the yield pick-up.'

BZW says the leveraging has been concentrated on US more than European
bond markets and may well be limited to the short end of the Treasury
curve, though 'the impact will still have percolated along the curve.'

WORLD BOND MARKETS:
NEW YORK

   By RICHARD TOMKINS

US Treasuries passed a milestone last week. On Wednesday, the yield on
the benchmark 30-year long bond ended the day below the psychologically
significant 6 per cent level for the first time in two years. On
Thursday and Friday, it edged down further still, closing the week -
and the year - at 5.94 per cent, in marked contrast to the 7.92 per
cent at which it started the year.

The question now is whether yields will fall further still, and Wall
Street analysts believe they will. Most indicators point to a weakening
of economic growth in the coming year, further diminishing inflationary
pressures.

With recession an increasing possibility, analysts confidently expect
the Federal Reserve to continue to reduce the Fed funds rate, with the
next downward movement pencilled in for the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting of January 30-31.

This week, however, could be a quiet one in the bond market, for any
agreement between the president and Congress over a balanced budget
will almost certainly come too late to allow the flow of government
data to resume before the weekend.

Most attention is likely to focus on today's publication of the
National Association of Purchasing Managers index for December. This is
expected to show a slight increase from November's 46.5.

FT GUIDE TO THE WEEK


UK gilt repo market opens

An open market begins in gilt repos, agreements to sell and then
repurchase government bonds. All players in the gilt market will be
allowed to borrow and lend stock, rather than only a select group of
dealers. The reform should provide greater liquidity, make the market
more attractive to foreign investors and reduce government funding
costs.

Cash for Marcos victims

About Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) of money from Swiss bank accounts
belonging to the late Ferdinand Marcos, the former president of the
Philippines, is to be transferred to Hawaii. The move is part of a
Dollars 100m deal in settlement of a Dollars 2bn claim by about 10,000
victims - or their relatives - who were tortured, raped or murdered
under the Marcos regime. The Filipinos filed a lawsuit against Marcos,
who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, after a popular revolt ousted him
from power in 1986.

AT&T targets Britain

UK phone-users can expect to find themselves the target of aggressive
campaigns by AT&T, the largest US telecoms operator. AT&T says it will
not compete on price but on quality of service and innovation. British
Telecom, which has so far brushed off challenges from its 150 or so UK
rivals, may have more to fear from the US giant.

Cricket

South Africa meet England in the fifth Test in Cape Town (to Jan 6).

Holidays

Armenia, Botswana, Canada, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, New Zealand,
Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Taiwan, Yugoslavia.

WEDNESDAY 3

Perry in Sarajevo

William Perry, US defence secretary, arrives in Sarajevo after
inspecting US bases in Italy and Hungary. Mr Perry is touring US
military operations to implement the Bosnia peace accord. It is the
first visit by a high-level US official since the deployment of 20,000
American troops began on December 16.

On Thursday, Mr Perry travels to Ukraine, where he and his Ukrainian
and Russian counterparts will participate in the destruction of an
intercontinental ballistic missile silo in accordance with the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.

Summing up in Maxwell trial

The Maxwell fraud trial resumes following a Christmas break demanded by
the jury. The judge, Lord Justice Phillips, will start his summing up.
This is expected to last almost a week, after which the jury will be
sent out to consider its verdict. Kevin Maxwell, Ian Maxwell and Larry
Trachtenberg deny conspiring to defraud the Maxwell pension funds.

Holidays

Japan, Taiwan.

THURSDAY 4

UK's first war crimes trial

Committal hearings start in Dorking, near London, for what could be
Britain's first war crimes trial. The accused is 84-year-old Szymon
Serafinowicz, a former Nazi paramilitary allegedly involved in
atrocities during the second world war.

Japan's stock markets open

The Tokyo Stock Exchange and the country's other stock exchanges open
the year's trading session.

Holidays

Burma, Zaire.

FRIDAY 5

Britain's Blair in Far East

Tony Blair, leader of the UK's opposition Labour party, makes a two-day
visit to Japan on the first leg of a Far East tour (to Jan 8) to raise
his party's international profile and persuade foreign investors of the
soundness of Labour economic and financial policies. He will address
the Keidanren, the main business federation, and meet government
ministers and UK businesses in Japan. He travels on to Singapore.

German rail fares rise

Fares on Deutsche Bahn, Germany's federal railway system, rise an
average 2.8 per cent in western Germany. Train tickets in eastern
Germany, which used to be 20 per cent cheaper than in western Germany,
will now only be 10 per cent cheaper. The Schones Wochenende ticket,
which enables five people to travel unlimited mileage on local trains
for an entire weekend, will now cost DM35 (Dollars 25), up from DM30.

Mastering Management

The FT's 20-part series resumes in the UK edition with part nine,
following a two-week break. Non-UK readers can take out a subscription.

Holidays

Sri Lanka.

SATURDAY 6

Rifkind visits Hong Kong

Malcom Rifkind, UK foreign secretary, arrives in Hong Kong for a
three-day visit, his first to the colony as foreign secretary. He will
meet local business and political leaders and receive a briefing from
the governor, Chris Patten, on the state of Anglo-Chinese relations as
they affect the June 1997 hand-over of the colony. Mr Rifkind travels
on to Beijing.

Sailing

The Cape to Rio yacht race starts from Cape Town, South Africa.
Although the event is sponsored by Rothmans cigarettes, one of the

race.

SUNDAY 7

Portillo in Japan

Michael Portillo, UK defence secretary, in Japan to January 9, will
discuss co-operation in United Nations peace-keeping operations. Japan
is to send troops for monitoring duties in the Golan Heights at the end
of this month. An accord is expected on UK-Japan military exercises and
exchanges of officers for training.

UK rail fares increase

British Rail and London Underground fares rise by varying amounts,
according to the route and service provider.

MEASURES THAT CAME INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1 1996

Public procurement deal

Public sector procurement contracts worth several hundred billion
dollars a year were opened to international competition when a new
World Trade Organisation accord came into force. The 24 signatories
include the 15 members of the European Union, the US, Canada, Japan and
South Korea.

US bill on lobbying

A ban on gifts for politicians in Congress came into force. Senators
can only accept gifts worth less than Dollars 50, with exemptions for
home-state products and foodstuffs. House of Representatives members
are allowed nothing, although there are 23 exemptions including
home-state products, T-shirts and baseball caps. Lobbyists must
disclose full details of their activities.

Italy holds EU presidency

Italy assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union,
with the prime task of inaugurating the Inter-Governmental Conferences
(IGCs) on the future of the EU. The presidency risks being overshadowed
by Italy's political instability and a general election.

Lamberto Dini, prime minister, has argued strongly that he should
remain in office to ensure the government is able to concentrate on the
presidency.

Britain takes over WEU

The UK took over the presidency of the Western European Union, a
10-nation defence club. Britain has pledged to take a pragmatic
approach to upgrading the WEU, with some improvements in its capacity
to anticipate and handle crises but with no question of its
compromising Nato's role as Europe's main security institution.

EU-Turkey customs union

A customs union between the European Union and Turkey came into effect
with the removal of remaining trade barriers. This followed a vote in
the European parliament in December, in which the move was approved by
343 to 149, with 36 abstentions. There had been concern about Turkey's
human rights record.

EU finance directives

The EU Investment Services Directive, and the accompanying capital
adequacy directive, were both implemented. The directives aim to give
EU investment firms a 'passport' to trade in all member states if they
are authorised in one.

The CAD also introduces European Union-wide rules for banks and
securities firms to set aside capital to cover risks in securities
trading. These are in addition to international rules covering lending
risks run by banks.

Telecoms competition

Cable TV, utility, rail and other 'alternative' networks throughout the
EU were allowed to use their infrastructure to offer telecom services.
Mobile operators were permitted to build their own networks and
directly connect to other mobile operators.

French income tax rise

An additional 0.5 per cent tax charge was introduced on all revenues in
an attempt to correct the country's accumulated social security
deficit.

German tax changes

Tax cuts and other changes took effect which should leave Germans
nearly DM20bn (Dollars 13.8bn) better off this year. Tax-free
allowances were brought into line with poverty-level incomes, more than
doubling the level of income permitted before tax to just over DM12,000
a year.

Consumers will also benefit from the elimination of the 'coal pfennig',
which was previously added to electricity bills to help pay for the use
of German coal in power stations. However, these savings - amounting to
about DM27bn this year - will be offset partly by DM7.5bn higher
contributions to pensions and insurance funds.

Deutsche Telekom tariffs

Germany's state-owned telephone company, due for partial privatisation
later this year, introduced changes to bring its tariffs more in line
with market demands. Long-distance calls will become cheaper and local
calls, which have been kept artificially cheap for decades, more
expensive. Business clients can also choose from three different
discounts of up to 24 per cent.

British alcohol tax cut

The tax on fortified wine, such as sherry and port, was reduced by 12p
for a typical 75cl bottle.

UK copyright extended

Copyright on music and literature was extended from 50 to 70 years,
implementing an EU directive of October 1993. Although virtually all
member (and non-member) states adhered to the 50-year rule, the EU
followed Germany, where royalty payments last 70 years. Britain will
now be out of step with other English-speaking countries, which will be
able to produce cheap editions 20 years earlier.

The change is retrospective, bringing back into copyright works by
artists who died between 1925 and 1945, including the composers Edward
Elgar and Gustav Holst, and writers Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of
Sherlock Holmes, Kenneth Grahame, author of Wind in the Willows, Thomas
Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, DH Lawrence, and Beatrix Potter.

Income tax back in Cuba

Cuba, which abolished personal taxes as a 'capitalist evil' after the
1959 revolution, reintroduced income tax on hard currency earnings. The
government also introduced a tax on boats - whatever their size - and
road tolls on two highways leading to tourist centres.

SOCCER CLUBS IN EGYPT WINOVER TV FEES: GOVERNMENT PITCHES IN TO BOOST
ROYALTIES

   By JAMES WHITTINGTON

It was not quite the kind of negotiations Rupert Murdoch or Kerry
Packer might be used to, but for Egypt's football clubs earlier this
month it was quite something to score against the state television
monopoly.

Cairo's two most popular soccer teams last month banned state
television from broadcasting their matches after a row over royalties,
forcing the government to intervene in their favour.

The Egyptian government has long been ultra-cautious about allowing
market forces to unsettle the country's protected state sector. But
when it came to football, two senior ministers readily made the
necessary concessions.

In the Egyptian football calendar, the highlights of the season are the
matches between Cairo rivals Ahli and Zamalek.

These succeed in emptying the city's streets and push TV ratings way
past the most gripping soap operas.

Facing financial difficulties, the two teams astonished many Egyptians
by putting aside their rivalry on the pitch to take on the powerful
Radio and Television Union which for years has benefited from its
monopoly on domestic broadcasts by refusing to negotiate fees for
televising matches.

The clubs' financial problems began after the 1990 World Cup in Italy,
when the football federation urged clubs to turn professional and sign
contracts with players.

This led to fierce competition to sign the best footballers which
pushed up transfer fees and forced club directors to look more closely
at their finances.

In August, it became obvious that something had to give when Zamalek
paid a record EPounds 600,000 (Dollars 177,000) for Egypt's highest
goal scorer, Ahmed el-Kas.

'Faced with this kind of costs, to keep a first class team we had to
start thinking seriously about our finances,' explained Mr Adly
el-Kee'i, manager of Ahli.

'Before we just worried about winning our matches but suddenly we had
to think about our performance in terms of profits and losses. We
needed more income and the television rights seemed an obvious
candidate for change.'

At the start of the season in September negotiations between the soccer
clubs and the RTU on broadcasting fees were not going well.

The clubs complained that the fees, which are always paid to the home
side, were not only too low but also depressed gate earnings because
fans would stay at home to watch the matches live on television.
Demands for a better arrangement, however, were given short shrift.

'The (Radio and Television Union) is not a bank,' Mr Amin Bassiouni,
president of the RTU, was reported as saying. 'We are not responsible
for the soccer clubs' financial problems.'

On November 5, to break the deadlock, Ahli, the national champions,
took the unprecedented step of banning TV cameras from its matches.
Attendances rose three-fold, and the club said it earned more from gate
receipts than the previous television fee structure.

With the first goal scored, Zamalek quickly followed suit.

Caught offside and facing the wrath of Egypt's football fans, the
state-run broadcasters quickly called on the government to act as
referee.

The deputy prime minister, Mr Kamal el-Ganzouri, and the information
minister, Mr Safwat el-Sherif, were put on the case.

As the weeks went by and Ahli and Zamalek stayed off the screens,
football fans became more and more restless, with the local press
firmly in favour of the clubs.

With the pressure on, the RTU backed down, and the government stepped
in to provide the extra money.

A three-year contract which came into force on Saturday, will double
the clubs' earnings - EPounds 200,000 for matches between Ahli and
Zamalek and EPounds 150,000 for other matches.

'We're very, very happy, it shows we were right to stand up and fight,'
said Mr Ali Osman, chairman of Zamalek.

JAMAICA PONDERS AN ECONOMIC VICTORY OF SORTS

   By CANUTE JAMES

The custodians of Jamaica's truculent economy are celebrating a
victory, of sorts.

After 18 years of mainly acrimonious relations with the International
Monetary Fund, the island has ceased to be a borrowing member. With
foreign reserves covering three months of imports, government officials
are claiming that the new status with the IMF is a victory for the
administration's management of the economy.

Others are not so sure. The victory for Jamaica is pyrrhic, and the IMF
can claim a win in getting Jamaica to implement its structural
adjustment policies, say the government's critics. They point to
continuing currency instability and to billowing inflation. Businessmen
complain that high interest rates - a government tool for damping
demand and reducing pressure on the exchange rate - are driving them
out of business.

'After 18 years and being in a relationship with the IMF it must
reflect that we have managed effectively the macro economy,' said Mr
Percival Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. 'I am not concerned
whether the IMF will claim some credit. My greater satisfaction is that
the economic situation is such that we do not need to borrow from them
and that we can take our own economic choices in accordance with our
sovereign judgments.'

There are no victors in this, said Mr Delroy Lindsay, president of the
Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica. 'This appears to be a draw.
Jamaica has made progress in structurally adjusting the economy, but it
still has a far way to go. Inflation is too high, interest rates are
too high and there is little growth.'

Jamaica's relations with the IMF is a litany of repeated and protracted
negotiations, agreements reluctantly implemented by successive
governments because they were politically unpopular. IMF agreements
became synonymous with the deterioration of the economy as governments
fulminated against the Fund's conditions for the structural adjustment
of the economy.

But the end to Jamaica's borrowing from the Fund has not coincided with
any indication that the persistently wayward economy is settling down.

After 18 months of relative stability, the currency has depreciated by
16.5 per cent since July after a decline in foreign currency flows to
banks. The central bank was forced to intervene by selling from its
reserves. Economic expansion has been sluggish at just under one per
cent in 1994. Mr Omar Davies, the finance minister, says 1995 is likely
to have resulted in more of the same. 'Growth will not be spectacular,
but it will be positive,' he said.

Mr Davies rejects suggestions that the economy is stagnant. 'We are
having lower levels of growth than we expected,' he said. 'This is not
stagnation but low growth.' The finance minister has done the
unthinkable in Jamaican politics by publicly admitting to making errors
which contributed to the current uncertainty in the business climate.

The prospects for Jamaica are limited and clear, economists and
business leaders concur. A reversal of the deregulation would be
damaging. 'The government has done well in the macro-economic policies,
but its management of some aspects has been inadequate,' said Mr
Lindsay. 'Interest rates must come down, the currency allowed to find
its own level, inflation will be lower and all other things will fall
into place.'

OBSERVER: FOOD FOR THOUGHT


Hush. Egon Ronay, the Hungarian-born restaurant critic, has been
touring the eateries of Europe's four major international airports and
is not impressed. The great man, who penned The Unforgettable Dishes of
My Life, has collected more than enough material for a sequel.

Amsterdam's Schiphol comes bottom in Ronay's airport league table,
getting just one out of 10 for its catering quality. 'Anybody who eats
at Amsterdam airport needs to have his head and palate examined. It is
below criticism,' says Ronay. Paris's Charles de Gaulle is not much
better, scoring two out of 10. Frankfurt gets four out of 10, but Ronay
was still far from impressed.

Britain's Heathrow airport comes out tops, with the quality of its
chips and coffee getting a special mention. However, one word of
caution about the survey. Ronay was hired by the British Airports
Authority to undertake the exercise.

What's that they say about the customer always being right?

100 YEARS AGO: AMERICAN FINANCE


All the cables from New York reflect the feeling of relief which has
pervaded financial and commercial circles on the reported successful
negotiations for placing further Government bonds. Nothing could be
more significant than this of the low ebb to which the credit of the
United States has fallen. That it was a little better than had been
anticipated in some quarters after the publication of President
Cleveland's Message is not saying much. A workman who falls from a
scaffold may congratulate himself upon the fact that he has broken only
one leg instead of two, but the blessing is of the comparative order,
and the case of the United States is somewhat analogous to this.

The typical British car has limited passenger room, but is highly
suitable for British conditions, which are an amalgam of slow speeds,
short distances and smooth surfaces. But it is not, in itself, well
adapted for the vast spaces of continental travelling and the
roughnesses of colonial roads. Meanwhile, the mass-produced American
car meets colonial and continental conditions admirably.

COMPANY NEWS (THIS MONTH): PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH TO LEAD TO STRONG
EARNINGS - US RESULTS

   By MAGGIE URRY

US investors are looking forward to some good news this month as most
companies start reporting their 1995 earnings figures. Throughout the
year, the quarterly numbers have produced pleasant surprises, with
results often beating analysts' estimates, writes Maggie Urry.

Corporate America has gone through rapid productivity growth in recent
years, which has meant that even in 1995, with profits rising sharply,
companies were still laying off workers and taking large restructuring
charges.

Analysts prefer to look at the 'operating earnings', excluding one-off
charges. Forecasters expect the S&P 500 companies to announce earnings
per share totalling about Dollars 38 per share compared with Dollars 32
in 1994, a rise of nearly 20 per cent.

Particularly strong earnings gains are expected from cyclical sectors
such as aluminium, paper and pulp, and chemicals. Also well ahead will
be technology groups. However, some of these, such as semiconductor
makers, issued warnings on profits for the final quarter as sales
growth weakened and prices came under pressure.

Weaker figures are expected from some of the consumer non-durables
groups, such as the tobacco and restaurants sectors. In February, poor
results are due from retailers.

ARGENTINE CONGRESS URGED TO SPEED LAWS

   By MATTHEW DOMAN

   BUENOS AIRES


The Argentine government is stepping up pressure on the nation's
Congress to approve key economic legislation early in the new year.
Legislators failed to vote on two important measures in extraordinary
sessions held this week.

Debate on the measures - a presidential request for additional taxing
and budget-trimming powers and a bill to advance reform of
federal-provincial government relations - was again suspended late on
Thursday evening after opposition members of the lower house of
Congress withdrew from the chamber. Their walk-out denied the chamber a
quorum and pushed consideration of the bills into January.

The government is now insisting that extraordinary congressional
sessions be extended as far as February to win approval of the measures
it argues are critical to repairing the nation's finances in 1996.
Argentina's Congress normally takes a long southern summer recess over
the months of December, January and February.

The measure considered to be the most important is President Carlos
Menem's request for extraordinary powers to cut expenditure and raise
taxes without congressional approval. The government argues that the
proposed 'superpowers' are necessary to ensure that the 1996 budget is
balanced and International Monetary Fund fiscal targets are met.

The second major measure, the ambitiously titled Reform of the State
legislation, aims to streamline financial relations between the
national government in Buenos Aires and the country's 23 provinces.

The federal government argues that elimination of duplication of
services in the two tiers of government could save up to Dollars 1.5bn
a year but is reluctant to confirm that efficiency measures may see the
loss of up to 20,000 state sector jobs.

The congressional backlog was cleared somewhat earlier this week when
the upper house of Congress, the Senate, approved the 1996 budget law
and a hotly debated measure to increase taxes on tobacco products.

Argentine financial markets have maintained a firm tone in thin
holiday-season trade this week, and investors appear content to give
Congress some additional leeway to approve the government-sponsored
measures.

Economist Raul Buonuome of ING Barings said the markets were willing to
accept that the Senate might not sign-off on the measures until March
but had expected lower house approval this week.

ISRAEL HAILS 'CONSTRUCTIVE' ATTITUDE FROM SYRIANS

   By PATTI WALDMEIR

   WASHINGTON


Israel and Syria yesterday extended negotiations into the weekend as
the two sides took cautious steps towards peace in informal talks at a
secluded venue where they were able to start to form the sort of
personal relationships essential to any peace deal.

Each side sent three negotiators to the talks, held in the elegant
ambiance of the Aspen Institute's Wye Plantation conference centre
outside Washington.

Mr Uri Savir, director-general of the Israeli foreign ministry and a
crucial negotiator of the Israel-Palestinian peace accord, headed the
Israeli team. The Syrian chief negotiator is Mr Walid Moualem,
ambassador to Washington and a confidant of Syrian president Hafez
al-Assad. They were joined by four representatives of the US
government, whose presence is viewed by both sides as crucial to
mediate a deal. That team is headed by Mr Dennis Ross, state department
Middle East co-ordinator.

Convinced secrecy is essential to progress, all parties imposed a news
blackout. But an Israeli embassy spokesman in Washington stressed the
'positive atmosphere' of the talks.

'Very good personal contacts' were made, with negotiators from both
sides holding 'a lot of small talks' in the corridors and when they
dined together.

Given the intense distrust which exists between Israel and Syria any
improvement in the atmosphere must be progress. And Israeli sources
noted a new, more constructive attitude from the Syrians.

Analysts point out that the intentions of President Assad are
notoriously difficult to decipher, as he seldom travels to the west and
runs a closed and secretive government.

But they believe he may have concluded that the time is now ripe for
peace.

The assassination of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin has
highlighted the strength of the anti-peace movement in Israel, which
may persuade Mr Assad that his best interests lie in making a deal with
the current Israeli government rather than having to deal with a
future, potentially more hostile one.

Mr Assad is also keen to remove Syria from the list of countries denied
certain economic benefits from the US because of their alleged support
for terrorism.

SUBSIDY WILL HAVE TO EXCEED DOLLARS 300M: NUCLEAR PRIVATISATION:
DECOMMISSIONING MAY LAST MORE THAN 100 YEARS

   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor

The government is likely to have to provide several hundred million
pounds for a special fund to pay for cleaning up nuclear power station
sites after next year's privatisation of the industry. The fund will
also have to be given tax-exempt status.

Advisers in the City of London are working on the structure of the
segregated fund which was announced earlier this month by Mr Tim Eggar,
the energy minister. The fund would be managed by an independent trust
to ensure money was available to decommission power stations over a
period that could last more than 100 years. The fund will have to be
endowed with an initial cash amount of between Pounds 200m (Dollars
312m) and Pounds 300m. This sum would be increased using earnings from
British Energy, the privatised company, to meet decommissioning
liabilities. However, contributions would come out of the company's
taxed income. So the trust itself would have to be exempt from tax to
avoid double taxation.

The size of the trust's liabilities is still being calculated. The fund
would be responsible only for long-term decommissioning - monitoring
sites while disused reactors 'cooled down' and eventually dismantling
them after 135 years. The larger costs of the first stage of
decommissioning a power station, including removal of spent fuel and
contaminated components, would be paid for by British Energy, which
would also bear the risk of a power station being shut down before
adequate provisions had been built up.

British Energy will also be directly responsible for disposing of spent
fuel, which represents the largest part of its total liabilities,
estimated at Pounds 6bn.

The initial finance for the fund could either be provided by the
government or raised through a loan from the private sector. But the
government has been told that it should provide the finance itself
because a loan would only reduce the potential sale price of British
Energy.

Another important decision will be the discount rate used to calculate
the size of provisions made by British Energy to meet its liabilities.
Present estimates have been based on the 6 per cent rate used by the
Treasury. The nuclear industry uses 2 per cent, which means that larger
provisions have to be made to reach the target.

The government's Department of Trade and Industry is expected soon to
publish details of the capital structure of British Energy.

SHOPPERS STABBED


A store worker ran amok with three knives yesterday and stabbed 10
people. The man marched through the aisles at the Netto store in
Bordesley Green in the English Midlands city of Birmingham, attacking
shoppers and staff. Two men and a woman were later stable in hospital.
Seven other people including a 13-year-old boy suffered less serious
wounds. A man was arrested outside the store by unarmed police.

OVERSEAS NEWS:
AILING KING FAHD HANDS OVER POWER TO SAUDI PRINCE: MOVE ENDS
SPECULATION OVER SUCCESSION BUT FUELS DOUBT ON RULER'S HEALTH

   By ROULA KHALAF, Middle East Correspondent

Saudi Arabia's King Fahd handed over the running of the government
yesterday to his half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah, in a development
likely to raise further doubts about the king's health but end
speculation about succession in the kingdom.

A royal order carried by the official Saudi Press Agency said the
73-year-old monarch, who is believed to have suffered a minor stroke
last November, was handing over 'management of government affairs' to
the crown prince while he recuperates.

Prince Abdullah, who is two years younger than the king, is deputy
prime minister and head of the powerful 57,000-man National Guard. He
is seen as more conservative and less internationally minded than the
king, though diplomats said he was unlikely to change the kingdom's
foreign and economic policies.

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter, and a close ally of
the US. The decree said the prince would take over while the king
enjoyed 'rest and recuperation'.

The decision makes official a role the prince has played since the king
fell ill.

Although he will officially now chair cabinet meetings and represent
the king on official visits, the move may prove temporary if the king's
health improves, diplomats said yesterday.

'It sounds more like a technical move, a kind of regency,' said one
diplomat in the kingdom. 'The king is still king. What we don't know is
how much he will still be involved and this will depend on his health.'

The king left hospital on December 8 after suffering what was
officially termed a 'sudden indisposition' but is known to have been a
stroke.

Diabetic and overweight, King Fahd was seen on television yesterday
aided by a walking stick as he received Crown Prince Abdullah and
Prince Sultan, the defence minister.

Saudi officials yesterday suggested the move was aimed at putting an
end to speculation of a power struggle within the kingdom.

The talk had been fuelled in recent months by two big shocks. The first
was the monarch's illness, the second a car bomb on November 13 which
destroyed a US-staffed Saudi National Guard communications centre in
Riyadh, the capital. the

Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the regime have latched on to these
events from their base in London and claimed a power struggle has
broken out in the royal family.

They viewed the bomb attack on the national guards as an attempt to
undermine Crown Prince Abdullah.

Yesterday's move preceded the unveiling of Saudi Arabia's 1996 budget.
Early indications suggested the kingdom would continue public sector
retrenchment, maintaining expenditures at SR150bn (Dollars 25.7bn), the
same as in 1995.

Faced with a cash crunch resulting from the collapse of oil prices and
the cost of the 1990-91 Gulf war, Saudi Arabia has since 1994 embarked
on a policy of cutting government expenditures and raising non-oil
revenues.

TORIES BRACED FOR MINORITY GOVERNMENT: SENIOR MINISTERS ADMIT MAJOR MAY
LOSE COMMONS MAJORITY BEFORE END OF 1996

   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby Correspondent

Government ministers yesterday contemplated the probability that Mr
John Major will lead a minority administration later this year, amid
fears that the Conservatives can expect to lose more seats in the House
of Commons.

As left and rightwing Tories indulged in mutual recriminations over the
recent defection of Miss Emma Nicholson, MP for Devon West and
Torridge, to the Liberal Democrats, senior ministers privately admitted
that the government could expect to lose its Commons majority before
the end of 1996 - and that it may rely for survival on the support of
the nine Ulster Unionist MPs.

Ministers played down claims by one left-of-centre Tory that at least
six other MPs were prepared to defect to opposition parties. Yet
several admitted that by-elections triggered by the deaths of MPs would
put the Tories into a Commons minority this year. The departure of Miss
Nicholson means the government can now expect two pending by-elections
to cut its Commons majority to just one, if Sir Richard Body, who
remains outside the Tory whip, is excluded from calculations.

However, despite increasing signs that his party may have to rely on
their support in any No Confidence motion, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland secretary, insisted there would be 'no special treatment' for
the UUP.

'I recognise no difference in the essential equation by reason of
events in the last few days or even a longer period,' he told BBC Radio
4's Today programme.

Other ministers, however, were already contemplating the need for
concessions to the UUP, with one privately conceding that relations
with the Ulster parties would be 'critical' to the government's
fortunes.

Calculations about the government's majority coincided with signs that
the delicate truce between left and rightwing Tories appeared to be
tottering in the wake of the defection.

Mr Michael Portillo, defence secretary, launched a strong attack on
Miss Nicholson, rubbishing her claims that the reason for her defection
had been the party's shift to the right.

'It is very silly to say that the party has tilted to the right - that
is completely incredible,' he told BBC radio. 'I think the party is
probably much the same. We have a broad breadth of opinion within the
party.'

Mr John Redwood, last year's beaten Tory leadership challenger, also
attacked the idea of a rightward shift by the government, claiming Mr
Major's cabinet reshuffle last July had promoted left of centre MPs.

However, Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister, rounded on Mr
Portillo, claiming the party had clearly taken an anti-European stance
and that Miss Nicholson's defection should be heeded. 'There is no
doubt at all that the party has moved to the right,' he said. 'That
can't be denied . . . it may be denied, but if it is denied it is a
false denial.'

Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a pro-European backbencher, also demanded a
halt to the 'torrent of personal abuse' heaped on Miss Nicholson and
called on ministers to rise above the warfare between the party's
wings.

'I would just like them to behave as if they were one cabinet, visible
for all to see and not in such a way where undoubtedly the unhappiness
produced has led to two defections in three months. We cannot afford
any more and I trust we will not have any more,' he said. Tory warning,

UK NEWS:
TAX SELF-ASSESSMENT WILL HIT SMALL BUSINESS, SAYS LABOUR

   By JAMES BLITZ

The Treasury's plan to allow self-employed managers of small businesses
to assess their own income tax liabilities will come under a strong
attack from the Labour party this week amid claims that it will add
significantly to company costs.

Labour claims self-assessment will place new burdens on small
businesses running into hundreds of millions of pounds. It estimates
the scheme will create extra recurrent costs of Pounds 130m to Pounds
250m a year for self-employed business managers and mean big increases
in red tape.

Mr Andrew Smith, Labour's shadow chief secretary, is also concerned the
scheme contains a 'hidden tax bombshell'. He said yesterday the
introduction of self-assessment later this year would increase the
Treasury's tax take by some Pounds 850m in 1997-98.

Labour is expected to raise its objections to the scheme in the Commons
on Thursday when the Finance Bill is published.

Mr Smith said the increase in tax revenue would occur because the
self-employed would make their assessments next year on the basis of
current-year activities rather than those for the previous year.

Because of anticipated increases in inflation and economic growth, the
change to current-year assessment would allow the Treasury to take more
in tax from the self-employed.

'While the principle of self-assessment makes sense, the way the
government is going about it on the current deadlines is a disaster,'
said Mr Smith.

He revealed that Labour would call for aspects of self-assessment to be
delayed to avoid confusion.

But Mr Smith would give no guarantee that Labour would abandon the
self-assessment plans, arguing that a new government might create new
difficulties by reversing changes of such magnitude.

A spokesman for the Inland Revenue confirmed that the government would
receive the additional Pounds 850m in 1997-98. But he said it was a
'one-off shift' that would not be repeated in future years.

'Overall, self-assessment amounts to a clearer system with more
definite deadlines - and one which people will find easier to operate,'
he said.

UK NEWS:
WALDEGRAVE GETS TOUGH ON SPENDING TO FINANCE TAX CUTS

   By ROBERT PESTON, Political editor

Remorseless pressure to bring down UK public spending to finance next
year's widely expected tax cuts has been promised by Mr William
Waldegrave, chief secretary to the Treasury, in a new year interview.

The chief secretary said he had a long-term aim of seeing public
spending fall to around 35 per cent of gross domestic product, compared
to about 42 per cent at present.

He said this should not be seen 'against the background of a slavish
target of numbers' but because of a 'genuine belief that too much is
done (by government) and a good deal of it is act-ually hindering the
economy'.

His views on the potential for shrinking the government's share of the
economy are strikingly different from those of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, who is not persuaded that there is scope to get the
proportion much below 40 per cent of GDP without damaging public
services.

There is also a significant difference between Mr Waldegrave and Mr
Clarke on European monetary union. Mr Clarke believes that the decision
to participate in a single currency is primarily an economic one.
However, Mr Waldegrave said the decision to join was primarily 'an act
of political will and choice'.

He also hinted that Mr John Major's successful campaign to persuade the
EU to study the implications of two-tier monetary union - with only a
small minority of countries joining the proposed single currency - is
motivated by a desire to delay the project.

'I do think that it is possible to imagine technical questions which
will be raised which will worry those who are going in very much,' Mr
Waldegrave said. 'The damage from a badly established union will be
quite considerable.'

The chief secretary also made it clear that he will contest any
criticism he may face in the Scott report on arms sales to

Iraq, due to be published in the next few weeks. Leaked drafts of the
report criticised Mr Waldegrave for failing as a Foreign Office
minister in the late 1980s to announce an apparent softening in the
government's policy on the arms embargo with Iraq.

Mr Waldegrave, who has made further submissions to Lord Justice Scott,
said: 'My conscience is entirely clear.' He would only consider
resigning if he could be persuaded that his 'memory of the whole
business is so wrong'.

He added that it would not only be his memory that was at fault but
that of 'the whole Foreign Office'.

On next year's public expenditure negotiations, he said he would start
visiting ministries with a view to securing cuts in the early spring.

One of the initial targets of his scrutiny will be the Pounds 15bn cost
to government of public bodies at arm's length from ministries and
quangos. He said he was looking for savings of several hundred million
pounds in their running costs. He will also maintain pressure on
spending departments to substitute private finance for
government-financed capital projects. 'In terms of extra cash flow
there is probably more to come from that,' he said.

His other target will be to step up the government's fight against
fraud, especially in the social security budget.

CHIRAC CONCEDES DIALOGUE NEEDED ON REFORMS

   By ANDREW JACK in Paris

   PARIS


Mr Jacques Chirac, the French president, made a sharp break with the
practice of his predecessor, Mr Francois Mitterrand, on Sunday night by
raising the political content of the country's traditional New Year's
Eve address from its head of state.

In an address lasting nearly 15 minutes and broadcast on most
television news channels, Mr Chirac devoted much of his time to
defending his decisions over the last few months and how they tied in
to his election campaign promises.

He made patriotic play of France's historical mission and global
importance, and its continued commitment to brotherhood, tolerance and
justice.

Referring to the widespread strike action since last November, which
was prompted by his government's proposed social security reforms, he
called the resulting period one of 'crisis'.

In his strongest statement of support for Mr Alain Juppe, he praised
the 'courage and determination' of the prime minister, as well as the
rest of the government.

However, in a sign of implicit criticism, he said that one lesson to be
drawn from the experience was the need for greater dialogue and
consultation - something which he acknowledged had not been
characteristic of France in the past.

Another lesson - in a jibe at his political predecessors - was that 'it
is no longer possible to govern as we have for the last 20 years' with
only piecemeal reforms. He stressed the need for a country able to cope
with 'global competition'.

He said his aim remained to build a 'new France' based on justice,
unity and resonsibility, and his top priority remained to reduce
unemployment - which remains at more than 11.5 per cent.

He placed less emphasis than in a previous television interview last
October on fiscal rigour, but talked about the need to set up a
creative, productive economy. He pledged that taxes - which have risen
since his election - would be cut as soon as possible.

President Chirac made time to discuss the French commitment to Europe -
a point brought home by the EU's flag hanging alongside that of his own
country on the wall behind him.

However, he also stressed the need for change in the administration of
the EU so that it was 'more attentive' to the daily needs of the
French, including their 'social hopes' and the 'real priority' of
employment.

OVERSEAS NEWS:
BEACON FOR EMERGING DEMOCRACY


Democracy can be a baffling business. In Soviet times, Russia's voters
could vote for only one party whose political philosophy was force-fed
to them from birth. In last month's parliamentary elections they had a
choice of 43 parties with each one claiming to have the only answer to
Russia's woes.

Such a drastic democratic upheaval has clearly left many Russians
bewildered and may help explain why more than one-fifth of them opted
for the familiar and voted for the return of the Communists. But the
elections also proved an education for Russia's political leaders who
are now scrambling to learn the lessons before the all-important
presidential elections scheduled in six months' time.

The Magnitogorsk Worker, the local newspaper for the Urals industrial
town founded as part of Stalin's industrialisation drive, encapsulated
many of the confusions and controversies that came to dominate the
campaign. In so doing it reflected, in microcosm, the social pain and
ideological uncertainties that continue to bedevil Russia.

The newspaper, founded in 1930 and still proudly bearing a Soviet
emblem on its front page urging the proletariat of the world to unite,
provided full, lively, and generally fair coverage of the campaign,
encouraging those who see the media as an important factor in the
development of a healthy civil society.

Like most of Russia's local newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker could
have been under enormous pressure from many quarters. The list of six
parliamentary candidates for the city seat included the deputy head of
the local administration and a director of the steel combine which
employs 60,000 workers and dominates the region's economy.

But Mr Georgy Tikhonov, the chief editor, argued that the newspaper's
role was simply to provide an objective forum for the debate and
encourage readers to participate in the vote. 'This newspaper does not
agitate for or against particular candidates. . . it agitates for
something else: for the widest possibility for people to discuss openly
one or another candidacy and the course of the campaign itself. Read,
think, and make your choice]' the newspaper stated.

In comparison with most western newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker
provided few reports and opinions from its journalists but carried
extensive personal contributions from the candidates and scores of
letters from its readers.

Mr Alexander Pochinok, the incumbent deputy who represented the then
pro-government Russia's Choice party in the previous vote in 1993, was
the dominant figure in the campaign for one of Russia's 225
directly-elected seats.

Although he supported the government's harsh monetary policies which
many critics blamed for Russia's social ills, Mr Pochinok boldly
launched his campaign by concentrating on social problems and promising
to improve the lot of the elderly.

But his attempt to seize the mantle of social concern was fiercely
contested by the Communist candidate who wrote an emotional tirade
against the government's policies and promised a restoration of the
certainties of the Soviet era.

These themes were echoed in the opinions of the newspapers' readers who
expressed impassioned and disparate views.

'During the war, millions were evacuated here and resettled. They were
given work and a roof but now they have been thrown out. Every honest
person will vote for the Communists,' said one.

'I do not want to return to the miserable plague-stricken camp of the
past but I fear the thorny road forward to civilisation,' commented
another.

One reader planned not participate in the elections at all given they
were merely a 'political spectacle distracting the country from its
true problems' while another con demned the newspaper itself for giving
too much space to the 'so-called democrats'.

The Magnitogorsk Worker made clear it was aware of some dirty electoral
tactics during the campaign but did not identify who was responsible
for them in order not to prejudice opinions. In the week before the
vote, it carried an item about a pensioner who had been contacted by
someone claiming to represent the local telephone company. 'Vote
correctly and your telephone bill will be paid in advance for a year,'
the mysterious caller promised.

On the eve of the elections, the newspaper urged its readers to go to
the polls although it recognised that many voters were still confused
by the extraordinary range of parties on the ballot paper.

The results were slow to trickle in and the Magnitogorsk Worker did not
publish the preliminary outcome until three days after the poll. The
electors of Magnitogorsk had returned the pro-market Mr Pochinok as
their local candidate but they had also lodged a strong protest vote
backing Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic
party and the Communists in the simultaneous ballot for the seats
assigned on the basis of proportional representation.

In all, 39 parties - including Russia's Choice - failed to garner more
than the 5 per cent of the vote required to win any of the 225 seats in
the 450-strong parliament allocated by proportional representation. Mr
Pochinok, for example, has been elected as a representative of a party
which will be unable to form its own faction in parliament.

One voter told the newspaper: 'Voting is most democratic. But you must
write that Hitler also came to power in Germany by democratic means. We
must go forward to the presidential elections but people must be
vigilant.'

SCALFARO SEEKS CLARITY ON POLLS

   By ROBERT GRAHAM in Rome

   ROME


President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has appealed to Italy's political
parties to come forward with clear ideas on how long the government of
Mr Lamberto Dini should last and to give a firm calendar for the life
of the current parliament.

The head of state's appeal was contained in his annual message
delivered on New Year's eve.

The highly political message was delivered in advance of this week's
meeting of the parliamentary group leaders to fix the terms of a debate
on the future of the government following the resignation tendered last
Saturday by Mr Dini, the prime minister.

As expected President Scalfaro rejected the resignation, insisting
parliament must decide. In his message, President Scalfaro reinforced
this point. 'In a few days the debate in the chamber of deputies will
provide the right opportunity to know precisely what the various
political groups want and to see whether a consensus emerges that is
both clear to the general public and useful to the head of state.'

The debate is likely to be staged next week, allowing further time for
the political leaders to negotiate behind the scenes. Until now none of
the main political parties has come forward with a proposal either for
the continuance of the Dini government or a date for general elections.

But Mr Dini, who has been in close touch with the main party leaders,
appeared confident over the weekend that he would remain in office.
Backed by President Scalfaro, he has argued strongly that the country
cannot afford a government crisis and a general election during Italy's
six-month presidency of the European Union which lasts until June.

Despite underlining the importance of parliament, the tone throughout
President Scalfaro's 35-minute New Year's message was of a man who
intended to use his limited constitutional powers to the full. He made
his own preferences plain.

He went out of his way to praise the 11 month premiership of Mr Dini -
so indicating his desire to see the former deputy director of the Bank
of Italy remain at the helm during Italy's EU presidency. He also said
he would like to see the current legislature carry out a proper reform
of the constitution in time for the celebration in 1998 of the 50th
anniversary of its introduction. This was seen as a none too subtle
hint that parliament should not be dissolved before institutional
reform has been tackled.

Yesterday several political parties took exception to what they
regarded as President Scalfaro's overtly partisan stance. In particular
the president's message was attacked by the rightwing National
Alliance, by the Greens and by Reconstructed Communism, which was
formed from the hardline members of the former Communist party.

PARTIES WEIGH UP RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

Political decisions in Italy are rarely made in a hurry.

No one wishes to assume the responsibility - and risk - of the first
move. This is why the politicians will take their time in deciding the
fate of Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's government even though they have
had ample notice of the administration's limited duration.

Mr Dini tendered his resignation on Saturday to President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, after approving an additional financial package for the 1996
budget. This was his last self-appointed task.

President Scalfaro has now thrown the responsibility back to parliament
to decide what should happen next. This will take the form of a
parliamentary debate later this week or early next week.

Having acquired a taste of power over the last 11 months, Mr Dini is
more than willing to stay on. Moreover, President Scalfaro, who has the
final say on a date for the next general election, is clearly anxious
the former director general of the Bank of Italy should remain in
office.

President Scalfaro believes it is too late for a big political shake-up
now that Italy has the responsibility (since January 1) of the
presidency of the European Union. He thus wants Mr Dini to remain prime
minister - probably with a revamped cabinet - for the duration of the
six-month presidency. But this seems to be part of a broader strategy
by Mr Scalfaro, a former Christian Democrat interior minister, to allow
parliament to survive until 1997, thus permitting more time for a
recreation of the centre grouping which dominated post-war Italian
politics until 1992.

The parliamentary debate is expected to focus on three broad scenarios:

* Mr Dini heads the government to ensure a stable EU presidency and
permit elections around June.

* Mr Dini presides over a caretaker government with elections held in
late February or early March.

* A broad-based government is formed lasting up to two years to permit
a programme of big institutional reforms.

The first scenario involves several variations. For instance, Mr Dini
could seek to maintain the backing of the centre-left parties, headed
by the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) who supported his government
of non-parliamentarians all last year. This would provide a fragile
majority in parliament unless a prior understanding was reached with
the rightwing alliance headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime
minister. The government would be little more than a caretaker, while
the parties indulged in a six-month election campaign.

Alternatively Mr Dini, who has no political base of his own, could try
to broaden the backing for the government to include the small centre
parties in the rightwing alliance. This would have the advantage of
lessening the exposure of the centre-left as the government's main
backer and would provide some chance of parliament pushing through a
few reforms in the next few months. It would also help offset the
destabilising effect of the populist Northern League, which, with
almost 80 deputies, retains considerable power to swing votes.

The second scenario is straight-forward and would mean parliament being
dissolved shortly after the debate on the government's future. Mr Dini
would remain in office but with no real executive power. Given that it
normally takes a good six weeks to two months to form a government
after an election, Italy would be without an effective administration
probably until May.

The third scenario is the most complex. At a minimum it would require a
commitment from the PDS, some of the centre parties and the bulk of Mr
Berlusconi's rightwing alliance to back the idea of carrying out over
the next two years important institutional reforms such as
strengthening the prime minister's position and ending the duplication
of the bicameral system. This would be done either by allowing a
'technical' government to continue as the executive while a special
bicameral commission was formed to draw up the reforms; or a new
government would be formed, drawing ministers from the parties
supporting it. The onus would then be on the government to draw up the
reforms.

Mr Berlusconi has been exploring this idea of a broad-based government
over the Christmas break. His scheduled trial later this month for
corruption probably played a part in his change of mind. But the PDS is
sceptical of his chances, and the rightwing National Alliance (AN), his
main ally, is openly hostile to the idea. The parties themselves are
changing too fast for a broad-based alliance to survive and be useful.

The PDS has the power to force elections simply by refusing to continue
backing Mr Dini; but of late Mr Massimo D'Alema, the party leader, has
dropped his insistence on an early vote. This is because the
PDS-dominated centre-left is increasingly divided on strategy and beset
by doubts about being led in an election by the uncharasmatic Mr Romano
Prodi, the Bologna academic and former head of Iri, the state holding
company.

The centre-left staked much on striking an electoral deal with a
movement headed by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the former Milan magistrate.
But Mr Di Pietro may now be prevented from entering politics because of
his own problems with the law that have arisen as aresult of
investigations over his abuse of office before he joined the Milan
magistrates' anti-corruption team.

Against this background, the simplest option for the political parties
is to allow Mr Dini to stay with the excuse that Italy needs an
identifiable government to play its full role as EU chairman. This is a
convenient fig-leaf behind which the politicians can hide their
confusion. But it will merely postpone the day of reckoning at the
ballot-box and is unlikely to provide an authoritative government, even
if Mr Dini has proven to be a skilled and ambitious operator of the
system.

SAMPAIO LEADS AS PORTUGAL NEARS VOTE

   By PETER WISE in Lisbon

   LISBON


Campaigning for Portugal's presidential election on January 14 began
this week with Mr Jorge Sampaio, the Socialist candidate, showing a
clear lead over Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister for 10 years
until his centre-right Social Democrats were beaten in October's
general election.

Mr Sampaio, a former Socialist party leader who stepped down as mayor
of Lisbon to run for the presidency, was given 41.6 per cent of the
vote in a newspaper poll yesterday, compared with 34.9 per cent for Mr
Cavaco Silva. A weekend poll based on a broader sample of more recent
interviews gave them 50 per cent and 34 per cent respectively.

Since the return of democracy in 1974, Portugal has consistently
elected presidents from the party opposed to the government so that
each acts as a counterweight to the other. Mr Cavaco Silva says that
Portugal will 'capsize' if all political weight is shifted to the
Socialists, who are also dominant in local government.

However, the polls indicate that most voters are inclined to provide
additional support for the Socialists, who are four seats short of a
parliamentary majority, by electing Mr Sampaio. Under Portugal's 'semi-
presidentialist' constitution, the president has the power to dissolve
parliament and call an early election when governments run into
difficulties.

Mr Antonio Guterres, the prime minister, is campaigning for the backing
of a Socialist president. This would help his minority government meet
election commitments both to spend more on social reforms and exercise
the budgetary discipline required to meet the convergence targets for
European economic and monetary union.

Ministers say Mr Cavaco Silva would seize the first opportunity to
dismiss the government if he won the election, although he has pledged
to co-operate fully with the Socialists in the interests of stability.

The former prime minister's attempt at a transition from an aloof
decision-maker to the kind of benevolent figure of tolerance and
concern that Mr Ma rio Soares, the outgoing Socialist president, has
made popular is proving difficult to achieve.

Despite popular respect for his integrity, support for Mr Sampaio, a
less charismatic leader, appears to be based more on disapproval of his
rival, whose government had grown increasingly unpopular before its
defeat, and on backing for Mr Guterres.

The government is avoiding decisive measures, including the
presentation of the 1996 budget, until after the presidential vote. It
hopes the political honeymoon that followed its election can be
prolonged long enough to benefit Mr Sampaio.

RUSSIA PLEDGES TOUGH LINE ON ECONOMY

   By JOHN THORNHILL in Moscow

   MOSCOW


Russia's economics ministry yesterday pledged it would continue to
pursue a harsh monetary policy designed to stabilise the economy and
cut the monthly rate of inflation to below 2 per cent despite the
strong anti-government protest vote in last month's parliamentary
elections.

However, the ministry's tough stance, contained in an annual economic
forecast, was seemingly at odds with the the softer rhetoric employed
by President Boris Yeltsin in his address to the nation on New Year's
Eve.

'The main task for 1996 is that those in Russia who today are poor
should begin to live better,' he said, promising the government would
rectify the problem of delayed wage and pension payments which has
caused great social distress.

Mr Yeltsin also lashed out at the corruption in financial circles which
was responsible for diverting money intended for social spending.

Last week, Mr Yeltsin criticised the economics ministry, employing
rhetoric reminiscent of the Stalinist era to denounce 'saboteurs' who
were responsible for undermining the reform programme.

He promised to increase payments to pensioners by compensating them for
savings eroded by the hyper-inflation of the early reform years.

Mr Yeltsin's pledges have led some economists to fear that the
government may consider loosening its monetary policy pushing up
inflation early this year. The government may come under intense
pressure to increase spending on social protection to curry electoral
favour before the presidential election in June.

But ministers have repeatedly argued that there is no contradiction
between tight monetary policies and a rise in the standard of living.

* Russia confirmed that it had missed the New Year deadline for
destroying thousands of tanks and other military hardware beyond the
Ural Mountains and said Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan had
also failed to meet the treaty commitment, Reuter reports from Moscow.

General Dmitry Kharchenko said Moscow wanted to push the December 31,
1995 deadline pledged by the Soviet Union in 1991 back to the end of
1998. The pledge had cleared the way for ratification of the
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.

PACT TO OPEN UP STATE CONTRACTS: INTERNATIONAL NEWS DIGEST


Public procurement contracts valued at several billion dollars a year
will be thrown open to international competition under a World Trade
Organisation agreement which took effect yesterday.

The agreement covers more countries and purchasers - and applies to a
wider range of contracts - than existing rules agreed under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 15 years ago. In addition to covering
services for the first time, the new rules extend to procurement by
sub-central purchasers, such as states, provinces, departments and
utilities, as well as to central governments.

Though not all WTO members are obliged to participate in the agreement,
it has been ratified by more than 20 governments, including the US, the
European Union's 15 members, Japan, South Korea and Switzerland.
Singapore and several other countries plan to subscribe to it.

The accord excludes defence contracts, EU telecoms and the US regional
and urban public transport sector.

The complex new rules set a variety of thresholds, denominated in
Special Drawing Rights, above which contracts must be opened to
competition. The threshold for central government procurement is
SDR130,000 (Pounds 125,000), for sub-central purchasers about
SDR200,000, and for utilities roughly SDR400.000.

The agreement also lays down specified tendering procedures, to ensure
that foreign bidders and foreign goods and services are treated on the
same basis as those in the purchaser's home country. Guy de

Quake hits Indonesian island

A powerful earthquake measuring 7.0 on the open-ended Richter scale
shook Indonesia's Sulawesi island yesterday, destroying wooden houses
and triggering tidal waves and aftershocks.

Officials said the extent of damage along a remote isthmus, 38 miles at
its widest, in central Sulawesi was unlikely to be known until today
because of poor communications. There were no immediate reports of loss
of life.

Information was slowed by a lack of telephone lines in the remote area
between the towns of Palu, the provincial capital, and Tolitoli, to the
north-east of Palu.

Up to 1m people are believed to live in the 150-mile belt between
Tolitoli and Palu. Most of them live in narrow coastal strips separated
by mountains.

Tremors and quakes are fairly common events in Indonesia. But
casualties and damage are often minimal because of low population
densities in many areas outside towns and cities. Reuter, Jakarta

Wave of violence in Corsica

Gunmen shot dead a Corsican nationalist and three bombs exploded on the
French Mediterranean island yesterday, raising fears of a renewed
vendetta between rival separatists.

Gilbert Rossi, a 34-year-old member of the Cuncolta Naziunalista
movement, was killed by unknown attackers outside a restaurant during
New Year celebrations in the port of Ajaccio in the south-west of the
island.

Three bombs, including one at a flat owned by another Cuncolta member,
went off in the town before dawn and police defused a fourth device. No
one was hurt in the explosions. Police said no one had claimed
responsibility for the killing or the blasts.

The Cuncolta is linked to the hardline 'historic wing' of the outlawed
Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC).

Rossi was the 13th nationalist to die since a bloody feud erupted last
year between the FLNC and the rival Movement for Self-Determination
(MPA), both demanding greater Corsican autonomy from France. Corsica
has been hit by more than a dozen bomb attacks since Christmas. Reuter,

Gene cloning raises hopes

A gene that has been linked with obesity has been cloned, a step that
brings closer a new generation of treatments for the chronically
overweight.

Two companies, Millennium of the US and Roche of Switzerland, describe
the cloning - effectively the manufacture - of the 'ob' gene in the
latest issue of the journal Cell.

The ob gene triggers the manufacture of a protein, leptin, which last
year was been shown to affect the weight of mice with no significant
side effects. But the relationship between leptin and weight in humans
has not yet been established precisely.

The two companies claim to have narrowed research to the gene's
activity in the brain, but further work is probably needed before
development of an obesity drug based on the ob gene could start.

Last year, the US biotechnology company Amgen paid Dollars 20m for to
the Rockefeller Institute in New York, which first identified the gene,
for the rights to products arising from it. Daniel Green, London

ZEROUAL PICKS LITTLE-KNOWN DIPLOMAT AS PM

   By ROULA KHALAF

Algerian President Liamine Zeroual has chosen a little-known career
diplomat as the country's new prime minister.

Mr Zeroual, elected president in November, on Sunday named Mr Ahmed
Ouyahia, his 43-year-old head of cabinet, to replace Mr Mokdad Sifi who
had been asked to stay on until the end of the year.

Most Algerians met Mr Ouyahia, who comes from the Berber province of
Tizi-Ouzou, for the first time when he appeared on state television
last July to read a statement telling them that the last round of talks
with the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had collapsed. The FIS
has been battling the government since 1992. Mr Ouyahia is not believed
to have taken a lead part in the negotiations.

That he is among the youngest prime ministers the country has known
points to an attempt by Mr Zeroual to reach out to a younger generation
in a country where more than 70 per cent of the people are under the
age of 30. But Mr Ouyahia's appointment sheds little light on Mr
Zeroual's post election politics.

'Zeroual has opted for a safe pair of hands, a skilled functionary
rather than a political heavyweight,' said one Algerian expert
yesterday. 'It means the composition of the government is not what
really concerns him.'

Mr Ouyahia's government is not expected to last longer than a year
because Mr Zeroual has promised legislative elections, although he has
yet to commit himself to a specific date.

The prime minister's task will centre on overseeing economic reforms
agreed with the International Monetary Fund and preparing for the
elections.

Mr Ouyahia is perhaps best known among his colleagues for arranging an
accord to end the conflict between Tuareg rebels and the Mali
government in 1992, a task which won him recognition as a skilful
negotiator.

He was named ambassador to Mali to oversee implementation of the
accord, before becoming state secretary for co-operation and Maghreb
affairs in 1993.

Although some experts have suggested the choice of a diplomat with
negotiating skills points to a determination on the part of the
president to seek national reconciliation, any negotiations with the
FIS or other opposition parties which opposed the presidential election
are likely to be conducted directly from the president's office rather
than that of the prime minister.

In a system in which the presidency enjoys wide powers, the prime
minister's office is entrusted with more of a management role.

JAPAN PUBLIC PRESSED ON LOAN BAILOUT

   By GERARD BAKER in Tokyo

   TOKYO


Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minster, has urged an increasingly
sceptical Japanese public to accept the government's plan to spend more
than Y685bn (Pounds 4.37bn) in bailing out the country's failed housing
loan companies.

In a New Year message to the nation, Mr Murayama signalled the start of
what is likely to be a fierce political struggle over the bailout in
the new parliamentary session which begins later this month.

The prime minister acknowledged the unpopularity of the plan, which
will cost every individual in the country at least Y5,500, but said it
had been an unavoidable and 'painful' decision.

He promised a full investigation into the causes of the failure of the
seven companies. 'I will try from now on to shed light on the entire
problem,' he added.

Last month the cabinet agreed to allocate Y685bn from next year's
budget to pay for the cost of partially reimbursing creditors of the
bankrupt housing lenders. The government also committed itself to
spending more if the final costs of liquidation turn out to be greater
than is forecast.

The companies, which were established by the leading banks in the
1970s, are on the verge of collapse under a pile of nonperforming loans
which were advanced mostly in a bout of reckless lending to the
property sector during the bubble economy of the late 1980s.

Popular opposition to the principle of spending taxpayers' money has
escalated since the decision was announced and will be exploited by
opposition parties when the parliamentary discussion of the national
budget begins at the end of January.

Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected leader of the main opposition New
Frontier party, signalled his determination at the weekend to oppose
the bailout if the government did not provide a satisfactory and
detailed account of who was responsible for the costly mess.

The government has already attempted to propitiate the public's anger
by hastily removing the senior bureaucrat at the ministry of finance,
Mr Kyosuke Shinozawa. Mr Shinozawa, the administrative vice minister
for finance, resigned last week, in part to take responsibility for the
housing loan problem.

But the opposition wants the blame for the fiasco to be spread much
more liberally among both politicians and bureaucrats.

In its sights are Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, and most
intriguingly, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the international trade minister
and leader of the Liberal Democratic party, the largest coalition
partner. Mr Hashimoto was finance minister during the period when most
of the reckless lending of the housing loan companies was undertaken.

In 1990 the finance ministry issued guidelines to all financial
institutions to curtail their lending to property-related companies.
But the instructions did not apply to the housing lenders which
continued to pour money into highly speculative real estate projects.

The finance ministry has promised a full inquiry into the circumstances
of the housing lenders' demise, and has promised that those found
responsible, bankers, politicians and bureaucrats, will be held to
account.

But even a spate of resignations may not prove enough in the current
political heat. Many members of the socialist party, the second largest
coalition member, are profoundly unhappy about the bailout, as are some
officials in the finance ministry.

If the political pressure intensifies, some members of the coalition
may break ranks and oppose the deal.

Defeat for the government on such a crucial part of its budget plans
for 1996 would have potentially disastrous consequences for its
viability.

CONSERVATIVE ABDULLAH TAKES REINS OF POWER

   By ROULA KHALAF

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, yesterday entrusted with the
running of the government by his half-brother King Fahd, has been
described as more conservative than the king, less likely to
accommodate the west and possibly prone to pumping less oil to raise
prices.

However, as experts and diplomats were quick to point out, Saudi Arabia
run by the crown prince is likely to follow the same economic and
foreign affairs policies the west has become accustomed to under King
Fahd.

If the king's health improves, the handing over of the running of the
government may be no more than a temporary measure and, until Crown
Prince Abdullah takes over for good, King Fahd will continue to have
the final word on big decisions.

One of more than 30 surviving sons of the late King Abdul Aziz, the
71-year-old crown prince is known as a traditional bedouin who enjoys
important ties to the tribes of Saudi Arabia. The fact that he had a
different mother from the king's other powerful brothers has meant that
he comes from a less prominent branch than the other sons of King Abdul
Aziz.

But as the closest in age to King Fahd, he was named crown prince when
the latter took over in 1982. Although this has been a source of
rivalry with the rest of the clan, the sons of Abdul Aziz are known to
stick together when times get rough.

The crown prince is well respected and known for a stutter which seems
to disappear when giving public speeches. The bedouin base is his main
source of strength. Since 1963, he has commanded the National Guard, a
largely bedouin force which looks after internal security and acts as a
counterweight to the army.

Citing his strong links to Syria and the Palestinians, as well as a
reported reluctance to allow American troops to set up their base in
Saudi Arabia during the 1990 Gulf war, the crown prince is believed to
be less internationally minded than his half-brother. He is not known
to speak English, for example, and has played a role in cultivating
links with the Arab world.

This, however, say diplomats, is unlikely to have a bearing on the
Kingdom's close ties to the west, especially the US. 'The US alliance
is a vital strategic alliance which the Saudis will not do much to
change,' a diplomat said yesterday.

Moreover, according to Saudi observers, the crown prince played a
prominent part in drumming up public support within the Kingdom for the
Gulf war.

'He is more decisive than the king but less reflective perhaps,' said
one veteran Saudi observer who knows the crown prince.

'The king is very cautious and tends to see procrastination as a
virtue. Abdullah is less hesitant in his style and quicker to judge.'

Such a style, said the observer, may translate into more forceful
dealings with Islamic fundamentalists who have bombarded the kingdom
with faxes from a propaganda base in London.

Islamic dissidents are also suspected of having perpetrated the
November 13 bomb attack on a US-staffed Saudi National Guard
communications centre in Riyadh.

As the 1996 budget unveiled yesterday suggests, economic reforms
started in 1994 will continue. Faced with the collapse of oil prices,
Saudi Arabia has had to clamp down on spending in recent years, give a
larger role to the private sector and boost non-oil revenues.

In an address to the nation, Crown Prince Abdullah said: 'No doubt you
know the financial situation that emerged from the (1991) Gulf war and
that your government had (earlier) promised to continue its treatment
so matters could return to what they used to be - strength and
balance.'

The kingdom in recent years has been committed to keeping crude output
at 8m barrels a day in order to avoid a repeat of the mid 1980s, when
it was faced with falling prices and falling production. Diplomats said
yesterday that the crown prince was in the 1970s believed to favour a
policy of increased production but that they were confident the story
would not hold today.

As reforms are pursued, however, diplomats said yesterday that for as
long as the crown prince is only acting on behalf of the king, he will
have to find a way to accommodate the king's other prominent brothers
to minimise friction.

This may mean that in governing he will resort to consultation and seek
the co-operation of from powerful members such as Prince Sultan, the
defence minister, who is next in line for succession.

INDONESIA'S CONGLOMERATES LOOK TO MARKET FORCES

   By GREG EARL in Jakarta

   JAKARTA


Indonesia's big conglomerates, long regarded as 'crony capitalists'
receiving government favours, are becoming much more dependent on
market forces for their growth, according to a study.

The study of sales and asset growth of the country's top groups,
conducted by the Indonesian Business Data Centre, a private agency,
also shows that 300 businesses are responsible for about half the
country's gross domestic product.

The centre's director, Mr Christianto Wibisono, said the study showed a
distinct move away from reliance on government-awarded licences for
business growth in Indonesia. He said only 27 of the groups were now
dependent on managed trading and monopoly arrangements although many of
the larger groups had been established under those business conditions.

The 300 groups are estimated to have increased sales by 15 per cent in
1994 to Dollars 74bn (Pounds 48bn).

The figures point to some increased concentration in the hands of the
largest groups with the 10 largest recording a 17 per cent increase in
sales to Dollars 26bn. There were 31 groups with total sales of Dollars
350m, accounting for 55 per cent of total sales, whereas in 1993 there
were estimated to have been 24 groups with that level of sales
accounting for 49 per cent of total revenue.

Concentration is more evident on an assets basis with 56 groups
controlling three quarters of the Dollars 118bn in total assets of the
300 businesses.

The dominance of the economy by people of Chinese descent is underlined
by the fact that only 79 of the 300 groups are owned by ethnic
Indonesians and 203 by non-ethnic Indonesians, predominantly Chinese.

While there are few surprises among the company's largest companies,
several new players are fast emerging, with 11 groups estimated to have
grown by 50 per cent in 1994.

TALKS TO RESUME ON US BUDGET IMPASSE

   By PATTI WALDMEIR in Washington

   WASHINGTON


US President Bill Clinton will meet congressional Republican leaders
later today to resume talks on ending the protracted federal budget
dispute, after extended negotiations over the New Year weekend failed
to yield agreement either on balancing the budget, or on the more
immediate problem of ending the partial government shutdown.

Mr Clinton and Republicans met throughout Saturday and Sunday, before
recessing for New Year's Day. Both sides said no significant decisions
were taken during those negotiations, which focused on outlining areas
of disagreement.

But Mr Bob Dole, Senate majority leader, said negotiators were now
ready to 'start making the tough decisions'. And there were signs of
some flexibility from radical freshmen Republicans in Congress: several
of them, interviewed on weekend television programmes, made clear that
they were willing to compromise on the Dollars 245bn (Pounds 159bn) tax
cut included in their plan, saying balancing the budget was more
important than cutting taxes. Mr Clinton favours a much more modest tax
cut.

Mr Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, said today's negotiations
would focus on 'trade-offs' between cuts in healthcare spending, taxes
and welfare needed to balance the budget over seven years, as agreed by
both sides in November. There was no sign at the weekend that the two
sides had resolved the basic philosophical dispute which underlies the
budget impasse: whether to shift power away from the federal government
to the states, as the Republicans want; and whether to curb guarantees
of healthcare for the poor and elderly.

Both issues are likely to influence the outcome of this year's
presidential election campaign, which will soon shift into top gear
with a concentration of state presidential primary elections in
February and March.

Parallel efforts will resume today to solve the more immediate problem
of getting federal employees back to work, and ending the shutdown,
which has already lasted more than a fortnight.

The President and First Lady spent New Year's Eve and Day away from the
frustrations of the budget impasse, celebrating with 1,000 friends at
the Hilton Head resort in South Carolina, where they attended a
traditional New Year seminar to debate subjects such as 'morals,
manners, and today's pop culture' and 'politics, media and the decline
of civility'.

RHODES' HEIRS RETURN TO ZAMBIA'S COPPER MINES: AFTER 25 YEARS OF
NATIONALISATION, BOARDROOMS IN JOHANNESBURG AND LONDON COULD AGAIN
DETERMINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS LEADING INDUSTRY, REPORTS TONY HAWKINS


Cecil John Rhodes would have relished the irony. Twenty five years
after Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's founding president, nationalised the
country's copper mines, the government of President Frederick Chiluba
may be on the verge of taking the first step towards meeting its
promise to put the industry back into the private sector.

Negotiations with Anglo American Corporation for a feasibility study
for the development of the Konkola copper mining project are close to
conclusion, say industry officials.

It would be a move as rich in symbolism as the 1969 take-over itself,
seen at the time as heralding a new era for a country that was once
little more than a fiefdom of Rhodes' British South Africa Company.

Rhodes' vision of the company blazing a commercial trail from the Cape
to Cairo, in the name of an empire run by Englishmen, 'is now buried -
I hope and pray, never to rise again in this part of Africa,' declared
Mr Kaunda, architect of what turned out a disastrous socialist
programme.

Once again, however, boardrooms in Johannesburg and London could
determine the development of an industry still at the heart of Zambia's
economy, accounting for more than 90 per cent of export earnings.

With reserves at the Nchanga copper mine, which supplies ore to the
state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), likely to be
exhausted by the end of the decade, the government is under mounting
pressure to give the go-ahead for the Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m)
Konkola project.

Although widely anticipated, the decision to invite the South African
mining house, which has a 27.3 per cent stake in ZCCM, to prepare a
study and lead a consortium to develop the new mine will be
controversial, not just because Anglo American is being invited back.
The Konkola decision will also have far-reaching implications for the
privatisation of ZCCM itself.

While Zambia's privatisation programme has accelerated in the past year
- by the end of September, 87 out of 217 business units had been
processed, resulting in a significant inflow of new investment and
expertise - progress in dealing with the politically sensitive copper
mining industry has been slow.

Whereas privatisation of dozens of small state-owned businesses has
passed off with little controversy, the sale of the crown jewels, in
the form of ZCCM, is a different matter, not least because Mr Kaunda is
back on the campaign trail, preparing to contest next October's
presidential elections.

United Nations Conference on Trade and Development figures, published
last month in the World Investment Report, estimate an inflow of more
than Dollars 350m in new foreign investment since the 1991 elections.
In the last year a number of multinationals have returned to, or
expanded operations in, Zambia by buying state-owned companies.

The list includes Tate & Lyle in sugar, Unilever and HJ Heinz in food
processing and toiletries, the Commonwealth Development Corporation in
cement and agriculture, South African Breweries in brewing and Anglo
American in hotels.

The net result is that Zambia attracted more foreign investment in
1991/94 than any other sub-Saharan country, except oil exporters
Nigeria and Angola.

Nevertheless, the announcement of ZCCM's privatisation just months
before elections may seriously damage the prospects of Mr Chiluba's
Movement for Multiparty Democracy.

The past four years of structural adjustment have been extremely
painful, with falling per capita incomes, rising unemployment, high
inflation and interest rates and plummeting industrial production.

That all of this was necessary to turn around an economy brought to its
knees by 27 years of mismanagement by Mr Kaunda's United National
Independence party (UNIP) may count for little when voters come to cast
their ballots.

Economic reform would have paid dividends far more rapidly had the
privatisation programme, now beginning to show real results, been
implemented both sooner and more efficiently; had the country not had
two droughts; and, most important, had the copper mines been able to
exploit a period of strong demand and high prices.

Figures for the first nine months of 1995 point to copper output of
about 325,000 tonnes this year, down 8 per cent on 1994 and less than
half the average of over 700,000 tonnes a year in the late 1960s.

In cost of production terms, ZCCM is in the top 10 per cent of global
producers. Competitiveness will deteriorate further when costs grow as
Nchanga nears the end of its economic life, and the industry suffers
from the cumulative effects of undercapitalisation, inadequate skills,
reinvestment and maintenance spending, and weak management.

If all goes to plan, Konkola will be developed as a joint venture
between the government, whose contribution is likely to take the form
of providing already existing smelting and refining capacity - thereby
further weakening the rump of ZCCM itself - and a Anglo-led consortium,
which may take some 60 per cent of the equity in the scheme.

While such an arrangement makes sound commercial sense, it will leave
Mr Chiluba open to the criticism of privatising ZCCM by stealth.

An agreement in principle to develop Konkola, however, will reassure an
increasingly restive donor community.

The response from the finance minister, Mr Ronald Penza, struck an
equivocal note, speaking of the need for 'the utmost caution' in
privatising the mines.

'We must have the necessary political support,' he said - which was
interpreted by some donors as political shorthand for more delay.

SRI LANKA'S WAR EUPHORIA FADES

   By AMAL JAYASINGHE in Colombo

   COLOMBO


The euphoria that erupted when Sri Lanka's military scored a
significant victory last month over separatist Tamil rebels in their
northern stronghold of Jaffna has sharply diminished with steep price
increases coming into effect in the New Year to pay mounting war bills.

President Chandrika Kumaratunga yesterday promised to press ahead with
a carrot-and-stick strategy to end more than two decades of ethnic
violence which has claimed more than 50,000 lives.

'The economic cost of the war will have an all-round effect in terms of
higher prices,' Mr GL Peiris, deputy finance minister, said. 'This is a
war for peace, so there is no question that we have to find the
resources for it.'

The government estimates that the war against the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) will cost Dollars 760m (Pounds 495m) this year, up
from a provisional Dollars 640m in 1995.

The seemingly unending fighting was felt by the tiny Colombo Stock
Exchange, which shed 33 per cent of its value during 1995. Amid falling
foreign reserves, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 8 per cent
against the dollar in 1995.

Yesterday the government lifted a ban on local banks raising capital
abroad, in an attempt to reduce domestic interest rates, which last
month galloped to 105 per cent amid a cash flow crisis.

It is also raising telecommunications charges by 20 per cent, bus fares
by 50 per cent and electricity tariffs by 20 to 100 per cent, depending
on the rate of consumption.

However, Mr AS Jayewardena, the central bank governor, said the
economic picture should improve in 1996, with foreign capital inflows
expected to rise with the sale of state enterprises.

The government is hoping to attract Dollars 420m in foreign capital
from privatisation, including the sale of the telecommunications
operator and the national airline, AirLanka. The projections are
considered too optimistic by private analysts.

Government politicians said the rising prices and the government's
failure to turn the military success into a political victory had
turned initial enthusiasm into despondency.

Despite the fall of Jaffna, the Tigers have shown that they are still
able to carry out spectacular guerrilla attacks using suicide bombers.
Army camps and convoys have been targeted by lone Tiger guerrillas
laden with explosives.

Tamil men, women and children who fled the fighting in Jaffna are
sheltered in areas of the country's north still under rebel dominance.
The Tigers say they will not allow civilians to cross over to
government-held areas of Jaffna.

Defence analysts say that eventually the guerrillas will have to allow
civilians to return home because that would help the Tigers to go back
to Jaffna and revert to hit-and-run attacks against the army.

The military on the other hand is ill-equipped to supply its
35,000strong force in Jaffna because all land routes to the region are
dominated by the rebels. They depend on the minuscule air force and the
navy.

Mr Anuruddha Ratwatte, deputy defence minister, said the army would
soon open a land route to Jaffna. It would mean a fresh offensive that
would cost many more lives, officials said, and the army was already
bracing for it.

ZEDILLO RESHUFFLES CABINET

   By DANIEL DOMBEY in Mexico City

   MEXICO CITY


A year to the day after he lost his finance minister in the fall-out
from Mexico's botched devaluation, President Ernesto Zedillo last week
made further changes to a government still struggling with the
unpopularity unleashed by the currency crisis.

Mr Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, who as energy minister was criticised for
links to the old guard of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party,
has been replaced, along with Ms Norma Samaniego, the country's
comptroller general, who was thought to be keeping too low a profile to
get to grips with Mexico's allegedly rampant corruption. Mr Carlos
Salomon, the head of Mr Zedillo's press office and frequent target of
complaints about the administration's news management at times when
speculation about government changes unsettled the peso, has also been
removed.

The alterations leave key economic posts unchanged and do not indicate
any big shift in strategy. While the new energy secretary, Mr Jesus
Reyes Heroles, spent much of the previous administration of President
Carlos Salinas advocating a more interventionist economic approach, the
new comptroller general, Mr Arsenio Farell, helped push through the
wage-labour pacts that then provided the centrepiece of economic
policy.

Mr Zedillo's supporters claim the alterations draw a line under the
political difficulties of the government's first year and set the stage
for further reform. But other observers deem the changes a tardy
reaction to months of persistent criticism of Mr Zedillo's team.

'This is a defensive move. It does not take the initiative as a more
thorough going reshuffle would have done,' said Mr Juan Molinar, a
politics professor at El Colegio de Mexico, a graduate research
institution.

Mr Zedillo does not face a nationwide electoral test until
congressional elections due in 1997. But he can ill afford a repetition
this year of 1995's election results, which saw the main right-wing
opposition party establish control over roughly a third of local
government, and win three of five governorship elections.

With the government predicting an economic recovery of only 3 per cent
growth this year after a fall of 7 per cent in 1995, Mr Zedillo's new
appointees will find themselves the focus of added attention in their
tasks of managing the government's relationship with the press,
reducing bureaucratic profligacy and reforming and attracting new
investment to the country's energy sector.

POOREST DEPEND ON BENEFITS 'FOR 70% OF INCOME'

   By GRAHAM BOWLEY

The poorest 20 per cent of households get almost three-quarters of
their income from state benefits, government statisticians have found.

Cash benefits made up 70 per cent of the gross income of the bottom
fifth of Britain's households in the last financial year (1994-95),
according to the Central Statistical Office's latest survey of economic
trends.

Taxes and government benefits trebled the share of total income of the
poorest 20 per cent of households, the study shows.

Their share of total UK income grew from 2.3 per cent before taxes and
benefits to 6.9 per cent after taxes and benefits.

Before tax, the top fifth of households earned 20 times more than the
lowest fifth but only four times as much after taxes and benefits.

The top 20 per cent of households paid 19.6 per cent of their gross
income in income tax compared with 11 per cent paid by other
households.

State pensions accounted for almost three-quarters of the cash benefits
received by retired households, the study finds.

The distribution of income before tax is more equal among those still
at work than those who have retired.

But the distribution of after-tax income is more equal among retired
than among working households.

The CSO gives, for the first time, a regional breakdown of gross
domestic product and investment. This shows that in 1994 - the latest
year for which complete figures are available - the south-east, home to
31 per cent of the population, accounted for about 36 per cent of GDP.

The north-west, which was the second most productive region, produced
9.9 per cent of the UK's total GDP.

Northern Ireland accounted for the lowest proportion of GDP at 2.3 per
cent.

The south-east also had the highest GDP per capita at Pounds 11,407 per
head - compared with the UK average of Pounds 9,768.

The lowest was Northern Ireland where people earned Pounds 8,027 per
head and Wales where the figure was Pounds 8,274.

But this gap is narrowing. Growth in GDP per head has been higher in
Northern Ireland than any other region since 1990.

Income from employment was the source of more than 65 per cent of GDP
in Scotland, whereas it accounted for less than 61 per cent in East
Anglia and the south-west.

GLOOMIER PROSPECTS PREDICTED FOR THE ECONOMY

   By GRAHAM BOWLEY, Economics staff

A gloomier outlook for the UK economy emerged today with a leading
forecaster predicting that growth will slow in 1996 and a poll which
shows that business confidence is at its lowest since 1992.

The latest report by Cambridge Econometrics, the economic consultancy,
says a slowdown in the rest of the world will depress Britain's exports
this year.

It says companies will also cut output as they try to sell the stocks
they built up in 1995.

As a result, UK gross domestic product will grow by less than 2.5 per
cent in 1996 compared with 2.75 per cent in 1995. This prediction
clashes with the official Treasury forecast of 3 per cent growth this
year.

But growth will rebound in 1997 to 2.8 per cent, the forecasting group
says. It thinks spending by consumers will grow modestly in 1996 and
then expand strongly next year - due partly to tax cuts in the next
Budget.

Meanwhile, a survey of 2,000 businesses published today by Lloyds Bank
shows that confidence is at its lowest level since the poll began in
1992. For the first time the survey shows an increase in those
businesses reporting cashflow prob-lems and a slowdown in export
orders.

Orders for goods and services continue to grow - but at the slowest
rate since the second half of 1992. The poll shows that confidence has
dropped as economic growth has been disappointingly slow.

Mr Michael Riding, the director of commercial banking at Lloyds Bank,
said that although companies 'are still experiencing growth, they are
having difficulty in coming to terms with managing in a low inflation
economy. This, coupled with failed growth expectations, has made them
somewhat pessimistic - possibly unnecessarily'.

Companies in the construction and retail sectors reported the slowest
growth in orders, while manufacturing companies and hotels and catering
businesses reported strong growth.

Companies told Lloyds Bank that investment spending has slowed because
of slower profit growth and increased pressure on cashflow. However,
Cambridge Econometrics predicts that investment will pick up in 1996 as
the private finance initiative fills much of the gap left by cuts in
government capital spending.

The forecasting group says there is evidence of a build-up in stocks in
the motor vehicle, chemical and non-metallic mineral product
industries.

It predicts that headline inflation will fall in the short-term in
response to lower mortgage interest rates although the underlying rate
will remain broadly unchanged.

In the longer term, headline inflation will rise to 3.7 per cent in
1997 from 3.1 per cent currently.

WALDEGRAVE RESOLVES TO START EARLY: NEW YEAR AIMS INCLUDE PUSHING THE
PFI AND TACKLING FRAUD

   By ROBERT CHOTE

Like the arrival of Christmas in the shops, negotiations between the
Treasury and government departments over public spending seem to get
earlier every year.

The detail of the last public spending round was published only a month
ago, at the time of the Budget. But Mr William Waldegrave, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, is already preparing for the opening
skirmishes of this year's battle.

Mr Waldegrave said in an interview with the Financial Times that he
planned to emulate his predecessor, Mr Jonathan Aitken, by looking at
the spending of larger departments in spring, before the haggling
proper gets under way.

The Department of Social Security will come under particular scrutiny,
according to Mr Waldegrave. Its Pounds 90bn budget next year will be
Whitehall's largest by far, so it is bound to be an important target in
any search for savings.

'It is essential that they are feeling the full force of the
possibilities of new ways of doing things,' Mr Waldegrave said. 'Peter
Lilley has exciting things to say about how benefits can be delivered
in a few years' time. What the Treasury has to see is whether 'a few
years' time' can be made any shorter.'

Mr Waldegrave has been criticised by some MPs for allowing too big an
increase in the DSS's running costs during the last spending round. But
he argues that some cuts have actually cost money by weakening control
of the benefit system.

Mr Waldegrave said it was clear that the proportion of social security
claimed fraudulently - estimated at between 5 per cent and 10 per cent
for some benefits - was much larger than most observers had thought.

He noted that a pilot scheme to issue some claimants in London with
swipecards was already saving money. 'One of the things I have to do
early in the new year is see what is a practicable, do-able,
non-fantastic programme here which might generate another few hundred
million,' he said.

Mr Waldegrave said there was also scope to push the private finance
initiative, which attracts private sector funds and expertise into
public sector infrastructure projects.

'One thing we have broken the back of this year is institutional
resistance to the PFI, although it only generates a saving for public
expenditure in terms of delivering better value for money,' he said.

Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, believes that
economic activity may be slowed in the short term by an 'infrastructure
hiatus' as private finance replaces direct public funding. But Mr
Waldegrave said he expected private money to be attracted more quickly
than the Treasury assumed in the Budget.

There were no 'wonder drugs' which would deliver savings from
government spending next year, Mr Waldegrave added. He ruled out the
idea of taking a tougher line with the Department of National Heritage
because of the extra revenue from the National Lottery.

But Mr Waldegrave admitted he was attracted - although this was a
personal rather than a Treasury view - to the idea that arts
organisations could be funded through endowments. This would limit the
centralisation of public support for the arts, although it would not
necessarily save money.

Mr Waldegrave said that in framing a long-term strategy for public
spending, it was unrealistic to aim for the low government shares of
national income achieved in some Asia-Pacific countries.

Nations such as the US, New Zealand and Switzerland were better role
models, implying a government share of national income of 35 per cent
or 36 per cent. Public spending stands at 42 per cent of national
income, compared with the formal target of less than 40 per cent.

Mr Waldegrave said every chief secretary had the ambition of reaching a
stage where it was no longer necessary to hold public spending
negotiations every year. He said it was worth investigating the idea
that departments could agree a tough settlement on the understanding
that their budgets were guaranteed for a number of years. But he
conceded that departments would fear that a future chief secretary
would not feel bound by the pledge.

So the annual ritual of the public spending negotiations remains with
us. Every year departments will squeal about the pressure they are
under, and the chief secretary will proclaim one of the toughest rounds
in living memory.

TORIES WARN OVER NICHOLSON ATTACKS

   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby Correspondent

Senior left-of-centre Conservatives yesterday warned the government to
tone down its attacks on Miss Emma Nicholson, the MP for Devon West and
Torridge, following her defection to the Liberal Democrats last week.

As her decision to quit the Conservatives continued to inflame the
long-running battle between leftwing and rightwing Tories, Mr Peter
Temple-Morris, the MP for Leominster, condemned the 'torrent of
personal abuse' being heaped on Miss Nicholson - arguing that the
criticisms were not helping to settle pro-European Tory MPs in the wake
of her defection.

In recent days Mr Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, has
claimed that Miss Nicholson's departure followed her repeated and
unsuccessful attempts to gain a ministerial post within the government.

Mr Michael Portillo, the defence secretary, compounded the criticism
yesterday by arguing that Miss Nicholson had 'demonstrated a history of
disloyalty' - in part by deciding to vote against Baroness Thatcher in
the 1990 Conservative leadership contest.

However, Mr Temple-Morris, a Euro-enthusiast who, ironically, is often
associated with Mr Heseltine's cause, warned that the attacks on Miss
Nicholson were further damaging party morale.

'If someone does defect from the party, then that is bad enough without
personalising things,' he said. 'But ministers are creating a situation
in which the public probably has some sympathy with her.'

Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, attacked the language with
which Mr Portillo had castigated Miss Nicholson, insisting that
ministers needed to understand why she had made such a move.

'This is what I regret, that members of the cabinet should be indulging
in this sort of language and this approach,' he told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme. 'We should be making sure that other people who have
anxieties should have those anxieties removed so the public should see
we are not a bitterly divided party, that we have pulled ourselves
together and can work together.'

Ministers were yesterday hoping that the circumstances of Miss
Nicholson's move were exceptional and would not be followed by further
defections.

But party whips will be heeding the recent claim by Mr Hugh Dykes, the
MP for Harrow East, that a further six Tories could defect to
opposition parties before the next general election. Mr Dykes, one of
the most staunchly pro-European of Conservatives, will have his every
move watched closely by Tory whips in the next few months.

Others whose names have been speculated upon as possible defectors are
Mr Temple-Morris; Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East; Sir
Keith Speed, MP for Ashford; Mr George Walden, MP for Buckingham; and
Mr Tim Rathbone, MP for Lewes.

None of these has been prepared to admit that he is seeking to move to
another party. However, two of them - Mr Hicks and Mr Walden - have
indicated dissatisfaction with the direction of politics at Westminster
by announcing that they will not be standing at the next general
election. Sir Keith Speed is also standing down at the next election.

SALES SUCCESS LESS SWEET AS CHEWERS AVOID SUGAR

   By JOHN AUTHERS

Consumers tried to cut down on their sugar in 1995, according to the
annual survey for the chocolate and sweets markets carried out by
Cadbury-Schweppes, the confectionery company.

While Nestle's Kit Kat bar consolidated its lead over the Mars Bar -
perceived as more fattening - in the chocolate market, the most popular
sweet was Wrigley's Extra, a sugar-free chewing gum.

Total consumption of chocolate declined slightly compared with 1994,
from 530,000 tonnes to 526,000 tonnes, a trend which manufacturers
attributed to the hot weather during the summer. But total spending on
chocolate reached a new high of Pounds 3.2bn.

Kit Kat's sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 200m while those of Mars,
fell 2 per cent to Pounds 150m.

A report in June by Datamonitor, the market research company, said Kit
Kat's share of the chocolate snack market had stayed at about 17.4 per
cent between 1990 and 1994, while the Mars Bar's share had dropped from
16 per cent to 11.7 per cent.

Mars made changes to its product last year in an attempt to appeal to
women and to make its bars seem less fattening, introducing bite-sized
versions and changing the recipe to make it taste lighter. Cadbury's
Dairy Milk consolidated its place as the third most popular chocolate.

In the market for sweets, Wrigley's Extra gum finished ahead of Polo
mints and Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles, according to the annual review by
Trebor Bassett, the sugar confectionery division of Cadbury's. Orbit by
Wrigley, another sugar-free gum, came fourth, well ahead of the better
known Wrigley's Spearmint, which was 17th.

The total size of the market was less than half that for chocolate,
with total sales of Pounds 1.4bn and 283,000 tonnes sold. Average
spending per capita for the year was Pounds 24.

The hot summer weather also affected sales of sweets, which include
cough lozenges in the top 20, according to Trebor Bassett. But it
added: 'There remains enormous future potential for market growth - we
still have quite a way to go before we match the per capita consumption
for sweets of our European neighbours.'

FIAT STEPS UP DRIVE FOR IMPORT POSITION

   By JOHN GRIFFITHS

Fiat Auto UK is restructuring its dealer networks as part of a campaign
to regain its status as one of the UK new car market's biggest
importers.

The company is reorganising its 220-strong Fiat dealer network and
increasing its Alfa-Romeo dealerships by 25 per cent.

The moves strengthening the dealer networks come as the Italian group's
wholly-owned UK subsidiary prepares today to launch its Bravo and Brava
models. They are intended to challenge Ford's Escort, Vauxhall's Astra
and other similar-sized models in one of the biggest sectors of the UK
new car market. Fiat spent more than Pounds 1bn developing the new
models.

The new models appear set to return the Fiat brand to the 4 per
cent-plus market share levels not seen since the early 1980s. Mr James
Blades, Fiat Auto UK's managing director, now expects final figures to
show Fiat's market share in 1995 reached 3.6 per cent, with total sales
approaching 75,000 when about 3,000 Alfa-Romeo sales are included.

Fiat's UK market share peaked in 1979 at 4.9 per cent, with sales of
Lancia models at the time lifting the group's share above 5 per cent.
Yet for much of the 1980s Fiat's share slid downwards, mainly because
of the parent group's failure to invest in new models. By 1992 it had
slumped to less than 2 per cent.

So poor were Lancia sales that Fiat has stopped importing them to the
UK altogether, while sales of Alfa-Romeo - bought by Fiat in 1987 -
currently represent less than 0.2 per cent of the UK market.

However, the launch of two small cars, the Punto and Cinquecento, has
already brought about a strong revival. Mr Blades said: 'We are now
working hard to ensure that further growth is stable and sustainable.
That means making further inroads to fleets so as not to be subject to
the whims of private buyers.'

Fiat's concern in this respect is illustrated by Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders statistics showing that the total new car
market in the UK grew 2 per cent in the first 11 months of 1995. Yet
within this total fleet demand grew 7 per cent whereas sales to private
buyers have stagnated.

The importance of the fleet sector to manufacturers and importers is
underlined by the fact that around 47 per cent of new cars in 1996 are
expected to be bought by fleets.

Fiat's sales to fleets in 1995 played a big part in its outperformance
of the new car market overall. At 67,400 Fiat's total sales in the
first 11 months were 20 per cent higher than in the same period in
1994, compared with only a 2 per cent rise in the UK new car market
overall. Within the total, however, sales to fleets have jumped 43 per
cent. The importance of Bravo/Brava to Fiat's further UK growth is
underlined by the fact that the model segment in which they will
compete accounts for more than 30 per cent of the fleet market.

Under the dealer restructuring, Fiat is retaining the overall size of
the network at about 220 dealers but replacing many of the smaller,
less committed outlets with facilities owned by the bigger retailing
groups. As a result of the shake-up, now in its final stages, some 30
per cent of the network is owned by members of the UK's top 100
retailing groups which are capable of making the substantial investment
that Fiat wants to see.

CRITICS TURN ON TERRORISM INSURANCE FOR CITY: AS THE IRA CEASEFIRE HAS
LITTLE EFFECT ON PREMIUMS, BUSINESSES QUESTION THE EXISTENCE OF
REINSURER POOL RE

   By RALPH ATKINS

When the IRA bombed the City of London in 1992 and 1993 causing more
than Pounds 1bn in damage, businesses were thankful anyone was prepared
to provide insurance against further attacks.

With insurers set to exclude unlimited terrorism cover from commercial
policies, the setting up of Pool Re - a state-backed 'reinsurance'
company which would underwrite policies sold by conventional insurers -
was seen as a sensible response.

Nearly three years later, as many companies renegotiate policies due
for renewal, the mood has changed.

Pool Re is criticised as expensive and inflexible. The Association of
Insurance and Risk Managers, which represents commercial insurance
buyers, reckons the high rates Pool Re charges are forcing companies to
choose between spending large amounts on terrorism cover - or risk
going without.

The IRA ceasefire has had a limited impact. Premium rates have fallen:
a 20 per cent discount has been announced for next year. Pool Re also
collects only 60 per cent of the policy premium at the start of the
year; the remaining 40 per cent is waived if total claims during the
year do not exceed a certain level (Pounds 75m in 1996).

But terrorism cover used to be included in standard commercial property
policies at no additional cost. As Mr Leslie Lucas, Pool Re chief
executive, admits: 'Any policyholder is going to say that, if we once
had it offered for nothing, any price is going to be too much.'

There is also concern that the structure of Pool Re is preventing the
development of an alternative terrorism insurance market.

Because Pool Re started in 1993 without any capital, it had to operate
as a mutual, pooling the resources of those who depended on its
services. It insists member insurance companies only sell terrorism
cover at rates and on terms set by Pool Re. Premiums are pooled into an
insurance fund which at the end of 1994 stood at Pounds 410m but is
likely now to be substantially higher. Because most insurers are Pool
Re members, companies have little option but to buy Pool Re policies.

Moreover, corporate groups cannot 'cherry pick' - buying insurance
policies backed by Pool Re only for vulnerable properties. Apart from
smaller sites, they have to buy cover for all or none.

Rates are set according to formula varying by location. There is only
limited scope for taking account of measures individual companies might
take to reduce their exposure to terrorist attack.

Mr Alan Gavaghan, deputy chairman of insurance broker Willis Corroon,
says: 'A lot of companies spend a lot of money on risk prevention
action, not just things like sprinklers and shatter-proof windows. They
have put a lot of thought into it, but they are treated in the same way
as people with clapped out warehouses.'

Alternatives are available. Willis Corroon is one of five brokers which
combined to provide terrorism insurance underwritten by syndicates at
Lloyd's of London which are not Pool Re members.

Last month the facility was improved and policies paying out up to
Pounds 100m per terrorist attack are available. That means large
companies could choose to insure just their most vulnerable properties.

But the total amount of insurance coverage available is limited. Prices
may also not be sufficiently attractive for companies to switch from
Pool Re policies which provide unlimited cover. As Mr Jeremy Lowe, of
Willis Corroon, says: 'It is a viable alternative to Pool Re for those
who want to be selective, rather than a competitor.'

In spite of its criticism, the Association of Insurance and Risk
Managers do not want to kill the idea of a pool.

'The concept is a good one,' says Ms Ina Barker, executive director.
'The premiums of the many pay for the claims of the few.' There is also
little sign that insurers and reinsurers are willing to return to
providing full terrorism cover without state back-up.

The association's idea is that Pool Re should be funded by a flat
contribution, or levy, on all commercial property policies. That should
allow a return to the automatic provision of terrorism cover. As funds
are built up by Pool Re - assuming there is no escalation of terrorism
- there would be scope for contributions holidays.

Potentially, Pool Re could evolve into a state-backed reinsurer
providing cover against other perils where the incidence is low but
potential costs could be catastrophic - London flooding is a possible
example.

The aim would be to achieve the basic principle of insurance -
spreading big risks on the shoulders of many. Ms Barker says:
'Terrorism insurance ought to be automatic for the benefit of society.'

FISHING PATROL MOVES INTO DISPUTED AREA

   By BERNARD GRAY

HMS Lindisfarne, a UK Fisheries Protection Vessel, yesterday went on
patrol in the controversial Irish Box fishing area, between western
England and Ireland, to mark the first day that Spanish trawlers were
legally entitled to work in the disputed zone.

Also on standby to monitor the situation were three commercially
chartered patrol aircraft which are used to oversee fishing fleets in
British waters.

However, in spite of predictions of confrontation, none of the 20
Spanish boats which have so far registered to work in the Irish Box
appeared.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food pointed to the holiday
season as a possible explanation and added that fishing conditions were
not particularly favourable in the area at present.

Meanwhile, arguments continued between British politicians about the
agreement, which allows the large Spanish trawler fleet to use the
area, traditionally the preserve of Cornish fishing fleets. Mr David
Harris, a Conservative MP whose constituency includes the Newlyn
fishing port, said yesterday that Spanish access to the Irish Box would
inevitably lead to further cuts in quotas, hurting the UK fishing
industry.

Mr Harris said he had written to Mr John Major, the prime minister,
arguing that more control of fishing zones should be handed back to
individual European Union member states, rather than regulated by the
European Commission through quotas.

'The end result is going to be massive over-fishing of stocks already
under pressure,' he said.

Yet Mr Tony Baldry, the fishing minister, said that Spanish boats would
not be able to catch any additional fish by choosing to trawl in the
Irish Box, rather than in other areas.

'They will be policed equally fiercely on the catches that they take to
make sure the fish are the proper size and are within quota, as much as
ensuring that there are no more than 40 trawlers at any one time in the
Irish Box,' he said.

The two men also disagreed about whether Spanish boats would abide by
the rules of the agreement to use the disputed waters.

Mr Harris predicted that Spanish trawlers would use 'every trick in the
book' to skirt the rules, while Mr Baldry argued that the Spanish boats
would comply.

'It will be a very stupid Spanish skipper who seeks to break the
rules,' said Mr Baldry. 'If he does so he will be brought into court,
he will be prosecuted and he will be fined up to Pounds 50,000.'

BIG THAW LEADS TO WATER CUTS: UK NEWS DIGEST


Thousands of homes throughout the UK were flooded and whole communities
faced water shortages yesterday as the Christmas freeze gave way to a
dramatic thaw, bursting water mains and domestic water systems. In some
areas, temperatures soared from -20C to around 7C.

In Scotland, 1/2m Strathclyde homes suffered burst pipes at some point
over the holiday. Water rationing was introduced in parts of Northern
Ireland as reservoirs ran low because of water leaks and burst pipes.
More than 100,000 homes were affected and water tankers were being used
in some areas.

The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which is responsible for public
housing, dealt with more than 5,000 calls. Plumbers ran short of
materials and the executive had to arrange special openings of supply
stores to allow work to continue. Vast quantities of water were lost
because affected schools, factories and offices were closed for the
holidays.

Thousands of consumers in the Carmarthen area of west Wales spent
yesterday without water because of a burst main taking supplies from
the river Towy. North West Water brought in extra staff to cope with
phone calls, and other areas affected by the thaw included
Northumberland, Tyneside and Wearside, East Anglia, Essex, and Suffolk.
Thames Water said customers were cut off at various times but teams
were working to restore services. Press Association

SCOTTISH BANK HOLIDAYS

'Drop January 2' plan attacked

Scottish nationalists yesterday attacked plans to bring Scottish
banking industry holidays into line with England. The move could make
this the last traditional new year holiday period north of the border
and set a precedent for other employers, warned Ms Anne McNair, the
Scottish National party's employment spokeswoman.

Scotland has two new year bank holidays - January 1 and January 2 -
whereas England and Wales have only January 1.

Announcing SNP backing for a campaign by the main banking union Bifu,
she said: 'Once again it seems that Scottish families and society are
taking second place to English clearing banks and the London Stock
Exchange. Making Easter Monday a bank holiday instead of January 2, as
is proposed, would make no sense since demand for banking services is
far greater at Easter than at new year.' Press Association

NHS TRUSTS

Plea for help over fraud probe

The National Health Service Executive has written to all 458 NHS trusts
asking them to co-operate with a police investigation into an alleged
fraud by locum agencies.

The investigation follows routine checks last year by the Audit
Commission, the NHS watchdog, at four hospitals in north Wales.

The Metropolitan Police's company fraud unit is now investigating the
claims. It believes that up to 80 trusts could have fallen victim to
the alleged fraud, which is said to have involved charging excessive
fees or sending duplicate invoices for the services of locum doctors
and therapists. Four people have been arrested in connection with the
allegations, and released on police bail. The total sum involved is
alleged to be about Pounds 3m. John Authers

SUPERMARKET PRICE WAR

J Sainsbury offers 200 cuts

J Sainsbury fired a new year salvo in the supermarket price war
yesterday by cutting the cost of more than 200 items by up to 50 per

chainstore Iceland announced it was reducing some prices to those of
1986. However, Sainsbury's and other leading food retailers denied that
the initiatives would trigger another round in the price war. Press

NERVES BEGIN TO FRAY OVER BUDGET IMPASSE


It is probable that the US government will still not be fully
functioning again this morning - and it is not possible to ignore the
rising tide of public and personal disgust with the wilfulness of those
on the right wing of the US Congress who have brought about this pretty
pass.

Note, from the outset, where the finger of blame is pointed: not at
President Bill Clinton, though he may have contributed to the overall
budget impasse and is reaping political benefit from it; nor at Senator
Bob Dole, though the majority leader might have been more resolute in
standing up to his party's vizigoths if he did not need them for his
presidential ambitions.

No, responsibility lies squarely with those so convinced of their own
rectitude and so insulated from the real world outside their
conservative salons and support groups that they cannot understand the
damage they are doing - not only to those affected by the longest, if
partial, closure of the federal government ever, but also, ultimately,
to their own cause of balancing the budget in seven years.

It is doubtful that the impact of the suspension of government business
will lop more than a fraction of 1 per cent off GNP. Important
industries and cities have not ground to a halt because 280,000 federal
bureaucrats have been laid off. No college football game, the opiate of
the New Year season, has been cancelled.

There has been damage, however: to the civil servants, not exactly fat
cats, unpaid for two weeks over Christmas; to small federal contractors
dependent on government; to the 20,000 people who apply for passports
every day and the 23,000 who register with social security; and to the
small towns and businesses that live off the seasonal trade of great
national parks like Yosemite in California, where the adjacent Mariposa
County has declared itself a disaster area.

They may not amount to a collective blip in the national statistics,
but their livelihoods are affected - for months ahead - and all are
some politician's constituents. To judge by their comments in streams
of US media interviews, they are mostly mad with what they frequently
call 'the clowns of Congress', and soon some poll will doubtless
measure their anger.

Perhaps more serious for the congressional right is the offence they
have given to the chattering classes, who, when aroused, can still do
much to shape public opinion. Nothing has offended them more than the
denial of unfettered access to the most comprehensive collection ever
assembled in one place of the works of Johannes Vermeer, the Dutch
master, at the National Gallery here in Washington.

Last week, Rusty Powell, the gallery's director, was able to open its
doors by releasing Dollars 30,000 from a private donor fund earmarked
for future exhibitions. This was enough to make the Vermeers - but not
the rest of the formidable standing collection, nor the concurrent
Winslow Homer exhibition - available to the public. And did they come,
with lines in frigid weather stretching round the block for precious
passes.

But the money is only good for a week, which means that unless Congress
comes up with funding for the gallery pronto, the Vermeer exhibition
cannot complete its scheduled run until next month. And, like the small
businessmen in Mariposa County, just about all the gallery-goers have
vented their spleen at Congress. One angry TV commentator suggested
that, as a punishment, the 73 Republican freshmen in the House of
Representatives be permanently barred from looking at Vermeer's
masterpieces (though the impact of such contemplation might well be
salutary).

A more severe critic could go further by noting that few of the
affected are natural allies of the hard right. Art appeals to the elite
and is often decadent; passports are for foreign travel and thus
somehow un-American; social security is for the weak; national parks
might be more profitable if opened up for oil drilling and commercial
exploitation; and Washington itself, a veritable modern Sodom and
Gomorrah, would be better off turned into a pillar of salt.

The last word should lie, surely, with the bureaucrats. While they are
on unpaid furlough, members of Congress are receiving their salary
cheques and, as is their wont during recess, travelling the globe. So a
group of US diplomats in Latin America ordered back to work to arrange
one such six-nation trip, sent this distinctly undiplomatic message to
the state department:

'Frankly, we are disturbed by the thought that while American school
children are being turned away from Smithsonian museums, national
parks, monuments and memorials, some members of the US Congress are
looking forward to seeing exotic attractions like Copacabana, Iguazu,
Cuzco, Macchu Picchu and Otavalo - largely at the expense of the
parents of those school children.'

Perhaps they should push the congressional delegation off a cliff, in
the manner of the Incas.

WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THIS MILLENNIUM COMMISSION?

   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

What, exactly, is this Millennium Commission we keep hearing about? The
body set up to plan the UK's celebration of the year 2000. Most other
countries hope to let off a few fireworks but the UK is taking it very
seriously indeed, and spending about Pounds 1.5bn.

Whose idea was it? Lord Palumbo, former chairman of the Arts Council,
thought the millennium a good excuse to spruce up Britain's national
heritage - Stonehenge, the cathedrals, that sort of thing, and perhaps
add one or two modern landmarks. Prime minister John Major agreed, and
Palumbo's idea has gathered great momentum.

Organised by a quango of the great and the good, presumably? Spot on.
Seven worthies, mixed to reflect the aristocracy, business, heritage
lobby, science and women, plus a couple of politicians (Virginia
Bottomley and Michael Heseltine) who are charged to give to it a
vote-gathering twist.

Where on earth is the money coming from? From the UK national lottery,
now a little over a year old. Projects to mark the millennium are one
of the five worthy causes that are getting great chunks of lottery
cash, along with the arts, sport, the heritage industry and charities.
To date the Millennium Commission has received almost Pounds 300m. But
unlike the other good causes, its good fortune ends on December 31
1999. After that, its share of the lottery cake will be divided among
the other four.

Hasn't the commission upset the Welsh? Yes, some of them. It was
decided to spend about Pounds 600m on 12 landmark projects, the 20th
century's gift to the future. These are to be spread conscientiously
around the UK. Wales was owed one, but the national rugby ground at
Cardiff Arms Park, and a proposed opera house for Cardiff Bay, each
applied for Pounds 50m. Forced to choose between the two Welsh
passions, rugby and music, the commission said 'No' to music and
'Maybe' to rugby. The money will probably be spent refurbishing Cardiff
Arms Park.

So all this millennial cash is not spreading universal happiness? No
way. There are as many people whingeing as celebrating, especially in
the media. The commission is accused of being short on big ideas and
long on cautious pragmatism. It has imposed severe restrictions by
demanding that applicants should be able to provide half the cost of
any project, although some of this can be in land or labour. This makes
things hard for imaginative loonies.

But some good must be coming from it? Well, the Tate Gallery is happy.
It has Pounds 50m for its proposed gallery of modern art on Bankside;
Kew Gardens has Pounds 21m for a millennium seed bank for plants; and
Portsmouth Harbour picked up Pounds 40m to convert itself into the
world's classiest marina. Scotland has been sweetened with Pounds 46m
for a 'new' Hampden Park. These are among the landmark schemes.

But I live in Twistelton-on-the-Marsh. I'll never get along to these
national monuments. The commissioners have also set aside another
Pounds 600m to engender turn-of-the-millennium optimism at the grass
roots. Over 300 groups of local activists have already received a go
ahead for good ideas. For example, there will be a new village hall for
Ingleton in Derbyshire, thanks to a millennium grant of Pounds 150,000;
a coastal railway linking the Giant's Causeway and Bushmills in
Northern Ireland will please locals and tourists, at a cost of Pounds
700,000; and Pounds 588,000 has been set aside for salmon ladders in
the River Thames.

Strengthening communities and greening the land are buzzwords the
commissioners have taken to heart. The Pounds 42.5m for Sustrans, which
aims to cover the nation with 2,500 miles of cycle paths, just about
sums it all up.

What is going to happen in 2000? Good question. No one knows, although
Imagination, a group of creative whizzkids from London, and M2000,
financed by Touche Ross and MAI among others, should have a good idea.

They are the two consortia short-listed to organise the year-long
celebration, likely to be a cross between the Festival of Britain and
Disney World. The winner will be chosen this month. Four sites have
also been short-listed: Greenwich, near London; the National Exhibition
Centre near Birmingham; Derby; and Stratford, in London.

Greenwich, the chosen venue of M2000, is favourite, while Imagination
has plumped for Birmingham.

It depends whether the commissioners go for a site in London plumb on
the international dateline, or Birmingham, near the centre of the UK.
With Pounds 100m of millennium money to oil the profit-making event, it
should be some celebration.

And on December 31 2000, is it all over? The commissioners hope not.
There will be the landmark buildings to enjoy, although there is no
equivalent to the Crystal Palace or the Eiffel Tower on the horizon to
amaze citizens of 2096. There will also be hundreds of village halls,
urban parks and small woodlands.

And there will be some bursaries, which are planned to continue ad
infinitum. What are they. Can I have one? No reason why not. The
commission is setting up a Pounds 100m endowment, which should produce
about Pounds 5m a year to be distributed in dollops of Pounds 2,000 and
upwards to citizens who want to improve themselves, and then pass on
the improvement to their communities.

More details will be announced this month, but you will probably have
to apply to a charity or a voluntary organisation for vetting. Good
luck.

MASTER OF RECOVERY EXPECTS SCRUTINY: A CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO DEBT DOES
NOT RULE OUT A NEW PHASE OF GROWTH, WRITES ROBERT CORZINE


John Browne, British Petroleum's chief executive, has marked the
completion of his first six months in office with the conclusion of a
Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.27bn) natural gas deal in Algeria.

The project, which analysts say will help turn BP into a significant
international gas company, attracted headlines mainly because of its
location in a country struggling with an Islamist insurgency. But the
deal is also noteworthy in that it will form one of the foundations for
a new phase of growth and capital investment at BP, whose last
expansive foray triggered a debt crisis in 1992 and the departure of
Robert Horton, former chairman and chief executive.

That episode still influences the thinking of John Browne and that of
Sir David Simon, BP's chairman and the man who engineered the recovery
of the company's fortunes. 'We must not leverage this company ever
again,' said one senior executive last week.

But the company says a cautious approach to debt does not mean that BP
is afraid to act decisively to ensure future growth. It has embarked on
big oil and gas projects in politically unsettled parts of the world
such as Colombia, Azerbaijan and Algeria.

Such projects are a marked departure from BP's traditional core areas -
Alaska and the UK sector of the North Sea. But during Browne's tenure
as head of the company's upstream arm, the board came to accept that
political risk is best spread across a range of projects in different
countries. 'The real risk is having too much in one basket,' says one
BP executive, 'not in going to risky countries which could have a
material effect to the company's bottom line.'

Browne also placed emphasis on the 'phased development' of such
projects. That allows the company to limit its financial exposure
during the early stages of a project, when there is likely to be
greater uncertainty about whether it will prove technically,
politically or commercially viable.

Industry observers say Browne's greatest success was in re-shaping the
strategic direction of the exploration arm and ensuring that it had a
string of possible projects to choose from. It now has sufficient
assets to ensure that reserves can be replaced for another 10 years.
That means that while many other oil companies hunt for new reserves,
BP can focus on projects that are likely to offer the highest return.

Yet analysts wonder whether Browne will have equal success tackling the
problems in BP's downstream division, the one part of the company of
which he has no direct experience and a sector in which big changes may
have an impact on BP's customer base.

He has recently devoted time to downstream issues, in particular to the
future of the company's refineries. They, like much of the industry,
suffer from thin margins and offer little scope for any technological
advantage over competitors. An announcement on the further
restructuring of the company's refining assets is expected this month.

Browne, an engineer who believes technology can continuously enhance
BP's financial performance, is upbeat about chemicals - a segment in
which proprietary technology can increase competitiveness and the
division that BP has chosen to lead its expansion in Asia.

An announcement on broader corporate aims is expected in March. There
have been rumours in the industry that Browne has contemplated radical
changes to the way BP conducts its business, with some observers
speculating that Browne, a former corporate treasurer, would like to
adopt more of a 'merchant bank' approach to the industry.

BP executives say he is more likely to maintain a step-by-step
approach, and emulate Simon by setting simple targets related to BP's
financial and performance ambitions.

One of his biggest challenges will be to maintain BP's strong financial
performance. 'You can grow from an uncompetitive base by cutting
costs,' says one executive. 'The hard task is to grow from a
competitive base, and not just capture the chemicals cycle at its top.'
That means BP will have to focus on efforts to keep margins as high as
possible even in a downturn.

Browne's strategic aim is to create a 'distinctive' company - one with
elements that competitors would have difficulty copying and one which
would provide unusual financial returns to investors. He emphasises the
importance of relationships with host governments, partners and
suppliers.

Browne also wants a 'unique' set of assets, including markets. But big
acquisitions of the type that landed BP in so much trouble in the past
appear to have been ruled out for now, although executives say BP will
continue to make small-scale acquisitions.

Browne's first six months have been made easier by BP's strong
financial performance. But in future there is likely to be greater
investor interest in how he and his colleagues deal with the narrower
issues of the downstream assets and with capital investment decisions.

Senior BP executives say investors are right to demand the highest
capital efficiency possible. After all, says one, 'the industry as a
whole has a pretty bad track record. It hasn't spent money wisely.'
What of BP specifically? 'We should expect to withstand tough
scrutiny,' he says. 'But I don't believe BP will repeat the past.'

FILMS FOR 1996

   By NIGEL ANDREWS

You can always tell a new movie year. It stomps into view overturning
Christmas trees and growling 'No more Mr Nice Guy'. 1996's first
audiences are invited to choose between Seven (serial killer with
horrific murder methods), The Kingdom (ghoulies in a haunted hospital)
and Four Rooms, which climaxes with Quentin Tarantino presiding over
chopping a finger.

Nevertheless, there are compensations to be found. The faint hearted
can take refuge in France's The Horseman On The Roof - more buckle and
swash from director Jean-Paul Cyrano De Bergerac Rappeneau - and in
Something To Talk About, a marital comedy-drama with Julia Roberts. She
twangs a pretty southern accent while Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands
provide power casting as Mom and Pop.

In truth, even the nasties are not that nasty. The Kingdom, a weirdly
hilarious TV mini-series turned four-hour movie from Danish director
Lars Von Trier, is more black comedy than spine chiller. And there is
humanity between the stomach-testing moments in Seven. Brad Pitt and
Morgan Freeman play detectives sleuthing through a series of murders
patterned after the seven deadly sins.

The moral is, if you want quality cinema you must take the rough with
the smooth. But you need not take Four Rooms at all. This quartet of
stories proves there are days when even wonder children like Tarantino
should be locked in the nursery until they get the script right.

On video, meanwhile, two films allow you to be adult and childlike at
the same time. Ed Wood is Tim Burton's funny-elegiac homage to the
world's greatest 'bad' director, with Martin Landau eating the scenery
as the horror actor Bela Lugosi.

And Dianne Wiest similarly eats the scenery in Woody Allen's splendid
showbiz comedy Bullets Over Broadway. The two actors won last year's
best-supporting Oscars.

MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS FEATURES:
BIG IDEAS, BIG BOOKS: SEVEN WISE MEN GIVE THEIR OPINIONS ON THE
CHALLENGES COMPANIES ARE LIKELY TO FACE IN 1996


What will be the big management challenge of 1996? And what was the
best/most enjoyable/most instructive business book you read in 1995?

On this page we print seven answers to these questions.

Sumantra Ghoshal, professor of strategic management at London Business
School:

Challenge: Over the past few years many companies have focused on
rationalisation and restructuring. Often this has required
fragmentation of their organisations into small units and some radical
decentralisation. Now, with much of the fat out of the system, the
challenge will be to reintegrate their fragmented organisations to
pursue new growth opportunities.

Book: The Boundaryless Organisation by Ron Ashkenas, Dave Ulrich, Todd
Jick and Steve Kerr (Jossey-Bass, San Francisco).

This is a wonderfully practical and down-to-earth book that is both
idea-rich and implementation-focused. It provides insightful ideas,
clear examples and simple tools - a rare combination in the world of
business publications.

Gerry Robinson, chief executive, Granada Group:

Challenge: Not to run out of steam. The 1980s was a period of huge
growth and expansion through new markets, new technology and a global
view of business. The 1990s have been dominated by cost control, cost
cutting, streamlining and tighter management control in order to
maintain profitable growth. This must not become the main role of
management - we must also use creativity, enthusiasm, leadership and
sound strategic direction to improve a company's health and growth.

Book: I have to confess that I did not read any business books at all
last year. This is not because I feel I have nothing to learn about
business but because I did not find the time.

The most important book I read last year was unquestionably Wild Swans
by Jung Chang (HarperCollins). Reading about China's cultural
revolution is more enlightening and satisfying than reading about the
corporate revolution.

I am a strong believer in broadening the mind in spheres other than
business.

Tim Simpson, managing director, Arthur D Little:

Challenge: 'Seventy per cent of all re-engineering projects fail',
people will tell you, misquoting one of the big change gurus. My view
is not so pessimistic. Many companies have made large-scale change work
for them, and their performance has jumped as a result.

But with the recovery faltering, and markets ever opening to world
competition, sustaining this performance improvement will be the
management challenge of 1996.

Book: 1995 was again notable more for books I wanted to read than those
I found time for. But one which did hit home was the Fifth Discipline
Fieldbook, by Senge and friends (Nicholas Brealey Publishing). Ease of
reading is one attraction - it's written for browsing and provides
usable suggestions on almost every page.

And its central proposition - that learning, and particularly team
learning, is a key part of building competence in companies - is
intuitively obvious. The book goes further, suggesting practical ways
to manage the learning process and build competence faster. And it
complements Senge's earlier, more theoretical work, with much more
practical experience.

Peter Sutherland, chairman and managing director, Goldman Sachs
International:

Challenge: To cope with the effects of globalisation. Within a very
short time the world has decisively changed and management will
increasingly be required to focus on opportunities in, and challenges
from, the emerging markets that will provide much of the economic
dynamism for the world into the next millennium. An understanding of
relatively familiar cultures and relationships will have to be
augmented by an under-standing of relatively different environments.

Book: I am not proud to admit that I have virtually never read business
books (unless written by Sir John Harvey-Jones). In 1995, however, I
have read some that I would recommend.

The first of these is Corporate Level Strategy by Goold, Campbell and
Alexander (Wiley), which looks at managing multi-business companies
such as GE, ABB and Canon.

My second and third books are not business books per se but I recommend
them because, in today's world, a good manager has to be tuned in to
dramatic political change in terms of national sovereignty. Andrew
Marr's Ruling Britannia (Michael Joseph) is about more than Britain.

It is about a world in transition. One doesn't have to agree with all
his conclusions to find his opinions both provocative and relevant.

I would also include Where Did We Go Wrong - From the Gold Standard to
Europe (Faber & Faber) by the remarkable Eric Roll, who analyses past
errors in policy relating to the British economy and, above all, to
British negativism towards European integration.

Adair Turner, director-general, Confederation of British Industry:

Challenge: Growing. British businesses have got very very good over the
past 10-15 years at being lean and mean, at increasing productivity.

They need now to get better at investing for the long term, at
marketing, at creating new products. A stable economic climate should
make this possible.

Book: Not business but economics, and not one but two. The State We're
In by Will Hutton (Cape). Disagreed with lots of it and almost gave up
after the first two pages of polemic, but provocative and insightful if
you persevere. And The World in 2020 by Hamish McRae (HarperCollins),
crystal-ball gazing with insight.

David Wellings, chief executive, Cadbury Schweppes:

Challenge: The same as always. Putting forward the best face possible
on the past in order to attract investors; scanning the latest mountain
for that elusive and obstacle-strewn path to shareholder value; and
ensuring that managers of vision, tenacity and stamina are there to
step in when you eventually fall off the mountain.

Book: Neville Bain's Successful Management (Macmillan Business). Sound,
practical advice from a businessman to businessmen. Blessed relief from
consultants peddling the latest irrelevant buzzword for keeping in
shape 'corporate re-engineering' or motivation 'empowerment'.

George Yip, adjunct professor of strategy at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA):

Challenge: Multinational companies will continue to face in 1996 the
challenge of globalisation and of building global capability.

A successful global company today needs the capability to access and to
transfer anywhere in the world technology, ideas, factors of
production, and other sources of competitive advantage.

In this regard the biggest challenge will be moving executives around
the world in the face of escalating costs.

Book: Strategic Alliances: An Entrepreneurial Approach to Globalization
by Michael Y. Yoshino and U. Srinivasa Rangan (Harvard Business School
Press).

Strategic alliances are a major method for globalisation and this is
the best book I have read to date on the international aspects of this
subject.

MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS FEATURES:
A PRODUCT OF POETRY: RUPERT MORRIS WONDERS HOW FAMOUS VERSE COULD BE
USED IN ADVERTISING


Readers of the Management Page may have noticed that Union Bank of
Switzerland has been using poetry in its advertisements.

'Thoughts that transcend time from Union Bank of Switzerland' have
appeared on global satellite and cable channels, featuring Sir John
Gielgud and others reading classic poems like Ozymandias, Ulysses and
so on.

The poetry was chosen, according to project manager Vincento
Travaglione, to embody corporate values of 'responsibility, openness,
courage and perseverance'.

Of course, there is nothing new about poetry in advertising. In the
early years of this century, we were regaled with gems like these: The
Onoto, the Owl and the Waverley pen, They come as a boon and a blessing
to men . .

Or the following, proclaiming the attraction of Everybody's, a popular
magazine of the inter-war years: Oh Mr Porter, whatever shall I do? I
was reading my Everybody's and got carried on to Crewe] Copy-writing
was in its infancy in those days, I suppose, which may explain why
these excruciating verses lasted for several years; and yet they were
probably extremely effective, imprinting themselves on the popular
consciousness in much the same way as the catchiest pop songs.

Nowadays, alas, advertisers are more image-conscious. You can't imagine
the Body Shop using some naff rhyme, can you? Ovaltine is the
honourable exception, resurrecting the delightful song of those 'happy
girls and boys', the 'Ovalteenies'.

But Advico Young and Rubicam, the Zurich agency which dreamed up the
UBS campaign, have been doubly smart. Not only have they regaled TV
viewers with some decent poems for a change, subtly enhancing their
client's image; they have also done it on the cheap by using authors
who are long out of copyright.

There is no end to the number of commercial interests that might
benefit from a quick glance through the Oxford Book of English Verse.

Brewers, for instance, need look no further than AE Housman. Indeed,
Ind Coope should surely consider funding an AE Housman chair of poetry
at its Burton-on-Trent headquarters.

No modern copy-writer could improve on this passage from A Shropshire
Lad: Say, for what hop-yards meant, Or why was Burton built on Trent?
Oh many a peer of England brews Livelier liquor than the Muse. And malt
does more than Milton can To justify God's ways to man. Ale, man, ale's
the stuff to drink For fellows whom it hurts to think.

Your AB audience might blench somewhat at the last line, but
self-conscious intellectuals are not usually beer drinkers anyway, so I
don't think we need worry.

Haircare has been a fruitful medium for advertisers, and yet one does
feel that there is a certain creative vacuum in this field.

Purveyors of hair bleach must despair of that stubborn group of
independent-minded modern women who refuse to emulate the models with
flowing locks on their screens and become bottle blondes. Perhaps they
should try a touch of Wordsworth: Earth hath not anything to show more
fair  .

And if that doesn't work, there's always Eliot: Stand on the highest
pavement of the stair - Lean on a garden urn Weave, weave the sunlight
in your hair On reflection, this verse might be more appropriate for
wigmakers. But that's the joy of poetry as an advertising medium. It's
so flexible.

Other products and services might not be so easy. It is certainly time
the army came up with something better than that macho stuff with young
lads driving tanks, swimming, skiing and and generally behaving like
would-be contestants on Gladiators. How about something that brings out
those unchanging values of selfless patriotism? The Soldier, by Rupert
Brooke, has the right combination of gravitas and romanticism. But that
first line is a bit of a downer: 'If I should die . .' You might as
well make it a commercial for funeral services.

Now there's a thought. Undertakers have been loath to advertise up to
now, but poetry might give them just the opportunity they need. The
words of the American Stephen Vincent Benet spring to mind: You may
bury my body in Sussex grass, You may bury my tongue in Champmedy, I
shall not be there, I shall rise and pass. Bury my heart at Wounded
Knee.

At Berry & Birnam we always respect the wishes of the departed. Organ
refrigeration a speciality. Or something like that.

MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS FEATURES:
LIQUID THERAPY FOR THE NEW YEAR


Ihave not been myself recently. Not since I filled my body with a
strange orange liquid at the start of the festive season. The incident
was quite out of character and the memory of it leaves me feeling
sheepish and puzzled even now. Lest you conclude that I went wild on
the mandarin liqueur, I should assure you that my liquid was imaginary
and that it has made me calmer, unflappable, ready for the new year.

The bizarre story began when a lady named Deborah Marshall-Warren
offered me a free trial of something called Orange Liquid Therapy. She
said this was a 'mental de-tox' session that involved hypnotism, deep
relaxation and direct suggestion to sooth all my stresses away. Halfway
round the bend with pre-Christmas strain at the time, I felt willing to
try anything. When she told me her practice was in Regent Street, that
clinched it: I could sort myself out and do some Christmas shopping as
well.

Yet when I arrived at her office, I started to feel uneasy. There was
an unnatural calm about Ms Marshall-Warren. Her eyes were red and she
looked as if she had been crying for weeks. We sat in a tiny cubicle as
hot as the Sahara and lit by a large bright globe. 'I'm going to put
you under quickly', she said. Obediently, I sat in the chair and tried
to relax. I looked at the spot on her hand. I closed my eyes. 'Feel
your calves filling with a warm, orange liquid', she crooned. 'It is
soothing, tingling, and it is moving, up, up into your knees. Feel your
knees filling with a warm, orange liquid. It is soothing, tingling. It
is moving, up, up into your thighs . .' You get the picture.

When I was full to the brim with orange liquid, I had to imagine it
scrubbing out my cares, fears, anxieties, fizzing and dissolving them
in much the same way that Domestos gets to work with stubborn household
stains. Then, when there was no more work for it to do, I was told to
picture it slowly draining out through my fingers and toes. Clean and
emptied, I was informed that I was feeling lighter, more confident,
better able to cope and happier.

Set down in black and white, orange liquid therapy sounds daft as a
brush. I am constitutionally opposed to New Age nonsense. I do not
believe in trendy miracle cures for complex problems. The sort of
stress relief that makes sense to me is to work less, drink less or to
go on holiday.

So imagine my bewilderment to find myself feeling much better after 45
minutes of semi-conscious sloshing around in make-believe coloured
fluid. Before entering the cubicle I felt tense, on the verge of
hysteria. Afterwards I was cheerful, unbothered even by Oxford Circus
in the rain at rush hour, and more or less equal to Christmas.

Yet when I tell my friends and colleagues my wonderful hypnotism story
they give me a wary look. As far as they are concerned, I've started on
a slippery slope, and soon I will be pushing all kinds of dubious
management gimmicks. I insist I am still the same person. They are not
so sure. We shall see.

1995 was the year in which the re-engineering craze died. A
replacement, developed by McKinsey and explained in the consultant's
latest quarterly bulletin is called: Do It, Then Fix It. I like this
new fad more than the old one, because it comes in words of one
syllable. The idea behind it is equally hard to argue with: companies
should work out what changes to their business need to be made, then
they should carry them out without more ado. Once done, they should
assess the result, and if it has flaws, they should swiftly put them
right. Indeed, this seems to be such a sensible way of going about
things, it is a mystery to me why companies need McKinsey to spell it
out to them.

In the middle of all the change that companies are supposed to be
undergoing, one thing remains constant: workers feel their bosses do
not have their best interests at heart.

Never mind all the empowerment, teamwork and egalitarian structures,
employees take the same dim view of their managers as they always have
done. According to actuaries Watson Wyatt, less than half believe their
company is well managed, or think that their bosses make the right
strategic decisions.

The only thing that has changed in recent years is that workers now
view their superiors as hypocrites: good at drawing up a set of values
for the company, less good at living by those values themselves.

I realise it is not for me to volunteer new year's resolutions for
others, especially as I have not made any for myself. But might it not
be time for senior managers to start practising what they preach? I
used to think that human behaviour was difficult to change, in
particular that old dogs could not be taught new tricks. But now I am
not so sure. Dare I recommend a little hypnotherapy? On second thoughts
it would only work if they wanted to change. And that, surely, is the
problem.

HOTELIER'S STARCK CHOICE: IAN SCHRAGER'S HOTELS ARE FOR THOSE WHO CAN
AFFORD CHINTZ BUT WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SAYS ALICE RAWSTHORN


On paper, Ian Schrager looks like the sort of self-indulgent
businessman who is rather too self-indulgent for his own good.

He did, after all, fly 80 palm trees from Washington to the Delano
hotel he opened in Miami last summer, because they were more attractive
than the local crop. And, after taking a closer look at the sand on
nearby Miami Beach, he shipped in a ton-and-a-half of a superior
variety.

Yet Schrager is not just another architecture junkie who allows
aesthetic excess to cloud his business judgment. He can rattle off the
profit margins on almost every aspect of the Delano and of his three
New York hotels. He has harnessed his love of design to turn them into
the hotels of choice for what he calls 'the generation that wants
something different' - artists, actors, designers and musicians who can
afford four-star or five-star establishments but find them rather
boring.

The three New York hotels - the Royalton, Morgans and the Paramount -
are almost always fully booked. The Delano in Miami is so popular that
last month's American Vogue prefaced an article on other Miami hotels
by saying: 'If you can't get into the Delano . . . .'. Schrager is now
renovating the Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles and searching for a site
in London.

The progress of his business career has been erratic, to say the least.
He made his name in the late 1970s with Studio 54, a New York nightclub
that he ran with his university roommate, the late Steve Rubell. Studio
54 captured the hedonistic spirit of the late 1970s. But in 1980
Schrager and Rubell were sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for tax
evasion.

After their release they opened a nightclub, the Palladium, and
diversified into hotels. Neither had any experience of the business,
but they knew what sort of place to open. 'There was no point in
opening another luxury hotel,' says Schrager. 'That end of the business
was well served by Claridges in London, the Bel Air in LA and the
Carlyle in New York. They serve room service course by course at
Claridges. You can't beat that.'

They sensed a need for a new type of luxury hotel for the sort of
people who used to go to Studio 54 - people who wanted, and were
willing to pay for, the comfort and service they got in conventional
luxury hotels, but would prefer a less formal setting more in tune with
their taste than the chintzy interior of Claridges.

They started by renovating Morgans, a discreet mid-town hotel with 154
rooms built in the late 1920s. Schrager commissioned Andree Putman, the
French designer, to refurbish Morgans in her understatedly elegant
modernist style, but they were more adventurous in their choice of
designer for the next hotel, the Royalton, which they entrusted to the
flamboyant Frenchman, Philippe Starck. Schrager worked with Starck
again on the Paramount, an equally extrovert but less expensive hotel
that opened in 1990.

Each of the New York hotels has its own character. The Royalton is the
most audacious. The Paramount is for people who love the Royalton but
cannot quite afford it. And Morgans is the most discreet. Schrager
ensures there is a difference of at least Dollars 50 (Pounds 32)
between the room rates: Dollars 250 for the Royalton, Dollars 200 for
Morgans and Dollars 100 for the Paramount. They all have an average
occupancy rate of more than 90 per cent, against the US industry
average of 71 per cent.

'Coming from the nightclub business was great training for running an
hotel,' says Schrager. 'You're selling a commodity product. A nightclub
sells the same drink and plays the same music as the competition. The
only thing that differentiates them is production values. It's the same
with hotels.'

Production values are Schrager's forte. Starck, with whom he
collaborated on the Delano's all-white interior and Alice In Wonderland
garden, is prodigiously talented but notoriously difficult to work
with. Schrager's solution is to set up a project management team of
architects, art directors and buyers to implement Starck's ideas and
bring them in on budget.

'After doing three hotels with Philippe, we know what to expect,' says
Schrager. 'We don't panic when we get these weird faxes from him.' This
system has produced some of Starck's best work. He is one of the
world's most sought-after designers who receives three or four requests
a month to design hotels, but says 'no to all of them, except Ian'.

All Schrager's hotels look expensive. The fittings are specially
commissioned and the renovation budgets seem high - Dollars 28m for the
Delano, Dollars 35m for the Royalton, Dollars 60m for the 610-room
Paramount. But Schrager is careful to buy existing hotels which will be
easy to convert. 'We replace everything, even the plumbing, but leave
the rooms intact. You can get into trouble by banging on walls.' He
says it would cost 'much more' to kit out his hotels in conventional
chintz than in a sumptuous Starck design.

His latest project is the Mondrian in Los Angeles. It was purpose-built
as a 1960s apartment hotel and is now being redesigned by Starck, who
says he wants it to be 'very, very white with one or two symbols of
colour' to emphasise the 'dreaminess of LA'. Schrager has asked artist
James Turrell to create a 'three-dimensional living art piece' for the
foyer 'so it will be like walking into an artwork.'

As his hotel chain expands, Schrager has cut costs by pooling areas
such as purchasing and marketing. He is careful to concentrate on room
rental, and licenses out services such as bars, restaurants and gyms.
Brian McNally, who has turned the Royalton's '44' into one of
Manhattan's most chic restaurants, runs the Delano's Blue Room with pop
star Madonna as a co-investor. Schrager even licenses the newsstands.
'When we ran the newsstand at the Paramount, it lost Dollars 1,000 a
month. We've given it to a guy who knows the business and it makes
Dollars 4,500 a month.'

The Mondrian is scheduled for completion in October and Schrager will
then expand outside the US. He has hunted for sites in London without
success, although Granada's hostile Pounds 3.3bn bid for Forte could
create some opportunities.

'My customers travel on a certain axis,' says Schrager. 'New York,
Miami and Los Angeles are on it, so are London and Paris. You couldn't
open hotels like mine just anywhere because there wouldn't be enough
people to fill it. And I'd put as much effort into a place with 17
rooms as I would into one with 700.'

OVERSEAS NEWS:
BANGKOK GETS TOUGH ON MOTORISTS


More than 100 people were arrested on the first day of a campaign by
Bangkok police to force motorists to heed traffic regulations as part
of an attempt to unsnarl the city's gridlock.

In Bangkok, known for the world's worst traffic jams, drivers routinely
flout the rules. Violators often slip the police small bribes and are
swiftly on their way.

Car sales in 1995 are expected to have topped 500,000, making Thailand
the largest car market in south-east Asia. But only 8 per cent of
Bangkok's land surface is covered by roads, compared to 25 per cent in
New York and Paris. Short trips in the city can take hours.

Bangkok's traffic problem is affecting the city's development. Some
foreign businesses have decided to locate elsewhere, and tourists spend
less time and money in the capital, citing their aversion to the
traffic. The campaign is part of a plan by Thaksin Shinawatra, a
billionaire businessman and deputy prime minister, who was elected last
July on a pledge that he would solve Bangkok's traffic problems in six
months or resign. Thaksin's deadline - January 26 - is approaching with
no noticeable improvement in traffic conditions.

However, the World Bank recently announced it will provide a Dollars
150m (Pounds 97m) loan to Thailand to help alleviate its traffic
problems. Maurice Le-Blanc of the bank said: 'The government of
Thailand has taken a leading role in the region in addressing
environmental and road safety issues in an aggressive manner, which to
date have proved very successful. This will further those efforts.'

* For those who can make it through the traffic, Bangkok's first
Cyberpub has just opened, providing a focus for the party-loving
after-work crowd. For Dollars 12 an hour, customers can sit at one of
10 glass-topped tables equipped with a Compaq Presario.

Getting into the spirit of things, an opening night trio of women
clicked on to a virtual dating service which bills itself as 'Your link
to true love'. As the picture and vital statistics of a young hunk from
New York appeared on the screen, one adjusted her glasses and took a
closer look.

The Cyberpub is in the same ownership as the local upmarket Dusit Thani
hotel chain.

POBOX AND THE MAGIC COOKIE


Which company will have the greatest effect on the development of the
Internet this year? My answer is neither Microsoft nor Netscape. It is
a tiny new company in Philadelphia called Pobox. com - spelt as if it
were an abbreviation of Post Office Box, but pronounced as the single
word 'Pobox'. Its product consists of a simple forwarding service that
is an electronic equivalent of a post office box.

The system works as follows. Customers give out an e-mail address
ending in pobox. com - like the one that appears at the bottom of this
column. When their friends or colleagues send them e-mail at that
address, a computer in Philadelphia looks up the recipient in a data
base and forwards the message immediately to their Internet provider.

This service allows people to give out an e-mail address that is
independent of where they work or where they choose to buy Internet
access. Moving from one Internet provider to another is simply a matter
of sending a message to pobox. com giving a new forwarding address and
quoting a 'magic cookie', a number that establishes the customer's
authenticity.

I have already discovered an advantage of the service. Having recently
moved from London to Silicon Valley in order to work on a book, I have
switched Internet providers. But my address has remained the same, and
messages sent to me as if I were in London are forwarded to me in
California without my having had to tell anyone how to reach me.

Yet people moving house are not the sole market. Other potential users
includes customers of CompuServe, which allows people to use only an
indecipherable string of numbers as their e-mail address.

Equally attracted will be those who are embarrassed by the cumbersome
length or strange letter-and-number combination of their real e-mail
address.

The entrepreneurs behind Pobox. com are a pair of students at the
University of Pennsylvania, still living in a college dormitory: Reuven
Bell, 23, whose subject is religious studies, and Meng-Weng Wong, 21, a
computer science major born in Singapore. The two launched their
service in early 1995, and already have 3,000 users. In keeping with
the principle that most of the best Internet businesses start off by
giving things away, the pair offer a generous free trial lasting three
months.

Thereafter, the price for forwarding mail starts from Dollars 15 a
year, payable by credit card - with the incentive of six years for the
price of five to those who choose to pay Dollars 55 in advance.

Three months is exactly right for the trial period. It is long enough
for customers to become comfortable with the service and to give their
new e-mail address to all their friends, but not long enough for anyone
to find it worthwhile to start again with a new name from scratch.

So far, 850 electronic invoices have been sent out, and almost half
have been paid. Because of a glitch in the billing software, Bell and
Wong have not yet had time to send out reminders. But early indications
are promising, and the pair claim that an automated trawl of Internet
newsgroups has turned up more than 1,000 mentions of their service,
only one of which was negative.

Whether Pobox. com will make serious money or not is too early to
predict. Its founders certainly hope so. Bell has just taken time off
from his degree to work on the business 12 hours a day, and is planning
to pursue some Wharton MBA courses on his return to academia. Moreover,
the company already has imitators: a sign, surely, that others see the
potential in its idea.

Even a modest success could have a sharp effect on the Net. It would
remove the fear of changing e-mail address that forces many to stay
with an unsatisfactory service provider. In doing so, Pobox. com's
success would make a large global industry significantly more
competitive.

* Talking of magic cookies, someone recently sent me the following
story by e-mail. A woman who had eaten a delicious cookie at the cafe
of a department store in Dallas asked for the recipe. 'We don't give it
out,' said the waiter. However, the customer persisted and offered to
pay for the recipe.

On hearing that the price would be 'two fifty', she agreed to charge it
to her credit card along with the bill for her lunch, and was then
handed the recipe on a printed sheet. Thirty days later, her Visa
statement revealed she had been charged Dollars 250.

The furious cookie lover called the company's head office, thinking
that the real figure should have been Dollars 2.50, but was told there
was no mistake.

The Dollars 250 was to insure that not just anyone could afford the
recipe. Accordingly, her request for a refund had to be turned down,
but the woman got her own back in the end.

She copied the recipe into an e-mail, which she posted to all her
friends. They posted it to their friends, and they in turn to theirs.
'I paid for it,' her e-mail said, 'so you can have it for free.'

I find it hard to imagine that the department store named in the e-mail
would behave in such a pig-headed way.

But even if apocryphal, the story illustrates the power of the
Internet. By the time you read this, tens of thousands of people may
have baked cookies according to the recipe without paying Dollars 250.
And the name of the store chain will have been blackened on computer
screens all over the world. Tim. Jackson@pobox. com

HOME SHOPPING TAKES A TUMBLE FROM ITS TROLLEY: ENTHUSIASTIC PREDICTIONS
OF A COUCH-POTATO FUTURE WERE PREMATURE, WRITES WINSTON FLETCHER


A funny thing has happened. Home shopping, that supposedly
trail-blazing benefit of interactive television, has fallen out of its
supermarket trolley.

Less than a year ago the pundits were predicting a couch-potato future
for us all. Sitting comfortably in front of our screens, we would surf
the stores and trawl the malls. Never again need we venture into the
rough, tough world of Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. We would
click-on, cruise-thru', and our cyber-shopping trollies would be filled
by techno-magic.

Well, it hasn't happened yet. But is it on its way?

The picture is confused as there are two types of televisual home
shopping. First, conventional satellite/cable channels offering
merchandise in a fairly traditional way. Second, shopping emporia -
mostly American - are burgeoning on the Net.

The more knowledgeable US home shopping gurus have long been suspicious
of the forecast explosion in their marketplace. QVC, America's largest,
highest profile home-shopping channel, mostly sells jewellery (42 per
cent of its turnover) and clothing (18 per cent). For clothing, the
return rate is about 40 per cent.

A couple of years ago QVC's then retiring chairman, Joseph Segel, said
in a notable speech: 'The number of people tuned to a particular
channel when your advertising runs is likely to be a small fraction of
the number you could reach with direct mail. The cost of running a
shopping channel is much greater than most people realise. Some system
developers and their software programmers assume that consumers are
itching to be converted from passive to interactive TV viewers.
Certainly there are some people who fit that mould. But I venture to
say that the great American public prefers just to watch television and
let someone else do the work.'

In turn, futurologist John Naisbitt's well-informed Trend Letter - a
publication understandably keen to embrace almost anything and
everything new under the sun - recently asked: 'Is the much-hyped age
of online shopping about to bloom? Not really.' The same issue of Trend
Letter reported that 'merchants on the Internet are reluctant to
solicit credit-card numbers for payment, lest hackers steal account
numbers' - a little cybernetic difficulty that has by no means been
resolved.

Nonetheless, research estimates suggest that 2m online purchases were
made in the US in the last year. That sounds an awful lot until you
remember that it equates to a single purchase by less than 1 per cent
of America's population. And Americans, particularly those living way
out nowhere, have always been catalogue shoppers, so direct marketing
has always been big business in the US.

It is a far-flung country, and even with gasolene as cheap as Coke it
doesn't make a lot of sense to drive hundreds of miles for a rubber
grommet. In other words, established home shoppers may just be
switching media, from print to Net - without new shoppers being
inveigled into the couch-potato lifestyle.

Where Americans are slow to lead, Europeans are even slower to follow.
At the end of 1994 a study of the multimedia marketplace in Europe
carried out by leading research group Inteco reported that the demand
for home shopping was non existent. 'No one in the study,' it
proclaimed, 'showed any interest in being able to order goods
electronically.'

The progress of home shopping in Britain confirms that. QVC started
with a bang in the UK but sales appear to be stabilising at about
Pounds 50m annually - not a lot with which to run a full-time channel
and supply some 300,000 customers.

Part of the reason for this disappointing growth is the result, I
suspect, of the hype attached to the phrase 'virtual reality'.
Televisual shopping, it is claimed, provides 'virtual reality'. In a
virtual reality supermarket you can whiz round the aisles picking up a
pack of this and a jar of that as you skid past the shelves. It sounds
so futuristic, so clever, that we have been seduced into believing it
would be wonderful. But would it?

It would certainly be fun once or twice, like a video game. But we all
know what has happened to the sales of video games. The problem is that
virtual reality really doesn't bear much resemblance to reality.

We encounter reality through our five senses: sight, sound, smell,
taste and touch. So-called virtual reality offers reality in - at best
- two dimensions: sight and sound. Sight is the most important single
sense involved when we go shopping. But it is not the only one.

As supermarkets are well aware, smell is all-important. That is why
they put fruit and vegetables at the front of the store, and bake their
own bread. For many products, touch is as important as smell. ('If you
don't want the goods, don't muck 'em about', went the old
costermongers' injunction, to restrain customers from manhandling the
produce).

Paradoxically, it is in the area of sight that virtual reality is least
real. If Bill Gates, the boss of Microsoft, believes that projecting
huge cyber-blowups of great masterpieces on to his walls will convey
even a tad of their artistic merit, it is as well he never tried to
major in aesthetics.

But never mind great paintings. Would you even buy fresh meats or fish,
or even fruits and vegetables, without seeing them in the flesh? If
people didn't want to inspect the goods carefully and choose the
freshest, why would they shop at the deli counter? The newest Tesco
stores now have large old-fashioned butcher's sections. And if you want
to inspect groceries before you buy them, why not shop for the lot at
one stop?

Apart from groceries, the sector that has generated most chatter among
the marketing classes - but again, little action so far - is cars. (The
marketing classes are not much interested in jewellery - not in selling
it, anyway).

Automotive gurus constantly predict that the end of the showroom is
nigh: motorists, it is said, will compare and contrast different models
on-screen before selecting their test-drive short-list. And one day,
even the test-drive will be taken on-screen.

The assumption is that video information is more appealing to motorists
than printed or personal (showroom) information. Maybe. But feel,
comfort, guidance - even smell - are important reasons for showroom
visits, and cannot be duplicated by 'virtual reality'.

Which may explain why the only area in which home shopping seems to be
taking off is one in which virtual reality is virtually non-existent -
the marketing, not of goods, but of services, particularly financial
services.

As financial products are, so to speak, invisible and intangible, they
are ideal for telephone selling. While financial service providers
increasingly use direct response television advertising
cost-effectively, their commercials could hardly be described as
virtual reality. Or indeed, in many cases, as reality of any sort.

Not that home shopping is not going to grow. It will, but it will be
slow and highly specialised. Delivery takes time and costs money. Many
people, perhaps most, will never feel comfortable with computers.
Forget those middle-class parental boasts of brilliantly sophisticated
computer-literate kids; think, instead, about all the underprivileged,
computer-illiterate kids.

Nor is home shopping quite as revolutionary as cyberbuffs believe.
Almost exactly a century ago the Victorians were opening up their own
version of the information superhighway (and with at least as much
hyperbole). The UK postal service, the railways, the telephone and the
telegram were bustin' out all over. Telegrams were described - as new
media so frequently are described by their sponsors - as 'the boldest
advertisements in modern times.'

By the turn of the century, all the great London department stores had
mail-order departments. Harrods, which pioneered home shopping by
telephone, rejoiced in the telephonic address EVERYTHING, LONDON.
Whiteley's in Bayswater boasted they could supply anything 'from a pin
to an elephant' door-to-door.

And the Army and Navy store sped huge mail-order catalogues to its
customers in every corner of the globe, carrying within their covers a
cornucopia of sumptuous and succulent merchandise. Moreover, delivery
was often a good deal faster and cheaper than it generally would be
today.

Home shopping may yet be the bonanza of the future. But I wouldn't bet
my Tesco shares on it.

ARTS & LEISURE:
GREEN TURNS DARK FOR THE STRUGGLING GOLF CLUB PRO


Peter Alliss recently observed that the average club golfer expects the
local professional to play like Nick Faldo, teach like John Jacobs and
be as good a shopkeeper as Marks and Spencer.

Very few club members realise how much of an endangered species the
non- tour golf professional is about to become, especially in Britain,
the home of golf. Traditionally, the pro has received a small retainer
from his club but earned the bulk of his living selling equipment and
giving lessons.

Yet selling equipment to club members is becoming virtually impossible
as the tiniest of retailers strives to compete against specialist chain
stores such as American Golf Discount and Nevada Bob's.

'The members don't realise what a financial strain it is to carry the
stock on a big overdraft and they can be such fickle customers,' says
Haydn Darrell, the pro at the small Devon club of Sidmouth. 'I'll see
them turn up to play with a new set of clubs and I won't even have had
the chance to match the price they've paid from one of the big chain
stores.'

Darrell's experience is echoed nationally. A recent report from the
specialist Golf Research Group predicted that the 2,400 retail outlets
supplying the UK golf equipment market will have shrunk to only 200 to
300 shops within a year or two.

'The traditional pro shop just cannot survive,' says Colin Hegarty,
head of GRG. 'The average gross turnover is around Pounds 110,000 a
year and they cannot stock the shop and survive on that kind of
volume.'

His figures show that the bigger retail outlets are growing fast, with
a matching shrinkage at the smaller end. Hegarty says the club pro has
two options: 'Get out of the business quickly: it's better to take a
big loss than stay and starve to death. Or become an Alan Walker.'

Walker is a former club pro - 10 years at the coalface - who realised
he was a doomed species in a thriving industry, so he now has a
high-volume shop adjoining his Warren Park driving range in Essex, plus
a management company looking after a nearby pay-and-play course.

Walker says that club pros have lost their retail business
'frighteningly quickly. Five years ago it was a Pounds 130,000 average
turnover with a 35 per cent margin. That's all over.'

His own shop turns over slightly more than Pounds 1m a year, but a
branch of American Golf Discount has just opened on Walker's doorstep.

'We're being hurt,' he admits. 'Teaching alone isn't the answer to
replacing lost income. Firstly, statistics show that the British are
the worst golfers in the world in terms of readiness to take
instruction. Secondly, it's too seasonal. Who's having a lesson today?'

He looked out of his office window as an arctic snow shower blasted
across the 14th green. Few issues currently occupy the Professional
Golfer's Association as intensely as the livelihoods of its 3,500
members. As a result, a PGA working party is radically re-thinking the
raison d'etre of the pro.

It doesn't help that while the public image of the golf professional is
Nick Faldo or Ernie Els, superstars like those are a light year away
from the everyday work of the pro at the local club.

When the PGA wanted a leading figure for a publicity campaign, it found
Faldo's fee unaffordable, so ended up using Nigel Mansell, one of the
game's better-known amateurs.

Alan Walker is a committee member at the PGA and is deeply involved in
the process of reviewing future direction. As one experienced insider
put it: 'We have to stop training people for futures they are never
going to have. They're not going to be Woosnam or Norman, and now
they're not going to be a successful shopkeeper, either.'

Walker acknowledges the problems. 'At the end of the day we're all
failed players,' he says. 'I went into the game thinking I could play
and was going to spend my days on the course winning tournaments, and
I've ended up an accountant.' Later this month the PGA opens an Pounds
8m training academy at its headquarters, The Belfry, the hotel course
in the English Midlands that has hosted several Ryder Cups.

Leisure management and course architecture are much more important now
than learning how to spend several hours repairing a persimmon-headed
driver for a tiny fee.

The qualifications dished out at The Belfry will be equivalent to a
degree. 'We've always been reluctant retailers, and the tour is for a
tiny minority, of whom 75 per cent won't cover their costs,' says
Walker. 'The jobs we've got to aim for are those of actually managing
the facilities, which in the past have gone to food and beverage
specialists or greenkeepers.

'In the future, if your local club pro can't drive a computer and work
the local media, forget admiring his short game around the green.'

If the pro can re-engineer himself to survive, what of the shop? We may
not buy much, but which weekend golfer doesn't enjoy a mooch around his
club shop's over-stocked shelves?

'It's history,' says Colin Hegarty. 'Marks and Spencer are already
moving into clothing in a huge way and the big chains will be selling
all the clubs and equipment. A starter's hut where you can buy a glove
and a ball - if you've forgotten to bring them - is the most likely
outcome.'

ARTS & LEISURE:
YEAR OF THE MILLENNIAL RE-THINK

   By COLIN AMERY

At least 1995 ended on a note of pure wisdom. For once, the old English
system of independent representative groups of well-informed
individuals appointed by the crown to guide our affairs worked
brilliantly, with the millennium commissioners proving themselves worth
their salt by refusing to allocate national lottery money for the
proposed Cardiff Bay opera house.

For too long Lord Crickhowell and his opera house trustees have been
led by the nose by London architectural groupies and admirers of the
designs of Zaha Hadid, who won the competition to design the proposed
opera house.

The common sense of the minister, Virginia Bottomley, and her
commissioners will save Wales the embarrassment of a design that is not
supported by the people of Wales and is already dated.

A Cardiff Bay opera house as a new home for the Welsh National Opera is
a good idea, and no doubt a large theatre will be built there. The
mistake was for the opera house trustees to believe they had to build
something approved by a narrow segment of the international
architectural mafia.

The jury for the competition was unrepresentative and innocent,
seemingly prepared to let Miss Hadid's quaintly modern period piece go
ahead even though she had never built a serious building. Miss Hadid is
really a talented futurist painter - her work would have been avant
garde in turn of the century Russia. Today it is labelled
'uncompromising' and 'exciting'. It is neither. The trendy London
chatterers who influence people like Lord Crickhowell should be seen
for what they are: rearguard types trying to protect a briefly
fashionable designer. But Miss Hadid is no genius.

The tragedy of the inevitable row about Cardiff Bay is that the failure
of Miss Hadid's design will be seen as a triumph for the philistines.
It is actually a dated, awkward design that only got this far through
endless lobbying. The millennium commissioners, who distribute part of
the proceeds of the UK national lottery, have called the bluff of the
trendies.

Sensible opera house trustees should look at the newest opera houses in
the world; meet their architects and managers; and choose someone with
experience. The trustees must start again with a good new architect.
Life is tough, but Virginia Bottomley is tougher, and in this case she
and her commissioners are right.

Last year, national lottery money gave a fillip to the UK's
architectural profession. The turnover of the British construction
industry should benefit by some 5 per cent or so in the years to the
millennium. It is large-scale projects that attract attention, but some
90 per cent of lottery grants are for projects of less than Pounds 1m.

Yet 1995 saw construction still in recession and architects only
beginning to see green shoots of recovery fertilised by lottery cash.
The secretary of state for the environment, John Gummer, belatedly
recognised the value of towns. His new planning policy guidance notes,
to be issued early this year, will stress the value of mixed
developments. That is an almost complete volte face for the entire
planning system. If he is serious, Gummer will presumably be
re-educating the entire planning profession at the new University of
Greenwich.

He will have to start with the Corporation of the City of London which,
since the inspired but disastrous experiment of the Barbican, has
abandoned any pretence that the City is more than a Square Mile of
offices. The recent announcement of two big office schemes in EC4, and
the decision to encourage Mitsubishi to go back to the drawing board on
the Paternoster site, means the City may be in danger of becoming a
horizontal version of Canary Wharf.

The opportunity at Paternoster to build a mixed development, giving
Mitsubishi the chance to build as many offices as it likes on, say,
London Wall, must not be missed. In turn, the chance to move the Museum
of London to a marvellous site next to St Paul's should be grasped, and
why not have hotels and residential accommodation overlooking Wren's
wonder?

Architects in 1996 need to learn to be different kinds of animals.
Those like Miss Hadid and Sir Richard Rogers (imminent adviser to the
new Labour party) who are wedded to dogma, are now old fashioned.
Architects like Sir Michael Hopkins, Sir Norman Foster and Richard
MacCormac are the leaders of the profession, and also admired by the
public.

That is a breakthrough, and one that has come about because the public
are under-estimated by architects at their peril. The public - you and
me - understands the difference between quality and a dead cow in
formaldehyde. Virginia Bottomley and her commissioners understand the
difference, too. In 1996, quality and common sense may replace dogma
and fashionable nonsense. I live in hope.

ARTS & LEISURE:
MAN OF MUSIC WITH PERIOD APPEAL: ANDREW CLARK TALKS TO THE CONDUCTOR
WHO CHALLENGES OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND OPENS OUR EARS TO THE PAST


This looks like Roger Norrington's year. He opens and closes it in
Salzburg, conducting the Vienna Philharmonic there later this month and
returning in December to rehearse Mozart's Mitridate for the 1997
festival. In between there will be Berlioz with the London
Philharmonic, Dvorak in Boston, Henze in Basle, Elgar in Washington,
Beethoven in Chicago, Nicholas Maw at the Proms and Brahms in Vienna -
not forgetting three European tours with his own period-instrument
orchestra, the London Classical Players.

Did someone say Norrington was a period specialist? If so, the period
ranges pretty wide - from 1600 to 2000. That distinguishes him from
most early music pioneers. And he uses the same forensic skills to
unravel Vaughan Williams and Part as he does for Beethoven and Bruckner
- which sets him apart from other high-profile conductors. No British
musician has done more to challenge our assumptions or open our ears to
the past. At 61, Roger Norrington fully deserves the international
limelight.

He clearly enjoys it. The early music revolution, he says, is not about
period instruments or a particular type of repertoire. 'It's a habit of
mind. Even if I didn't know anything about early music, I would still
be the conductor I am now. I just can't look at a piece of music
without taking it back into the garage and stripping it down, finding
what the hell is going on and putting it back together again. Vroom]'

Earthy enthusiasm has always been a Norrington hallmark. It inspired
his singers and orchestra at Kent Opera, where his 13 years as music
director gave him a vast repertory and an intimate understanding of how
a company works. Enthusiasm has also been the key to his 'Experience'
weekends, where he and the LCP discuss, rehearse and perform a
composer's work to the amused enlightenment of all. And it continues to
permeate his day-to-day contact with conventional orchestras.

'You don't often come across that kind of enthusiasm for the way the
music is realised,' said a member of the Basle Symphony Orchestra after
Norrington's latest visit. 'His contact with the players is amazingly
lively - the orchestra had a great time. He got a humming performance,
the music really took off.'

Longstanding colleagues say Norrington has mellowed over the years. He
has had two operations for cancer and become a father again: his wife,
the choreographer Kay Lawrence, and their two-year-old son often travel
with him. 'But when it comes to the music, he's just as strict and
demanding as ever,' says an LCP stalwart. 'He has an incontrovertible
idea of how it should be. His point is that this is real music written
by real people, and he gets that 'immediate' element across. He wants
to get round the traditional interpretation, demythologise the music,
remove the waffle and ballast.'

That is one of the reasons why Norrington now enjoys such a high
profile outside the UK. Long popular in the US and Italy, he has only
recently begun to make his presence felt in the Austro-German
heartland. He says CDs have had a proselytising influence - 'they're
sinking into the subconscious. People there are getting used to the
idea that there are things they need to know about. Despite my rough
German, the orchestras have been very responsive.'

Norrington has not forgotten the UK. A former choral scholar at
Cambridge, he lives in Berkshire, organises the LCP's schedule with a
couple of helpers and conducts 10 programmes a year with the London
Philharmonic. He says he is perfectly happy to work with modern
instruments. 'If you're changing the score - because many of the
published scores are inaccurate - and you change the seating, the
tempo, the phrasing, the light and shade, the Weltanschauung, it
already makes a huge difference. But once they get used to the style,
they may hesitantly say 'We're doing everything else, shouldn't we drop
the vibrato?'. That happened with the LPO, and the result was
absolutely marvellous. As they begin to trust you, they realise you're
not going to turn up in a gown and mortar board. They see you're a real
musician.'

Norrington's interest in historically aware performance began in the
early 1960s, when he went round the churches of Europe performing
Schutz with his own amateur choir. There was no Schutz style: he had to
invent his own. From there it was but a short step to Bach, Telemann
and Handel - and on to Gluck and Haydn, Beethoven and Berlioz, Schubert
and Schumann. The journey has now reached Wagner and Bruckner, and the
results astonish Norrington as much as they do his admirers.

In his LCP recording of the Meistersinger overture, Norrington knocks
two to three minutes off the standard performance length. 'I keep
thinking that with the next thing we do, there won't be quite the same
things to discover,' he says. 'A year ago, we didn't know how Wagner
would sound on period instruments. I thought the tempo wouldn't be a
big question, it would be a matter of just hearing the same music on
these instruments. Then I started my research. In Ueber das Dirigieren,
Wagner writes that when he conducted the Meistersinger overture, it
lasted a few seconds over eight minutes. I thought wow] What will it
sound like if we do that?'

It was a revelation - less pompous and more humorous than usual, with a
spring-in-the-step in the climaxes. There were similar results in
Bruckner's Third Symphony, which Norrington conducted at the Linz
Bruckner festival last autumn. He opted for the first version - the one
Bruckner never heard, with none of the 'improvements' carried out by
his pupils for later performing versions. And he delved into Bruckner's
own recorded comments, which include references to a polka in the
finale.

'What do most conductors do? They play it like a dirge. But if Bruckner
says it's a polka, it's a polka. So I take it at a steady polka speed,
which makes it sound like a dance - and the chorale suddenly becomes
singable. All I'm trying to do is put the record straight, to believe
in the past. You don't set out to prove people wrong - you start as an
innocent, asking questions, and you stumble across these glaringly
obvious things.'

Norrington says he deals with every composer's music in the same way:
'I feel it, I get as much information as I can about it, and then I do
it. I want to obey both sides - the heart and the head, they're in
constant creative tension. You can have the best intentions to follow
what the composer wants, but after a couple of days in rehearsal you
may find you're doing it quite differently - and that's how it should
be. In the end, feeling is king. It has to be your own vision.'

For the past two summers he has conducted at the Rossini festival in
Pesaro. Was there much for him to contribute there? 'The management was
keen I should continue de-cloying Rossini - no high notes at the end,
cadenzas as written, decorations with taste, tempi not too slow. He
doesn't need to be livened up, but there's more allure in the phrasing
than he's given credit for. He's usually hijacked into 19th-century
style. But Zelmira was written in 1822. He went to Vienna and met
Beethoven. These are fully classical works, in the sense that Beethoven
is fully classical.'

Norrington's journey into the past is far from finished. He visits
Prague in May to give the first historically aware performances of
Smetana's Ma Vlast. Given the chance, he would also take the LCP to the
Festspielhaus at Bayreuth - 'the right orchestra in the right hall'. He
wants to play Tchaikovsky in St Petersburg, to do an 'Experience'
weekend on Berg, and to conduct Lulu, Les Troyens and Meistersinger in
the opera house. He dreams of reviving the Early Opera Project, with
which he toured Monteverdi's Orfeo in Italy in the 1980s. 'Historical
staging is in the same state as early music was in 1960. The material
is all there. It just needs a mad entrepreneur with the right theatre.'

Norrington admits that much of what he does is guess-work: it is a
hazard of the road he has chosen to take. He may go wildly wrong at
times - that is the result of his risk-taking - but none of his
performances has ever been dull or routine. Long may it stay that way.

Local heroes (7.30pm BBC2) is a little hymn to English eccentricity,
both in style and content. Adam Hart-Davies is a one-man store of
trivia (or general knowledge as it used to called in less ruthlessly
mercenary days) about inventions of the past including laughing-gas (I
always thought invented by Humphry Davy out of sheer boredom with
Bristol; eminently likely) and a spanking-machine.

For those who remember Richard Harris' play Outside Edge, first on
stage then on television with the incomparable Maureen Lipman, the
sitcom with the same name hasbeensomething of a disappointment. Its
characters verge on the caricatured and lack that consistency that even
sitcom creations should have. Still, a show that avoids aping American
comedy and even takes cricket as its theme is worth a plaudatory
chuckle (8.30pm ITV).

Great Ormond Street continues its gripping survey of the great

about the bramble bush and its dependent wildlife.

TALES FROM ARABIA: THEATRE

   By SIMON READE

There is no better place to tell a spell-binding story than in the
theatre, especially around Christmas, when we are at our most
childlike. This is the motivation behind Battersea Arts Centre's
ambitious current programme 'Telling Tales'. Alongside new Christian
fables and fresh glosses on the European tales of the Brothers Grimm,
it is refreshing to experience the contrasting oral tradition of
Persia: Alf Laylah Wa Laylah - Arabian Nights: The Tales of
Sheherazade.

The excitement starts when you enter the modest studio to find it
re-formed. We sit cross-legged in-the-round, raised above the courtyard
arcade beneath, peering into a shimmering arena which transforms from
king's bedroom to bustling bazaar, the banks of the Nile and the plains
between Cairo and Basra in the tiniest flicker of our mind's eye. 'This
hot land called Egypt' is conjured from nothing more than a fistful of
sand draining through a woman's fingers. Michael Gordon's direction and
Liz Cooke's design create a compelling environment for their dedicated
company of ten focused performers. 'Listen,' they command: 'Listen.'

It is the whim of King Shahrayar to execute his virgin brides after
only one night, as a means of purging his kingdom of unfaithful Woman.
He scapegoats them because of his own self-loathing: he murdered his
first queen in a fit of ill-founded jealousy. A strong-willed princess,
the Sheherazade, is determined to end this needless sacrifice, and
volunteers to be his bride, but only after she has told her sister a
bedtime story - beautifully in Arabic - which intrigues the King. So
she tells him more.

The stories selected by the company are not of the Boys Own 'Ali Baba
and the Forty Thieves' variety, but all craftily develop the
proto-feminist theme. Each tale has jealous husbands wrongfully
murdering their wives for imagined infidelity, or women enduring sex
and childbirth, and even broach pre-ordained marriage. This
interpretation of the exotic Arabic world of the Middle Ages as one
riddled with miscarriages of natural justice against women, pursues a
clear agenda, but not one which is worn on the sumptuous sleeves of the
women. The stories are elliptical, graceful and enchanting.

There are stories within stories, tales chasing their own tales, richly
interwoven like a magic carpet. The 75 minutes of storytelling does not
only reinvigorate a moribund king, but revivifies the wider audience.
Suitable for older children, it could run for 1001 nights.

AN ABSENCE OF INFLATION: THE FEELGOOD FACTOR IS SET TO REMAIN ELUSIVE
IN 1996, SAY MARTIN WEALE AND GARRY YOUNG

   By MARTIN WEALE

By most measures, 1995 was a good year for the UK economy. Inflation
remained subdued, output grew by more than 2.5 per cent, unemployment
declined by more than 200,000 and government borrowing fell, albeit by
less than was expected at the beginning of the year. In addition, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was able to take a penny off the basic
rate of income tax and cut interest rates by a quarter of 1 percentage
point.

This very favourable mix of growth and inflation is rare by British
historical standards and, while we think it likely to continue, there
are risks that the economy will not be as successful in 1996.

The most striking aspect of the present economic situation is the
virtual absence of domestically generated inflation at a time of
relatively fast growth and falling unemployment. This is partly a
reflection of the extent of disinflationary pressure in the UK labour
market. Since the peak in unemployment in 1993, wage increases have
shown no sign of picking up and real wages have scarcely grown. This
means that the benefits of increased productivity have been
appropriated into profit margins. These have risen substantially:
profits as a proportion of gross domestic product - at 36 per cent in
1994 - are higher than in the early 1970s.

One important question in present circumstances is whether the
surprising lack of growth in wage rates is evidence - as claimed by the
Treasury - that the sustainable rate of unemployment has fallen. In the
1980s and early 1990s it seemed that this figure was about 8 per cent
of the labour force. Certainly, when the unemployment rate fell to 5.5
per cent by 1990, there was a sharp acceleration in inflation which was
only squeezed out by the rise in unemployment during the last
recession.

Assuming productivity growth of 2 per cent a year, the rate of increase
in wages could probably rise from its existing level of 3.25 per cent
to 4.5 per cent per annum and still be consistent with annual inflation
of 2.5 per cent and very high profit margins. This suggests that
unemployment at 8 per cent is still above its sustainable rate.

It would be premature, however, to assume from this that the
sustainable rate of unemployment has indeed fallen. Unit labour costs
picked up noticeably in 1995 and in manufacturing were growing in
October at an annual rate of 4 per cent. This probably reflects the
stagnation of productivity associated with the slowdown in output. But
it may be an early indication that unemployment is reaching its
sustainable level.

If the sustainable unemployment rate has fallen, it will be possible
for output to grow for some time to come at more than its underlying
trend rate without generating inflationary pressure. This does not
guarantee that the chancellor's inflation target of 2.5 per cent by the
end of the present parliament will be met - the weakness of domestic
prices has been offset by increases in import prices arising from
sterling's depreciation of close to 7 per cent through 1995.

We expect the underlying inflation rate by the end of 1996 to be
slightly over 3 per cent. A better way of putting this is to say that
we think there is only a 40 per cent chance of meeting the inflation
target. There is also a risk that inflation will be substantially
higher if faster growth in import prices feeds through to domestic
prices.

This assessment depends on the outlook for demand, which appears to
have stalled in the second half of 1995, leading to fears that the
overall rate of growth in 1996 will be considerably slower. This time
last year the National Institute forecast growth of 2.7 per cent for
1995, and this is likely to be very close to the eventual out-turn. For
1996, we are predicting growth of 2.4 per cent, much lower than the
Treasury's forecast of 3 per cent.

Our forecast assumes that continued weakness in domestic demand will be
offset by higher export demand, helped by the fall in sterling in 1995.
Individual monthly figures are erratic, but it was gratifying to see
higher exports in November as an early indication of this trend.

We do not expect much of a feelgood factor to develop in 1996. This is
partly due to the very slow growth in wages.

There is at present much discussion about whether the economy will be
lifted by a surge in consumer spending, with the suggestion that
spending is depressed by consumer gloom inspired by fears about
employment prospects. But the truth is that consumers are behaving
perfectly normally. It looks as though they will have saved about 9 per
cent of their income in 1995 and we are expecting a similar figure for
1996. This is lower than in any year since 1971, except during the boom
period of 1986 to 1990 - and we doubt consumers are ready for a binge
like that of the late 1980s.

In spite of the pause in growth, we expect a continuing fall in
claimant unemployment to about 1.9m, or just under 7 per cent of the
labour force. This is partly due to changes in the administration of
benefits. While we expect some acceleration in wage growth, this will
be consistent with a downwards drift in the inflation rate as the rate
of increase in import prices subsides. Profit margins will stop rising,
but there will be no great pressure on them.

The main risk of this forecast is that demand will be weaker than
expected as a consequence of companies adjusting to an unintended
build-up of stocks, tight fiscal policy and possible weakness in demand
for British exports. In this event, inflationary pressure should weaken
further and we would expect to see cuts in interest rates to maintain
the economy's momentum as the next general election approaches.

In the longer term, we expect these favourable trends to continue. The
improved picture in the labour market will be backed up by slightly
faster productivity growth as the economy starts to benefit from the
recent expansion of higher education and, we hope, the more stable
macroeconomic environment established since sterling left the European
exchange rate mechanism. We can see the growth rate accelerating to 2.8
per cent and unemployment falling to 1.2m. This would not exactly be an
economic miracle, but it would at least make a pleasant change from the
years of stop-go.

Social Research, a UK research institute, and a member of the

NEITHER BOOM NOR BUST: CONDITIONS ARE NOT RIGHT FOR SHARPLY LOWER US
INTEREST RATES, SAYS STEPHEN S. ROACH


The financial markets always want more of a good thing. And that seems
to be the case in looking to 1996. It is fashionable to worry that the
US economy is soft and getting softer, and that inflation is heading
dramatically lower. In such an environment, the Federal Reserve is
expected to reduce short-term interest rates aggressively. Moreover,
with the budget deal of a lifetime finally thought to be at hand, most
forecasters expect a dramatic further rally in the bond market.
Needless to say, such a scenario hardly poses a threat to the glorious
bull market of 1995.

Our prognosis for the US economy in 1996 is at odds with many of these
presumptions. I expect neither a boom nor a bust. Real gross domestic
product is likely to expand in a 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent range -
essentially in line with what I believe to be the US economy's
underlying long-term growth potential. The case for upside growth
surprises is relatively straightforward. It is based on solid support
from three important macroeconomic forces: real income generation (at
present running above trend at 3.7 per cent); interest rates (which are
near historic lows); and the currency (which is vastly undervalued).

In such a constructive environment, I expect the US economy to show
surprisingly broad-based gains in 1996. With mortgage interest rates
down about 200 basis points over the past year, the turnround in the
residential construction sector should continue well into the new year.
And there should be no let-up in US business's record-setting boom in
capital spending.

This is a structural phenomenon - triggered mainly by spectacular
productivity breakthroughs - that should continue to be surprisingly
immune to the whims of the business cycle.

Upside surprises in the export sector can also be expected, reflecting
the combined effects of a supercompetitive US economy and more diverse
trade flows. The strong impetus for export growth in 1995 - with unit
volume growth accelerating from 4.8 per cent in the first quarter to
10.6 per cent in the third - stands in sharp contrast to widespread
fears that there will be an export collapse in a sluggish global
economy.

The good news is that the US is less dependent on its traditional
trading partners: sales to Europe and Japan have fallen to 34 per cent
of overall US exports, down sharply from 42 per cent at the end of
1990.

Finally, reports of the demise of the American consumer are vastly
exaggerated. With consumption well supported by income generation, I do
not share the widespread conviction that households are being dragged
down by excess debts. The ratio of annual debt servicing expenses to
income stands at present at 16.8 per cent, well below the highs hit in
the latter half of the 1980s. While I do not expect a consumer buying
binge, the forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in real consumption through
1996 is sufficient to account for over 1.5 percentage points of real
GDP growth.

The inflation prognosis is particularly intriguing. While I continue to
believe the cost-efficient, productivity-led US recovery remains
intact, I am now of the view that the inflation rate is slowly moving
up from its cyclical lows. The consumer price index rose 2.9 per cent
in 1995, up 0.3 percentage points from the low of 1994, and a little
more acceleration in 1996 is expected, to an annual rate of 3.2 per
cent.

I do not share the view that price stability is now at hand. The bulk
of the disinflation of the 1990s has been a by-product of an
extraordinary compression of labour costs. With productivity and
corporate profitability surging, with the unemployment rate at 5.6 per
cent, and with real compensation virtually stagnant for over a decade,
I do not accept the notion that a submissive workforce has no choice
but to capitulate further on wages.

In spite of the supposed threat of the dollar-a-day Chinese worker,
this strain of productivity enhancement has now gone far enough. The
days of asking the labour force to keep sacrificing for the noble cause
of disinflation appear to be largely over. The risk of a backlash from
workers is a growing concern - one that might have an important impact
on the sociology, politics and economics of the US for years to come.

As for the Fed, it is hard to accept the widespread conviction than an
aggressive monetary easing is now at hand.

Given the outlook for the economy and inflation, the urgency for a
further dramatic easing just is not there. Granted, the central bank
may offer a token easing in the aftermath of a budget accord. But if
market expectations of sharply lower short-term interest rates were
realised, the Fed would have to throw its traditional caution to the
wind. If it takes its commitment to price stability seriously, and I
believe it does, it is difficult to imagine the Fed turning away from
the restrictive policy bias that worked so well in the 1980s.

The budget is obviously the wild card. The problem is that it is still
business as usual in Washington. The best we are likely to see is a
plan based on back-loaded spending cuts, front-loaded tax cuts,
immunity for social security and dubious economic assumptions (for
example, that the perfect path of trend growth, low inflation and
declining interest rates continues forever). I have come to the
reluctant conclusion that the same creative mathematicians who gave us
Gramm-Rudman I and II and the great budget accord of 1990 are hard at
work today. Credible deficit reduction remains a dream, not a
certainty.

Adding it all up, it is hard to be thrilled about US Treasury bonds.
Everything good is just about priced into the market. On the chance
that a budget deal is struck - even if it is a classic smoke-and-
mirrors compromise - a final bull run to bond yields of 5 1/2 per cent
is possible.

But as reality sinks in, and the economy and inflation fail to conform
to market hopes, I continue to believe that the next big move in bonds
is back towards an equilibrium level of 7 per cent. I expect such a
correction to take place by mid-year, at the latest.

WAYS TO VIEW SUPPORT FOR STEELMAKING PLANT


From Mr George Becker.

Sir, In the US we have been reading with interest the reports that
British Steel is seeking to close an Irish steel plant on account of
subsidies that the Irish government is to provide.

In the US British Steel is seeking one of the biggest subsidies from
the taxpayer ever recorded in order to operate a steel plant in
Alabama, which British Steel is proposing to build in partnership with
an American and a Japanese company.

Support worth Dollars 250m is being sought from - and granted by - the
state legislature of Alabama in order to persuade British Steel and its
two partners to open the steel plant in the state. If built, the plant
will directly threaten the jobs of at least 3,500 steelworkers in other
parts of the country.

Without entering into the merits of the Irish steel plant's case, we
find it puzzling that British Steel is so hostile to subsidies in
Europe and so ravenous for them in the US.

Transatlantic trade and co-operation can not be built on this kind of
tilted playing field.

CANADIAN PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THE TRAPPER'S SNARE


From Ms Carla Bennett.

Sir, Thank you for Bernard Simon's comprehensive article ('Hunting for
a kinder kill', December 13). The trap research compound near
Vegreville is a ploy that illustrates how far the Canadian government
and the fur industry will go to preserve this barbaric industry.

The fur industry professes to champion Canadian native people, but it
has been the most destructive force in their history. It has exploited
them, their culture and their way of life. Native people do not
process, sell or store furs but are at the bottom of the fur industry
chain.

Because of the sympathy people feel towards the plight of the Canadian
native people, the Canadian government and the fur industry are
promoting the myth that trapping is culturally and economically central
to the native people.

Fewer than 50 per cent of native homes are fully serviced with sewerage
and water, native infant mortality is 60 per cent higher than the
average among other Canadians, and 70 per cent of natives have not had
a high school education.

Fur trapping has not and will not relieve these problems. It will
perpetuate them.

DIAGNOSING MIDDLE-CLASS ANGST


From Prof Peter Curwen.

Sir, In his otherwise excellent article on middle-class insecurity
('Bang go the great expectations', December 27), John Plender is surely
incorrect in claiming that an occupational pension is 'not an asset at
all'.

For the great majority of members of occupational pension schemes, the
pension is tied to the salary earned during the years immediately prior
to retirement and is unaffected by whether or not the company pays its
full contribution in every year.

It is certainly true that the benefits could be improved were
pension-fund surpluses to be used for that purpose, but the basic
payment is secure and does indeed form a substantial asset for the
pensioner.

The whole point about personal pensions, which yield direct ownership
rights, is that whereas the benefits are not tied to salary, and may be
much greater than under an occupational scheme, the risk element is
also much greater and hence the pensioner cannot rely upon the size of
the asset.

It is most unlikely that members of occupational pension schemes are
overly concerned about being 'disenfranchised', although they most
certainly detest those 'bosses' who manipulate their own pensions for
personal advantage.

Insofar that 'frustrated expectations' are the cause of 'middle-class
angst', it is not negative equity which is of direct concern since, as
John Plender notes, this has affected relatively few middle-class
households, but rather the possibility of falling house prices.

This is a very new phenomenon, and often accompanied by great
difficulty in achieving a sale, but it has no parallel in respect of
occupational pensions since their value is unknown prior to retirement.

OBSTACLES FACING THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY


From Ms Philippa Rann.

Sir, Martin Wolf's piece on whether democracies are growing in number
and influence, and to what extent democracies are less warlike than
autocracies ('Mightier than the sword', December 28) reminds me of
discussions 30 years ago on whether history moves inexorably in the
direction of communism, and to what extent communist governments would
decrease international tensions.

There are indeed powerful 'forces that are driving countries towards
representative political institutions', but there are equally powerful
forces undermining democracies from within. Democracies have been voted
out, and there is no evidence that the increasing gap between rich and
poor will not weaken many democracies.

It is curious that Protestant societies were the first to nourish
democratic institutions, and that no non-Protestant society has
sustained democracy for longer than 70 years. There is nothing
automatic about progress, and nothing inexorable about the direction in
which history will go: that will depend on the choices each of us
makes.

UK NEWS:
WHEN POLITICS REPLACES POLICY


Britain's general election campaign is under way in earnest. The
defection from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats of Miss Emma
Nicholson could not have been a more potent reminder of the fragility
of Mr John Major's government. The prime minister's parliamentary
majority is now down, in effect, to three. Further deaths or defections
could soon eliminate it entirely.

Mr Major appears determined to defer the election until the last
possible date in the spring of 1997, relying if necessary on the
support of the Ulster Unionists to sustain him in any vote of
confidence. Privately, opposition leaders admit that he may well
succeed in that objective. But, amid rumours of further defections,
ministers equally are obliged to acknowledge they can no longer be
certain of the parliamentary arithmetic. An autumn election is now a
real possibility if not yet a probability.

The prime minister would be wise to pay close attention to the message
of Miss Nicholson's defection. Since his leadership victory last
summer, Mr Major has been too anxious to appease his opponents by
speaking the language of the Eurosceptic right of the Tory party.
Whatever her personal motives for joining Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal
Democrats, Miss Nicholson's charge that the government has been
deserting the political centre ground finds a dangerous echo among
voters.

Rhetoric calculated to appeal to the more hardline Conservative
activists will not recover for Mr Major the support of the less
committed voters who will decide the outcome of the election. Mr Blair
has learned one of the golden rules of British politics - elections are
not won from the extremes of left or right but from the centre.

Gruelling business

Either way, the looming campaign promises to be a gruelling and
unedifying business. Politics, it seems, leaves little room these days
for policy. The normal business of government has been suspended. Mr
Major's legislative programme is designed above all to minimise
controversy within his own party and to highlight areas of difference
with Labour. Mr Tony Blair meanwhile concentrates on inflicting
tactical defeats on the government at Westminster. Those expecting
Labour to unfold a detailed blueprint for government are likely to be
disappointed.

As they make their promises and level their charges in the scramble for
votes, however, Messrs Major, Blair and Ashdown should pause for a
moment to reflect on a more worrying feature of British political life.
Politicians of all parties have rarely been held in lower public
esteem. They have themselves, mostly, to blame.

Wider developments

It is true that wider developments have contributed to a general
weakening of faith in the ability of politicians to 'solve' national
problems. Global markets have delineated more clearly the limits of
economic independence. The necessary sharing of sovereignty in Europe
has robbed Westminster of other pretensions. But to acknowledge such
trends is not to exonerate the politicians.

The important gap is not that between the limits imposed by the harsh
realities of modern life and the unreasonable demands of the voters.
The real disillusion stems from the gulf between promises and
performance. If politicians more readily acknowledged the constraints,
the voters would be more willing to adjust their expectations. Instead,
the parties wittingly exaggerate their power, promising easy solutions
to complex problems.

To take the most obvious example: the central debate about the right
levels of public spending and taxation is conducted with shameless
mendacity. One side promises painless tax cuts, the other perfect
public services. The reality is that modest rates of economic growth
will allow neither for the constant ratcheting down of income tax rates
promised by Mr Major nor the cost-free and comprehensive welfare state
pledged by Mr Blair.

It is perhaps too much to expect the politicians to mend their ways so
close to an election. But this erosion of trust and confidence in
parliament is inimical to good government and dangerously corrosive of
democracy. Ultimately, the politicians as well as the voters will be
the losers.

ITALY AND THE EU PRESIDENCY


For the fourth time in a row, the six months' presidency of the
European Union has fallen to a member state whose government is
severely distracted by domestic difficulties. It seems to be becoming a
bad habit. First there was Germany, with a general election in
mid-presidency back in 1994. Then there was France, with presidential
elections last May. The Spanish government in the past six months
managed to postpone its demise in order to complete its EU
chairmanship, in spite of losing its parliamentary majority.

Now Italy is supposed to take the chair, not even sure if it has a
government. Mr Lamberto Dini offered his resignation on Saturday after
completing his limited mandate. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro wants
him to stay on, but he is leaving it to the fractious Italian
parliament to decide. It hardly makes for firm leadership and a clear
agenda for Europe.

Those four Euro-enthusiastic governments were supposed to co-ordinate
their plans for the two-year period. They intended to lay the
groundwork for a clear-sighted and coherent inter-governmental
conference this year, which would mark another important step towards
the goal of European political union. Instead, the EU is stumbling
towards that target in a familiar state of muddle.

Spanish achievements

Admittedly, Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government in Spain achieved rather
more in the past six months than one might have expected from its
political weakness at home. It completed preparations for the IGC,
albeit with more modest ambitions than committed integrationists would
like. It persuaded the other 14 member states to agree a blueprint for
the launch of the single currency in 1999. It finalised a programme to
reinforce the fragile relationship between the EU and US. And it
organised an impressive gathering of Mediterranean states to cement
better co-operation between Europe, the middle east and north Africa.
Not bad for a lame-duck administration.

The challenge for Mr Dini, or any other head of an Italian government,
is to keep that good work going. At least he does not appear
over-ambitious. Italy has not tabled any heavy agenda of national
priorities, as other member states are sometimes tempted to do. A
successful launch to the IGC at the end of March is one priority;
agreement on a reconstruction plan for Bosnia is another. The former
should be a formality, but the latter could be a very difficult
negotiation: the European Union must be generous if it wants the peace
initiative in Bosnia to succeed, but every member state faces tough
domestic budget constraints, limiting the room for manoeuvre.

Difficult issues

There are always other difficult issues on the EU agenda which require
clear leadership from the presidency. In the next six months those
include the plans to liberalise the EU energy market; reform of the
Tacis aid programme for countries of the former Soviet Union; and
reform of the EU wine market. There is also strong German pressure for
agreement on a stabilisation package to regulate the behaviour of
member states after creation of economic and monetary union. These are
all issues on which Italy has clear national interests, and on which a
weak government in Rome may find it difficult to compromise, let alone
negotiate a deal.

A strong Italian government is out of the question for the foreseeable
future. At this moment, early elections would not solve the problem:
under the present electoral laws, they are unlikely to produce a result
much different from the present stalemate. President Scalfaro is right
to urge the main political factions to stop bickering and agree on a
programme of essential constitutional reforms. That could be enacted by
a broad-based cross-party coalition, as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
former prime minister, appears to favour - though this seems somewhat
unrealistic.

Alternatively, Mr Dini could be asked to serve on for another six
months, dedicated to the EU presidency and to securing the
constitutional reforms. That would be an acceptable compromise, in the
interests of Italy and Europe.

FEATURES & OPTIONS:
EUROPE UNLOCKED FOR DEALERS: ON THE FIRST DAY OF TRADING UNDER NEW
RULES BREAKING DOWN EU BORDERS, JOHN GAPPER AND RICHARD LAPPER ASSESS
WHO THE WINNERS AND LOSERS WILL BE


This morning NatWest Securities will commence trading on the Swedish
Stock Exchange from its offices in the City of London. For the first
time, the stockbroking arm of the British bank will buy and sell shares
in Swedish companies without having to do so through local brokers. 'We
can sit in London with a screen on our desks, and trade as if we were
in Stockholm,' says Mr Scott Dobbie, chairman of NatWest Securities.

The ability to trade securities across borders in this way is a product
of the European Union's Investment Services Directive (ISD), which
takes effect today. The directive aims to give Europe's thousands of
broking firms a 'passport' to trade anywhere in the Union, and is
accompanied by the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) which imposes fresh
capital requirements.

Progress in implementing the two directives is likely to be slow - by
December 31, only seven of the 15 EU states had passed the necessary
legislation. But whatever the delays, the changes are happening faster
than previous efforts to harmonise banking supervision. 'It is far more
complex, and it is having to be accomplished in a much shorter time,'
says Ms Jane Welch, head of legal advice at the UK Securities and
Investments Board.

And the impact on Europe's stock exchanges and derivatives markets will
be far-reaching. The directives are likely to favour larger investment
banks and stock exchanges, at the expense of smaller firms and
exchanges.

There are two key measures in the Investment Services Directive. The
first is that firms will be able to operate in any EU member state,
provided they are regulated in one of them. When operating outside
their home countries, they will be subject to rules on the conduct of
business devised by the local regulators for all banks and brokers.

For the larger banks already operating in more than one EU country, the
'passport' rule will reduce costs and ease the regulatory burden.
However, the directive is unlikely to make a significant difference to
their operations. Although there have been instances of member states
imposing strict requirements on foreign banks, most of them have been
able to operate where they want. 'We have never felt constrained about
crossing national borders,' says Mr Wilco Jiskoot, senior executive
vice-president for merchant banking at ABN Amro, the Dutch bank.

But for smaller firms operating in countries with no regulation for
securities traders, the directive will mean being regulated for the
first time - together with the accompanying costs, even if they are
operating purely in their domestic markets. They are also likely to
lose the share of commission and fees they make in carrying out local
business for large investment banks. From today smaller brokers will
have to find a substitute for such earnings if they are to survive.

The second key measure of the directive is to allow stock exchanges and
futures and options markets to trade throughout the EU. With increasing
volumes of equity dealing, derivatives business and bond market
transactions carried out electronically, this should in effect allow
brokers to conduct business from offices located anywhere in Europe.

The effect will be to increase competition between Europe's 32
securities exchanges and 24 derivatives markets. Already, for example,
the Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock and derivatives
markets, plans to extend its electronic network to several other
countries. Early this year it is opening an access point in London,
which will reduce the telecommunications costs for London-based
Deutsche Bo rse members to transact their business directly with
Frankfurt.

It is widely expected that many smaller exchanges could fold as these
pressures intensify. Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, chairman of the Matif, the
Paris-based futures market, expects a wave of restructuring with some
derivatives markets disappearing, either through merger or takeover.
'It will mean some substantial modification in the landscape of futures
and options exchanges in Europe,' he says.

Matif is planning to launch an ambitious joint electronic network with
the Deutsche Borse and two other French exchanges later this year which
would allow traders to deal in French and German equities over the same
screens. It would also cover a range of futures and options products.
'With the prospect of a single currency it all amounts to a new big
bang in Europe as far as the markets are concerned,' says Mr Pfauwadel.

One target for European exchanges such as Paris and Frankfurt is likely
to be the London Stock Exchange's Seaq-I electronic bulletin board,
which marketmakers use to advertise large blocks of European shares for
purchase and sale. Already, European bourses which have invested a
large amount on modernising their trading and settlement systems have
won back dealing business in local equities from Seaq-I.

But many market participants argue that large exchanges - particularly
London - are likely to gain rather than lose from the directive.
NatWest's strategy of trading increasingly on local exchanges rather
than on Seaq-I does not lessen its commitment to its main base in
London. Remote trading on overseas exchanges could help London's role
as the physical location from which traders operate by electronic
means.

Mr Giles Vardey, director of markets development at the London Stock
Exchange, argues that remote trading is now 'commercially inevitable'.
Mr Vardey accepts that competition from large exchanges will intensify,
but says smaller exchanges could suffer. 'Trading power is likely to
become concentrated in London, and the directive will hasten this
process,' he says.

The most immediate effects of Capital Adequacy Directive are likely to
be felt by the investment banks. They will be required for the first
time to allocate capital to cover risks of losses through adverse
movements in the markets for shares, bonds or currencies. At the
moment, banks have to allocate capital only to cover lending risks
under the 1988 Basle accord of international supervisors.

The new rules also demand that banks and securities firms monitor their
risks at all times keeping a permanent watch on large exposures. For
example, trading exposures to a single customer will have to be limited
in most cases to less than 25 per cent of capital base - and can only
be exceeded with the national regulator's permission. The larger banks
are best placed to comply with such demands, having invested huge
amounts over the past few years in systems to allow them to monitor
their exposure.

Smaller banks are less prepared. 'Developing the ability to spot large
exposures across the business is a significant headache for many
players,' says Mr Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury and capital
markets at Price Waterhouse, the accountants. 'It imposes a level of
integration that only the top few players have.'

In theory, the Capital Adequacy Directive could lead to some banks
having to set aside significantly more capital. But most banks believe
that the directive's impact will be minimal. Mr Ian Linnell, banking
analyst at Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, says for most
the impact has been 'neutral to marginal', and believes that some banks
will be able to operate with less capital than before.

However, there could be extra burdens for those banks which are heavily
involved in equities trading, for which Capital Adequacy Directive
rules are stiffer in some cases. For example, BZW, the investment
banking arm of Barclays, will have to put aside a little more capital,
according to Mr David Band, chief executive.

But the biggest impact so far has arisen from the need to invest in
upgrading technology to comply with the directive's requirements to
monitor group operations globally. Some of the bigger banks have spent
up to Pounds 5m on systems and software, and even the smaller firms
face minimum costs of Pounds 50,000 to pay for software. Mr Band says
there has been a shortage of technicians in London able to work on bank
systems. 'That has been a big problem for the market,' he says.

As the directives come into action this morning, the immediate
beneficiaries look to be the large investors who increasingly trade
across European borders and are likely to see a reduction in charges.
In the longer term, the winners will be the large investment banks,
many of which are now based in London. The losers will be the smaller,
less efficient brokers and the smaller exchanges that cannot find a
role as the EU's stock and derivatives markets become increasingly
integrated.

NATWEST SEEKS TOP GUN


* What will the NatWest Group do with Dollars 3.6bn that it is raising
from the sale of its US retail banking business to Fleet Financial? Not
so long ago NatWest was the biggest of the Big Four UK banks. Now it is
the smallest. So the money should come in handy helping fulfil its
ambition to transform NatWest Markets into one of the top 10 global
investment banks.

Although NatWest appears to have ruled out bidding for a a well-known
Wall Street name, like Lehman Brothers, it will have to buy something,
or someone, if it wants to be a serious player in the big league. In
October it paid a hefty Dollars 135m for Eric Gleacher's five-year-old
US mergers and acquisition boutique. Gleacher, 55, made his name
running Morgan Stanley's M&A department during some of the biggest
hostile takeover battles in the 1980s. Now he has made his fortune by
selling out to NatWest.

As long as Gleacher hangs around, NatWest Markets has a chance of being
taken seriously in the domestic US investment banking market. However,
Gleacher is not an international player and NatWest Markets desperately
needs to beef up its global investment banking team if it wants to
compete with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley etc.

Hence the owners of some European corporate finance boutiques must be
hoping that NatWest will be as generous to them as it was to Gleacher.
After all, when Morgan Grenfell was looking for a new chief executive
in 1987, it had to pay Pounds 15m for John Craven's Phoenix Securities
to secure Craven's services.

The obvious UK candidate is Hambro Magan's George Magan who worked for
Morgan Grenfell before starting his own boutique in 1988. He is a good
five years younger than Gleacher and has an equally impressive record
in the UK M&A market. But would Magan join NatWest Markets for less
than Gleacher?

Surely not. Once again NatWest may have to make do with second best.

Car maintenance

* What do you call a Trabant on top of a mountain pass? A miracle. And
what do you call a Yugo which looks like a submarine? A work of art.

Motorists stuck with unloved and unwanted Yugos, products of of the now
defunct Yugoslavian motor industry, can take heart. Kevin O'Callaghan,
a lecturer at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, has bought 39
abandoned Yugos for his art class. After six weeks tinkering they go on
display at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show.

The only thing that the exhibits have in common is that they can no
longer be driven. Apart from a submarine, the students have turned the
cars into such items as a giant telephone complete with push-button
numbers and handset; an accordion; a confessional - complete with
crosses; a grand piano which actually plays, and even a portable loo.

Collect call

* Who says Serbia's president is above the law? The home phone of
Slobodan Milosevic was disconnected last month because the bill went
unpaid while he was in Dayton negotiating a peace settlement for former
Yugoslavia.

However, justice was done in the end. According to Nasa Borba, a local
newspaper, the telephone company employee was fined 10 per cent of her
monthly wage, because she had failed to notice that the phone was on a
'protected list' registered in the name of the ruling Socialist party.

Honour guard

* Another New Year's honour's list has come and gone and dear old
Andrew Buxton, Barclays' chairman, has still not picked up his
knighthood.

There are lots of other good guys, such as the chief executives of
Shell and SmithKline Beecham, who have not got their Ks. But Buxton is
different. He is a chairman of one of the top dozen companies in the UK
and all his fellow chairman have titles. What has he done wrong?

Whether Buxton deserves a knighthood after 33 years with Barclays is
neither here nor there. But the latest honours list just goes to show
how little progress has been made in tidying up the present system of
honours for business folk.

Peter Wood, who created Direct Line, gets a CBE, whereas Graham
Kirkham, a fellow entrepreneur, gets a knighthood. Alan Jackson, the
departing chief executive of BTR, gets nothing. But Malcolm McIntosh, a
fellow Australian, gets his K for keeping down the cost of the Ministry
of Defence's weapons bill.

One can only hope that the leaders of big business who have not got
titles turned them down. But one suspects not.

Car wars

* South Africa has a problem. With one serious crime committed every 17
seconds it is getting a reputation as the most dangerous country in the
world which is not at war. However, it is also starting to make a name
for itself as a testbed for new measures to combat crime.

A group of insurance brokers has come up with a novel tip for motorists
when attacked by armed hijackers at a traffic intersection. Ram the car
in front. The hope is that the fuss will scare off the hijackers.

Great idea. The snag is that South Africa's hijackers already use the
same tactic to tempt drivers out of their vehicles. So when a motorist
receives a bump up the rear, it is either bad news or very bad news.

Safety first

* How do Eskimos cope with the snow?

They grit their teeth.

OVERSEAS NEWS:
EU STATES SLOW TO ADOPT DIRECTIVE ON INVESTMENT: ONLY SEVEN COUNTRIES
READY FOR CROSS-BORDER REFORM

   By ANDREW JACK in Paris with ANDREW FISHER in Frankfurt, ANDREW

   PARIS, FRANKFURT, MILAN, BRUSSELS


Only seven of the European Union's 15 member states were ready to
implement the Investment Services Directive when it came into effect
yesterday, the European federation of stock markets reported.

The directive is designed to allow non-bank investment groups to carry
out several activities more easily across borders.

It aims to create a 'passport' system allowing an institution regulated
in one EU country to operate in all the others without having to comply
with additional requirements.

Stock market officials in some countries say they have restructured and
are ready to meet the requirements of the directive but their
governments have not yet passed the necessary legislation. Other
governments have expressed concern about accepting the 'passport'.

Market officials say the seven which have to all intents and purposes
met the requirements of the directive on time are the UK, the Republic
of Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.
In some of these, however, the legislation itself still needs to be
passed. Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and France are expected to
introduce the legislation by the middle of this year. Germany, Greece
and Spain will not be prepared for full implementation until 1997.

Some countries such as France and Italy have used the enabling
legislation for the directive to push through broader financial
regulatory reforms, which has held up progress.

There are already strong links between the Frankfurt and Paris
derivatives markets which are expected to deepen in the coming months,
but the directive should extend links throughout Europe.

In Germany, this will create considerable new work for the Federal
Supervisory office for Securities Trading (BAWe), which was set up only
a year ago to root out insider traders and enforce compliance with
stricter disclosure requirements. Analysts believe the main effect of
the directive may be less to encourage financial institutions to open
offices in other countries than to change the location of where
transactions are carried out - reinforcing the position of those
markets which already have the greatest liquidity for any particular
security.

Mr Giuseppe Zadra, director general of the Italian banking association,
said he feared the focus of trading in Italian instruments could shift
to other markets if his country's institutions did not invest and
modernise. 'National markets don't have a future, and that's why they
will have to be changed and compete on a European scale,' he said.

The new rules have also raised fears there will be new risks for
investors because institutions receiving their passport in the country
with the weakest regulatory requirements will be able to obtain
recognition elsewhere.

'I have already heard anecdotally that some dubious firms from outside
Europe are looking for the best place to get initial authorisation,'
said one stock market official. 'The strength of the whole will rely on
the standards imposed by the least experienced regulator.'

CHANGES SOUGHT IN TERRORISM INSURANCE FOR CITY

   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent

Reform of the government-backed terrorist insurance scheme, which was
introduced after the 1992 IRA attack on the City, is being urged amid
fears that some companies may be inadequately covered.

The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers is worried that
businesses are having to pay excessively high premium rates, which are
forcing them to make a difficult choice between buying cover or risk
having to bear the cost of a terrorist incident.

Insurance industry estimates suggest that less than half of those
businesses which buy commercial property insurance purchase full
terrorism cover, although many have their own 'captive' insurance
companies providing dedicated insurance cover. Others could cover the
cost of an incident from other resources.

However, Ms Ina Barker, executive director of the association, said:
'The danger is that a lot of big businesses do not have enough
terrorism cover and are therefore putting business at risk.' Such fears
could intensify if the IRA ceasefire broke down.

Airmic hopes to hold talks with the Department of Trade and Industry
about possible reform to Pool Re, the state-backed mutual reinsurance
company. This was set up in 1993 to ensure that conventional insurance
companies could provide terrorism cover to commercial clients.

Pool Re members - which include most of the main UK-based commercial
insurance providers - have to provide terrorism insurance on fixed
terms and rates. Premiums collected by insurers are pooled and used to
pay any claims. If Pool Re runs out of money, the government would make
up the shortfall.

Since the IRA ceasefire was announced last year, premium rates have
fallen. But buyers and brokers say the system remains inflexible and
expensive.

Airmic is proposing a scheme in which all commercial property policies
would include a flat contribution towards the costs of Pool Re,
allowing a return to the automatic provision of cover against terrorist
attack. Debate in City, Page 7

PENSION FUNDS RAISE RETURNS BUT MISS OUT ON BIG US GAINS

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

UK pension funds recovered from their poor performance in 1994 with
investment returns averaging 19 per cent last year, according to a
survey by the WM Company.

Pension funds benefited from a return of almost 24 per cent on UK
equities, which make up more than half of their portfolios.

But they missed out on the big gains in the US stock market, which
returned 33.8 per cent last year. Only 4.3 per cent of the Pounds 380bn
of funds measured by WM was invested in US equities.

'Everybody thought the US was overpriced at the end of 1994 but it
really took off,' said Mr Peter Warrington, a director of WM, which
specialises in performance measurement.

He added that the longer-term performance of UK pension funds
demonstrated consistently impressive results. Whether measured over
five years or 20 years, they showed the same average annual return of
15.3 per cent, nearly twice the rate of inflation.

'In the mid-1980s, people were saying that equities couldn't go on
producing these high returns. We had disappointing years in 1990 and
1994, but over five years there is still a positive return of 16.7 per
cent on equities,' Mr Warrington said.

Property has proved a more disappointing investment for pension funds.
Although it was the best-performing sector in 1994, in 1995 property
produced a return of only 5.3 per cent, compared with a return for all
other sectors of 20.1 per cent. Over five years, property returns have
averaged 6.0 per cent, and property sank to 5.1 per cent of total
pension fund assets at the end of the year.

WM's survey, which covers about 80 per cent of UK pension funds,
reveals little change in the mix of assets held by managers, despite
widespread discussion of a tendency to 'rebalance' portfolios with more
fixed-income investments and less equity.

Some actuaries and investment managers have argued that pension funds
are maturing, with fewer members now actively contributing and more
receiving benefits. That should mean funds will increase bond holdings
to provide a more guaranteed stream of income.

But the funds measured by WM held 77.5 per cent of their portfolios in
equities last year compared to 76.6 per cent at the end of 1994.
Holdings of UK and overseas bonds, other than index-linked, also
increased, but only to 9.9 per cent.

'All the talk we have heard about funds maturing and moving into bonds
hasn't materialised,' said Mr Warrington.

FINANCE:
GOING FOR GROWTH: THE LEX COLUMN


It is perfectly reasonable to feel sanguine about the prospects for the
world's main financial markets in 1996, but it is difficult to get
excited. Inflation is low and apparently under control; growth may have
slowed, but most economies will still expand this year; and the US
economy's soft landing looks convincing enough.

But after last year's bull run, there is much less to go for. In 1995,
inflation fears proved overdone, allowing interest rates to be cut. The
resulting bond market rally, coupled with bid activity, fuelled
advances in stock prices.

Even though there are more interest rate cuts to come, the pace is
slowing and much of the benefit is already priced into both bonds and
stocks. Furthermore, the US market, which led the way last year, looks
rather overvalued. The stock market, having risen more than 30 per cent
last year, faces a proliferation of earnings downgrades. Since earnings
are not likely to fall off a cliff, a slowdown in economic growth does
not necessarily mean stock prices will stall. But the market looks
expensive relative to trend earnings and bond yields. Dividend yields
are low, even when share buy-back programmes are taken into account.
The benign economic environment probably rules out a 1987- style crash,
but a correction is not only likely, it would probably be beneficial.
And there are several potential triggers: the US budget agreement, for
example, has still to be thrashed out.

Europe

A correction in the US would hit the UK hardest, since it has benefited
most from the bull run. Although strong earnings growth is likely to
continue into 1997, the UK has other problems, including the growing
possibility of an early election, as the Conservative party's majority
dwindles. In fact, Prime Minister John Major is likely to hold on to
power until 1997 even without a majority, but any weakening of his
control over the election's timing will be viewed as a negative by the
stock market.

The UK also has more to fear from inflation than most other markets,
given its relatively rapid economic growth and an expected rise in
consumer spending. This will benefit some sectors, such as
housebuilding and retailing, but the danger is that any further rate
cuts in the first half of the year will have to be reversed in the
second - or worse that the government may try to ignore overheating of
the economy, since raising rates in the run-up to the election would
hardly be politically expedient. With gilts currently yielding twice as
much as equities, the balance looks about right. But inflation jitters
could cap gilt prices, halting further equity advances.

Further bid activity, as in the US, will help underpin stock market
prices, but estimates that the FT-SE 100 index, whatever early gains it
makes, will end the year around 3,750, less than 100 points above its
current level, are probably sensible.

In continental Europe, the problem is too little growth. This bodes
well for bonds. Even without further short-term rate cuts in Germany,
there is room for bond yields to fall. More generally, any signs that
the structural problems of high social spending and unwieldy budget
deficits are being addressed should encourage investors. Bunds and
other European bond markets may well outperform the US market in 1996 -
the problem is the strongest outperformance is often on the way down,
so it may be safer to bet on yield differentials than on absolute price
movements.

Japan

Tokyo's Nikkei-225 has ended the year roughly where it started, just
below 20,000, inviting the question of whether US and European fund
managers are right to increase their weighting in Japan. Few markets
have performed as well over the past six months. The index has gained
37 per cent since its July low, though the yen's decline over that
period has eroded more than half that gain when measured in dollars.
Currency risk will continue to bedevil foreign investors as economic
recovery sucks in more imports, further driving down the trade surplus.
But the attraction of Japan in 1996 is that it is the only leading
market set to benefit both from the early stage of an economic revival
and a pick-up in corporate earnings. A rise in sales should kick in, on
top of the margin improvements achieved over the past year.

On the surface, much of this recovery has already been discounted, with
the index standing at around 83 times prospective earnings - high even
by Japan's historical standards. However, a more useful guide to the
Nikkei's value is the ratio between equity and bond yields. Currently,
Japanese government bonds yield 1.5 times as much as equities, well
below the long-term average. As a result, Japanese institutions, heavy
net sellers of equities last year, may well favour equities over bonds
in 1996. The top Japanese life insurers and brokers have shed recent
pessimism and forecast a 1996 high for the Nikkei in the mid-20,000s.
They may be right.

Emerging markets

Emerging markets look cheap. On most valuation measures, a rebound is
already overdue. Last year's lacklustre performance partly reflects the
crisis of confidence following the collapse of the Mexican market at
the start of the year. In fact, international investors had little
reason to take the higher risks associated with emerging markets. US
fund managers in particular were able to make impressive returns in
their own domestic market.

But there are signs that US money is starting to move offshore again.
As fund managers are forced to look for growth outside the domestic
market, emerging markets are bound to get at least some of that money.
Typically, US managers have looked south of the border. But there are
still good reasons for avoiding Latin America, not only because of the
dire economic problems which continue to afflict some countries. The
main bond market is the dollar-denominated Brady bond market, which
would suffer from a US market correction. Slow growth, particularly by
emerging markets standards, makes stock markets relatively
unattractive, given the associated currency risk.

Asian stock markets look a better bet. Not only does Asia enjoy strong
economic growth and a cash surplus; the markets are likely to benefit
from funds from Japan, as well as the US and UK.

CHRISTMAS BRINGS CHEER TO TRADING STATEMENTS: UK RETAILERS

   By NEIL BUCKLEY

Expect to hear news of another strong Christmas as large retailers make
their January trading statements, writes Neil Buckley. Christmas
accounts for a large part of many retailers' annual profits. Reports of
a buoyant December and good start to the post-Christmas sales have
breathed life back into a sector depressed by gloomy results in the
autumn.

Three retailers thought to have had the liveliest festive seasons -
Argos, Dixons and Next - report next week. Argos should unveil a total
sales increase in double digits for the third Christmas running, while
Next is expected to have at least maintained the 10 per cent increase
reported in September. Dixons is forecast to report a 10 per cent
increase in like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, over
Christmas.

Also reporting the same week are Boots and Sears. In the former, strong
performances from Boots the Chemists and Halfords will be tarnished
slightly by sales declines in Do It All, and the Fads/Homestyle home
decorating business. For Sears, total sales are expected to be slightly
up, but like-for-like sales down.

The following week, Body Shop, Storehouse and Marks and Spencer are
forecast to report sales increases of at least 5 per cent. At House of
Fraser a like-for-like increase of perhaps 3 per cent is expected.

One year after the poor trading statement that sparked the departure of
four directors, Kingfisher is expected to reveal recoveries in
Woolworths and Comet, but falling sales in Darty, the French electrical
chain.

WH Smith is forecast to report a Christmas sales increase of up to 7
per cent in its interim results on January 24, while Burton, at its
annual meeting the following day, is expected to announce a continuing
improvement in sales and gross margins.

GREENBURY GUIDELINES WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST: OTHER COMPANIES

   By WILLIAM LEWIS

The Greenbury committee's report on executive pay will move into the
spotlight in January and February, with the publication of a
consultation document and several companies' annual meetings held under
Greenbury rules for the first time, writes William Lewis.

Next Monday, a consultation document on possible methods for disclosing
the true value of directors' pensions will be launched. The Faculty of
Actuaries and the Institute of Actuaries, together with the Stock
Exchange and the Department of Trade and Industry, are to send the
paper to public companies and are seeking their views by February 9.

The Greenbury committee's report, published in July, recommended that
pension costs be disclosed to shareholders to reflect the value to the
individual as well as the true cost to the company.

The Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries put forward a
preferred method but there were calls for wider consultation.

Many companies feared that directors' remuneration could appear to
increase by startling amounts under the new code. The consultation
document will include a number of options - including allowing for the
'smoothing' out of the effects of Greenbury.

Other Greenbury recommendations have already been put in place by some
companies and are due to be tested at annual meetings in the next few
weeks.

Bass and Burton, in their annual reports sent to shareholders last
month, were the first companies to give a separate remuneration
committee report on executive pay. Both companies' remuneration
committee chairmen will be answering shareholder questions on pay at
the meetings on February 8 and January 25 respectively.

Greenbury also recommended that companies seek shareholder approval for
new long-term incentive schemes. Burton and Capital Radio on January 17
will ask shareholders to vote through new schemes for executives at
their annual meetings.

Following the rule changes announced in the November budget regarding
the taxation of executive share options, Euromoney and Berisford are
asking shareholders to approve changes to their executive share option
schemes. Berisford's meeting is on January 22 and Euromoney's is on
January 18.

* Cable and Wireless: At an extraordinary general meeting on January
15, shareholders in the UK-based telecommunications group will have the
opportunity to question the board on the abrupt departures of the
chairman, Lord Young of Graffham, and Mr James Ross, chief executive.

The purpose of the EGM, however, will be to change the company's
articles to allow a non-British citizen to hold one of these top jobs.
This would allow the New Zealand-born finance director, Mr Rod Olsen,
to act as chief executive until a replacement is found.

* US companies: US investors are looking forward to some good news this
month as most companies start reporting their 1995 earnings figures.
Throughout the year, the quarterly numbers have produced pleasant
surprises, with results often beating analysts' estimates.

Analysts prefer to look at the 'operating earnings', excluding one-off
charges.

Forecasters expect the S&P 500 companies to announce earnings per share
totalling about Dollars 38 per share compared with Dollars 32 in 1994,
a rise of nearly 20 per cent.

* Banco Santander: Mr Emilio Botin, chairman of Spain's largest banking
institution, announces the group's 1995 consolidated results later this
month, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.

Santander raised its attributable profits after minorities by 5.9 per
cent to Pta63.3bn (Pounds 334m) in the first nine months of 1995, ahead
of market expectations, and said it had absorbed the impact of the
troubled Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), which it acquired in 1994.

* Fokker: Negotiations on a capital injection for the loss-making Dutch
aircraft maker are due to resume early in the new year, but there is no
indication when the rescue plan may be agreed.

Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany, the controlling shareholder,
and the Dutch government, a big minority shareholder, failed to agree
the package, believed to be worth more than Fl2bn (Pounds 808m), before
the end of 1995.

FORTE TO EXPAND THROUGH MERIDIEN

   By DAVID BLACKWELL

Forte, the UK's biggest hotels group, is planning a further 26 Meridien
Hotels in a push to expand internationally.

The move is expected to be announced in today's final defence document
against the Pounds 3.3bn hostile bid from Granada Group, the
television, catering and leisure group.

Forte is also likely to promise a special dividend or share buy-back if
the Pounds 1.05bn sale of its roadside businesses to Whitbread goes
through. Last week, the group agreed to sell its Little Chef and Happy
Eater roadside restaurants, Welcome Break motorway service areas and
Travelodge budget hotels to the UK brewing and leisure group. The deal
is conditional on the failure of Granada's bid.

The document is expected to include a promise to increase annual
dividends, which were cut from 9.91p to 7.5p for the year to January 31
1993 and were last raised five years ago.

The document will show that Christie & Co, the property surveyor, has
revalued the hotels upwards by Pounds 355m to Pounds 3.35bn, just over
10 per cent above the last estimate in January 1994 and representing
net asset value per share of 325p. This excludes the stake in the Savoy
Group, which Forte plans to sell.

The revaluation was dismissed by Granada, which said if the increase
had been added to assets on July 31 last year, the return on assets
would have fallen from 7.4 to 6.5 per cent. 'Frankly, this looks like a
bit of an own goal by Forte,' said Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief
executive.

Forte paid Pounds 280m to acquire the Meridien chain of 58 hotels from
Air France just over a year ago in order to give it a bigger
international presence. Of the 26 new projects under consideration, one
is in Manchester and all the others abroad, including Beirut and
Bangkok.

Most will be management contracts, although equity stakes have not been
ruled out. Expansion in the US remains a priority.

Sir Rocco Forte, chairman, said the main thrust for Meridien would be
overseas. The first year had been spent in integrating the business,
and Pounds 14m had been taken from head office costs.

'We have only just started,' he said. 'Now we will be much more
pro-active.'

Today's document will concentrate almost entirely on the hotels, giving
details of performance. Meridien is expected to have contributed 20 per
cent to group operating profits.

Operating profits from Forte's Exclusive hotels - including the Georges
V in Paris and the Grosvenor House in London - are expected to account
for 10 per cent of hotel profits, with other London hotels accounting
for 25 per cent. The Posthouse (including Crest) and Heritage
traditional hotels are likely to show contributions of 25 per cent and
20 per cent respectively.

NEW LOOK RETAILER SOLD TO INSTITUTIONS FOR POUNDS 170M

   By TIM BURT

New Look, the privately-owned fashion retailer founded by entrepreneur
Mr Tom Singh was yesterday sold to a venture capital buy-out group for
about Pounds 170m.

Mr Singh, who started the company in 1969 with a Pounds 5,000 loan, has
agreed to sell the 323-store chain to institutional purchasers led by
BZW Private Equity and jointly underwritten by Prudential Venture
Managers.

The sale follows New Look's abortive attempt to come to the market in
October 1994, which it abandoned the day before its scheduled flotation
amid fears it would not raise the estimated Pounds 150m it was seeking.

Under the terms of yesterday's deal, New Look's shareholders -
dominated by Mr Singh and his family trusts - will initially receive
about Pounds 105m in cash and shares worth about Pounds 50m in Vallsar,
an investment vehicle set up for the transaction.

That will leave the Singhs with 25 per cent of Vallsar, which is to be
renamed New Look. BZW Private Equity has also offered a further Pounds
15m payment contingent on New Look's performance in the three years to
March 1998.

Mr Gavin Aldred, New Look's director in charge of corporate strategy,
said proceeds from the disposal would fund expansion: 'In the 12 months
to March this year, we will have opened 76 stores in the UK and 10 in
France, and we aim to continue growing at about 50 outlets a year.' He
claimed New Look - advised by J. Henry Schroder - was Britain's most
profitable specialist women's wear retailer. In the year to March last
year, pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 6.01m to Pounds 15m
on sales of Pounds 141m (Pounds 83.4m).

Its rival Etam, by comparison, reported first-half losses of Pounds
3.85m in the autumn, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.74m.

Mr Graeme White, a director of BZW Private Equity, praised New Look's
operating performance and said the existing management would remain.

Mr White has joined an enlarged board of New Look as a non-executive
director, as has Mr Martin Clarke of Prudential Venture Managers. He
said the two backers had no timetable for an exit, but did not rule out
a fresh flotation attempt.

LONDON BRACES ITSELF FOR A REPO REVOLUTION: AN OPEN MARKET IN SALE AND
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR UK GOVERNMENT BONDS STARTS TODAY

   By RICHARD LAPPER and PHILIP GAWITH

Dealers in UK government bonds are today braced for one of the biggest
changes in the City since Big Bang 10 years ago.

The introduction of an open market in gilt repos, agreements to sell
and then repurchase government bonds, will allow all participants in
the market to borrow and lend stock, removing the monopoly over such
activity that a select number of firms have long enjoyed and bringing
the UK market into line with practices in the US and France.

The Treasury and Bank of England hope the changes will make it easier
for investors to trade gilts, increasing their attractions to overseas
investors and ultimately reducing the cost of funding government debt.
But in the longer term, the development of repos could also lead to
broader changes in the structure of the UK's short-term money markets
and in the way that the Bank of England manages liquidity.

'I'm not saying that repo is going to take off overnight but it is the
brave new world,' says Ms Una van Dorssen, director of repo marketing
at NatWest Markets.

In simple terms, a repo is an agreement to sell a security and then
repurchase it at an agreed future price and date.

One party to the deal 'borrows' money, using the security as a
collateral. The other party 'lends' the money and 'borrows' the bond,
in much the same way as a pawnbroker would take temporary possession of
valuables in return for a personal loan. But although the repo looks
like a loan, in reality it encompasses a disposal and a subsequent
acquisition, reducing credit risk in the event of default by either
party.

And in the international bond markets, repos play a more complex
economic function. Dealers frequently borrow money through repos to
fund the purchases of the same bonds, which are then committed as
collateral. Securities firms usually rely on this means to finance
their operations as they do not have access to the interbank markets
where banks lend to each other.

At the same time, dealers 'lend' money through repo agreements, in a
similar way to how they might place money on deposit with a bank,
although in this case they have the additional security of holding a
bond as collateral. At the same time, the 'borrowed' bonds can be used
to meet short-term trading needs. In the bond markets, dealers
frequently take short positions (sell bonds they do not own), when they
feel prices are likely to fall.

In the UK, the ability to carry out repos or to borrow or lend
government stock through stock lending agreements has been restricted
by law to stock exchange money brokers - effectively middlemen. In
addition, only gilt-edged market-makers, a group of more than 20
securities firms licensed by the Bank of England, have been allowed to
'short' the market.

The new, more liberal rules will make it possible for a much wider
range of traders and investors to operate in the UK gilts market. 'The
fact that it is now seen as a clear and open market will make it
attractive. It will encourage people into the marketplace. They no
longer see it as an esoteric market with rules of its own,' says Mr
David Brayshaw, managing director LM Money Brokers.

Ms van Dorssen at NatWest Markets says that with a deep and liquid
underlying market and a robust futures market in place, repo's
development will increase the range of strategies open to traders.

The impact of repo on the UK's money markets should also be
significant. 'It will be beneficial for the money market and should
help to restore liquidity,' says Mr Brayshaw. 'There has been a lack of
short-dated government paper that can be traded. Also, the overnight
market, which determines funding costs, has come to be dominated by a
small group of players.'

Ms Van Dorssen says cash managers will be able to place larger amounts
of money on 'a repo line' than on an 'unsecured deposit line'.

And in the short-term, at least until liquidity in the market picks up,
dealers expect repo rates to be close to the London interbank rates,
offering investors the double advantage of security and extra yield.

Nevertheless, traditional market participants may take time to adapt to
the new environment.

Some UK institutions, which currently earn a fee by lending stock on
their books to money brokers, may have to modify their systems and
learn new skills. Specialists in managing medium and long-term
investments, they may be less prepared for the demands of short-term
money market management necessary in the repo market. And dealers may
prefer to obtain finance through existing relationships with money
brokers.

In the long-term, however, dealing directly with other dealers and
investors through repos should become cheaper and more attractive. Mr
Simon Briscoe, chief UK economist at Nikko Europe, says money market
operators will respond to repo similarly to way in which British
motorists responded to the opening of the motorways in the early 1960s.

'It wasn't an immediate transition. Even though motorways allowed for
more traffic and bigger lorries people still use the A roads.' Step
away from tradition, Page 22

DISNEY AIMS TO PUMP UP THE VOLUME

   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which recently bid Dollars 19bn
(Pounds 12.2bn) for the Capital Cities/ABC television company, plans to
strengthen its presence in the music business.

It is believed to have joined forces in the autumn with PolyGram, the
world's largest record company, in an attempt to sign up Janet Jackson,
the US singer. Mr Michael Eisner, group chairman, wanted to sign her in
the hope that a high-profile star would raise Disney's stature in the
music market and attract other acts.

Under the terms of Disney's agreement with PolyGram, Ms Jackson would
have split her recording contract between the two groups. She would
have signed to Disney in North America and to A&M, the PolyGram
subsidiary which was her original record label, for the rest of the
world.

It now looks as though Janet Jackson will sign a new contract with
Virgin Music, the record label to which she has been contracted since
1991 when her A&M deal ended. Virgin, owned by Thorn EMI, the UK
leisure group, is thought to have out-bid Disney and PolyGram just
before Christmas, although it has not yet signed a contract with Ms
Jackson.

Mr Eisner is still keen for Disney to expand in the music market, which
is one of the fastest growing and most profitable areas of the
entertainment industry. Until now the focus of the group's music
interests has been its Hollywood Records subsidiary founded six years
ago.

Hollywood's performance has been erratic. It has released a number of
highly successful soundtrack albums under the Walt Disney record label.
The Lion King, the soundtrack to the 1994 animated hit, has sold more
than 9m copies in the US. But it has failed to become a force in the
marketplace.

One option for Disney would be to continue to try to attract
high-profile stars. This could be slow and expensive as there is fierce
competition among rival labels for best-selling acts. An alternative
would be to bid for EMI Music, the Thorn EMI division that owns Virgin,
which is expected to be demerged from the rest of the Thorn EMI group
next autumn. But Disney could face fierce competition from other North
American companies.

MEDIOBANCA TO GIVE FERFIN OFFER TERMS: NEWS DIGEST


Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, is expected to reveal
shortly the terms of its public offer to buy 158m shares of Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin), the holding company that controls the Montedison
industrial group.

The move has been forced upon Mediobanca after it lost two judicial
appeals against a public offer for an amount of shares equal to those
acquired in an October raid to gain control of Ferfin. The completion
of the offer will mean Mediobanca will hold 15.26 per cent of Ferfin,
with an estimated disbursement of L582bn (Dollars 367m).

Mediobanca finally accepted the ruling of Consob, the stock exchange
watch dog, late last Friday. It had initially lodged an appeal with the
regional administrative court of Lazio, and when that failed with the
higher court of the state council.

Pricing of the offer presents several problems. Principal among these
has been the L953bn Ferfin rights issue in mid-December. This came well
after Consob's first ruling that Mediobanca must make a public offer.
Before the rights issue, analysts suggested L1,580 per share
represented the average price paid by Mediobanca in its October raid on
Ferfin.

But just before the rights issue they were suspended at L1,056; and
Consob announced only shareholders on the register before the issue
could be the subject of Mediobanca's public buy offer. This point is
apparently being questioned by Mediobanca's lawyers.

Analysts also pointed out that by being obliged to acquire 15 per cent
of Ferfin, the outlay represented over 10 per cent of Mediobanca's
assets, a large exposure.

Health groups abandon merger

After a busy year of consolidation, the US healthcare industry ended
1995 on a sour note with the formal dissolution of a Dollars 1.6bn
merger that would have created the country's largest managed care
organisation.

WellPoint and Health Systems International, two Californian healthcare
groups, abandoned a merger agreement reached last April. Friday's
development came two weeks after the two organisations announced they
were in discussions to break off merger talks, and follows indications
that executives from each side were unable to reach agreement on how to
share power in the new company.

The merger would have created a West Coast giant with the financial
muscle to acquire other managed care groups around the country. The two
had listed the ability to grow beyond their Californian base as a key
reason for the combination.

Under the terms of the all-stock deal, shareholders in Health Systems
would have received 45 per cent of the shares in the combined group.
However, the two sides are believed to have been unable to agree on
what role the smaller company's managers should play after a merger.
The deal would have provided the springboard for a far more widely-held
public company than either is at present.

Richard Waters in New York

Maculan, the troubled Austrian construction group, said creditor banks
had agreed an extensive financing package to salvage the company in its
entirety.

The financing measures include cash-credit lines worth Sch910m (Dollars
90m) which will be divided between the group's Austrian and German
creditor banks according to the previous volume of credit granted. In
addition, the creditor banks and credit insurers will make guarantee
lines available, totalling Sch770m, Maculan said.

Maculan Holding in turn has undertaken to forgo the repayment of
shareholder loans made to its operating subsidiaries with a total
volume of some Sch938m. Reuter, Vienna

Tabacalera, the partly-privatised Spanish tobacco company, has sold its
lossmaking dairy subsidiary La Lactaria Espanol SA (Lesa) for Pta4bn
(Dollars 33m).

Tabacalera acquired Lesa, Spain's biggest milk company with 10 per cent
of the market, in 1988. The buyers, the milk companies Leyma and
Iparlat, will also assume Pta5bn of Lesa bank debt, guaranteed by
Tabacalera. The state's Official Credit Institute is providing the
buyers with an Pta8bn loan to pay Lesa's debts and restructure the
company. Reuter, Madrid

VICTORS AND VICTIMS OF BOARDROOM UPHEAVAL: TIM BURT LOOKS AT THE HIGH
NUMBER OF COMPANIES STARTING THE YEAR WITH A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP


An unprecedented number of Britain's leading companies are beginning
1996 with newly-installed chairmen and chief executives following a
year of boardroom upheaval.

Groups such as BAT Industries and Inchcape have new chairmen, while
British Telecommunications, BTR, BOC, WH Smith, and electronic
components manufacturer Bowthorpe are among those to bring in new chief
executives.

Their arrival - mostly part of a smooth succession - comes after a year
in which other high-profile directors became boardroom casualties,
including Lord Young and Mr James Ross, chairman and chief executive
respectively of Cable & Wireless.

Mr Tiny Rowland left Lonrho after losing his long-running battle with
Mr Dieter Bock, the trading group's chief executive. Other departures
included Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential; Mr Richard
Reynolds, a director of GEC; Mr Howard Robinson, chief executive at
Calor Group; and Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman of Wembley.

Russell Reynolds, the UK's largest headhunter in revenue terms, said
the number of arrivals and departures reflected the growing influence
of institutional shareholders and non-executive directors in bringing
in new management.

'We're seeing a trend that when companies are having a very difficult
time the executives are being brought to account,' said Mr David
Shellard, managing director.

He cited the Cadbury committee on corporate governance as one factor
behind the increased turnover among company directors, while adding
that the Greenbury committee on executive remuneration had focused
shareholder attention on performance-related pay.

Heidrick & Struggles International, the London-based executive
recruitment agency, said the rash of outside appointments also
signalled a growing skills shortage at board level. Mr John Viney,
chairman, said: 'There are simply too few people to go round. So we're
seeing the best, such as Sir Colin Marshall, taking on two or three
roles.'

Sir Colin, chairman of British Airways, yesterday became non-executive
chairman of Inchcape, the international marketing and services group.

'Inchcape has not been in the best of health,' Mr Viney added. 'They
know it's much better to have a top-class person - even if only for one
day a week - than someone less effective,'

Among the other new arrivals this month, Lord Cairns, who last year
resigned as chief executive of SG Warburg, the investment bank, becomes
chairman of BAT Industries.

Mr Ian Strachan succeeds Mr Alan Jackson as chief executive of BTR. Sir
Peter Bonfield, knighted in the New Year honours, moves from computer
group ICL to be chief executive of BT. Mr Bill Cockburn has become
chief executive at WH Smith.

Mr Tim Parker is taking over as chief executive at CJ Clark, the
shoemakers. Mr Nicholas Brookes is the new chief executive at
Bowthorpe. And BOC, the industrial gases group, will mark its annual
meeting later this month with the appointment of Mr David John and Mr
Danny Rosenkranz as new chairman and chief executive respectively.

NATIONWIDE LOOKS TO LIFE OPERATION

   By ALISON SMITH, Investment Correspondent

Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, is looking to its
new life assurance and unit trust subsidiaries, which open today, to
enable it to reduce its dependence on mortgage-related financial
services.

The new operations replace the relationship in life assurance that
Nationwide has had with Guardian since the beginning of 1990s.

Mr Tom Boardman, managing director of the two new subsidiaries, said
that whereas in selling Guardian's financial services about four-fifths
of Nationwide's business was mortgage-related, he hoped that within a
couple of years this could be reduced to about half.

This strategy seems to acknowledge that endowment mortgages are
becoming less popular and that any recovery in the housing market over
the next couple of years is unlikely to match the pace of the 1980s.

Nationwide has also set itself the target of winning 70,000 financial
services customers in the first year - about 1 per cent of its total 7m
customer base.

This is more ambitious than the 40,000-plus financial services
customers it is thought to have gained each year during the six-year
tie with Guardian.

The new life company will sell term assurance, a mortgage endowment
policy, a guaranteed equity bond and a personal pension plan. The unit
trust operation will sell two unit trusts - a UK growth fund and a
balanced fund which includes an element of overseas exposure.

Apart from the policies it designs itself, Nationwide Life will also
sell a permanent health insurance policy bought in from PPP, the
healthcare company.

This is a smaller and simpler range than the Guardian policies which
Nationwide has been offering, but Mr Boardman said the straightforward
nature of the products should help to keep costs down. He believed the
range was still broad enough to meet most customers' needs.

For Nationwide, as for other mortgage lenders which have set up their
own financial services businesses, a key element will be to market
these products to the entire customer base - savers as well as
borrowers.

Initially, Nationwide's salaried financial services sales force will be
made up of about 340 agents and will grow to 380 by the end of
February. Just over half of these will be branch-based, with the
remainder available to visit customers.

FRENCH BANK SEEKS SHORT-TERM FINANCE

   By ANDREW JACK in Paris

   PARIS


Credit Foncier de France, the specialist French property bank, is
considering obtaining a substantial short-term bridging loan while it
undertakes a wide-ranging restructuring plan.

Bank executives are believed to be discussing the idea of seeking a
loan from a commercial bank, secured on its assets, which would last
about three years.

Separately, they are holding talks with the government about short-term
ways to stave off the growing financial crisis triggered by the
withdrawal of its monopoly rights over certain state-backed housing
loan schemes.

The idea is to provide the bank with time to introduce a restructuring
programme which could reduce costs by 30 to 40 per cent in as little as
the next two years, including job cuts and the possible sale of some of
its central Paris offices.

However, executives want to reduce staffing without any redundancies so
they are likely to extend the length of their programme to at least
three years.

They are also discussing refocusing the bank, possibly by withdrawing
from activities such as loans to property developers and local
authorities, and concentrating on core activities of loans to low and
middle-income housing projects.

Credit Foncier's ability to raise funds on the capital markets has been
tightly restricted recently because its share price has dropped sharply
and its credit rating has fallen.

It was dealt a severe blow during December when the French stock market
regulators recommended against it proceeding with a proposed merger
with its 55 per cent-owned subsidiary, Societe des Immeubles de France.

The deal would have provided a much-needed FFr1bn (Dollars 204m) boost
to its balance sheet. It is now looking at other ways of achieving a
recapitalisation.

The bank is also likely to discuss with the French government, in the
medium-term, a change to its legal statutes to make it more like its
private sector competitors.

Although it is a quoted company without any state shareholding, the
government appoints its chairman or 'governor'.

HYUNDAI TO ACCELERATE DECENTRALISATION: SOUTH KOREA'S BIGGEST
FAMILY-RUN 'CHAEBOL' IS MOVING WITH THE TIMES, SAYS JOHN BURTON


Mr Chung Mong-koo, Hyundai's new chairman, is likely to preside over
the gradual break-up of the giant family-owned South Korean industrial
group his father established in 1947.

That, however, is the way Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, wants
it. In an attempt to avoid a family fight over the Hyundai empire after
his death, Mr Chung decided several years ago to divide it among
several of his sons and nephews by transferring his stock in most of
Hyundai's 45 companies to them.

The result has been the creation of smaller and decentralised groups
within Hyundai that amount to a confederation of allied companies.

The process is expected to accelerate with the recent formal transfer
of management control from the elder Mr Chung and his brother Chung
Se-yung, who succeeded him as chairman in 1987, to their sons.

Hyundai's restructuring, which is expected to benefit the group, could
serve as an example to Korea's other conglomerates, or chaebol. The
chaebol have been widely criticised for being too big and inefficient
while fierce competition, for example, has led to duplication of
activity.

Government officials have long urged them to abandon many of their
marginal businesses and concentrate on a few specialised industrial
sectors to improve their global competitiveness.

Splitting Hyundai into smaller groups is expected to help achieve these
goals. Each mini-Hyundai group focuses on only a few industries, and
these units are less able to support unprofitable activities than they
were within the old monolithic structure.

Under a reorganisation plan announced a year ago, Hyundai was divided
into six main groups, with almost all now controlled by one of Mr
Chung's sons and nephews.

The most ambitious of the new sub-groups is the one controlled by Mr
Chung Mong-koo, the new Hyundai chairman and eldest surviving son of
the Hyundai founder.

In 1977, he established Hyundai Precision & Industry as a cargo
container company, which became the world's largest. Hyundai Precision
now produces railway engines and carriages, sports and utility
vehicles, and military equipment. It also plans to enter the aerospace
sector, assembling aircraft and satellites.

Mong-koo also controls Hyundai's small steel operations, which he wants
to expand by building a large mill that would supply steel to Hyundai's
car and shipbuilding operations.

Mr Chung Mong-hun, his brother and the new Hyundai vice-chairman, has
developed Hyundai Electronics into one of the world's biggest producers
of computer memory chips in less than a decade. Another brother, Mr
Chung Mong-jun, controls Hyundai's shipbuilding operations, the biggest
in Korea.

Hyundai Motors, Korea's largest car company and considered the group's
crown jewel, is being taken over by the family of Mr Chung Se-yung, the
brother of the Hyundai founder. His only son, Mong-kyu, has been
appointed as the car company's new chairman at the age of 33.

Mr Chung Mong-hyuk, another nephew of the Hyundai founder, has been
named new president of Hyundai's petrochemical and oil refining
companies, another growth area.

Other main Hyundai companies, including its trading house and
construction company, remain under the control of the group founder.

A formal break-up of Hyundai is likely to take some time since the
group is held together by a complex web of cross-holdings. These ties,
however, should weaken as the government imposes limits on
cross-holding arrangements in attempt to reduce the economic dominance
of the chaebol.

Family solidarity is also expected to prevent an early break-up of
Hyundai. The Hyundai companies are likely to operate on the same basis
that Mr Chung Ju-yung has established with several of his brothers, who
have created their own small industrial groups that partly depend on
Hyundai for business.

Hyundai Motors, for example, is the biggest customer for the motor
vehicle parts company of the Halla group, founded by Mr Chung In-yung.

Nonetheless, internal conflict may also increase as rivalry grows
between the Hyundai companies. Hyundai Precision, for example, is
challenging Hyundai Motors by producing four-wheel drive vehicles and
mini-vans.

A looser organisational structure may also make it more difficult to
push through large projects that were once easily tackled under the
autocratic management style of the Hyundai founder.

Analysts will also be watching closely to see whether the new Hyundai
chairman can gain group support for his projected Dollars 10bn steel
mill, which has been criticised by some Hyundai subsidiaries as
unnecessary.

NETSCAPE LEADS THE FASHION FOR US NEW ISSUES: FT WRITERS LOOK AT THE
BEST PERFORMING SHARES AROUND THE WORLD IN 1995


New issues - if you could lay your hands on them - were the hottest
performing stocks in the US last year, with Netscape Communications,
the Internet company, racing to the fore, writes our New York staff.

The market for initial public offerings was more active than it had
ever been, but the few sceptics that remained claimed this was a sure
indication the US market was way out in front of most traditional
valuations measures.

Netscape, which produces a browser for the Internet, was floated in
August at Dollars 28 a share, and by year-end it was trading at Dollars
139, having reached a peak in early December of Dollars 174.

Other strongly performing new issues included Pixar, which handled the
animation for Disney's latest hit film Toy Story. It floated at Dollars
22 just after the film's opening at Thanksgiving, and quickly reached a
high of Dollars 49 1/2, although by year-end it had fallen back to
around Dollars 28 7/8.

Many of the new issues were in the technology sector, which had led the
market higher for much of the year, although towards the end of the
year many of these stocks faltered as growth in semiconductor sales
slowed.

The technology sector's performance should not obscure notable gains in
other sectors. Lower interest rates and hopes for productivity gains
made bank and insurance company shares among the best performers.
Banks, deep into a round of mergers, recorded gains of more than 50 per
cent.

Steel companies, most of which crawled back into profit only in 1994,
managed the dubious distinction of forming the worst-performing stock
market sector.

Another poor performer was the retail sector, which ended another
difficult year with a disappointing Christmas.

Construction falls

Building sites abound in German cities and cranes cover the Frankfurt
skyline, but construction shares headed remorselessly downwards in
1995, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. The sector's share performance
slumped by 33 per cent and 1996 is not expected to show much, if any,
improvement.

By contrast, the electrical and electronics sector had a strong year,
adding 34 per cent. Apart from Siemens, reaping the benefits of its
aggressively profit-oriented restructuring, the sector contains SAP,
the fast-growing producer of business software. SAP's share performance
has been meteoric in the past two years, though it has slowed recently.

Commerzbank, whose own new headquarters is taking shape in Frankfurt,
estimates that profits of quoted construction companies will rise a
mere 2 per cent in 1996 after 6 per cent in 1995. The German commercial
and homes building boom is now over, with public sector construction
also held back by budget constraints.

Mr Ingo Mainert, a Commerzbank analyst, says stocks likely to perform
in line with or better than the overall market this year include
motors, steel, electricals and electronics, and insurance.

The bank foresees the DAX index rising to 2,500 or even 2,600 points
after it closed on Friday at 2,254, a rise of 7 per cent on the year. A
year ago, the bank had hoped for 2,400 but the weak dollar and higher
than expected pay rises threw out its calculations.

For electrical and electronics companies, Commerzbank expects an
overall profits rise of 21 per cent this year after 22 per cent in
1995. Earnings in the steel, engineering, motor and metal industries
should show steeper rises, it says. Further markets will be covered
over the following days.

THOMAS LOCKER'S BID FOR PENTRE ATTACKED

   By TIM BURT

The largest shareholder in Thomas Locker yesterday claimed the
engineering group was seeking a reverse takeover with its proposed
Pounds 7.5m bid for Pentre, the industrial drums manufacturer.

Mr John Carr, who holds 22.6 per cent of Thomas Locker's ordinary
shares, said the purchase price overvalued Pentre: 'The shareholders of
Thomas Locker not only get no premium for the very significant value
inherent in the company they own, they are being asked to approve a
scheme that will lose them control.'

Mr Carr, who acquired his stake in the company last May, urged
shareholders to reject the acquisition, which is being funded by the
issue of 8.62m new and 25.9m A ordinary shares. He also condemned as
inadequate a proposed 3-for-10 scrip issue of additional ordinary
shares, designed to compensate ordinary shareholders for the loss of
voting rights.

The dissident shareholder, advised by KPMG, said there was no logic for
Thomas Locker in acquiring Pentre, which he claimed was burdened with
Pounds 6.9m borrowings.

Neither company was available for comment.

MARKETS:
ANXIOUS EYES FOCUS ON COPPER


London Metal Exchange dealers returning from their festive break today
will be anxious to ascertain the new year mood of the copper market,
which is likely to set the tone for other base metals contracts as
well.

Last week's lightly-traded inter-holiday period ended with the copper
market close to its 1995 low as stocks soared towards the excessive
level at which they ended 1994. At 296,425 tonnes they were more than
double the July low.

With further rises in stocks expected, analysts and traders were
predicting further falls this week. '(Stop loss selling orders) were
triggered below Dollars 2,665 earlier today,' one trader told the
Reuters news agency on Friday afternoon, 'and more are likely to be
lurking below Dollars 2,650. . . copper is back on shaky ground.'
Several analysts forecast that copper would drop to Dollars 2,500 in
the medium term as new production capacity came on stream and stocks
continued to accumulate.

The steady increase in stocks over recent weeks has been encouraged by
big premiums available for immediate delivery at the LME. As the stocks
have risen these premiums - known as 'backwardations' - have narrowed.
'If stocks keep rising, and we do expect they will, then the spreads
should come in even more,' Adam Rowley of Macquarie Equities told
Reuters.

'At some stage in the first quarter of 1996 we are looking for quite a
sharp fall in copper prices,' he added.

'With February/March at Dollars 80 to Dollars 90 backwardation it looks
as if this period will stay tight,' said Wolfgang Becker of Iceni
Commodities Brokerage. 'Obviously at some stage the whole thing will be
reversed, but this sort of stock rise may be a bear trap.'

Options traders told Reuters prices could overshoot downside targets if
hedging against large put (selling) positions below the market gathered
pace. 'We are just waiting for copper's resilience to end and when it
does the market could collapse,' one said.

ASSESSING THE POWER OF MULTINATIONALS: GLOBAL INVESTOR / TONY JACKSON
IN NEW YORK


A noisy debate has broken out in that quiet retreat for the weekend
reader, the book review section of the New York Times. It revives an
issue which some might have thought buried: the power of the
multinationals. It is also a useful reminder that the triumph of free
trade - an idea implicit in most investment strategies today - cannot
be taken for granted.

The opening salvo came in a review by the political theorist Mr Francis
Fukuyama of a book called Opposing The System. The book, by a veteran
leftist Mr Charles Reich, reportedly argues that the current social
malaise - poverty, unemployment and so forth - has been engineered by
large corporations for their own benefit. Therefore, it says, the
powers of government should be increased to control them.

Mr Fukuyama regarded this as 1960s claptrap. The remedies proposed by
Mr Reich, he argued, had got us into this mess in the first place.
Poverty and crime were caused not by big companies, but by big
government.

Enter stage left another 1960s veteran, the consumers' champion Mr
Ralph Nader. Big corporations, he wrote in reply, erode democracy,
export jobs, and weaken the legal safeguards for workers, consumers and
the environment. 'Until Mr Fukuyama understands that a society rots
from the head down and that corporate power needs analysis, he will
never understand Mr Reich's thesis,' he concluded.

So far, so familiar. But the role of the multinationals is becoming
part of a wider issue: that of free trade. If you believe that free
trade is destroying jobs and damaging society, you are bound to blame
the multinationals as its agents.

As another book recently put it, global free trade 'will impoverish and
destabilise the industrialised world, while at the same time cruelly
ravaging the third world.' The author is no 1960s leftist, but the
erstwhile corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith.

As a blend of right-wing populist and born-again environmentalist, Sir
James forms an unlikely bridge between the two wings of protectionism.
On the right, he is joined by the US presidential candidate Mr Pat
Buchanan and by the fellow-billionaire Mr Ross Perot.

On the left, he links with those who argue that free trade enables bad
environmental practice to drive out good: that through the agency -
again - of the multinationals, production will gravitate to countries
free from costly environmental controls.

Those who feel paranoid about the unholy alliance of free-trade
governments and big business can point to one central fact. As the
chart reminds us, world trade has indeed been growing rapidly in
relation to the world economy since the late 1980s, having previously
grown in line.

But are corporations growing in proportion? The evidence is mixed. Last
year, the three biggest US companies by revenues, as listed by Fortune
magazine, were General Motors, Ford and Exxon. Their combined sales of
Dollars 384bn (Pounds 249.3bn) were equal to 5.7 per cent of US GDP.
The figure for the same trio 20 years before was 6.7 per cent.

But if US multinationals are not bigger, they may still be more
powerful. Arguably, modern communications and the lowering of trade
barriers give them much more opportunity to arbitrage labour and
capital around the world. Hence the solution of such as Mr Buchanan:
put the barriers up again.

It might be thought that the impulse to free trade is politically
unstoppable: and indeed, that in the coming world of the Internet the
genie cannot be put back in the bottle anyway.

Not everyone in the investment community agrees. The highly successful
investor Mr George Soros, for instance, argues that electronic trade is
not intrinsically different from the old kind, just faster. It would be
perfectly feasible to re-impose exchange controls, he says. Single
countries could not do it, but groups of countries could.

Mr Soros is gloomily convinced that the present world order, which he
regards as a golden age of capitalism, will ultimately break down. The
last comparable period, he says, was the end of the 19th century. In
those days, 'the British Empire was at the heart of the system, and had
an interest in maintaining security. When there was trouble, it sent a
gunboat. Now there is no chief beneficiary (from stability): certainly
not the US.'

Should the average investor worry about all this? Not for the time
being, perhaps. Both of the likely protagonists in next year's US
presidential elections, Mr Clinton and Mr Robert Dole, are professed
free traders: although both will bear watching for signs of concessions
to their respective outer wings.

The point is rather that the case for a prolonged global bull market
contains an internal contradiction. On the one hand, we are told that
multinational corporations are enjoying a one-off shift to greater
productivity and cheaper labour, based largely on the globalisation of
markets. On the other, we are told the globalising process does not
entail empoverishing one set of workers to the benefit of another. Free
trade means faster growth, so the pie gets bigger.

This worked very well for small countries like Taiwan and Korea, which
were able to develop and open up at their own pace. It is another
matter, to paraphrase Sir James Goldsmith, when political upheaval,
modern communications and the liberalisation of capital movements hurl
4bn workers into the world economy in the space of a few years.

Hence the internal contradiction. Proponents of the bull market argue
that the shift in power between capital and labour is profound enough
to last for a generation. The question is what that generation will
make of it. If it feels disposed to rebel, global free trade could be
the first casualty.

TIME TO REWRITE INFLATION TARGET: ECONOMICS NOTEBOOK / ROBERT CHOTE


Over the last five years many countries have adopted formal targets for
inflation as the centrepiece of their economic policies. But turning a
vaguely expressed enthusiasm for low inflation into a precise numerical
objective is not as straightforward as it sounds.

For one thing, policymakers face a trade-off between the need to
establish credibility and to demonstrate humility. Any target has to be
demanding enough to persuade people that the authorities are serious
about achieving low inflation; but it cannot be too demanding because
credibility will then be lost again when the target proves impossible
to hit.

In 1992 Britain adopted a formal inflation target comprising three
objectives: underlying inflation between 1 and 4 per cent until spring
1997; between 1 and 2.5 per cent in spring 1997; and below 2 per cent
in the long term. The most demanding element soon slipped from public
consciousness, but the first two stayed in place. By last summer,
however, the remaining target had to be updated. Interest rate changes
take about two years to affect prices, so it was becoming too late to
do much about inflation within the target period.

Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced therefore in his Mansion
House speech that he would aim for underlying inflation of 2.5 per cent
or less beyond spring 1997. He predicted this would keep inflation
between 1 and 4 per cent most of the time, recognising that unexpected
events might push inflation higher when it was too late for
policymakers to react.

This formulation has caused confusion ever since and influential voices
have argued that it needs rewriting again. Sir Terry Burns, the
permanent secretary to the Treasury, said shortly before Christmas that
the government should move away from targeting a range for inflation,
concentrating instead on a single figure. Some senior officials at the
Bank of England agree.

The Mansion House speech left many questions unanswered in the minds of
City and academic economists. Was the new target looser or tighter than
its predecessor? Was the inflation objective 1 to 2.5 per cent, 1 to 4
per cent or 2.5 per cent and below?

The conduct of interest rate policy in subsequent months only deepened
the mystery. Mr Eddie George had told the chancellor in May that
inflation was set to exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time and that he
should therefore raise rates. The chancellor refused because he thought
inflation would be lower. Economists were unnerved by the disagreement,
but at least both sides appeared to agree on the definition of the
target - 2.5 per cent or below.

But in September the Bank muddied the waters. It continued to predict
that inflation would exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time, but
dropped its demand for a rate rise. Shortly afterwards, Mr Mervyn King,
its chief economist, argued that the target would be satisfied if
inflation averaged 2.5 per cent or less over a long period. To
observers who had thought the authorities were supposed to be erring on
the side of caution - keeping inflation below 2.5 per cent except in
unavoidable circumstances - this looked like a loosening of policy.

But in a sense it was simply a recognition of the inevitable
limitations of inflation targeting. These limitations were demonstrated
by Andrew Haldane and Christopher Salmon, from the Bank, in a study
published last month*. They constructed a model of British inflation
since 1960 and reran history as though the authorities had pursued a
2.5 per cent inflation target by setting interest rates on the basis of
a forward-looking forecast.

The study suggested inflation would have been lower and less variable
had the authorities followed this policy, as the graphic illustrates.
But Haldane and Salmon also used the model to assess the possible
outcomes for inflation had the economy been buffeted by the whole range
of unforecastable outside disturbances which was typical of the period.
They concluded that even if monetary policy had always been well
directed, the authorities would have had only a one-in-four chance of
hitting a 1 to 4 per cent inflation target: 'Other things equal, these
results would argue for an inflation target band width at least as wide
as that operating in the UK - and possibly much wider.'

This study provides further evidence that it may be counter-productive
to express the inflation target as a range at all - be it 1 to 4 per
cent or 2.5 per cent and below. If the range were wide enough for even
a well-intentioned policymaker to be confident of hitting the target,
it would have to be so wide as to provide little gain in credibility.

Finland has recognised this problem and aims simply for inflation of 2
per cent. The Bank of Finland concedes that it would be impossible to
hit the target precisely in any given month, except by chance. But it
argues nonetheless that a single figure provides a better anchor for
private-sector expectations than a target range.

Mr King's comments and the Bank of England's advice this autumn suggest
that the authorities in the UK may be behaving as though they have a
point target for inflation slightly below 2.5 per cent - even though
that is not what the formal statement of the target says. If so, the
chancellor would do well to rewrite his target again so that it
reflects reality in a rather clearer way. *Targeting Inflation, Bank of
England, 1995

ZAMBIA'S STOCK MARKET


* Zambia

Zambia's stock market will struggle to trade for the foreseeable future
due to a growing crisis in the banking sector, analysts have said,
Reuter reports from Lusaka.

Several large institutions have been unable to participate in the stock
exchange because their money has been tied up in four collapsed
financial institutions.

Four banks collapsed between May and November, leaving 16 in the
country.

A Rothmans of Pall Mall Zambia public offer, which closed on December
7, for example, was grossly under subscribed because the pension
schemes and other institutions expected to have participated had their
money tied up.

* Thailand

The average daily turnover on the Bangkok stock exchange in 1995 fell
by 27.5 per cent from Bt8.6bn to Bt6.25bbn.

Foreign trading on the SET over that period was Bt804.36bn, accounting
for 26.35 per cent of total trade.

Foreign buying was worth Bt425.3bn in the period, while selling
accounted for Bt379.03bn.

* Hong Kong

The Hong Kong stock exchange will review regulations on options trading
in the first quarter of 1996 and does not expect to launch new options
during the review period.

The review would cover the proposal that market makers should be exempt
from stamp duty when they conducted arbitrage with the spot market to
spread risks.

The exchange will also study changes to rules governing opening bids
and how to increase the number of market participants, including market
makers

The exchange began listing individual stock options in September and
currently trades options on nine stocks.

* Indonesia

Further state asset sales, an updated legal framework and automation
could mean a bright start to the year for the Jakarta stock exchange,
brokers and analysts believe.

The exchange switched to a fully automated trading system from manual
operations in May, after long delays. This coincided with a move to new
premises in the central business district, and the extension of trading
by 90 minutes each session.

Brokers and analysts said the automated system had helped raise
efficiency and transparency and add liquidity. The fully automated
trading system would also provide a springboard for a planned move to
fully scripless trading, expected in the next few years.

The government is expected to list many of the more than 200 state
companies in the next few years.

* Philippines

The Manila equities market, which languished for much of last year, is
expected to rebound strongly during 1996 as more companies are listed.

The authorities expect the creation of a central depository, the start
of scripless trading and tighter rules to prevent insider trading to
boost sentiment.

Some brokers said they expected up to 30 companies to list.

However, inflationary pressures in the first quarter could be brought
about by an impending increase in domestic oil prices.

At present, about 200 companies are listed.

A central depository would begin operations for treasury bills and
government bonds in March before expanding to shares by the third
quarter of 1996.

TRADERS PIN HOPES ON DOLLAR


If foreign exchange traders have their wishes granted, 1996 will be a
year of volatile markets. Last year was much better than the dismal
spectacle of 1994, but the last few months were characterised by the US
dollar trading in a very narrow range.

There is a fair amount of bullishness among currency forecasters about
the outlook for the dollar, though in recent years it has managed to
confound the best intended explanations for why it should rally.

Analysts at Lehman Brothers think that the dollar stands to benefit in
the coming months from: perceptions that inflation has become
structurally lower, a modest improvement in the current account deficit
as a proportion of GDP, and resolution of the budget negotiations.

They caution, though, that any rally could run into the buffers in the
second half of the year, which may be dominated by a turn-round in
German interest rate expectations.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the dollar,
forecasting levels of DM1.55 and Y112 in the next six months. Against
the yen, their thinking is based upon trends in the trade and current
account data of both the US and Japan, which suggest that the big
bilateral balances between the countries are turning in the dollar's
favour.

Against the D-Mark, their thinking departs from the premise that the
German economy is suffering from the mis-alignment of the D-Mark in
Europe, and this will require the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy in
order to curb D-Mark strength.

Politics will be a key variable. US presidential elections will affect
the dollar, while the progress towards monetary union in Europe will
also be an important determinant of D-Mark and Swiss franc performance.
The proximity of elections in the UK, and a possible Labour government,
could make life difficult for sterling.

LOOKING AHEAD TO BRIGHTER PROSPECTS: THE EMERGING INVESTOR / JOHN PITT


The year just ended has not been one that investors in the world's
emerging equity markets will care to remember. Far better to look ahead
to the brighter prospects that many strategists believe beckon in 1996.

But there were some winners during 1995 - a year in which what have
become known as the 'pre-emerging' markets came into their own.

Take Jordan, for example, capitalised at less than Dollars 5bn (compare
this with Mexico's market capitalisation of about Dollars 90bn), and an
annual turnover estimated at less than Dollars 1bn. (Mexico has an
average daily turnover of at least Dollars 100m.)

A far sighted investor who took a position in the country's fledgling
stock market at the start of last year would have seen
dollar-denominated assets appreciate by 23 per cent. Compare this with
a loss of 35 per cent in both India and Hungary, or 40 per cent in Sri
Lanka.

Certainly one of the prominent themes of 1995 has been the growing
interest in these pre-emerging markets: countries which are just
beginning to organise their financial structures, but are endeavouring
to do so as quickly as possible.

As the main emerging markets of Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey,
for example, retreated in the face of a flow of funds back into the
developed world, so interest turned to lesser known regions. In
particular, a race began among a number of US and European investment
banks and brokerages to establish contacts and trading positions in
Africa. It became clear that in this 'new scramble for Africa' returns
on investments could, in many cases, far exceed those in the more
mature markets. But the risk would also be much greater.

This did not deter the launch of a number of African funds during 1995,
although most were naturally skewed towards the largest market on the
continent - South Africa. With an estimated market capitalisation of
Dollars 274bn Johannesburg is the world's seventh largest stock
exchange.

Russia was another growth area and some commentators believe that 1996
will see this market come of age, especially after the presidential
election is out of the way. ING Barings global strategy unit led by
Michael Howell, for instance, believes that both eastern Europe and
Russia show attractive valuation levels, and thinks fund managers are
ready to significantly increase their exposure.

'Of the Dollars 50bn expected to flow towards emerging equity markets
in 1996, I expect some Dollars 5bn to head towards eastern Europe and
Russia,' says Mr Howell. 'This is equivalent to more than 10 per cent
of existing market capitalisation, and, perhaps, as much as 25 per cent
of the existing free-float.'

Other factors likely to lift investor sentiment in Russia include an
improvement in custodial operations, with expectations that an
independent central depository will finally be created.

Mr Mark Mobius, president of the Dollars 7bn Templeton Emerging Markets
Fund, is another enthusiast for Russia, although he is aware that the
country's turbulent political climate is likely to get worse before it
gets any better.

Nevertheless, he is confident that potential for investment is bright,
given that the country has embarked on what he calls a 'revolutionary'
approach to financial market reforms.

But what of the core emerging markets?

Mr Arnab Banerji, chief investment officer of Foreign & Colonial
Emerging Markets based in London, believes that in spite of a
disappointing return on investments in 1995 the outlook remains
positive. He picks South Korea, India, Brazil and Taiwan, among others,
as having strong prospects.

India, for example, continues to have good compound earnings growth, he
says.

He is also among a number of strategists who favour Brazil among Latin
American markets.

Garantia, a leading Brazilian investment bank, warns that slower
economic growth during the first half of the year will put a brake on
the stock market's momentum; while for the year as a whole it will be
very much a matter of selecting specific sectors. Garantia favours the
food, beverage, packaging and retail sectors, on the basis that the
recent decline in inflation means that many people now have a
disposable income for the first time in years.

At UBS the emerging markets team is keen on Chile, South Korea and
Turkey, all for different reasons. Chile will continue to see an
improvement in the economic picture and political problems are forecast
to dissipate; South Korea is expected to benefit from an easing in
monetary policy; and Turkey should be able to move forward once again
now that the parliamentary elections are out of the way.

Chile will also benefit from the increased weighting - from 1.9 per
cent to 7.3 per cent - which the equity market will attract in the
IFC's investable index which starts this month. Mr Nigel Rendell at
James Capel, who classifies Chile as 'an Asian tiger living in Latin
America', forecasts that despite the recent rise in interest rates,
corporate earnings will rise by 25 per cent in nominal terms, valuing
the market on a prospective p/e of 16 times.

Whether or not this year will see a pick-up in activity among the
world's emerging markets depends on a host of factors, not least the
movement in US interest rates. Further easing in US monetary policy,
many analysts believe, could trigger a fresh wave of institutional
money out of the US and Europe, and into Latin America and the Far
East.

INVESTORS FACE A DEARTH OF ECONOMIC DATA


Thanks to the latest Federal government shutdown, US stock market
investors start the new year facing a dearth of official economic data
against which to judge the economy's performance.

The only significant new information this week will be the National
Association of Purchasing Management report for December, due today.
The headline NAPM index for the month is expected by most economists to
be around 47.5 - higher than November's 46.5 but still below the
50-mark which would point to expectations of manufacturing growth. That
would provide a firm backdrop for the bond market, whose recent gains
have underpinned share prices.

While keeping one eye on bonds, the stock market will begin to fix its
attention on the corporate earnings season starting later this month.

Three months ago, a generally strong set of quarterly results helped
set the stage for the stock market's fourth-quarter rise. This time
around, the figures will be pored over for signs of how the US's
economic slowdown is affecting earnings growth.

Most market followers expect earnings growth to taper off during 1996.
But corporate cost-cutting and share repurchases have left plenty of
room for earnings to come in ahead of expectations. And with US
investors still buying mutual funds, there seems to be plenty of cash
around to chase share prices higher.

MARKETS:
STRATEGY

   By MICHAEL MORGAN

The start of the new year has brought the usual crop of recommendations
from brokers. Spain and Sweden feature among the lists as potentially
good performers in 1996 while the time may now be ripe to take profits
on Switzerland after its strong run last year.

Views on Italy are divided, with some analysts thinking the time is
right to give the market another chance but others finding the
political outlook still unappealing.

JP Morgan expects equity markets to remain volatile, with positive
responses to interest rate cuts probably offset in part by continuing
bad news on earnings.

Morgan reiterates its underweighting of Paris, saying France is
expected to experience one of the slowest growth rates in Europe next
year. It is taking profits on a previous upgrade of the Swiss market
and switching the money into Italy, which it believes is discounting
the bad news and could react positively to a relaxation of monetary
policy.

Morgan says the low valuation on its forecasts and scope for interest
rate cuts makes the Swedish market look attractive after its recent
underperformance.

Lehman Brothers still recommends being overweight in the Spanish,
French, Swedish and Dutch markets. It says the first two are cheap,
relative to debt, while slower French growth has been more than
discounted by the market.

Sweden looks attractive on a prospective dividend basis, while the
Dutch market is the cheapest among the core European economies.

The UK, Swiss and Italian markets remained relatively expensive.
Liquidity flows had helped the first two, but value would come through.
In spite of its underperformance, Lehman saw little value in Italy.

ABN-Amro Hoare Govett, meanwhile, continues to prefer Germany and the
Netherlands in core Europe while Spain is its peripheral market of
choice. And while Italy's valuations have improved, ABN still does not
trust the politics.

TOKYO

With the Year of the Pig ending on a note of slight recovery, some
market participants are hoping that the Year of the Rat will be a good
one for the Japanese shares, writes Emiko Terazono. Past Years of the
Rat have seen the market rise by an average of 54.6 per cent, and the
animal is regarded by believers of traditional omens as a favourable
sign for investments.

Stocks may need all the help they can get since banks and life
insurance companies are expected to sell their share holdings ahead of
the March book-closing. Analysts point out that there has been heavy
trading around 21,500 and regard that figure as a strong resistance
level.

HONG KONG

Further gains are expected among equities this week after Friday's
year-end window dressing and solid gains in the futures market, which
took the Hang Seng index to intra-day and closing highs for 1995.

Analysts are concerned, however, that the near-term outlook for
recently active newspaper stocks remains cloudy in view of their weak
earnings prospects. They add that the decision to relax conditions
governing the pre-sale of uncompleted flats will benefit developers,
although it will not have much stimulative effect on the local property
market.

FRANKFURT

The Bundesbank meets on Thursday, but having cut key rates at its last
meeting, no action can be expected on the discount or Lombard rates
this week.

James Capel says the Bundesbank Council will wish to assess the impact
of the monetary easing on M3 and the real economy over some weeks.

The most interesting feature of the meeting was likely to be what the
council said about the repo rate.

'We would expect a fairly prompt return to a variable repo rate, which
is likely to drift lower over the coming weeks,' says Capel.

On the corporate front, analysts are expecting a let-up in the number
of new bourse listings in 1996 after last year's flood, although
November will bring the flotation of Telekom, Germany's telephone
monopoly, which is expected to raise DM15bn.

Companies raised a record DM8.5bn in new funds in 1995 from 20 IPOs,
including the listing of Merck, the drugs group, that was Germany's
largest post second world war stock offering, which raised DM2.4bn, and
the Adidas placement, which raised DM2.1bn.

DUBLIN

Even after last year's performance, which saw the Irish equity market
climb by 20 per cent to end among the best performing markets in Europe
for the third successive year, Dublin retains its enthusiasts.

Mr Robbie Kelleher at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin says the market has
more than doubled since the trough of October 1992 but still expects
the ISEQ to be among the top performing indices in 1996.

'Valuations remain low, both by historic and international standards,
the Irish economy is likely to be the fastest growing economy in in
Europe again in 1996 and the strength of corporate cash flows and
balance sheets is likely to restrict the supply of new equity to a
minimum,' he says.

How this better relative performance translates into absolute
performance depends on developments in other markets.

Mr Kelleher believes the international equity market rally can be
sustained in the early part of 1996, on the back of continuing support
from low interest rates, low inflation and rising bond prices.

MARKETS:
YEAR EXPECTED TO OPEN ON POSITIVE NOTE


The UK market starts what could be a general election year in a healthy
spirit. A base rate cut in December, accompanied by reductions in
European and US interest rates, creates a positive background for
equities.

With most observers expecting base rates to fall further in the early
months of 1996, shares could yet set some more all-time highs. While
the FT-SE 100 index did well in 1995, it still lagged well behind Wall
Street's phenomenal performance.

The first test of the year will be the spring results season, not so
much for the figures themselves, but for chairmen's statements about
trading conditions in early 1996. The market shrugged off some profits
warnings in late 1995, mainly on the hope that UK economic growth was
pausing for breath, rather than grinding to a halt.

As the year moves on, thoughts will inevitably turn to the date of an
election, and the chances of a Labour government.

Concern will probably focus, not on macro-economic policies, but on
micro-economic matters such as the minimum wage or dividend taxation.
If Labour maintains its strong lead in the opinion polls, shares may
start to come under pressure.

Much went right for the UK stock market in 1995 - takeover activity, a
strong Wall Street, falling bond yields and worldwide interest rates.
It will be a surprise if all those factors are still as positive in
1996.

FINANCE:
CVRD MANDATE SUGGESTS END OF THE GOLDEN 3% FEE: INTERNATIONAL OFFERINGS


The debate about fees which investment banks charge for arranging
international equity offerings is set to be a lively one in 1996,
judging from the aggressive bids which emerged in the recent
competition to win Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) mandate.

Shortly before Christmas, the Brazilian government said it had chosen a
consortium including Merrill Lynch, NM Rothschild, KPMG and four
Brazilian partners to handle the sale of its 51 per cent stake in CVRD,
one of the world's largest exporters of iron ore.

The winning consortium is charging a fee of 1.9 per cent to arrange
what is expected to be one of the most significant international equity
offerings of 1996. According to market valuations, the government's
stake is worth about Dollars 5bn but the sale is likely to be spread
over at least two offerings.

If the winners' fee looked low, it was by no means the lowest. Bankers
involved in the bidding said a consortium led by Lehman Brothers had
offered to do the business for a fee of 1.75 per cent and another
including CS First Boston for 1.9 per cent.

It is also believed the fee bid by the consortium including Morgan
Stanley and SBC Warburg (disqualified because the first part of its fee
estimate was too far below the average) was in this region.

By contrast, Goldman Sachs, which had come top in the technical part of
the bidding contest, had bid a fee of 3.125 per cent, bankers said.

Bankers involved in the consortium which won the CVRD mandate say the
level of the fee was justified because the sale will be a secondary
offering and not an initial public offering, which usually commands a
higher fee.

Half of the CVRD stock is already traded, making CVRD the most
widely-held stock after Telebras and Petrobras. As a result, it already
has a wide following among foreign analysts and investors.

They also point out that there is a history of low fees in Brazil,
where past international equity offerings have been done for fees of
just over 2 per cent. But the two most important reasons bankers give
to justify the fee are: first, the size of the offering; and second,
the importance of being involved in the first of many privatisations in
Brazil.

Although bankers do not expect the government to sell its CVRD holding
in one go, the arranging banks stand to earn close to Dollars 100m from
the whole process.

On the second point, the bidding highlighted the willingness among
international banks to drop their fees in order to be at the forefront
of Brazil's privatisation programme.

The government wants CVRD to pave the way for further sell-offs in the
country's electricity and telecommunications sectors over the next few
years.

The fact that three leading investment banks were willing to arrange
the CVRD sale for a fee of less than 2 per cent, despite the risks
associated with an emerging market such as Brazil, is also a reflection
of the increasingly intense competition in the international equity
market.

Once one of the most lucrative sectors of investment banking, fees for
arranging deals, particularly privatisations, have been eroding
steadily over the past two years.

This has come about as governments seek to maximise the proceeds of
selling off state assets and new players try to break into the market.

The downward pressure on fees has been mainly on privatisations, where
there is likely to be follow-on business for the banks, and less so on
corporate IPOs or secondary offerings. However, there are signs that
corporate fees are also coming under pressure.

In view of the ever-greater number of privatisations in Europe and
elsewhere in the world and the growing number of investment banks
wanting a slice of the action, it is inevitable that fee levels have
become one of the main bargaining tools.

With competition set to stiffen further, many bankers now believe the
golden 3 per cent level, once the norm for European privatisations, has
gone for good.

Antonia Sharpe

Goldman Sachs maintained its position as the leading global
co-ordinator of international equity issues in 1995, according to data
from Euromoney Bondware, Antonia Sharpe writes. Goldman's involvement
in Germany's privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, scheduled for November,
should ensure it retains the top slot in 1996. However, winning the
CVRD mandate in Brazil, which is also set to emerge in the second half
of the year, has increased Merrill Lynch's chances of taking the lead.
Although Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, SBC Warburg, CS First Boston,
Dresdner Bank-Kleinwort Benson and Lehman Brothers remain among the top
10 global co-ordinators for 1995, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Paribas and
BNP have been displaced by UBS, ABN-Amro and BZW.

MARKETS:
WHILE THE COUNTRY'S FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS


While the country's financial institutions' woes are likely to prompt
the Bank of Japan to maintain an accommodating stance in its money
market operations, it is expected to push up interest rates on the long
end.

Banks are expected to step up their profit-taking on bonds and stocks
ahead of the March book-closing in order to cover losses stemming from
the write-offs of bad loans.

Many of the leading banks have pledged to clear their balance sheets of
bad loans related to jusen, or housing loan companies, and some have
announced that they may fall into the red for this business year to
March.

Life insurance companies may also want to take profits on their bond
holdings due to the decline in insurance premiums. While the leading
insurers posted healthy rises in their recurring profits for the first
half to September, this was largely due profit-taking on their
investments.

The seasonal repatriation of funds from the US ahead of the March
book-closing may briefly put upward pressure on the yen on the foreign
exchanges, but this is unlikely to have a lasting impact on bond
prices.

Lehman Brothers in Tokyo estimates yields on the 10-year government
bond, which closed the last year at 2.9 per cent, to end at 3.4 per
cent at the end of the first quarter of this year.

A STEP AWAY FROM CITY TRADITION: OPEN GILT REPO TRADING

   By PHILIP GAWITH and RICHARD LAPPER

The launch today of the open gilt repo market may be something less
than a 'second Big Bang', but it does represent a further step away
from a City where custom and tradition have played an important role,
towards one governed by the more homogenised standards of a global
financial services industry.

The privileges and arcane idiosyncracies associated with such core City
institutions as gilt edge market makers (GEMMs) and stock exchange
money brokers (SEMBs) are ebbing away.

Already there is evidence of some of the more marginal GEMMs throwing
in the towel, while SEMBs will have to cope with the fact that an open
repo market comes in tandem with an open stock-lending market.

Ironically, the advent of the gilt repo market is being
enthusiastically welcomed by that other supposed City anachronism - the
discount house. These institutions have, for as long as anyone can
remember, served as the intermediaries through which the Bank of
England channels liquidity to the commercial banks.

Often the butt of ridicule for their quaint practice of having
employees don top hats every morning in order to do the rounds of the
City's main banks, they have also become increasingly marginalised in
recent years as the clearing banks have gained ascendancy in the money
markets.

More than 80 per cent of the eligible bills - those which the Bank is
prepared to discount in its daily money market operations - are held by
the clearers.

As a result, the role of discount houses over the past 10 years has
been little more than to serve as brokers on behalf of the clearing
banks.

There is a widespread belief, however, that the Bank of England will
start to use the repo as its daily medium of intervention in the money
markets (at the moment it conducts repo operations every two weeks, but
the bulk of its daily operations are done through the bill market).

This will not be immediate - the Bank will first want to see a depth of
liquidity in the repo market, both in terms of the number of
counterparties, and the volume going through - but is believed to be
inevitable.

For its part, the Bank is playing a very straight bat. It said this
week that 'it did not have plans to change the form of its money market
operations', but that the development of gilt repo trading 'could make
it sensible to contemplate change later'.

The Bank has to tread very carefully, because, in the words of one
observer, 'any change is a sea change'.

A hint that the Bank plans to start using repo alongside eligible bills
in its daily operations is sure to be taken as a signal that a move to
sole reliance on repo is likely.

Some observers believe the Bank will try to run repo and bill
operations in tandem.

There are two main reasons why such a move is considered likely. First,
there is widespread belief that intervening via the repo will be a more
effective method of managing short-dated interest rates than the
current practice of intervening, often three times a day, via the bill
market.

Second, it seems most likely to be the modus operandi of a future
single European central bank and the UK is unlikely to want to do
anything which is at odds with what it might have to do in Europe, if
it participates in monetary union.

A study last year by Mr Norbert Schnadt for the London Business School
found that the money market operations of the Banque de France,
Bundesbank and Federal Reserve differed from those of the Bank of
England in that they were conducted less frequently, utilised only
repurchase transactions, and were spread over a very wide range of
financial institutions.

It also found that even though the Bank intervened more frequently in
the money markets than the other central banks, sterling rates were
much more volatile than elsewhere.

Recently, however, UK overnight rates have been steadier. Intervention
via repo is also unlikely, in itself, to be sufficient to make
overnight rates more stable.

Any shift towards daily use of repo will be welcomed by the discount
houses, because by so doing the Bank will increase the number of active
participants in the money markets, diminishing the dominant role of the
clearers.

The introduction of an open repo market also creates a new trading
instrument which puts more emphasis on the idea of secured money - a
high priority in the aftermath of the Barings episode.

At the moment, most secured lending and borrowing is done either to the
discount market, or via SEMBs, and through them to GEMMs.

Discount houses see an opportunity in this because of their expertise
in secured lending.

Mr George Blunden, chief executive of Union plc, says: 'Discount houses
have a head start because our job has been secured money markets since
the beginning of time.' As much as 95 per cent of the discount market
is secured.

Mr Ross Jones, chief executive at Gerrard and National plc, adds: 'This
is the biggest opportunity we have had for years. We see it as a
potential new lease of life for the secured sterling money market.'

A group like Gerrards has the added advantage of having a SEMB within
the group, which will be merged with the discount house operations.
While the pivotal role of SEMBs will be diminished, stock borrowing and
lending will continue, alongside repo, so the relationships they have
will still count.

A number of the largest holders of gilts - pension funds and
institutions - have dealt exclusively with SEMBs, and early indications
are that they will be happy to continue doing business this way.

As new entrants garner market share, institutions will have to widen
their counterparties beyond the small set of SEMBs they have
traditionally dealt with, but loyalty to old relationships looks likely
to be the watchword initially.

Discount houses are also confident that if the Bank of England starts
to use the repo as an intervention mechanism, it will want a manageable
set of counterparties, dedicated to making markets in all conditions.
They believe that their chances of playing this role are good.

Another development which will encourage the development of the repo
market is the introduction of the European-wide Capital Adequacy
Directive, which also takes effect today. CAD encourages a secured
money market, because the capital requirements for repos are much lower
than for unsecured ones.

MARKETS:
THE GERMAN BOND MARKET


The German bond market market ended the year quietly but positively,
with bund futures generally expected to remain firm.

Inflation, now below 2 per cent, is clearly under control and economic
growth is modest at best. Thus the Bundesbank can sit tight after its
pre-Christmas interest rate cuts.

With the discount rate now down to 3 per cent, the chances of a further
reduction are rated as no more than slight by most economists.

It has only once fallen below 3 per cent in the last three decades -
just after the 1987 stock market crash, when it stayed at 2.5 per cent
for six months.

Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Union Bank of Switzerland, said
the discount rate was not likely to fall so low in this cycle.

'However,' he added, 'this does not mean that monetary easing is over.'

The securities repurchase (repo) rate should fall below the current
3.75 per cent. Also, the 5 per cent Lombard rate could also be lowered,
since the bottom of previous cycles has seen it at 4 or 4.5 per cent.

If the money supply remains weak, the Bundesbank could cut interest
rates further, said Mr Bill Smyth of BHF Trust. But the 1987 discount
cut to 2.5 per cent did not produce a powerful bond rally, he noted.

MARKETS:
ALL EYES IN THE UK GOVERNMENT


All eyes in the UK government bond market this week will be on gilt
sale and repurchase agreements, or repos, which starts today.

'A whole new world of leverage trades, reverse repos, term stock loans,
buy/sells, matched books and, hopefully, very little mayhem will
transform the gilt market,' say analysts at HSBC Greenwell.

'We are entering a new evolutionary phase in the market. Repos will
impact on pricing, liquidity management, swaps, curve plays and
ultimately, we suspect, on official intervention in the money market.'

But in the near term, trading is unlikely to be heavily affected by
repos and after trading in a narrow range last week, gilts will have to
look elsewhere for life to be breathed back into the market.

The data front offers slim pickings, with M0 figures and the purchasing
managers' report for December scheduled as the only releases this week.

'M0 will be viewed with interest for what it reveals about consumer
demand in December - a month which accounts for over one-quarter of
total annual retail sales,' notes Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi
International. 'The weekly notes in circulation data suggest that there
was a seasonally adjusted increase in M0 of almost 1 per cent on the
month - this would appear to confirm retailers' reports of strong sales
in December.'

INVESTORS ASSESS THEIR STRATEGY FOR 1996: GOVERNMENT BONDS

   By RICHARD LAPPER

The scale of the rally in international government bonds over the last
six months surprised the markets and left many investors scrambling to
increase their exposures.

In assessing their strategy for this year, investors must weigh up the
extent to which benign economic fundamentals, especially for the US and
European markets, are already reflected in valuations.

At the same time, the markets could be affected by a number of
political uncertainties linked to the US presidential elections and the
creation of European Monetary Union.

European bonds provided investors with some of the best returns in 1995
- with returns (in local currency terms) to December 15 ranging from
around 15.3 per cent in France and 15.5 per cent in Germany to 19.3 per
cent in Sweden.

Over the last few weeks there has been a wealth of evidence that the
growth of core economies such as Germany and France is grinding to a
halt and that inflationary pressures are continuing to ease.

Furthermore, at their Madrid summit last month European leaders and
finance ministers reaffirmed their commitment to monetary union,
suggesting the reduction of fiscal deficits will remain a priority for
governments across the continent.

'Europe is shaping up for a common currency and that suggests
governments will wrestle to bring public finances under control. These
are developments bond investors will be pleased to see,' says Mr Craig
Shute, bond analyst at Bear Stearns International in London.

Similar 'bond-positive' forces are visible in the US, where Treasuries
provided investors with total returns of more than 17 per cent in 1995.
And the current market rally has very different characteristics to that
of 1993, which gave way to a sell-off early in 1994.

During 1993, the markets were expecting further monetary tightening -
now by contrast, further cuts in interest rates are expected. The
inflation rate is falling - it was rising in 1993 - and some analysts
argue that investors have yet to fully adjust their expectations to the
extent of the downward trend in inflation.

Mr Nigel Richardson, international bond strategist at Yamaichi
International, says US inflation - as measured by the consumer price
index - has not been as low as its current level of 2.6 per cent since
1972. The present situation 'holds out the possibility that there may
be a permanent return to 1960s-style price increases,' suggests Mr
Richardson.

Yet according to the a survey of economic forecasts by Consensus
Economics Inc, investors expect US inflation to rise to 3.1 per cent in
the longer term.

'They are responding fully to the current inflation background on the
grounds that they appear to doubt it will be maintained. In essence,
therefore, the bond market has 1980s style yields against a background
of 1960s style inflation,' says Mr Richardson.

However, there are also good reasons to be cautious. For a start, the
scale of the surge in bond prices in 1995 means much of the good news
is already reflected in valuations.

Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell by nearly two percentage points
in 1995, touching 6 per cent by the year end, while in Germany yields
on 10-year bonds had dropped to 6.07 per cent by December 27, a fall of
more than 1.5 per cent.

'With the US and European central banks virtually moving as one to cut
interest rates before year-end, most of the good news for the bond
markets has been delivered,' says Mr Graham McDevitt, international
bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.

Mr McDevitt predicts an increase in volatility, arguing that there is a
high risk of a correction in the first quarter with bond yields rising
by 25 to 50 basis points. Economic slowdown could also create
difficulties by undermining fiscal deficit and debt reduction schemes,
in turn putting at risk the achievement of Maastricht criteria for
monetary union in some countries.

The impact of the slowdown will be most clearly apparent in France,
where a fall in tax revenues could impair the government's efforts to
reduce its fiscal deficit from the current level of more than 5 per
cent.

The industrial action by French railway workers last month is expected
to have reduced growth in the final quarter of 1995 to 0.1 per cent.

Finally, while leverage has been an element of the current bull market,
it is not thought to represent as serious a threat to the markets'
stability as in 1994, when highly geared trades built up in 1993 were
suddenly unwound, aggravating the extent of the sell-off.

A popular geared play last year, according to analysts at BZW
Securities, was to finance purchases of US assets with yen borrowings
on the grounds that the 'perceived potential for currency loss is small
relative to the yield pick-up.'

BZW says the leveraging has been concentrated on US more than European
bond markets and may well be limited to the short end of the Treasury
curve, though 'the impact will still have percolated along the curve.'

US TREASURIES PASSED A MILESTONE


US Treasuries passed a milestone last week. On Wednesday, the yield on
the benchmark 30-year long bond ended the day below the psychologically
significant 6 per cent level for the first time in two years. On
Thursday and Friday, it edged down further still, closing the week -
and the year - at 5.94 per cent, in marked contrast to the 7.92 per
cent at which it started the year.

The question now is whether yields will fall further still, and Wall
Street analysts believe they will. Most indicators point to a weakening
of economic growth in the coming year, further diminishing inflationary
pressures.

With recession an increasing possibility, analysts confidently expect
the Federal Reserve to continue to reduce the Fed funds rate, with the
next downward movement pencilled in for the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting of January 30-31.

This week, however, could be a quiet one in the bond market, for any
agreement between the president and Congress over a balanced budget
will almost certainly come too late to allow the flow of government
data to resume before the weekend.

Most attention is likely to focus on today's publication of the
National Association of Purchasing Managers index for December. This is
expected to show a slight increase from November's 46.5.

(IGCs) on the future of the EU. The presidency risks being overshadowed
by Italy's political instability and a general election.

Lamberto Dini, prime minister, has argued strongly that he should
remain in office to ensure the government is able to concentrate on the
presidency.

Britain takes over WEU

The UK took over the presidency of the Western European Union, a
10-nation defence club. Britain has pledged to take a pragmatic
approach to upgrading the WEU, with some improvements in its capacity
to anticipate and handle crises but with no question of its
compromising Nato's role as Europe's main security institution.

EU-Turkey customs union

A customs union between the European Union and Turkey came into effect
with the removal of remaining trade barriers. This followed a vote in
the European parliament in December, in which the move was approved by
343 to 149, with 36 abstentions. There had been concern about Turkey's
human rights record.

EU finance directives

The EU Investment Services Directive, and the accompanying capital
adequacy directive, were both implemented. The directives aim to give
EU investment firms a 'passport' to trade in all member states if they
are authorised in one.

The CAD also introduces European Union-wide rules for banks and
securities firms to set aside capital to cover risks in securities
trading. These are in addition to international rules covering lending
risks run by banks.

Telecoms competition

Cable TV, utility, rail and other 'alternative' networks throughout the
EU were allowed to use their infrastructure to offer telecom services.
Mobile operators were permitted to build their own networks and
directly connect to other mobile operators.

French income tax rise

An additional 0.5 per cent tax charge was introduced on all revenues in
an attempt to correct the country's accumulated social security
deficit.

German tax changes

Tax cuts and other changes took effect which should leave Germans
nearly DM20bn (Dollars 13.8bn) better off this year. Tax-free
allowances were brought into line with poverty-level incomes, more than
doubling the level of income permitted before tax to just over DM12,000
a year.

Consumers will also benefit from the elimination of the 'coal pfennig',
which was previously added to electricity bills to help pay for the use
of German coal in power stations. However, these savings - amounting to
about DM27bn this year - will be offset partly by DM7.5bn higher
contributions to pensions and insurance funds.

Deutsche Telekom tariffs

Germany's state-owned telephone company, due for partial privatisation
later this year, introduced changes to bring its tariffs more in line
with market demands. Long-distance calls will become cheaper and local
calls, which have been kept artificially cheap for decades, more
expensive. Business clients can also choose from three different
discounts of up to 24 per cent.

British alcohol tax cut

The tax on fortified wine, such as sherry and port, was reduced by 12p
for a typical 75cl bottle.

UK copyright extended

Copyright on music and literature was extended from 50 to 70 years,
implementing an EU directive of October 1993. Although virtually all
member (and non-member) states adhered to the 50-year rule, the EU
followed Germany, where royalty payments last 70 years. Britain will
now be out of step with other English-speaking countries, which will be
able to produce cheap editions 20 years earlier.

The change is retrospective, bringing back into copyright works by
artists who died between 1925 and 1945, including the composers Edward
Elgar and Gustav Holst, and writers Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of
Sherlock Holmes, Kenneth Grahame, author of Wind in the Willows, Thomas
Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, DH Lawrence, and Beatrix Potter.

Income tax back in Cuba

Cuba, which abolished personal taxes as a 'capitalist evil' after the
1959 revolution, reintroduced income tax on hard currency earnings. The
government also introduced a tax on boats - whatever their size - and
road tolls on two highways leading to tourist centres.

FINANCE:
UK GILT REPO MARKET OPENS


An open market begins in gilt repos, agreements to sell and then
repurchase government bonds. All players in the gilt market will be
allowed to borrow and lend stock, rather than only a select group of
dealers. The reform should provide greater liquidity, make the market
more attractive to foreign investors and reduce government funding
costs.

Cash for Marcos victims

About Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) of money from Swiss bank accounts
belonging to the late Ferdinand Marcos, the former president of the
Philippines, is to be transferred to Hawaii. The move is part of a
Dollars 100m deal in settlement of a Dollars 2bn claim by about 10,000
victims - or their relatives - who were tortured, raped or murdered
under the Marcos regime. The Filipinos filed a lawsuit against Marcos,
who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, after a popular revolt ousted him
from power in 1986.

AT&T targets Britain

UK phone-users can expect to find themselves the target of aggressive
campaigns by AT&T, the largest US telecoms operator. AT&T says it will

Telecom, which has so far brushed off challenges from its 150 or so UK
rivals, may have more to fear from the US giant.
