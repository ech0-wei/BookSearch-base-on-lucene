MARKET BRIEFING

This two part issue of PPG describes policies relating to motorcycles
and uninsured loss recovery (ULR).

Motorcycles

While the market for insuring motorcycles remains fairly limited,
established participants NIG Skandia and Norwich Union have introduced
additional policies with Cornhill Insurance also entering the market.
Norwich Union leads the market with around 300,000 customers accounting
for around two-thirds of policies written.  The recently launched
Norwich Union Direct offers a motorcycle policy and existing
policyholders may see advantages in buying direct in the future.

Premiums fell again last year, reflecting increasing competition as
well as a significant fall in biking accidents.  In 1994, these
totalled 25,100, a reduction of more than half the figure of 65,300
recorded for 1984.  As the number of motorcycles also halved over the
same period, the statistics are not as encouraging as they might
appear.  However, there are signs that insurers are beginning to revise
their view of motorcyclists as high risks, particularly as a new breed
of more mature "enthusiast" motorcyclists is emerging.  The current
premium value of the market is estimated at #150m.

In the wake of Norwich Union's introduction of group-rated cover in
1994, Lombard General followed suit last year, with rates designed for
20 different categories.

Uninsured loss recovery

The ULR policies described are for legal expenses associated with
private motor and marine risks.  They all have to be purchased and in
force before the insured event takes place apart from Motorists Legal
Protection's After the Accident policy.  This is a stand-alone policy
designed for purchase by an accident victim - motorist, cyclist or
pedestrian - following an accident to cover the future legal costs of
pursuing a claim arising from that accident.

Motor ULR insurance is now widely sold in the UK, with most motor
insurers offering their policyholders the chance to add on legal
expenses cover.  Both DAS Legal Expenses Insurance and Cornhill
Insurance have recently produced upgraded versions of their standard
products, while DAS also offers a more basic policy.

Introduction of the conditional fee system in the UK last year,
accompanied by the launch of a conditional fee insurance scheme backed
by the Law Society,  led to some confusion among brokers as to the
continued need for ULR cover.    For #85 premium, the Law Society's
scheme - Accident Line Protect - pays up to #100,000 of costs awarded
against plaintiffs if they lose a personal injury case.  It is arranged
by Johnson & Higgins in association with the insurers' agents Abbey
Legal Protection, and placed with Lexington Insurance, part of AIG.

Motoring Uninsured Loss Recoveries Association (MULRA) chairman Paul
Asplin has responded with assurances that conditional fees will not
make any impact on the desirability or need for ULR cover.  Over 80% of
non-fault motor accidents do not involve personal injury and in such
cases the conditional fee system is not available.  He also pointed out
that, under the conditional fee system, plaintiffs are left to pick up
the costs awarded against them if they fail their case.  He stated
that, with the new conditional fee insurance scheme, plaintiffs might
find that the full amount of damages recovered was swallowed upon in
costs before the insurance cover came into play.

NEW SUBSIDENCE RATING SYSTEM

Hiscox Underwriting is pioneering a revolutionary system, provided by
the British Geological Survey (BGS), for rating the subsidence risk of
individual properties.  The computerised system - known as the Geo
Hazard Susceptibility Package 2 (GHASP 2) - is based on the BGS's
1:10,000-scale geological maps, the most detailed information on geo
hazards available across the UK.  It enables the underwriter to
pinpoint the precise bedrock beneath individual properties, even where
situated close to other properties.

Hiscox says that the system represents a major advance on other current
methods of assessing subsidence risk, which are based just on the first
three or four digits of a postcode and give only the average risk for
groups of several hundred homes.  It claims that use of GHASP 2 will
lead to premium savings of up to 60% for existing policyholders with
lower risk properties that are currently included within higher risk
postcodes, and even bigger reduction for policyholders moving to the
underwriter from other insurers.

The new rating system is being applied to the underwriter's 606 High
Value House and Contents Policy and will be used in particular to rate
properties in southern England, where many postcodes are susceptible
locally to a wide variety of geo hazards.

RIAS DISCOUNTS

The Retirement Insurance Advisory Service (RIAS) is giving discounts of
up to 15% to customers taking out a joint contents and buildings policy
as part of the RIAS Home Insurance Plan.  David Holden, RIAS general
secretary, said that its research showed that customers who choose to
cover their home contents and structure together under one policy are a
better risk than those who take out separate contents or buildings
cover.  RIAS home insurance policyholders can also add a special Home
Help Benefit to their existing cover for only #1 per month.  This
provides up to #50 per week for eight weeks should the policyholder
accidentally break or fracture a bone.

RATES WARNING

Specialist motor insurer Insurance (GB) warns that changes in
reinsurance rates and the need for bigger reserves will inevitably put
pressure on rates.  Recent legal developments have introduced the use
of actuarial evidence in determining multipliers and the adoption of a
discount rate linked to the yield of index linked government
securities.  These combined factors will have an enormous impact upon
the claims burden falling to UK motor insurers and reinsurers, says the
insurer.

Relevant developments are the production of the "Ogden" tables and the
Civil Evidence bill in October 1995 which permits courts to adopt Ogden
multipliers in the assessment of personal injury damages in all future
cases brought before them.  This means that if a personal injury claim
for an accident that occurred in, say, 1988 now comes before the court,
Ogden multipliers may be applied to the assessment of that claim.

It has been estimated that these new multipliers will produce a general
increase in claims of between 15% and 25% but could be as high as 50%.
Not all claims will be affected but plaintiff solicitors are currently
pleading Ogden level multipliers in approximately 10% of all cases.
This percentage is sure to rise very quickly, warns Insurance (GB), as
otherwise there could be implications for solicitors' E&O policies.

The insurer states that the overall effect will be an increase in
insurers' reserves for outstanding claims, which will be seen in many
reinsurance programmes now under negotiation as well as those in the
future.  As the introduction is retrospective, the 1996 revenue year
will see adverse developments due to increased reserves on prior year
claims.

Significant effects are already being shown on quotations for
reinsurance for 1996.  Insurance (GB) concludes that these increases,
coupled with the deterioration in claims reserves, will almost
certainly force appreciable premium increases on the industry early
this year.

WORST EUROPEAN RECORD FOR CAR CRIME

British motorists are at much greater risk of having their cars stolen
than drivers in the rest of Europe, according to the second annual
European Car Crime study by Eagle Star.  The study, compiled from the
latest EU government and insurance organisation statistics, compared
the number of cars stolen in 1994 in each country with the total number
of cars in use.

The UK has by far the worst record for car crime, with an average of 22
cars per thousand on the road stolen in 1994.  That is nearly double
the level in the next worst country, France, where 12.5 cars per
thousand were stolen in 1994.  The study found that car theft is lowest
in Austria where less than two cars per thousand were stolen in 1994.
The next most secure country was Switzerland, where just three per
thousand cars went missing.

Overall, a lower proportion of cars were stolen in 1994 than in 1993.
The European average fell from 11.7 thefts per thousand cars to 9.7.
In the UK, the proportion was down from 29 to 22 per thousand.

COMBATING CAR "RINGERS"

A Code of Practice for the Disposal of Motor Vehicle Salvage has been
produced by the Association of British Insurers and Lloyd's Motor
Underwriters' Association to help eliminate the practice of "ringing",
whereby the identity of a written-off vehicle is transferred to a
stolen vehicle by criminals.  The Code sets out the steps to be taken
by insurers and salvage dealers in the disposal of vehicles which
cannot be economically or safely repaired.

All total loss vehicles are placed into one of four categories,
depending on the extent of the damage, with the necessary action to be
taken in each case.  Vehicles in Category A are suitable for scrap
only; Category B should be broken for spare parts.  DVLA is notified
and the police are asked to investigate if the vehicle is relicensed or
an application for a registration document made.  Categories C and D
cover vehicles which can be repaired.

COMPUTER TRACING

Absolute Software Corporation, Canada, has introduced CompuTrace TRS,
which it claims is the world's first computer tracing technology and
theft retrieval system.  Absolute Software monitors the location of its
customer's computers using CompuTrace, a software program which is
undetectable once it is loaded onto the hard drive of the computer.
The program takes control of the computer's modem once a week, turns
the modem's speakers off and then secretly dials Absolute Software's
toll-free monitoring centre where the call is logged.

If a computer is lost or stolen, the customer contacts the CompuTrace
Theft Retrieval Centre to report the incident.  Once the theft is
reported, the customer's account is changed to alert status, so that
the call will be traced.  If a thief connects the stolen computer's
modem to a telephone line, when CompuTrace makes its scheduled call,
the Theft Retrieval Centre tracks the call using advanced equipment
that cannot be interfered with by call-blocking methods.

CompuTrace does not disrupt work while it makes a call.  If the modem
is in use or disconnected, the system waits until a telephone line is
open or connected.  It does not show up in the file directory, and will
survive even if the hard disk is formatted.  CompuTrace works with any
DOS or Windows 3.1 based computer as long as it is equipped with a
modem.  Absolute Software will release Windows 95, Macintosh and OS/2
versions of CompuTrace this spring.

ESCALATING MEDICAL COSTS, SKI RESORTS

The cost of having an injury treated in the world's most popular ski
destinations continues to climb rapidly, according to the second annual
study of medical costs by Home & Overseas, specialist travel subsidiary
of Eagle Star.  The study, based on an analysis of claims for medical
expenses submitted by skiers, shows that Britons can expect to pay at
least 10% more than last winter for treatment in their resort - the
second year running that costs have risen at this level.

Topping the table of the most expensive places for medical treatment
are resorts in Switzerland and the USA.  For example, the cost of
treating a damaged knee cartilage, requiring three days in-patient
care, now averages around #4,000 in Switzerland and #6,000 in the US.
Helicopter rescues now cost around #60 for every minute the helicopter
is in the air.  In France and Italy, typical costs for treating a torn
ligament in ski resorts are between #200 and #500 for around an hour's
consultation.

QUADRIPLEGIA AND PARAPLEGIA COVER

Swire Fraser has launched what it claims is a unique personal accident
programme for schools and sports clubs, providing 24 hour cover for
pupils/members for permanent total disablement resulting in
quadriplegia or paraplegia.  This cover can top-up an existing policy
to a total limit of #1m per pupil.

Director Graham Reid said: "The risk of quadriplegia or paraplegia is
of increasing concern to authorities today, where existing policies are
totally inadequate.  This policy now offers a realistic level of
indemnity for sportsmen and women who will, in the main, have their
full life in front of them".  More than seven million people receive
hospital treatment as a result of accidents each year and it is
estimated that of these 1.8m are sports related.

WORKERS' COMP EXECUTIVE via NewsNet
January 8, 1996

CARRIERS PLAN TO FOCUS ON MAKING REGS MORE EFFECTIVE (PART 1)

SACRAMENTO - The assembly is in the hands of conservative Republican Curt
Pringle of Garden Grove. The state senate is controlled by a liberal Democrat,
Bill Lockyer of Hayward. There is a very significant election - from a
legislative standpoint -coming up this fall. And so the California workers'
comp insurance lobby is taking a reality check on the chances of any important
bills being passed this year.

The general thinking is that any significant improvements in the system have a
better chance of coming from new or improved regulations that implemented or
should have implemented reforms passed in 1989, 1990 and 1993.

One lobbyist told the Executive,"I don't think public policymakers feel the
need to do any major workers' comp reform. So efforts at improving the
workers' comp system should be viewed as: What can we do? What can enough of
the stakeholders agree to so that they can put something on Wilson's desk?"

Other lobbyists agreed that major reforms are unlikely, but that some cleanup
bills from last year are a possibility. Assemblyman David Knowles,
R-Placerville, has informed the lobby that he is interested in the permanent
partial disability issue and looking at ways to legislatively enact the
American Medical Association guidelines as the impairment rating system.

The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation reportedly is
considering a study on the schedule to determine whether or not it has a major
impact on the cost of workers' comp and whether or not it adequately
compensates the injured worker, says Barry Carmody, president of the
Association of California Insurance Companies.

According to Mark Webb, senior counsel for the Coalition of California
Compensation Companies, the assembly-man's exposure PPD draft, that is making
the rounds, would also make some significant revisions to the med-legal
process. While the measure is gaining support by the day, Webb feels it is
also the type of bill that would likely face difficulty getting passed this
year.

At the top of the list of 1996 legislative goals for the Alliance of American
Insurers happens to be an effort to pass two of their bills from 1995 - AB
1046 and AB 1859.

"What they have in common," says Pete Gorman, assistant vice president of the
Alliance, "is that they reduce the discretionary authority of the Department
of Industrial Relations. One (AB 1046) brings them in under the OAL (Office of
Administrative Law). The other prohibits them from assigning out the lien
service process."

A second top priority item for the Alliance is one that is on everyone's hit
list, effective action on the Tricor v. State Fund case.

"I don't think the bureau's (WCIRB) weighting scheme (frequency based
experience modifications) does it," says Gorman. "It just flies in the face of
every traditional way of developing X-Mods."

Gorman is also leery of a proposal to give the insurance commissioner
administrative authority to review disputes before they went to litigation.

"We don't agree with that approach," he says. "I think it's too bureaucratic.
And the cost-benefit probably isn't there. What we may do...It seems to me to
be much easier just to run a bill that declares legislative intent that
elevates the standard for litigation from one of injury to one of bad faith."

He explains that an aggrieved employer would have to demonstrate that a
workers' comp carrier had taken a certain action in bad faith in order to have
it actionable. As it is now, he says, the employer can say unintentional or
intentional, "we suffered an injury and so therefore we can sue."

Gorman says, "So just raise the bar on where you can sue. That would be a much
better way to do this, because I don't think the legislature ever intended
this consequence of Tricor. They wanted only to give employers access to the
files." A third Alliance legislative goal is an updated medical fee schedule.

"We've already filed a letter saying we think it's going to end up being a
floor instead of a ceiling," Gorman fears. "And for small companies, we're
placed at a disadvantage. We don't have the leverage and the bargaining power
to get it down below that floor, whereas the big companies do."

The American Insurance Association has a list of specific issues on which it
would like to see action taken during 1996. Terry Miller, assistant vice
president, expresses concern over one of the first issues that needs to be
dealt with, the hospital fee schedule proposed by the Division of Workers'
Compensation.

"The AIA says we should postpone it," Miller relates. "We believe there is
currently insufficient information to accurately gauge the impact of the
schedule on workers' comp hospital costs."

Miller also notes that there appears to be no hospital fee schedule anywhere
in the US that is widely supported as THE model.

The AIA is also involved with PPD and the benefits of permanent partial
disability. It is working on a PPD bill but that the effort is in a very
embryonic stage at this point. Miller said that there were several bills on
the subject being floated around for comment.

A third key issue for the AIA is fraud. Miller says that the AIA has been
discussing the subject with the Department of Insurance "because it wants some
fraud legislation." Exactly what it should be, how broad it should be and
whether it should be geared just to workers' comp is still not determined.

Given the possibility of legislative gridlock, Webb of the CCCC sees the
principal focus for the year should be on reviewing all that's been put in
place over the last five years and seeing "what we can do with Casey Young,
Chip Aubrey and Chuck Quackenbush to make at least the best world we can with
what we have to deal with."

It's no surprise that Tricor is on CCCC's list, and Webb says, "We will work
closely with the California Workers' Compensation Institute and see what types
of things can be done to, at least, bring it into sharper focus - what the
courts need to look at in dealing with these types of bad faith lawsuits.."

CARRIERS PLAN TO FOCUS ON MAKING REGS MORE EFFECTIVE (PART 2)

Webb said that he felt it was significant that the CWCI board in December
decided to "take a step back" on any actions toward Tricor. The question they
had in mind was whether or not there would be any more such suits once the
system had completely shifted to competitive rating. The practices that had
come under fire in Tricor were a phenomenon of the minimum rate law era soon
to be in the dim and distant past.

Webb adds, "At the same time, let's look at ways that insurance cases can be
better made in the courts so that potentially we don't have 12 jurors suddenly
becoming claims managers."

The CCCC plans to present testimony on the permanent disability schedule to
the Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation at its hearing
on January 18 in Los Angeles. The hearing should be a packed house.

Webb says the association will then look at vehicles currently in place,
including Senator Steve Peace's SB 622 which was designed last year to make
the Chula Vista Democrat's 1993 health care organization law more effective.

The CCCC has been working with the California Association of HMOs to invent a
noncontroversial means for implementing managed care in a more effective way.
Webb notes that it's a task that's easier said than done.

"If we have some good treatment guidelines promulgated by the Industrial
Medical Council (and we're able) to combine those with...good utilization data
guidelines already in place, we may be able to get somewhere," Webb reasons.
"And that goes back to saying we need to get 1989, 90 and 93 implemented
before we can come back (to the legislature) and say this doesn't work."

In order to make the HCO process work, there will have to be changes in the
structural flaws - "multiple offerings, the multiple time frame, the ability
to opt out," Webb observes. They make it difficult for a capitated arrangement
to work. "All those are reasons why it has not received much of a response in
the marketplace."

But the point Webb wanted to stress was that there were other medical cost
containment devices that were put in place in 1993, "that aren't there, that
aren't being done right now." Webb says, "That goes back to the IMC and
treatment guidelines which could make managed care work even better under just
30-day control. And we're seeing a lot of managed care marketing using that
30-day control."

The ACIC's Carmody wants to champion a review of regulations. "There are just
too many regulations," says Carmody, "that cost too much money and that don't
provide any additional services to workers, attorneys, insurers or anybody
else." The way to get the ball rolling, he suggests is to get all of the
stakeholders to ask the questions: "Why am I getting this report? Why am I
producing this report? Why do I have to have this report?"

He said you need to take the reporting alone, forgetting the conduct of
business, and evaluate what is really critical and essential, and what is not.
Then you make recommendations to the administration "saying we think these
regulations, these records, this material required by regulation is
unnecessary, and it's a cost-driver. And let the administration make a
decision on whether it wants to repeal the regs or not."

Carmody observes that it doesn't mean the regulations are going to be changed
automatically but it does mean that those being regulated will have the
opportunity to provide their perspective on the value of the regulations.

"The governor basically called for this," Carmody notes. "He called for all
agencies to review their regs. The problem is the agencies do it alone. They
do it in a vacuum, a bureaucratic one in which they decide what is right and
wrong, or what is good and bad for the regulated public."

Carmody emphatically adds, "Frankly, they're not elected. And the public ought
to have some input on whether or not these regulations are needed."

The ACIC president feels there are kindred souls out there who aren't fond of
all the reports they have to fill out and submit to bureaucrats.

"I remember after the '89 and '93 reforms, the moaning from all of the
attorneys about all the paper one has to go through. And all of the reports
that are thrown in the trash can because their workers don't understand them,"
Carmody said. "Perhaps the benefit notices report process is the most
ludicrous of them all. They started out at about 15 and are up to 150 now.
Why? Why!"

AIA, CCCC CONFIRM W/C EXEMPTION FROM 1995'S EXPERT WIITNESS LAW

SACRAMENTO - An opinion by the California Legislative Counsel has put smiles
on the faces of more than just a few members of the workers' comp insurance
community in California.

The Counsel has determined that legislation passed last year does not subject
employers and insurers to additional expert witness fees in cases before the
Workers' Compensation Appeals Board. The legislation, AB 1204, was strongly
opposed by several company trade associations which requested the governor to
veto. He didn't.

Once the measure was chaptered, representatives from the American Insurance
Association and the Coalition of California Compensation Companies jointly
requested that Assemblyman David Knowles (R-Placerville), chairman of the
Assembly Insurance Committee, seek a Counsel clarification on whether the law
resulting from passage of AB 1204 applied to workers' comp.

"This opinion puts to rest any question about the testimony of medical
witnesses in workers' compensation cases," said Terry Miller, AIA assistant
vice president, western region. "It is clear that the director of the Division
of Workers' Compensation has the authority for setting witness fees by
establishing a medical-legal fee schedule."

The Legislative Counsel's opinion specifically states: "The fees for witnesses
providing medical testimony before the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board or
in other workers' compensation proceedings are not affected by the amendments
to Section 1034 of the Code of Civil Procedure enacted by Chapter 797 of the
Statutes of 1995 (AB 1204)."

Miller explained, "The expert witness fee is exactly the kind of hidden cost
that we sought to eliminate with the 1993 reforms. The insurance industry must
continue working together to ensure that those reforms are fully implemented.
Cooperative efforts, such as confirming the witness fee workers' comp
exemption, will ensure that cost savings for employers are realized."

The AIA and the CCCC have asked Casey Young, administrative director of the
Division of Workers' Compensation, to review current Workers' Compensation
Appeals Board rules regarding witness fees to make certain that they are
consistent with the provisions of Section 5307.6 of the Labor Code, which
authorizes the director to establish the medical-legal fee schedule.

CA-BASED W/C CARRIERS RANKED BY DIRECT LOSS RATIO, 1994 3RD QUARTER

SAN FRANCISCO - The third quarter 1995 workers' comp insurance figures for
California-based carriers, a regular feature in the Executive, are reported on
page 3.

The carriers are ranked according to their direct loss ratios with the highest
at the top of the page, lowest at the bottom. Keep in mind, the figures
represent each company's, or group of companies, total business writings, not
just those for California.

Fremont Indemnity of California, at the request of its management has been
separated from the other members of its group in order to reflect a more
accurate picture. Readers' attention is drawn to a boxed section, Direct
Premium Change, which reflects the percentage change between the current YTD
and previous YTD premiums.

FIRST W/C BILL, SB636, SCHEDULED FOR HEARING

SACRAMENTO - Amid the turmoil of Assembly leadership fight, the second half of
California s 1995-96 biennial legislative session got underway last week, and
the first workers' comp bill, SB 636 by Sen. Raymond Haynes (R-Murietta), is
scheduled for a hearing today, January 8, in the Senate Transportation
Committee.

SB 636 would require a driving school owner who employs one or more driving
instructors to file proof of workers' comp coverage with the Department of
Motor Vehicles. The measure is opposed by the Association of California
Insurance Companies.

A bill supported by the workers' comp insurance community in general, AB 1859
by Assemblywoman Valerie Brown (D-Sonoma), would, if passed and signed,
rescind the Division of Workers' Compensation's exemption from the
Administrative Procedure Act in adopting regulations. It is scheduled and can
be considered at any time for concurrence in senate amendments. The bill is
pending without a date set for action.

COALITION OPENS DOOR TO ALL W/C CARRIERS IN CALIFORNIA

LOS ANGELES - John Pasqualetto, president of Great States Insurance Company,
was reelected chairman of the Coalition of California Compensation Companies
at its fourth annual meeting.

The coalition's board of directors unanimously approved a change in its
by-laws opening membership to all admitted workers' compensation insurance
companies doing business in California.

Commenting on the change in the by-laws, Chairman Pasqualetto said, "We
recognize that the dynamics in both the market and the legislature that led to
the creation of the CCCC have changed dramatically. The new competitive rating
environment has certainly delivered greater volatility and diversity in the
marketplace. We intend to refine our focus in the coming year and work to
support and facilitate the continued transition to open rating."

Stan Braun, president of Pacific Rim Assurance Company, and Mary Lou Misrahy,
president of USA Casualty Company, will continue in their positions of
treasurer and secretary, respectively.

The primary focus of the CCCC for 1996 is one of the most vexing issues
affecting workers' comp companies in California today, the rise in bad faith
litigation. The key court case on the issue, Tricor v. State Fund, tends to
dominate the debate over virtually all aspects of insurer operations, not just
reserving practices, the CCCC notes.

Any solution to the problem, the CCCC opines, must acknowledge the need of
policyholders to have legitimate complaints resolved while at the same time
balanced with the legitimate interest of insurers and producers to provide
quality services to employers and timely payment of benefits to injured
workers.

COMMISSION TO PUBLISH SAFETY COURSE ON INTERNET

SAN FRANCISCO - The California Commission on Health and Safety and Workers'
Compensation is developing a comprehensive list of workers' compensation,
health and safety related courses offered by colleges, universities and
community colleges. The list will be posted on the Internet as well as printed
for members of the public without on-line access.

The commission's new service will include the name of the institution,
information on degree and certification programs, course names and
descriptions, schedule of classes, tuition costs (if any) and referrals and/or
instructions on how to obtain additional information.

The commission plans for the project to be ready for the winter and spring
1996 courses. The list of courses will be available on the commission page
under the Workers' Compensation and Division of Occupation Safety and Health
categories of the DIR (Department of Industrial Relations) Home Page at the
Internet address http://www.dir.ca.gov, and they welcome visitors. The
information will be updated each semester.

MISSOURI LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WORKERS' COMP REFORM AGAIN

JEFFERSON CITY - A workers' comp reform bill, similar to one that died in
committee last year, will be introduced in the Missouri legislature in the
upcoming session.

The 1996 version of the reform bill will attempt to more clearly define
workplace accidents, give administrative law judges less leeway in their
decisions and institute other reforms aimed at reducing fraud and speeding up
payments.

The opponents of the bill last year are reported to have the same objections
to the new version. They claim the bill is too pro-employer.

Legislators may lack the appetite to push forward since premiums have been
coming down, and there seems to be little perceived need for additional
reform.

MISSISSIPPI W/COMP RATES TO DROP 11.3%

JACKSON - George Dale, Mississippi Insurance Commissioner, says workers' comp
insurance rates will drop an average 11.3 percent starting March 1 for the
state's employers. This reduction is recommended by the National Council on
Compensation Insurance.

The commissioner predicts that the rate decline will save the state's
businesses an estimated $25.5 million in 1996. NCCI spokesman Robert Maxwell
said safer workplaces and attacks on insurance fraud were helping to
contribute to the improving cost situation. The 11.3 percent applies only to
the voluntary market rates, not the assigned risk plan.

OREGON WORKPLACE INJURY, ILLNESS RATE CONTINUES DECLINE STARTED IN 1988

SALEM - Just released 1994 Oregon workplace injury and illness data show that
new record lows have been set for both public and private employers.

Last year's public sector rate was 6.3 cases, which includes all work-related
accidents and ailments recordable under Oregon OSHA, per 100 full-time
workers. For the private sector it was 8.7 cases per 100.

The 1994 rates continue a downward trend that began in 1988, coinciding with
the state's effort to reform the workers' comp system, cut costs and improve
safety. Last year's public sector rate fell 29.2 percent in the last seven
years and 21.6 percent for the private sector.

NINE MONTHS RESULTS ARE STUNNING

Some interesting developments appear as far as premium decreases. The average
for all California-based carriers reporting on a timely basis (note: Alistar
Ins.. did not) is a net premium decrease through the first nine months of open
rating of 22.1%.

Among the most newsworthy is California Compensation Insurance, a unit of
Foundation Health, which changed from a growth position of 4% second quarter
year-to-date, to a net decrease of 7.3% in premiums at the end of the first
three quarters. This represents a change in premium position of 11.3%.
California Compensation is reporting a direct loss percentage of 54.8% which
appears to compare favorably with the average reported figure of 59.3%.

Allianz Insurance Company and Unicare Insurance are now the only two carriers
of significance which are reporting premium growth. Allianz 15% YTD and
Unicare 10.3%.

NOW COME THE PREMIUM INCREASES

Clearly putting the writing on the walls, many carriers have filed new rates
for 1996. Most do not take effect until February, well after the competitive
January renewals. The loss ratio debacle predicted by all in the early days of
open rating seems to be in the offing, albeit fairly well covered up.

With premiums down some 22 percent and pure loss ratios being reported at 60
percent the actual combined loss ratios we will see - after development - will
prove this year mighty unprofitable for many carriers. Will combined ratios be
reported in the 130s to 150s like so many pundits predicted? Nope, they will
not be reported in this year's results. But they will develop.

According to the Compline rate analysts (actually they can also be called
rate-icidal maniacs because they seem to actually enjoy the monitoring of this
stuff) there have been some significant changes in the rate basis from many
carriers. Here is a brief recap.

Fremont Group filed a 33.2% increase and re-calculated its own rates again.
State Compensation Insurance Fund increased manual rates 8% resulting in a
6.8% increase in collectable premium. SCIF is maintaining its current premium
discounts. Allianz Insurance is adding a 24-hour pilot program and taking a 4%
increase. Fairmont/TIG Insurance filed a 14.7% increase in rates. Citation
Insurance has taken a 9.3% increase. National American Insurance Company of
California is maintaining its '95 rates but dropped its split rating which was
based upon EAP over or under $10,000. Great States Insurance, a unit of FHP,
has instituted an 11% rate increase. Liberty Mutual Insurance Group filed
increases of from 9.7 to 15.2 percent depending upon the company. Safeco has
provided for an 11.3% increase, although it is using the same multipliers as
last year. Golden Eagle Insurance calculated a change of 10.782% and
recalculated its own rates again. Kemper Companies took a 10.1% increase.

So there you have it.

REGULATORY LOBBYING

We tend to think of lobbying as being a function of exerting one's will or
wishes (or at least attempting to) on the legislative process. But those whose
institutional memories or practical experience remember the legendary Clayton
R. Jackson, know that lobbying is also a function of the manipulation of the
regulator's process. Rules and Regs make up the real game sometimes, not the
laws passed by elected representatives.

And this year, more focus will be on changing, amending and deleting
regulations than the legislative-type reforms. One of the leaders of this
process is Ed Woodward, honcho over at the California Workers' Compensation
Institute. He is clearly emerging as one of the chief architects of what may
very well become a key reform year in California.

DOI'S FRAZIER TO HEAD INITIATIVE

Rex Frazier, the chief of the Legislative Bureau for the California Department
of Insurance in Sacramento, has been given a temporary assignment heading up
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush's initiative to ban non-economic payments to
uninsured motorists and drunk drivers.

The commissioner filed the initiative, "Personal Responsibility Act," for
inclusion in the November 1996 ballot. While the at-fault driver would have to
pay medical expenses, lost wages, etc. to the uninsured, he would not pay
anything for pain and suffering. The commissioner says it will save at least
$300 million a year in auto insurance costs.

Some industry lobbyists hope that, win-lose-or-draw, the assignment won't
affect Frazier's return to his post. Reportedly, Greg Butler, Quackenbush's
deputy for policy and research will fill in for Frazier.

MID OCEAN IN NEW WAVE

THE INEXORABLE TRANSITION of Lloyd's from a market to something more
resembling the food court of a shopping mall, sheltering under its
franchising umbrella insurance companies rather than syndicates of
merchant venturers, took a major step forward at the end of 1995.  The
commercial future of the managing agencies involved now appears to be
assured, whether the Lloyd's rescue plan works or not, and so do
comfortable futures for the agency principals who will no doubt have
benefitted from the purchase of substantial goodwill.

On 13 December, Mid Ocean Ltd, Hamilton, announced the effective
acquisition of Brockbank Group plc, London (WICR180/18), Terra Nova
(Bermuda) Holdings Ltd, Hamilton, that of Octavian Syndicate Management
Ltd, London, and CNA Reinsurance Group, London, the creation of CNA
Corporate Capital Ltd, a subsidiary of CNA Management Ltd, which will
provide #25m (US$38.75m) in underwriting capacity to three managing
agencies through the creation of four parallel syndicates.  The total
commitment of capacity is #225m, added to which is a further #18m from
single corporate member syndicate 1211 backed by USF&G Corp, Baltimore
MD.

Mid Ocean and Brockbank will create a group which brings together the
existing Brockbank managing agency businesses with Baltusrol, a US$78m
Mid Ocean subsidiary created as the holding company for two new Lloyd's
dedicated corporate syndicates underwriting in parallel with
Brockbank's existing syndicates.  Mid Ocean will have a 51% share of
the enlarged Brockbank Group, and $50m of Baltusrol's capital will
provide capacity for the two corporate syndicates.  Brockbank's
business will substantially be transferred into a new unit, Brockbank
Holdings, which will exchange shares with Baltusrol, the latter taking
51% in Brockbank Holdings and Brockbank Holdings 49% in Baltusrol.  A
shareholders' agreement between the two groups includes undisclosed
undertakings providing Brockbank with equally undisclosed "additional
rights" for a limited period, while Mid Ocean received a commitment
that the transaction may be unwound if certain "trigger events", mainly
related to the acceptance of the Lloyd's rescue plan and the future
stability of the market, occur or do not occur before 1 September.
Otherwise, Mid Ocean will acquire all but one share of Brockbank by 1
September 1997 at a price independently determined, in cash or Mid
Ocean shares, or loan notes.  Brockbank executives representing 28.6%
of issued shares have already committed themselves to accept the offer.
 The merger was approved by Brockbank shareholders at an EGM on 29
December, irrevocable commitments from 56.7% of its shareholders having
previously been made.

Mid Ocean reported a net profit of US$182.9m for the year to 31
October, up from $91m in 1994.  Gross written premiums were $445.8m, up
from $358.6m.  Net income for Q4 included a provision of $21.5m for
losses arising from Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn, partly by a reduction
in Mid Ocean's provisions for the Kobe earthquake from $10m to $5m.
Net investment income totalled $73.8m for the year, up from $51.5m,
with net losses on investments down from $18.2m to $1.5m.

Terra Nova acquired the ongoing business of Octavian for an undisclosed
price.  A new managing agency, Octavian Syndicate Management Ltd, will
be created for 1996 and beyond, operating as an independent business
unit within the Terra Nova group.  The existing Octavian agency will
continue to be responsible for its syndicates until 1995 and prior
years are closed.  Nigel Rogers will continue as Octavian m/d, and join
the Terra Nova Bermuda board.  Terra Nova Capital Ltd, a newly created
corporate capital vehicle, will provide capacity to each of the five
Octavian syndicates (non-marine 702, aviation 959, marine 1009, marine
329, Abbey Motor 554).

CNA Re's new subsidiary CNA Corporate Capital Ltd, a subsidiary of CNA
Management Ltd, will provide #25m in capacity to Claremount
Underwriting Agency Ltd, London, syndicate 2506, Tower U/W Agents Ltd
(Archer Group plc, London) syndicates 923 and 947, and Cox Insurance
Holdings plc (Energy & Marine) syndicate 658 (#5m).

USF&G is the sole corporate member of syndicate 1211 through new
subsidiary F&G UK Underwriters Ltd, London, which has initial capacity
of #18m.  The syndicate will be underwritten by John Dendy, formerly
underwriter of syndicate 546 (Sturge Non-Marine Syndicate Management
Ltd).  At the same time, USF&G has formed and funded a new managing
agency for the syndicate, F&G UK Agency Ltd, London, as a joint venture
between F&G Holdings Ltd and managing agents Ashley Palmer Holdings
Ltd, London, which will provide support staff in accounts and
reporting, claims and credit control and reinsurance security
monitoring.

CER

Cie Europeenne de Reassurances, Paris, has announced an increase in
capital to SF106.673m (US$91.m) as part of a reorganisation plan which
will result in the unit trading under the new name of CER Paris.  As
part of that plan, Geneva-based financial holding Intercasings SA and
Penmore SA, Geneva, formerly the captive of the HEP power provider
Penhold Group of Canada, have acquired 100% of CER Paris.  Penmore was
sold, free of any liability, to Intercasings, and assumed the name of
Cie Europeenne de Reassurances (CER) at the beginning of December.

A capital increase of SF42m for CER in the form of convertible bonds
will be underwritten by Caisse Inter Professionnelle d'Assurance
(CIPAV), Paris, a non-profit organisation, effectively the holding and
operating company of 12 pension funds for French professions.  CIPAV is
putting up CF28m towards the capital increase and will take a 23.14%
stake in CER.  Ultimately Intercasings will only hold around 12.5% of
the equity of CER and about 10% of CER Paris when the bonds are
converted into CER shares.  Intercasings will retain the voting
majority in CER which has been delegated to the management of CER
Paris, with an agreement not to intervene in underwriting or investment
strategy.  All new and renewal risks will be underwritten in the name
of Cie Europeenne de Reassurances, with the exception of risks from
French ceding companies where CER Paris will remain the issuing
company.

CER Paris said in a statement that a further capital increase at CER
was currently being finalised, which will ultimately bring the total
equity of the group to SF125.2m.

DAI ICHI KYOTO RE

Philip Singer of Coopers & Lybrand and Mark Riley of Clark Whitehill
have been appointed joint provisional liquidators to Dai Ichi Kyoto
Reinsurance Co SA and Kobe Reinsurance SA, both Brussels.  They were
appointed by the High Court on the petition of the Belgian curator,
Jean-Michel Derick, in order to protect assets in the UK jurisdiction.
Mr Derick was appointed curator of the companies by the Belgian courts
in November.  The appointment of the provisional liquidators
effectively halts all legal actions involving these two companies
including the suit launched by CRM Insurance Services Ltd, London,
which managed a contact office for the two reinsurers (WICR161/16).

Shareholders in SCOR SA, Paris, have approved plans for the absorption
of its largest shareholder HCS, the holding company which controls 48%
of the group's shares held by the major French insurance groups
(WICR178/17).  Following the merger Cie UAP SA, Paris, will have a 39%
direct stake in SCOR, Assurances Generales de France (AGF), Paris, 11%
and AXA SA, Paris, 10%.  SCOR said in a statement that the move
streamlines the legal and financial structure of the SCOR Group without
any dilution effects and will improve the liquidity of its shares.
SCOR also confirmed that its results for 1995 would be up strongly on
the net profit of about Fr280m (US$56.9m) earned in 1994.

SWISS RE

In keeping with its strategy of making Asia its third main operational
area, Schweizerische Ruckversicherung Ges (Swiss Re), Zurich, together
with ten Thai insurers, has formed a joint venture under the name SR
Risk Management Services Ltd, Bangkok.  The ten Thai companies in the
joint venture are Bangkok Insurance Public Co Ltd, The Dhipaya
Insurance Co Ltd, Insurance One Ltd, Muang Thai Life Assurance Co Ltd,
Phatra Insurance Public Co Ltd, Safety Insurance Public Co Ltd, The
Samaggi Insurance Public Company Ltd, The Siam City Insurance Company
Ltd, The Thai Commercial Insurance Public Co Ltd, and Thai Insurance
Public Co Ltd.

The venture has now received government approval.  Swiss Re will own
49% of the new company, and the ten local companies 5.1% each.  Thus
the company elegantly overcomes legal restrictions in Thailand, which
make it nearly impossible to set up a branch office in the country.
Swiss Re said "the partners aim to enhance reinsurance know-how and
related services in the Thai marketplace" through the venture.

In addition, the insurance authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore have
approved Swiss Re's plans to upgrade its local representative offices
to branches.  Following the start-up of operations in Bangkok towards
the end of this month, Swiss Re will be represented by eight offices in
Asia.  In addition to the outposts in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Manila,
Singapore, Taipei, Seoul and Beijing, offices are planned for Kuala
Lumpur, Shanghai and Jakarta.  The company is also closely watching
Vietnam and might enter that market soon, too, according to spokesman
Hermann Hefti.  At present the Swiss Re group as a whole writes about
SF1.4bn to SF1.5bn (US$1.2bn to $1.3bn) in the Asia Pacific region,
some 10% to 12% of its income, Mr Hefti said.

CIGNA

Linda Kaiser, the insurance commissioner of Pennsylvania, is to deliver
her decision on the proposed restructuring of CIGNA Corp, Philadelphia,
shortly after 12 January.  Despite three public hearings, American
International Group Inc (AIG), New York, Chubb Group, Warren NJ, and St
Paul Fire & Marine, St Paul MN, are still fiercely contesting CIGNA's
plans on the grounds that they are unfair, illegal and not in the
interests of policyholders because all of the documentation supporting
them has not been made available.  CIGNA has responded that the only
documents kept out of the public domain had been those which contained
information about policyholders currently in litigation over asbestos
or environmental claims.

-  CIGNA has been fined US$442,500 by the Insurance Department of
California for ratings errors and violations in its documentation after
it was discovered that the insurer had failed to file proper rate
increase applications for 255 of 468 policies, thereby overcharging a
small number of clients by US$1.3m.  CIGNA has repaid over $1m in
refunds to twenty Californian  mainly D&O policyholders.

GAN

Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN), Paris, intends to dispose of up
to Fr9bn (US$1.8bn) in additional assets to meet its debts and the cost
of its defeasance operations.  As part of this programme chairman Jean-
Jacques Bonnaud said that GAN was willing in principle to give up its
majority stake in banking subsidiary Credit Industrial et Commercial
(CIC), the first time that GAN has publicly acknowledged that its
shareholding in CIC could fall below 50%.

M Bonnaud said that the state had endorsed plans for GAN's
restructuring prior to sale at a board meeting in December.  He had
taken the acceleration in asset disposals to mean a greater commitment
towards privatization on the part of the government, and suggested 1997
as a possible date.  Additional assets to be sold off have yet to be
decided, with sales to take place over the next four to five years.

HDI/CITIBANK/TRANSATLANTISCHE

HDI Haftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie Versicherungsverein aG,
Hanover, appears to be on the verge of a major alliance with another
mutual, with a candidate most likely to be found in the life sector.
According to WICR's correspondent in Germany, this is the conclusion
which can be drawn from the reorganisation initiated by HDI, and from
remarks by chief executive Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl.

HDI has been busy in recent months.  It has signed a wide-ranging co-
operation deal with Citibank Privatkunden AG and Citicorp Deutschland
AG and, with effect from 1 January, took over the German insurance
operations of Citibank, Citi Lebensversicherung AG and Citi
Versicherung AG, both Dusseldorf.  It acquired Transatlantische
Lebensversicherungs-AG (Transleben), Hamburg, in December from Lloyds
Abbey Life plc, Weybridge, which it will merge with its own life
company, HDI Lebensversicherung AG.  However, the company's life
business itself will be moved away from that company into a new,
Hamburg-based life insurer, leaving HDI Leben as an empty shell with a
considerable tax-loss to carry forward.  HDI Leben will be renamed and
converted into a sub-holding under the parent HDI VVaG, and into which
all operational insurance interests outside the actual HDI VVaG will be
bundled, including those of reinsurer Hannover Ruckversicherung AG,
Hanover, and its subsidiary Eisen und Stahl Ruckversicherung AG.

Such a setup (parental mutuals, sub-holding for other interests) is the
classic model for a "Gleichordnungskonzern", a group formed of two
mutuals which cannot formally merge.  The group is then held together
by a joint management for both, and by stakes in the sub-holding, into
which the mutuals bring their non-mutualised insurance business.  Mr
Baumgartl does not deny that this could be a model and although he says
that there are "no current talks going on", it seems likely that such a
move towards an alliance with a life mutual would not be unwelcome to
him.

Following the signing of the deal with Citibank, Mr Baumgartl said that
"In order to be a global player on the life market, you need premium
income of about DM2bn" (US$1.4bn).  His present life companies are far
short of that: to 30 November, Citi Leben reported premium income of
DM322m for 1995, so the total for the year will be below DM400m.
Transleben reported DM216m for 1994, and the 1995 total is likely to be
below DM300m.  HDI's own life company is still struggling with the
problems of being relatively new, and premium income will total only
DM36m. Together, therefore, the whole HDI life group will write not
more than DM650m - and it is difficult to see where HDI will gain the
DM2bn it is seeking, if Mr Baumgartl does not have a major partnership
up his sleeve.

The deal with Citibank was not surprising, and aimed as much at volume
as the sales channels offered by the two companies.  Citi Leben has a
total life portfolio of DM16.7bn and Citi Versicherung gross premium of
DM23.5m.  The former Citibank insurers will continue as companies in
their own right, and will change their names to CiV Lebensversicherung
AG and CiV Versicherung AG.  Product names like "Citi Leben Plus 4"
will also remain unchanged, and policies will continue to be sold
exclusively through the sales channels of Citibank Privatkunden.  Those
channels - reaching at present about 2.5m customers - were of key
importance for HDI, Mr Baumgartl stressed.  "That is why we were only
interested in an exclusive and long-term cooperation with Citibank.
Without Citibank's salesforce, the two insurers would be of no value
for us!" he said, adding that by co-operating with Citibank, HDI had
completed its range of distribution channels.  HDI had no interest in
becoming an Allfinanz group, Mr Baumgartl said.

HDI will sell banking products exclusively for Citibank, and in return
Citibank will only offer CiV and other HDI policies in the insurance
sector.  Mr Baumgartl said that there would be no assimilation between
the Citi and HDI products.  "The CiV products will remain tailor-made
for Citibank's demands," he said

According to Mr Baumgartl, HDI's moves to strengthen its life business
were needed to counterbalance the sharp swings in the profits of the
industrial, motor and portfolios which were the group's major lines of
business.  "What we need is the broad private life business with a
relatively balanced development," he said.

The HDI deal with Lloyds Abbey Life was also confirmed in December, at
a price of about DM110m, according to sources at Lloyds Abbey Life.
The company has life business in force of about DM7.2bn.  For 1995, the
company again forecasts losses, although the expected DM7m is a strong
improvement over the DM11m loss in 1994.  Transleben, which
concentrates on broker-produced business, has suffered from high
cancellation ratios.  In 1992, it began a reorganisation, including a
drastic restructuring of its sales network.  HDI said that its 1995
premium income rose 9% from DM2.78bn to DM3.03bn, with motor being the
main earner, up by 140,000 risks to 1.8m at the year-end, and giving
HDI a market share of 4% - one of the winners in the present price war.
 1995 motor results had been excellent, but following massive price
cuts, an underwriting loss was likely for 1996.  Industrial fire, too,
was suffering from weaker prices, board member Gunter Wager said.

HDI officials confirmed that the company is one of four insurers
bidding for the business acquired by the UK's Automobile Association
(AA) from its members, more than 1m policies a year. Originally, HDI
had been the only bidder.  They also indicated that the acquisition of
a small insurer in Italy was likely soon, but did not specify any
candidate.

INDEPENDENT/LA PALATINE

Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs-AG, Aachen, has finally managed to
rid itself of La Palatine Assurance SA, Suresnes, the source of much
distress for another of its more recent disposals, Aachener
Ruckversicherungs-Ges AG (Aachen Re), Aachen.  Independent Insurance
Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of Independent Insurance Group plc, London,
has taken over Palatine from Groupement Francais d'Assurances IARD
(GFA), Suresnes.  GFA was a subsidiary of the old Aachen Re, which has
now been renamed AM Konzernruckversicherung AG after being transformed
into a purely in-house reinsurer.

GFA has transferred a major portion of its business to Palatine and
sold this business with the company.  Palatine has been active in the
French personal lines market since 1990 and has mainly sold motor,
property and accident policies via brokers and multiple agents.  The
net assets of Palatine were worth Fr35m (US$7.1m) on transfer to
Independent, which secured guarantees particularly regarding reserve
adequacy and Fr140m in order to restructure Palatine.

KANSA

Former managers of the bankrupt Kansa Pension Insurance Co. Ltd (Elake-
Kansa), Helsinki, were served with writs for damages towards the end of
December, the last possible moment before the statute of limitations
took effect (WICR159/24).  The suits, covering events in 1992, sought
an estimated FM240m (US$55.2m).  Liquidators are suing, among other
things, over property deals which were allegedly sometimes approved by
the boards in retrospect, and sometimes with not all board members
present at crucial meetings.  Further suits could follow concerning
events in 1993 and 1994, and these could raise the claims to FM1bn.
One matter awaiting clarification is the disappearance of FM700m in the
summer of 1993, without the authorisation of the board.

Seven of the Kansa companies have been the subject of extraordinary
audits and all of them are nearly complete.  The administrators have
asked some of the larger creditors for comments, which are expected
this month, but should not change the assessment of management's
responsibilities.  The auditors' reports have also been submitted to
the insurance department of the ministry of social affairs and health.

The bankrupt companies are Elake-Kansa, Kansa Life Insurance Co Ltd
(Henki-Kansa), Helsinki, two reinsurers, Kansa International Corp,
Kansy-yhtyma, and Finansipalveluosakeyhtio Kansa.  The pension company
is in the worst financial condition, with non-guaranteed credits, and a
deficit of around FM1bn (WICR159/24).  The situation of Henki-Kansa
appears better, but depends heavily on the outcome of the legal action.
 Indeed, the state of both companies will only be clear when the legal
actions have been settled, and decided which assets belong to which
company.  The general aim is to reduce the deficits of the bankrupt
companies through selling the Kansa Group's US-based subsidiary
Clarendon Group.  According to Mr Jaatinen the sale is progressing, and
should be finalised during 1996.

LIMIT

London Insurance Market Investment Trust plc (LIMIT), London, has
increased its capacity allocated to the Lloyd's market by 5.2% to
#610.25m (US$946m) for 1996.  The increase means that LIMIT now writes
6.5% of Lloyd's total capacity.  LIMIT said that it will be providing
capacity to two syndicates which it has not previously supported,
#0.25m going to non-marine (mainly nuclear risks) syndicate 1176 (Cox
Newton & Harman Ltd) and #3m to syndicate 1206 managed by Owen & Wilby
Underwriting Agency Ltd, a new managing agent for 1996 formed to manage
the syndicate which will be similar to that of syndicate 718 in the
sphere of accident & health risks, with the exception that no London
market reinsurance risks will be written.

NATIONAL (CALCUTTA)

National Insurance Co Ltd, Calcutta, introduced India's first package
insurance policy for farmers in West Bengal on 25 November.  Union
Minister of State for Finance, Dr Debiprosad Pad, described the scheme
as a significant milestone and urged the other insurance companies to
introduce similar policies.  The scheme will be extended to other areas
if it proves successful in West Bengal.  The package covers 12 frequent
hazards in rural areas, including fire and allied, burglary, electronic
equipment such as TVs and VCRs, bicycles, livestock, poultry and
handcarts.  The fire and burglary sections are compulsory, with an
annual premium of Rs152.50.  Taking five or more sections generates a
premium discount of 15% to 20%.

ORIENTAL

Oriental Insurance Co Ltd (OIC), New Delhi, closed the year 1994-95
with an overall profit of Rs437.1m (US$12.3m).  Motor claims cost it
Rs1,950m.  Chairman KC Mittal said that although there was an
underwriting loss of Rs1,307.9m for the year after a profit of Rs118.5m
in 1993-4, this was essentially due to provisions for motor TPL claims
of Rs5,040m on 21 March 1995, compared with Rs2,730m int he previous
year, and resulting from changes to the Motor Vehicles Act and a trend
towards higher awards by claims tribunals.  He described MTPL claims as
"a bleeding wound" for the company and said there was a dire need for
increasing the third party insurance premium for buses and trucks.

Gross domestic premium income was about Rs11bn, up from Rs10.06bn.
Results in both fire and marine had substantially improved.  Foreign
operations in Nepal, Kuwait and Dubai yielded a revenue surplus of
Rs14.2m against a deficit of Rs40.8m.  Total investment earnings
increased by 20.9% to Rs1,785.1m.

PROVINZIAL

German insurance agents are becoming increasingly worried about the
trend for established agency distribution insurers to set up direct
sales operations.  The agents' association Bundesverband Deutscher
Versicherungskaufleute said that more and more companies were becoming
"unfaithful".  The latest example was the plan of the Rhineland savings
banks, represented by Rheinischer Sparkassen- und Giroverband, together
with Provinzial Feuerversicherungsanstalt der Rheinprovinz, Dusseldorf,
to set up "S Direkt" in Spring this year to offer cheap motor cover.
According to a marketing analysis undertaken by the initiators, 14% of
potential customers were prepared to sign up with a direct sale
insurer.  The idea is also to increase penetration: while the 52
savings banks have a market share of close to 50% of households,
Provinzial has only 9%.  The savings banks will in future be major
shareholders of Provinzial.

SAMPO

The Vantaa public prosecutor is suing three directors of Sampo Group,
Helsinki, Yritys-Sampo managing director Juhani Vesterinen, district
director Seppo Raty, and customer finance director Kari Vihurila, for
bribery for allegedly trying to influence the outcome of the bids for
covering the insurance risks of the City of Vantaa in 1994.  They are
alleged to have granted a loan to a company indirectly owned by Raimo
Salmivuo, who was chairman of the city council at the time.  The
accused deny the charges, and say that Yritys-Sampo bid for the
business was the best according to objective criteria and that any
loans made to Mr Salmivuo were on normal market conditions.  A hearing
in the Vantaa county court is due this month.

SKANDIA

Forsakrings AB Skandia, Stockholm, offshoot Skandia Assurance &
Financial Services (AFS), which runs around 400 unit-liked insurance
funds, has set up a service company on the offshore tax haven of
Labuan, as well as in Borneo, which is currently home to 560 offshore
companies and 46 banks.  Skandia AFS South East Asia will be the
company's largest sales office in SE Asia, targetting Indonesia, the
Philippines, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Taiwan, and
Korea.

Elsewhere in Asia, the group has Royal Skandia in Hong Kong, which
sells unit-linked policies to expatriates working in the colony.
Skandia Asia chairman Bjorn Hall has forecast that pension monies would
grow by between 4% and 5% in real terms in the markets of Hong Kong,
China, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia Thailand, Korea, the
Philippines, and Australia in the coming years, and described India,
Burma, Sri Lanka and Cambodia as other up and coming markets.

Closer to home, Skandia's board has decided to take a more active role
as shareholder.  It will press for the establishment of nominating
committees, which propose candidates to boards, advise on their
remuneration, and propose auditors, in all joint stock companies.
Skandia will also encourage companies to give shareholders more
opportunity to prepare themselves for their AGMs by announcing them a
month in advance and publishing an agenda.  With over 30% of the
Stockholm stock exchange value in foreign hands, this should include an
English translation.

TRYGG-HANSA

Trygg-Hansa AB, Stockholm, is aiming to double its premium income over
the next four years.  Ceo Lars Thunell believes that Swedish insurers
face tough competition from niche and foreign companies, and to survive
must halve their costs.  His method will be to double income while
holding expenses unchanged.  To achieve this, Mr Thunell plans new
distribution channels, simplifying products, improving services to
larger customers, as well as international expansion.  For the non-life
market the watchwords will be simplification and standardised products.
 Mr Thunell was resigned to slow progress at home, "nibbling half a
percent a year" in Sweden.  In addition, non-life products would
increasingly be sold by telephone and over the Internet, which should
allow penetration into Finland and Norway.  Slightly further afield, Mr
Thunell believed that the future markets were in the Baltic area.

Many of the lucrative opportunities were in the life market, he said,
as cutbacks in Sweden's social security and pension system opened the
way for new products combining savings and insurance.  This was a
further reason for the joint stock company (Trygg-Hansa AB)
strengthening its grip on Trygg-Hansa Liv (WICR177/18, 178/23, 183/22).
 A major step towards this consolidation was taken when the shareholder
agreement between SPP and Trygg-Hansa Liv was dissolved in late
December (WICR183/22).  This agreement involved Trygg-Hansa Liv and SPP
undertaking not to sell shares to third parties before the year 2000,
and thereafter offering first refusal to the other until 2010.

This paved the way for Trygg-Hansa Liv to pay SK626.5m (US$94.7m) to
buy 632,000 A shares and 5m B shares of Trygg Hansa AB from SPP.
Together with its existing holding of 19.4% of capital and 28.1% of
votes, this will give Trygg-Hansa Liv all of the 2m A shares in Trygg-
Hansa AB, and leave it with 26.2% of the capital in the company and
39.2% of the votes.  Trygg-Hansa Liv's chairman Gosta Wiking indicated
that the life company did not intend to take up any more Trygg-Hansa AB
shares, so that the outstanding packets were large enough to be
attractive to other institutional investors.

SPP still holds 16,447,512 B shares in Trygg Hansa AB, which have a
market value of around SK1.8bn at a market price of around SK110 a
share.  SPP has already adjusted these to SK98 per share on its balance
sheet (from SK 80), and a substantial proportion is likely to be sold.
The 16.44m shares represent 19.9% of Trygg-Hansa AB's capital and 16.3%
of the votes.  SPP spokesman Klas Rasater indicated that SPP was
unlikely to want to retain more than 5% in the long term.

UAP

Cie UAP SA, Paris, and Interamerican Holding have announced that they
are to reorganise their current shareholding relationship within a
general co-operation agreement.  UAP will sell its 40% stake in
Interamerican Holding, which controls the interests of Interamerican
Property & Casualty Insurance Co, Athens, to Europolitan, Luxembourg.
Simultaneously, UAP's subsidiary Banque Worms, already a majority
shareholder in Interamerican Group member Interbank with 60%, will
become the sole shareholder.  The agreement will enable the
Interamerican Group and Interbank to enhance their joint capacity for
selling insurance products and banking services.  The Interamerican
Group will remain the representative of UAP in Greece.

UAP is proceeding with the restructuring of some of its main businesses
into two holding companies as announced at the end of last year
(WICR183/22).  UAP France became effective on 28 December 1995, and its
board met for the time on 3 January.

The minister of economy and finance (MoF) has also agreed to the
formation of UAP Collectives, which will be responsible for group life
within UAP France.  The MoF also authorised the transfer to it of the
portfolios of group assurance policies from UAP-Vie and UAP Incendie-
Accidents as of 1 January.

UK P&I

Members of the United Kingdom Mutual Steam Ship Assurance Association
Bermuda Ltd (UK P&I Club), Hamilton, have voted overwhelmingly in
favour of the International Group of P&I Club's proposal to limit each
member's liability to pay catastrophe calls to 20% of an owner's
limitation fund for property damage claims under the 1976 Limitation
Convention.  This will result in a potential total claim on all members
in the International Group of between US$18bn and $20bn.  It must be
accepted by a minimum of ten clubs in the International Group,
representing at least 85% of International Group's tonnage.  According
to the UK Club, a number of other clubs are holding meetings of members
along the same lines, with a representative picture of shipowners'
views hopefully becoming apparent by the end of January.  The
proposals, if approved by all members of the group, will be adopted for
the policy year commencing 20 February.

WEST OF ENGLAND

The West of England Ship Owners Mutual Insurance Association
(Luxembourg) has warned that an "even greater level of self-insurance
is the only option" for members of the International Group if
uncertainty surrounding the future of the Lloyd's market continues and
no viable alternative is found.  In its annual review for 1995 the club
said that concerns remained about the International Group's heavy
dependence upon Lloyd's, which still writes up to 80% of the combined
layer of the International Group's reinsurance contract.  While there
had been "some optimism during recent months that Lloyd's would be
restructured", delays in Equitas meant that there was continuing
uncertainty over the future of the leading reinsurer for the club and
the Group and the prospect that "even greater levels of risk will have
to be retained within the industry", it said.

P&I providers could not expect to be immune from the type of litigation
that has "so bedevilled" the Lloyd's market over the past few years.
One way to prevent or defeat such litigation was for a club's
underwriters and committee to have a basic underwriting plan which
analysed potential exposure, laid down a policy to limit that exposure
acceptable to its members and then communicated that policy to them.
The club said that "unless and until the International Group introduces
a realistic limit on cover, a major overspill claim would inevitably
lead to litigation."  While the International Group had recognised the
need for limiting catastrophe liability calls to an "economically
collectable" level, its intention to have that level determined by an
independent expert after an event was troubling.  The club suggested
that a glance at the Lloyd's experience of trying to collect monies
owed from names would provide a "salutary lesson" to the International
Group about such a course.

Another challenge lay in the International Group's own Pooling
arrangements.  Since the individual club retention had increased
substantially in recent years from $1.2m per loss in 1989 to $5m in
1995, it was possible that the pattern of development of incurred pool
claims data will be different to that of the 1980s.  Whereas a claim
for $900,000 would have taken less time to appear in the pool, in 1995
a significant loss might take much longer to develop to the point where
it will concern the pool.  Claims information may therefore appear
unnecessarily optimistic.  The West of England concluded that "time
alone will tell", but urged club underwriters to take measures to
ensure that any negative impact may be minimalised.

COLONIA LEBEN

Colonia Lebensversicherung AG (CL), Cologne, is set to turn its
Deutsche Crzte-Versicherung (DCV) branch operation into a company in
its own right.  According to its chairman, Carl Hermann Schleifer, CL
was currently discussing the legal and fiscal aspects of the
separation.  "By carrying out the spin-off, we break new ground," Dr
Schleifer said.  DCV will receive one-third of CL's existing portfolio,
which totalled DM62.5bn (US$43bn) at the end of 1995.  Dr Schleifer was
confident that a satisfactory solution would be found by this Spring,
and that DCV will then be turned into a separate joint stock company
retroactively from 1 January.  One major problem seems to be the offer
that has to be made to independent CL shareholders.

It is expected that DCV will eventually seek close co-operation with
Deutsche Apotheker-und Crztebank, Dusseldorf, the specialised bank for
the medical professions.  The small property and casualty unit Deutsche
Crzte-Versicherung Allgemeine AG, Cologne, which is already
independent, would not be affected by the separation.

Dr Schleifer, who also heads Nordstern Lebensversicherungs-AG and
private health insurer Colonia Krankenversicherung AG, also announced
another project of holding company CKAG Colonia Konzern AG,
establishment of a specialised consultancy and sales organisation to
concentrate on investments for customers over the age of 45.  A sales
force was currently being recruited in the banking sector who would not
only sell CKAG life insurance, but also funds, investment certificates
and other products.  Dr Schleifer said that former majority owner
Bankhaus Sal Oppenheim would certainly be a co-operation partner for
the new project, but that CKAG was also negotiating with other banks.
He added that the new organisation was one step in CKAG's strategy of
aiming at a new target group, the generation of the "young elderly".

Dr Schleifer displayed optimism regarding the prospects of life
business in Germany.  In his view life insurers would again benefit
from an improved economic environment and record growth in new business
in 1996.  He expects new business for both companies to rise by about
7% in 1996.  One major factor for the upturn would be the estimated
rise in the purchasing power of German consumers, which was expected to
be up by DM11bn (US$7.65bn) on 1995.  Germans were becoming
increasingly aware of the value of life policies as a provision for
their old age, Dr Schleifer said, adding that German life insurers had
not felt any effect from foreign competitors offering life policies in
the German market hitherto.  In his view, European Monetary Union would
bring no disadvantages for German insureds.

In 1995, Colonia Lebensversicherung AG (CL) suffered an 8.7% decline in
new business to DM7.5bn in sums insured.  "The market as a whole
anticipates a 13% fall in new business, so Colonia held firm and gained
market share," Dr Schleifer said.  He expected premium income for the
year to rise by 5.2% to DM1.9bn.  The cancellation ratio deteriorated
by 0.1 points to 4.7%, "but is still markedly below the market average
of above 6%", he said.  Sales by pyramid-sales company Proventus AG,
Bremen, accounted for less than 10% of newly sold business.  The
organisation did particularly well in selling private health cover in
eastern Germany.  "Overall, we are very satisfied with this sales
channel," Dr Schleifer said.

CL's cost ratio improved from 3.8% to 3.7%, mainly as a result of the
merger of the Colonia and Nordstern back-offices.  Dr Schleifer
expected a gross profit of DM593m for Colonia Life, up 4.4%.  Sister
company Nordstern Leben (NL) will outperform the rest of the market in
1995, the ceo said.  It maintained new business at the 1994 level, with
DM4.7bn in sums insured.  Premium income was expected to rise by 14% to
DM1.4bn, compared with an average growth of 7% in the German market,
although the cancellation ratio worsened from 3.7% to 4.3%.  NL's gross
profit will rise from DM276.7m in 1994 to an expected DM315m.

ELAKE-SAMPO

The boards of Sampo Pension Insurance Co Ltd (Elake-Sampo), Helsinki,
and Pension-Varma Mutual Insurance Co (Elake-Varma), Helsinki, aborted
their planned transfer of insurance portfolios after failing to agree
on what form the reorganisation would take and methods of calculating
profits from the assets (WICR181/23).  The regulator, the ministry of
social affairs and health, had insisted on unanimity over the merger
arrangements as a precondition of its own approval.  A joint communique
stressed that auditors had found that there were no significant
differences in the financial situations of the companies, a move
designed to quash doubts over the soundness of the financial position
of Elake-Varma.

According to unofficial reports, one bone of contention was that Elake-
Varma wanted to assume a 10% future yield on shares, which others
considered unrealistic.  There were also differences over how to
estimate profits from hydro-electric power stations, which tend to be
heavily influenced by inflation expectations.  Elake-Varma owns several
such plants.  Consequently, there was some incredulity when the company
announced that the surplus of its insurance and investment activities
would increase from around FM40m (US$9.2m) for 1994 to nearly FM270m.

Elake-Varma managing director Paavo Pitkanen declined to speculate
whether another attempt to reorganise the two companies would be made,
while Elake-Sampo managing director Risto Kausto considered the matter
closed.

The other merger within the Sampo group, that of Kaleva Mutual
Insurance Co., Helsinki, and Nova Life Insurance Co Ltd, Helsinki, is
to proceed.

R+V

Germany's highest administrative court Bundesverwaltungsgericht in
Berlin, has issued an important ruling affecting demutualisation in the
country.  The court said that the German insurance supervision
Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das Versicherungswesen (BAV), Berlin, had acted
correctly when it allowed the 1989 transfer of the life portfolio from
the mutual R+V Lebensversicherungsverein aG to the joint stock company
R+V Lebensversicherung AG, Wiesbaden.

Several insureds of the old mutual had taken legal action against BAV,
complaining that the compensation paid to members was too low and did
not take the hidden reserves of the mutual adequately into account.  At
that time, a total of DM218m (US$152m) was paid to members to
compensate for their loss of that status.  The plaintiffs argued that
the hidden reserves totalled "a multiple" of that sum.

The court said that the BAV had taken sufficient care of the interests
of policyholders.  The legal and effective material situation of the
plaintiffs had not been worsened to a noteworthy degree.  As far as
they had suffered losses at all, they had been compensated.  The
transfer of the portfolio was no reason to dissolve the hidden
reserves.  The BAV's agreement to the deal did not prevent members from
suing for higher compensation.

The judgement is of considerable importance because it eases the
transformation from mutuals to joint stock companies.  Many mutuals
suffer from inadequate equity, and must increase capital through
profits.  The EU directive on the solvency of insurance groups which is
in preparation would aggravate the problem for life mutuals, as
reserves for premium repayments to policyholders would no longer count
as equity.

EURO THOUGHTS

WITH THE DEADLINE of 1 January 1999 fixed by the Cannes Summit at the
end of June 1995, European insurers have begun to consider the
consequences for them of a move to a single European currency.  All
studies have reached the same conclusion: most of the costs generated
by the move to the single currency will occur during the preparatory
phase whereas the majority of benefits will only appear after the
implementation of the single currency, the Comite Europeen des
Assurances (CEA) said in a preliminary commentary.  There is therefore
a real economic interest in limiting the transitional period for the
move from one system to the other, while allowing the necessary time
for adaptation, it said.

Recurrent monetary crises in Europe over the last three years, have
largely shown that despite the EMS, Europe regularly suffers from
unbridled speculation aimed in particular at weaker currencies.  The
creation of a single currency in Europe would in theory be one solution
to such attacks and the only one capable in limiting such destabilizing
behaviour.  That participating states should meet on a sustainable
basis the criteria of convergence born when they join and in future is
a sine qua non for the success of the process but not insufficient in
itself, the CEA concluded.

Although technical differences exist between life and non-life
insurance, globally the prospect of monetary stability in Europe is
very much in the interest of insurance, especially life insurance.  The
reinforcement of monetary stability should achieve a fall in long-term
interest rates and greater confidence by the public in the single
currency which should, eventually, gain status as a reserve currency
like the dollar.  An end to exchange rate manipulation, the
disappearance of exchange rate risks between member states and the
optimum allocation of financial resources permitted by a single
currency were particularly important for European insurers as they may
now invest assets anywhere in the European Economic Area, the CEA said.
 A more favourable business climate should result and European insurers
would also be able to propose contracts in a single currency to clients
outside the EU.

At a micro-economic level, a single currency will reduce the cost of
transactions and bank transfers to insurers and make for better price
comparability and improve the quality of service offered.
Supplementary costs would be incurred because of modification of
computer programmes and financial management systems, re-denomination
of policies and other documents and some staff reorganisation.
Although the CEA found it probable that these changes will eventually
bring about gains in productivity and competitiveness, "it is
undeniable that they will represent, in the short term, a major
outlay".  Most insurers, however, would consider these costs as
investments, if the return on costs incurred was reasonably guaranteed
by firm and irrevocable commitments by governments on the continuity of
the process, it suggested.

Among obstacles likely to cause difficulties are the absence of a
precise, detailed timetable or a firm political commitment to conform
to it, which creates uncertainty, the CEA said.  Even if commitments
are given in this respect, insurers fear that insufficient co-
ordination of monetary policies, or sudden economic and/or social
difficulties in one or more states would have disastrous effects on the
process as a whole.

The absence of harmonisation in taxation (as well as in state social
security schemes) could also cause tension and constitute a barrier to
expected developments, the CEA considered.  The problem is the absence
of harmonisation of indirect taxation on savings and co-ordination of
fiscal provisions on overall assets and benefits.  The CEA raised a
number of issues with members with regard to the Green Paper on
monetary union published at the end of May by the European Commission.
The majority of European insurers favours a big bang solution, viewing
the three-year preparation period envisaged in the Green Paper as too
long.  During the transitional period (phase B) a large critical mass
of business must be undertaken in the single currency.  Undertakings
should not have to use double accounting during phase B even if they
underwrite single currency contracts from the start of 1999, the CEA
stressed.  Only national currencies will still be legal tender during
phase B, but as they will become real substitutes for the single
currency, conversion rates into the single currency, fixed irrevocably,
must make it possible for an automatic and cost-free move from any one
national currency to the single currency and back.  A European
directive was also required to stipulate that the move to the single
currency may not in itself be used unilaterally to cancel current
contracts.

SWISS RE ON SOLVENCY

Financial security of insurers is increasingly important in the
industry, but higher security has its price because it must be
ultimately paid for by policyholders and cedants or shareholders,
Schweizerische Ruckversicherungs-Ges (Swiss Re) concludes in its latest
Sigma study*.  "Just as investors are prepared to accept a lower return
on a bond issue with a high rating, so policyholders and cedants must
be prepared to pay higher premiums to a company with high security,"
the study said.

Since 1978, 648 non-life insurers worldwide have become insolvent.  At
the end of the 1970s, the number of insolvencies annually averaged
about 10, but by the 1990s had increased to about 80.  Although in 1994
there was a decline to just above 40, it was too early to speak of a
reversal of the trend, Swiss Re considered.  Two-thirds (66%) of the
insolvencies between 1978 and 1994 involved US companies, while in
Europe, UK insurers were most bankruptcy-prone, with 7% of the world
total.  Europe excluding the UK accounted for 4% (and at the same time
for 26% of global premium income).  Elsewhere, Bermuda represented 8%
of bankruptcies.

According to Swiss Re, the causes of insurance insolvencies are
complex.  In general, bankruptcy is greater in deregulated markets, as
these are exposed to greater fluctuations in premium rates, and the
profitability of the market as a whole tends to be both lower and more
volatile.  The US and UK markets were also adversely affected by high
burdens of loss from liability claims and natural disasters.  Prolonged
periods of falling interest rates also probably favour insolvencies, it
said.  Swiss Re expects that, especially in Europe, deregulation of
insurance markets and the replacement of material control by financial
supervision will increase competition and insurance market volatility,
exacerbating the risk of insolvency.

The study also analysed various methods for assessing solvency.  "Taken
in isolation, the solvency ratio means little.  The reserves ratio at
least must also be taken into account," Swiss Re said, adding that
generally, the use of premium volumes as a measure of exposure to risks
was "problematic".  There were distortions as a result of fluctuating
premium rates and different portfolio composition, and investment risks
were ignored.  In deregulated markets, insurance supervision
essentially consists of financial supervision, based in the EU on
relatively simple solvency ratios.  In the US, new risk-based capital
approaches were already being used, under which both underwriting and
investment risks assumed are quantified and used to determine the
necessary capital.  The study discusses several alternatives, including
simulation models and Swiss Re's own method of measuring its necessary
risk-adjusted capital.

This it describes as follows.  "The capital requirement is calculated
in accordance with the business risk, that is to say on the basis of
the probability distribution of the annual operating results.  This
distribution is made up of the results distributions of the various
lines of business and of investments.  The individual distributions are
determined in two stages: firstly, from empirical data from the past, a
probability function of the results is formed which is adjusted by
disregarding exceptional major events.  Secondly, using so-called
`threat scenarios' (for the various lines of business and investments),
exceptional loss events of the kind which, on the basis of Swiss Re's
portfolio, are to be expected statistically every 10, 20, 50 and 100
years are simulated.  The adjusted distributions and the distributions
of the exceptional events are combined to form the results
distributions.  From these, the probability distribution of the
operating result is derived, taking account of the most important
correlations.  This means that the diversification effects of Swiss
Re's portfolio are included.  It is most unlikely that extremely
unfavourable events will occur in all regions and lines of business at
the same time, which means that an unfavourable result in one area can
be cushioned by a favourable result in another.

The capital required is thus determined by the extent to which the
Executive Board is prepared to take risks.  The Executive Board
stipulates the probability with which, and the period over which, the
company's financial strength is not to be adversely affected.

The risk-adjusted capital determined in this way is then allocated to
the individual lines of business and profit centres on the basis of the
volatility of the results.  This allocation enables the results of the
lines of business and profit centres to be measured adequately."

Insurers' claims-paying ability is assessed not only by regulators but
also by private rating agencies, of which the best-known are Standard &
Poor's, Moody's and AM Best.  Comparing individual agencies' ratings
was not without its problems either, Swiss Re said.  Definitions of
rating categories differed, as did rating procedures, but there was a
clearly identifiable tendency for an ever smaller proportion of
insurers to receive a top rating.  "Best's clearly rates more companies
as `excellent' than do Moody's and Standard & Poor's," Swiss Re said.
"Moody's is the most cautious in assigning the highest rating," it
added, but of the companies examined, only Standard & Poor's rated some
as `vulnerable'.

The accuracy of ratings was analysed with AM Best's data, looking at
the rating three years prior to a company's collapse.  Corresponding
data from the other rating agencies were not available.  For most of
the companies becoming insolvent, the rating had been withdrawn or none
had been assigned.  Three years before bankruptcy, 45 out of 247
insurers had an A rating, and one year before only six.

ROI IMPROVED

Although the US property/casualty insurance industry will show a rate
of return on capital for 1995 of 9.2%, more than 60% higher than the
5.6% achieved in 1994, the industry's profit rate remains below that of
most other sectors according to a report published jointly by the
Insurance Information Institute (I.I.I.) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).
The Fortune 500 is expected to show a 13% rate of return for the year.
Nevertheless, the rate of return for insurance in 1995 is slightly
above its long-term rate of 9%.

The increase was attributed to lower than expected catastrophe losses,
and higher investment income and interest rates.  Catastrophes for 1995
are expected to cost about US$8bn, down from $17bn in 1994, although
Hurricane Opal and some lesser storms made 1995 the third worst year on
record for catastrophe losses, after 1994 and the record $23bn of 1992.
 Investment income increased by 10.4% in 1995 over 1994.  In 1994, the
increase was an "anaemic" 3.4%, after declines of 1.5% and 3.2% in 1992
and 1993.  Interest rates rose in 1994 and remained relatively high in
early 1995, so insurers could invest new funds in higher-yielding
assets.  Record stockmarket highs also generated  increases in capital
gains, while the fall in interest rates in Q3-Q4 1995 added to the
realised gains of insurers which sold bonds.  Realised capital gains
increased to $5bn last year, from $1.7bn in 1994.

Overall profitability for 1996 is expected to show further significant
growth, mainly due to investment income as premium growth is slowed by
severe price competition.  Alan Levin of S&P predicted a combined ratio
of 107.9% for 1996, and a continued fall in the quality of earnings as
underwriting losses increase through 1997.  "As a result, we expect to
see even more action in controlling expenses, possibly through more
mergers as insurers attack their cost base in order to preserve profit
margins.  With underwriting expenses accounting for approximately 26%
of net premium volume, internal expense control becomes the only
alternative open to insurers as a means for maintaining adequate
profitability," Mr Levin said.

A similar conclusion was reached by a study* by the Insurance Services
Office Inc (ISO), which measured risk as the variability in return on
year-end net worth for the 20 largest insurers and the 20 largest
companies in 30 non-property/casualty insurance industry groups,
including life/health insurers.  It found that from 1979 to 1993 the
median rate of return for the 20 largest p/c insurers was 9.6%, 1.6
points below the average of the corresponding medians for the 20
largest companies in each of the non-insurance groups.  It also found
that insurance was riskier than most non-insurance industries on each
of three measures of variability used to assess risk, total variability
in rate of return, a variability adjusted for industry cycles and an
ISO composite index averaging the first two.

The number of industry groups more profitable and less risky than
insurance was about three times the number which were the reverse.
Similar results were found when ISO examined all companies in industry
groups, not just the 20 largest.  However, about a quarter of
individual insurers analysed were superior to the typical company in
the non-insurance industry groups.  The property/casualty industry's
10.1% average rate of return during the two insurance cycles for 1978
to 1994 also was lower than the corresponding rates of return for five
out of six key composite indices, including the Standard & Poor's 500
and the Standard & Poor's Financials.

The study found that stockholder-owned insurers earned higher returns,
but faced greater risk than policyholder-owned mutuals.  Commercial-
lines insurers have also been more profitable, but faced more risk than
personal-lines insurers, and agency companies have been more profitable
but also more risky than direct writers.  The major short-tail property
lines have been more profitable, but also more risky than the major
long-tail lines, catastrophes increasing the volatility in property and
year-to-year changes in reserve adequacy smoothing results for
liability.

STATE REINSURER, NEW COMPANIES

Yang Wenyou, director of the Administration Department for Foreign Fund
Financial Organs of the People's Bank of China, said on 30 December
that a State Reinsurance Company would be established to break the
monopoly of the People's Insurance Co of China (PICC), Beijing, which
he said created unfair competition between the PICC and its potential
competitors which was unfavourable for the healthy development of the
insurance market (WIR527/7).  Implementation decrees on the provisional
regulations for the operation of the Insurance Administration and the
administration of agents to supplement the new Insurance Law were
expected to be issued shortly, he added.

On 13 December, approval was announced for a joint venture life insurer
to be set up in Shanghai by Manufacturer's Life Insurance Co of Canada
(Manulife), Toronto.  Manulife has been present in China for 15 years,
and has representative offices in Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chengdu
and Guangzhou, and has demonstrated its goodwill by funding insurance
and actuarial training schemes as well as contributing to a "Help the
Poor" programme in Sichuan.

However, in an interview with China Information last month, Vice-
Premier Zhu Rongji said that although China was committed to opening
its financial and insurance markets to foreign capital and its social
insurance system was in its infancy, hurried approval of a large number
of licences for foreign insurers would not necessarily benefit the
development of China's insurance industry.  "Haste makes waste," he
remarked, and therefore "we have to be cautious and open the market
gradually."

NEW LIFE INSURER FOR THOSE RESETTLED BY DAM PROJECT

A new life insurer is to be set up to provide pension, health and
accident insurance for those resettled as a result of the Three Gorges
Dam project, an official of the China Three Gorges Economic Development
Corp (CTGEDC) said last month.  The dam will flood 19 counties and
cities in Sichuan and Hubei and displace about one million people.
Sanxia Life Insurance Co is expected to have initial capital of
Yuan500m (US$60m), with shareholders including Hua'neng Electric Group,
Shenzhen Dapeng Securities Co, Wuhan Iron & Steel Co, Taishan Group,
China Petrochemical Corp and Houwang Group.  It will operate throughout
the country, investing a proportion of the premiums received in the
Three Gorges Project itself, the official said, adding that "five or
six insurance companies from the US, Japan, Canada and other countries
have expressed an intention to be its partners."

NINE FOREIGN APPLICANTS

The Taiwanese Finance Ministry accepted nine applications from foreign
insurers to establish branches in the 1995 applications round.  Four
were from non-life companies (Asia Insurance Co Ltd, Hong Kong, Royal
Insurance plc, London, CIGNA Insurance Asia Pacific Ltd, Sydney and AXA
Assurances IARD, Paris) and five life and health insurers (National
Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd, Melbourne, CUNA Mutual
Insurance Soc, Madison WI, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Delaware Inc,
Chubb Life Insurance Co of America, Warren NJ, and Aegon
Levensverzekering NV, The Hague).  Last year's was the first round in
which non-US insurers were permitted to make applications.  Nine US non-
life insurers and 14 life have been licensed since the market was
opened to them in 1986.  The government plans to reduce its 45% stake
in Taiwan Fire & Marine Insurance Co and Taiwan Life Insurance Co, both

CCI ON MARKET REFORM

The PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry New Delhi has recommended to
the government that it create a strong, independent regulatory body
with the power to finalise regulations and prudential norms for the
insurance sector as it is opened to the private sector (WIR522/8).  It
also recommended that the government should divest its own holdings in
the industry before allowing new entrants, regarding it as essential
that the state-owned companies operate in a commercial framework
governed by the operation of the market, as only then would they assume
a customer-oriented focus and be prompted to improve operations and
quality of service, the Chamber said.  It favours the opening of the
market to foreign investors, but only through a locally-incorporated
subsidiary, and preferably in a joint venture with Indian partners.
The Malhotra Commission recommendation to restrict the maximum
shareholding of the promoter of a new insurance company to 40% may not
be sufficiently attractive to attract investment, the Chamber
considered, and suggested a higher limit of 75%.  Capital criteria also
needed review, it considered, recommending minimum capital of Rs1bn
(US$28m) be brought in stages.

Privatization of pension funds, with a strong regulatory body, was also
recommended.  In order to popularise individual pension plans,
contributions to prescribed limit should be fully exempted from tax,
the Chamber proposed.  For rural business, clear guidelines were
required given the high acquisition cost, and cross-subsidization was
necessary, the Chamber said.  Rural covers also needed to be
imaginatively designed.

MINIMUM CAPITAL INCREASED

The Ministry of Economy & Commerce believes that most local insurers
currently have less than minimum Dh50m (US$13.6m) paid up capital
eventually required under the recent Federal Law No13 which amended the
1984 Federal Law No9 on insurance companies and agents, but believes
that the new minimum will easily be met within the next six years
(WIR525/5).  Most foreign insurers in the UAE should have no difficulty
in meeting the requirement, it added.  According to the Emirates
Insurance Association, 27 of the 46 insurers operating in the
Federation are foreign.

Under the new legislation, insurers are required to increase their
minimum paid-up capital to Dh25m immediately, and Dh50m by the end of
the sixth year.  Those unable to do so have the option of merger or
closure.  Some insurers consider that of the 46 currently operating,
only about 30 can easily manage the latest increase.  Minimum capital
requirements have already increased  from Dh7.5m in 1993 to Dh10m in
1994.

MOTOR POOL PROPOSED

- High premium motor insurance has prompted the UAE Ministry of Economy
to ask insurers to form a pool for high-risk motor.  A spokesman said
the proposal was in response to a spate of complaints that some
insurers were demanding premiums of up to 25% of the value of the
vehicle.  The Ministry approached the Emirates Insurance Association to
study the idea in consultation with its members.  "We think this could
be a reasonable alternative to tackle the problem," the spokesman said.

Pool members would provide loss, damage, TPL and passenger liability
cover for hire cars, the vehicle renter, publicly-operated buses and
trucks of all types - all known high risk category vehicles - and any
other vehicle the pool decided to include.  The spokesman said the pool
would be able to draw on the collective experience of member insurers
to fix fair rates meeting the needs of both insurer and insured, as
well as saving legal expenses by pooling costs.  The pool would also be
able to arrange excess of loss treaty protection, he added.

MOTOR THEFT ESCALATING

Faced with mounting theft losses, Israeli insurers said in November
that motor premiums would have to increase by 7% unless the police took
measures to reverse the trend.  One third of total premium volume is
consumed by the costs of large scale organised theft of cars by Israeli
gangs for resale or cannibalisation in Palestinian autonomous areas.
In October, 3,000 cars were stolen according to police figures, the
highest monthly total ever.  The conclusion of the Oslo agreements on
Palestinian autonomy resulted in a 44% increase in vehicle thefts in
the first quarter of 1995 compared to the same period in 1994,
according to Israel Insurance Companies Association data.  Chairman
Rimon Ben-Shaul, in a letter to Premier Shimon Peres, claimed that if
nothing is done, insurers may stop providing cover for theft.

Once vehicles disappear into Gaza and other autonomous towns, little is
done to recover them.  Joint Israeli/Palestinian patrols instituted in
December have reportedly reduced the incidence of thefts of Israeli
cars destined for resale whole, but theft of vehicles to be broken down
and sold as parts has increased.  Palestinian sources suggest that a
frequently-practised form of insurance fraud is for Israeli citizens to
sell their vehicles to a Palestinian and then report it stolen to the
police and insurers.

EARTHQUAKE LIMIT RAISED

Since 1 January, Israelis have been able to buy earthquake insurance
for 100% of the value of their property rather than the former 75%.
Awareness of earthquake risk, which has been steadily increasing, was
highlighted by the Gulf of Aqaba event in late November (WIR526/13),
after which the Knesset Finance Committee sub-committee for insurance
held a special session to try to formulate new measures.  Premium for
earthquake cover has been raised since 1985 from 0.2% to 1.5%, with a
deductible of 10%.  A proposal is also under consideration by the sub-
committee for establishment of a fund into which all earthquake
premiums would be paid, partly with the intention of saving the cost of
reinsurance abroad, since earthquakes are rare.

Meanwhile, following a report that over 60% of Israel's 1.3m households
carry no home insurance, Isracard, one of Israel's two credit card
companies, has decided to offer contents cover to people travelling
abroad.  Policies will cover 30 days, the average length of holiday by
Israelis, extendable to two months.

GLASS-STEAGALL AMENDMENTS CLOSE TO VOTE

In a letter to Thomas Lebreque, president of The Bankers Roundtable, on
28 December, US House Banking Committee chairman James Leach said that
after resolution of the current budget dispute between Congress and the
Clinton administration, he will recommend that the House of
Representatives bill to reform the Glass-Steagall Act be brought to the
floor of the House for a vote.  The proposals would permit banks to
affiliate with firms involved in securities operations, and become more
involved in insurance activities.  Disputes between representatives of
insurers and banks have bedevilled the bill, the American Council of
Life Insurance (ACLI) accusing the banks of deliberately preventing a
compromise settlement.  At issue are state regulation of bancassurance
activity and proposed powers for the Comptroller of the Currency to
impose a five-year moratorium on banks' entry into insurance.  The
Roundtable is particularly concerned that state regulation of
bancassurance should not be more onerous than that of insurance
companies.  Mr Leach said that there was "massive agreement" on 98% of
the bill, and a vote should not be delayed by the other 2%, on which
agreement was perhaps impossible.

PEOPLE'S BANKCORP GRANTED INSURANCE LICENCE

People's Bankcorp Inc of Marietta OH has been granted a licence by the
Ohio insurance department to distribute life, motor and property
insurance through a wholly-owned insurance agency, provided that
insurance activity is physically separated from banking activity in its
branches, the majority of policies are sold to non-customers of the
bank, and customers are not required to buy insurance from the bank for
any reason.  The licence is opposed by the Independent Insurance Agents
of  Ohio, which will challenge its validity in court.

NEW LAW IMMINENT

Life, joint life, accident, pension, student endowment and homeowners'
insurance policies are to be introduced in Cuba during the first
quarter of this year, according to a local TV broadcast monitored by
the BBC, implying that the long-awaited new insurance law (WIR522/1) is
close to being approved.

AMENDED LAW IN FORCE

The Insurance Amendment Act came into effect on 31 December.  As well
as increased minimum capital requirements, and more stringent licensing
requirements, the amendments increase the freedom of insurers to invest
in reserves.  Compulsory reinsurance cessions to Kenya Reinsurance
Corp, Nairobi, are to be phased out between this year and 1999.
Speaking at a reception last month, deputy insurance commissioner Sammy
Makove said that in future, the commission would publish annual lists
of insurance industry participants with valid licences, East Africa
Standard reported.  The publication of such a list in September
appeared to de-register hundreds of insurers, brokers, assessors and
surveyors (WIR523/7).  Some brokers and assessors de-registered at that
time continued to operate with some insurers, Mr Makove said, adding
that the Insurance Commission would continue to enforce licence
requirements.  Insurers should refuse business from unlicensed agents,
he added.

Of the two insurers "de-listed" in September, Mr Makove said that Co-
operative Insurance Service Ltd (CIS), Nairobi, had now met all
necessary requirements.  An auditor's report on state-owned Kenya
National Assurance Co, Nairobi (WICR181/20), was expected to be
completed by mid-December.

Meanwhile, insurers and brokers are in conflict over payment of the
compulsory 0.35% levy on gross direct premiums introduced by the
government in 1994 to fund the College of Insurance.  Attempts by
insurers to pass the costs on to policyholders are being resisted by
brokers, who allege such a step is illegal and are threatening court
action.  Cynical insurers suggest the complaining brokers merely wish
to be paid for collecting the tax.

NEW SUPERVISION COMMISSION

In December the Ugandan parliament passed legislation to establish an
independent Uganda Insurance Commission to oversee the industry,
responsible to the Finance Ministry.  Insurance was formerly supervised
by the Central Bank along with all other financial institutions.  The
Commission will issue regulations on the conduct of insurance and
reinsurance and intermediary activity, licence individuals involved in
insurance, and deal with complaints by policyholders.

Minister of State for Finance Matthew Rukikaire told parliament that
existing insurance legislation was "grossly inadequate".  Minimum
capital for a locally-owned insurer will increase to USh200m
(US$198,400), an increase which it is hoped will be sufficient to
remove from the market so-called "briefcase" companies (also known
locally as "quark insurers", presumably because they vanish with the
speed of light).  Sebaana Kizito MP, head of Statewide Insurance Co
Ltd, Kampala, argued for an increase to USh500m, a measure he said was
supported by the Uganda Insurance Association and the Uganda Insurance
Institute.  Foreign-owned insurers will be required to have minimum
capital of USh1bn for life or non-life, USh2bn for composite companies
and USh2.5bn for reinsurance activity.

MORE CATS, LOSSES LOWER

While indications have become stronger during 1995 that the gradually
changing world climate is having an effect on the occurrence of natural
catastrophes, especially floods and windstorms, insurers suffered fewer
losses from such events last year, Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Ges AG,
Munich, said in its annual report on catastrophes.  The year 1995 had
provided a "breathing space for the insurance industry, which has been
having to cope with particularly heavy claims burdens from natural
catastrophes for nearly ten years," it added.

The company also drew attention to an important and mainly positive,
factor: the long-lasting El Niuo effect, a natural cyclical warming of
the tropical Pacific, came to an end in 1995.  El Niuo had resulted in
extreme drought in Australia and heavy rainfall on the US Pacific
coast, but had also contributed to a reduction of hurricane activity in
the Caribbean.

According to Munich Re, the number of events it categorises as natural
catastrophes rose from 580 in 1994 to about 600 in 1995 which claimed a
total of 18,000 lives, up from 10,150.  In terms of economic losses,
1995 was a record year, the total of US$180bn dwarfing the $65bn of
1994, the previous worst year.  In 1995, however, insured losses
reached only $14bn, compared to $28bn in 1992 and $17bn in 1994.  This
resulted from the fact that insurance density in the regions most badly
affected in 1995 was comparatively low.

This applied in particular to what was, in economic terms, the most
expensive natural catastrophe to date, the Great Hanshin Earthquake
which struck Kobe on 17 January and caused overall losses of about
$100bn.  Although of only medium intensity, it reduced parts of the
industrial and port city to rubble and ashes.  More than 6,000 people
were killed and 300,000 left homeless.  Other notable events during
1995 were the January floodings of the rivers Rhine, Moselle and Maas,
only 13 months after similar occurrences, and tropical windstorms in
the Caribbean, the US and East Asia.

DISASTERS BILL UNDER FIRE

At hearings before the US House Transportation & Infrastructure
Committee's Water Resources & Environment subcommittee at the beginning
of December, the proposed Natural Disaster Protection Partnership Act
came under severe criticism by Rep Mike Parker (R-MS) as "a public-
sector solution to a private-sector problem".

The legislation proposes the establishment of a private sector insurer
to provide homeowners' cover and reinsurance in areas at high risk from
natural disasters.  Mr Parker said that a clause which would permit the
entity to borrow from federal government should its reserves be
depleted by a major catastrophe would make the government liable for
the insurance industry's risks.

In his testimony to the Committee, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury Mozelle Thompson recommended an approach combining state-
regulated mandatory disaster insurance with a federal reinsurance
programme rather than the federal corporation proposed in the Act.  Mr
Thompson feared that the proposed National Disaster Insurance Corp
could develop into a monopoly, placing policyholders at a disadvantage.
 He said the Clinton administration feared that the Act could expose
the government to unlimited liabilities, and had reservations about the
financial viability of the scheme.

He proposed instead development of "a required phased-in policy" for
dwellings for up to four families mortgaged with federally-related
lenders or secondary issuers, administered by states, together with a
federal excess of loss programme through the mechanism of an annual
auction of contracts covering a proportion of the loss from a single
natural disaster, triggered by industry-wide insured losses and with a
base price set in line with risk plus a cost of capital adjustment.
The programme would be designed to phase itself out between years 15
and 20 of operation.

WINDSTORM MARKET ASSISTANCE PROPOSAL

Acting New Jersey insurance commissioner Elizabeth Randall said she
intended to create a windstorm market assistance programme to improve
the availability of insurance for homeowners on the NJ coast, she told
the New Jersey Senate judiciary committee.  "If a co-operative,
voluntary effort by the industry fails to achieve the desired result, I
am prepared to consider moving forward with a regulatory approach on
behalf of our citizens," she said.  Her proposal would involve insurers
assuming liability in rotation for underwriting cover for homeowners
unable to obtain it.

STORM INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO RISE

In mid-November, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association filed a
request to the Insurance Department for an average rate increase of
67%, the first since 1981.  The annual premium for a house in Miami
Beach valued at US$113,000 and insured by the Association would rise
from $185 to $461, and in St. Petersburg Beach from $222 to $407, but
in St. Augustine Beach, the premium would fall from $222 to $205.  The
Association said that an independent actuarial assessment had
recommended an average increase of 124%, and that it had incurred a
loss in excess of $192m for claims in 1995.  Its rates are currently
significantly below those for other residual markets for homeowners in
Florida and in other states, as well as some rates in the private
sector, it said.  The Association insures 223,000 policyholders and has
total exposure of $35bn.

TAX BREAK "CRITICAL" FOR EQ PLAN

A proposed new earthquake insurance programme in California, given
preliminary approval by the state legislature on the last day of its
session in October, will require confirmation of tax-exempt status from
the Internal Revenue Service to be viable, deputy insurance
commissioner Richard Wiebe said.  This would force the state to
consider other alternatives, such as an involuntary insurance pool, he
added.

The proposed California Earthquake Authority will have access to funds
of up to US$10.5bn.  The California Insurance Department proposes a
premium rate of $3.10 per $1,000 of insured house value.  An initial
$1bn in funding for the Authority would be provided by insurers,
together with a guarantee of $3bn in the event of claims.  $2bn in
reinsurance would be bought in excess of this figure.  Last month
Insurance Commissioner Charles Quackenbush toured Bermuda, London, New
York and Zurich in search of potential capacity, where reaction was
favourable, Mr Wiebe said.  Brokers for the reinsurance element will be
EW Blanch Holdings Inc.  Losses above $6bn will be covered by an issue
of state bonds for $1bn, and a further $1.5bn in bonds placed on the
New York stock market by Morgan Stanley as lead manager, co-managed by
Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs.  A further $2bn would be paid by the
insurance industry on a contingency basis, bringing the Authority's
total capital to $10.5bn.

The Insurance Department hopes to deliver an interim report on progress
of the plan in the near future, and secure final approval by the end of
March.

"FAIR TORRENT" OF SNOW CLAIMS

While blizzard conditions brought a white Christmas to Scotland,
Northern Ireland, Wales and northern parts of England, the subsequent
New Year thaw has caused estimated damage of #350m (US$545m) according
to loss adjusters, The Balcome Group, London.  The group's initial
estimate of #500m in insured damage was refuted last week by the
Association of British Insurers (ABI), London.  Share analysts
variously predict the likely eventual cost to UK insurers at about
#400m, or #20m to #30m off the net profit of each of the UK composites.

UK insurers are receiving a "fair torrent" of claims after this "major
incident", an ABI spokesman told WIR, but insured damage was more
likely to total #100m to #200m rather than #300m to #500m.  It will be
several weeks before the official ABI estimate is known.  The majority
of claims are expected in Scotland, Northern Ireland and north east
England, primarily for household damage following burst pipes,
commercial water damage and business interruption.

Significant claims are also expected to arise from commercial users of
water following the failure of water supplies, he added, although some
businesses would be self-insured or lack appropriate cover and there
would be significant uninsured damage for householders in Scotland.

Increased weather damage claims recorded over the past week are still
within normal expectations and unlikely to lead to higher premiums,
according to UK insurers.  A spokesman for Royal Insurance plc, London,
told WIR that an increased number of claims were coming in, but it was
too early to estimate the total number.  Claims would be concentrated
in Scotland and north east of England, unlike in 1991 and the 1980s
when cold weather affected the whole country, he added.  Royal expects
the greatest number of claims from household damage, but commercial
claims to cost more.  Commercial Union plc, London, said it was too
early for definite numbers, but claims were likely to be "more than
usual".  As of 3 January, the company had received 1,500 claims.  Sun
Alliance Group plc, London, said the number of claims would be
significantly "up, not under".

BUILDING CODE PROPOSED

Insurers in the Caribbean region have been reminded by the Council of
Caribbean Engineering Organisations (CCEO) of the need to improve risk
management methods if they wish to achieve better rates from
international reinsurers.  One way, it suggested, is for insurers to
throw their weight behind the introduction of mandatory building codes
as a means of minimising damage from natural hazards.  Only three
Caribbean countries, two of them British colonies (the Bahamas,
Anguilla and Monserrat) have such codes.

The Barbados-based CCEO is in the final phase of drawing up a
comprehensive Caribbean Uniform Building Code (CUBIC), which it would
like adopted by all the other 12 members of CARICOM, the Caribbean free
trade area.  The code will outline the design and construction
parameters for all new buildings.  The organisation would like the
insurance industry to be more active in pressing governments to enforce
the Code, a spokesman said, and with the Caribbean just having
experienced its worst hurricane season for 62 years and insurers still
counting the costs, it feels the industry, with the prodding of
reinsurers, may now be ready to take notice.

Tony Gibbs, a senior Caribbean engineer who has been one of the most
active in promoting CUBIC, said Caribbean insurers would be doing
themselves a favour by supporting mandatory building standards, if only
because "it will remove an easy excuse for the high catastrophe
insurance premiums the region must bear at the present time".

One reason why most Caribbean governments have not moved to enforce the
Code is a desire to avoid raising building costs.  Mr Gibbs said that a
recent study showed that were CUBIC adopted, only between 0.24% and
2.2% would be added to total costs.

IN THE COURTS

On 21 December, Mr Justice Gatehouse found "with considerable
hesitation" that no competent members' agent could have placed names on
Feltrim syndicate 540/2 in 1990 (although some categories of names
failed to demonstrate their case), and "with more confidence" that the
names case failed with regard to syndicate 847.

On the same day, the Court of Appeal upheld the "pay now, sue later"
ruling by Mr Justice Rix in Marchant & Eliot Ltd v Higgins (WIR524/9).
Lloyd's served approximately 300 writs on recalcitrant names the same
day.

On 6 December, Lloyd's was also successful in a High Court action, also
heard by Mr Justice Gatehouse, in which Diana Aldrich sought to prevent
drawdown on her Lloyd's deposit because she claimed to have been
fundamentally mistaken about the nature of Lloyd's when she became a
name.  The case was summarily dismissed.

On 3 January, the Colorado Court of Appeal partially reversed a Denver
District Court preventing drawdown on Colorado names' deposits in an
action initiated by the state securities commissioner.  Meanwhile, an
outline settlement with the 700-odd members of the American Names
Association has been agreed in principle by Lloyd's.

As a result of the decision of Mr Justice Cresswell in Henderson et al
v Merrett Syndicates Ltd et al (WIR524/1), E&O insurers served the
victorious Pulbrook 334 (1985) names with a notice of intention to
avoid payment (WIR506/1).  The names have begun liquidation proceedings
against Pulbrook U/W management Ltd, London.

The appeal by the Gooda Walker Action Group on the issue of the
taxation of awards will be heard by the House of Lords on 16 January.

VETO TO BE OVERTURNED?

President Bill Clinton decided in December to veto congressional
proposals to limit court awards for liability damages (WIR525/11).  The
House of Representatives voted to override the veto on its bill, which
as part of the so-called Contract with America would limit damages in
all cases, including medical malpractice.  The Senate appeared likely
to try to take similar action, a two-thirds majority being required to
overturn the veto.  The bill would be the first to be enacted after a
Clinton presidential veto.

A joint congressional committee had met briefly on 15 December to try
to reconcile the differences between the House bill and that in the
Senate, which is restricted to product liability.  No date was set for
a further meeting, the staff of committee members being requested to
reach agreement on as many issues as possible beforehand.

CALIFORNIA PROPOSES NO-FAULT

Three initiatives to be put before the California electorate in March
could have important implications for insurers.  Propositions 200 to
202, which are being presented as a package by proponents, would
introduce no fault motor insurance in the state (200), require in most
cases that the losing party in class and shareholder actions alleging
breach of securities legislation to pay the costs of the victor (201),
and limit contingency fees to 15% if defendants in tort cases offer
early settlement in response to a mandatory demand letter (202).

Meanwhile, California motor insurers are lobbying against new anti-
redlining measures announced by Insurance Commissioner Charles
Quackenbush, which will force insurers to apply greater weight to
driving records and less to where the vehicle is garaged.  Insurers
suggest that the cost of reconfiguring databases will be huge and
passed on to policyholders, and that premium increases of up to 175%
may result.

NEW WORKERS' COMP SCHEME

A new Workers' Compensation Act was passed by the Argentine Congress on
3 October, and will come into effect in early April.  While previous
legislation referred only to injuries at work and employer's liability,
the new law also covers loss prevention.  The main features of the new
legislation are

- insurance is made compulsory, but employers may also choose to self-
insure if they can demonstrate sufficient financial strength to pay
monetary benefits and the ability to deliver required medical and other
services (medical care and medication; prostheses and orthopaedics;
rehabilitation; occupational retraining and funeral services).  The
ability of employers to provide benefits in kind if uninsured is
currently unsupervised

- employers are relieved of civil liability unless there is proof of a
wrongful, intentional act.  Under existing legislation, workers can
choose between accepting the scheduled compensation or going to court,
leading over the years to tens of thousands of cases with enormous
losses for insurers and reinsurers

- a new type of specialised workers' compensation insurer, known as
ARTs, is to be created.  These must have a minimum paid-in capital of
Pesos3m.  General insurers who write workers' comp may continue doing
so if they provide the new services provided by the act.  ARTs and
insurers will choose which industrial sectors they will cover, but
cannot turn down any request for cover from employers in those sectors

- disability income to be based on a monthly income instead of lump sum
payments, expected current value of the periodic benefit being limited
to Pesos55,000 (US$55,000) during the first three years of the new
system and Pesos110,000 thereafter

- only enumerated occupational diseases and disabilities will be
covered and the list of diseases regulated

- loss prevention and worker rehabilitation and retraining, and
collective labour negotiations to improve prevention and benefits, are
all encouraged

- benefits will be financed with monthly contributions paid by
employers.  Guarantee and reserve funds will be created and
administered by a new Workers' Compensation Superintendency and the
Insurance Superintendency, respectively.

LANDMARK MEDMAL RULING

The Supreme Court of India has held that patients who receive
incompetent service either from doctors or hospitals can claim damages
under the Consumer Protection Act 1986 (CPA), leading doctors to seek
cover against potential liabilities.  The National Consumer Commission
(NCC), constituted under the CPA, ruled in April 1992 that the
provision of paid medical assistance by hospitals and medical
professionals fell within the scope of the term "service" as defined in
section 2(1)(0) of the CPA.  In the event of any deficiency in the
performance of such services, the aggrieved party may file a complaint
to the Consumer Forum under the CPA.  The NCC decision was challenged
by the Medical Council of India.

The Supreme Court (Justices Kuldip Singh, SC Agarwal and BL Hansaria)
upheld the NCC ruling, excepting only services rendered by a doctor
practising free of charge to every patient under a contract of personal
service, by way of consultation, diagnosis or treatment.

The judges commented that a contract of personal service must be
distinguished from a contract of professional service.  They also
observed that they were unable to support the view that merely because
medical practitioners belong to the medical profession, they are
outside the purview of the provisions of the Act and the services
rendered by them are not covered by it.  The normal tests of negligence
should apply.  The court further observed that while immunity from
damages could be granted on grounds of public interest, the trend was
for restricting of such immunity.

The verdict brings to an end years of controversy generated by
differing decisions by various High Courts.  Among the possible reliefs
which could be granted plaintiffs are return of charges paid,
compensation for loss or injury suffered due to negligence and
remedying of the defective or deficient service.  The Supreme Court
decision evoked a mixed reaction.  The Honorary General Secretary of
the India Medical Association, Dr JC Sobti, pointed out that henceforth
private doctors would increasingly seek insurance cover on the lines of
the US system.

A random survey of private nursing homes in Delhi revealed that the
majority of doctors had already bought a professional indemnity policy
or planned to do so, and many of those already covered planned to
increase the sum insured.  At one home, all 35 medical consultants had
been instructed by the hospital director to take out cover for Rs1m
(US$28,230) each, while the director had already sought cover for
himself and paramedical staff at a cost of about Rs40,000 in annual
premium.

Liberia 
[DOCUMENT] Harassment of Journalists Intensifies 

Africa News Service 
January 15, 1996 (19960115)
 
   New York - Text of several recent news alerts by the New York-based 
Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). 
   On 12 January 1996, Stanton Peabody, acting managing director of the 
"Daily Observer", was released after Press Union of Liberia attorneys, 
through the Justice & Peace Commission, filed a bill of habeus corpus on 
his behalf. Peabody was released on bail of $20,000 Liberian (US$ 400). 
   Peabody will return to court on 16 January, as will editor-in- chief 
of the "Daily Observer" James Seitua. However, the two journalists will 
be tried separately on charges of "criminal malevolence." 
   Immediately after the court ordered Peabody's release, Director of 
National Police Joseph Tate ordered seven police officers to re-arrest 
him in the courthouse. However, the presiding judge announced that any 
re-arrest would place Tate in contempt of court. Peabody plans to remain 
at home until the upcoming court date.
   On 11 January 1996, representatives of the Press Union of Liberia and 
the management of the "Daily Observer" obtained a bill of release for 
James Seitua, editor-in-chief of the "Daily Observer". Bail in the 
amount of $25,000 Liberian dollars ($350 US) was paid. Under the 
conditions of his release, Seitua cannot travel outside of Monrovia, and 
must report daily to the police until the matter is resolved.
   The charge against Seitua, as stated in his bill of release, is 
"criminal malevolence." No charges have been filed against him in a 
court of law. On 29 December 1995, the "Daily Observer" published an 
article that disputed the claim made by United Revolutionary Front of 
Sierra Leone spokesperson Eddie Hebron that he was interviewed in the 
Ivory Coast by the British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of 
America. The article claimed that Hebron was in Monrovia, the Liberian 
capital, during the interviews. James Seitua was subsequently arrested 
on 9 January and detained; he has since been released on bail. Stanton 
Peabody, in an attempt to intervene on Seitua's behalf, was also 
arrested on 10 January. He remains in detention.
   On 8 January 1996, D. Sompon Weah II, reporter for "The News", and 
"The News" photographer Pewee S. Flomoku were attacked in Po River 
(northwestern Liberia), where they were covering skirmishes between West 
Africa peacekeeping forces (ECOMOG) and warring factions of the United 
Liberation Movement (ULIMO-J).
   The attack occurred shortly after their arrival, as they were 
recording the state of security in the region. At the directive of the 
executive director of the Liberia Refugees Repatriation & Resettlement 
Commission, Mrs. Weade Kobbah Wreh, they were beaten by her personal 
bodyguards and some ECOMOG soldiers. Flomoku's camera was destroyed.

Nigeria
[DOCUMENT] Press Group Condemns Attacks on Press 

Africa News Service
January 16, 1996 (19960116)

   New York - Statement by the New York-based Committee to Protect 
Journalists.
  The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonpartisan advocate of 
press freedom, condemns the December 23 arrest of Nosa Igiebor, editor 
in chief of best-selling Lagos-based "Tell" magazine, and the recent 
escalation of attacks against Nigeria's independent press. 
   Igiebor, the recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in 
1993, was arrested by six members of the State Security Service (SSS) at 
his home in Lagos. SSS agents also confiscated 20,000 copies of "Tell" 
magazine's Christmas Day edition with the cover story "Abacha is 
Adamant: Terrorizes the Opposition." On December 27, SSS agents made a 
failed attempt to search his office for the company's tax records and 
staff pay records.
   Authorities continue to hold Igiebor in solitary confinement without 
charge, and are demanding that he reveal his sources for articles 
published in Tell criticizing the military government. During 
interrogations at Lagos State Command of the SSS facility in Shangisha, 
Igiebor repeatedly stated that he receives financial support from 
neither outsiders nor Nigerian citizens, and that any information he 
receives arrives by mail. 
   CPJ also denounces the following attacks against the independent 
press during the last two weeks of 1995:
   * On December 31, the office of the magazine division of the 
Independent Communications Network Limited, publishers of "The News," 
"Tempo," and "Tempofootball," was torched by arsonists using a petrol 
bomb. According to Dapo Olorunyomi, editor -in-chief of "The News," the 
fire destroyed property (including a new line of Gateway 2000 Pentium 
computers) worth millions of naira. The arsonists managed to escape.
   The office, located on the first floor of Tejumola House in Ikeja, 
Lagos, houses the newsroom and production center of the three magazines. 
It was the only floor of the four-story building that was torched. 
Management expects publication of The News and Tempo to be suspended for 
approximately two weeks.
    On December 19, photojournalists Peter Obe, Bayo Ewuoso, Abiodun 
Ajala and Segun Olakitan were assaulted and detained by police during 
the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) rally in Lagos. Their offense 
was photographing the confrontation between NADECO supporters and the 
over five hundred policemen who shot tear gas into the crowd to disperse 
the protesters. 
   Ewuoso, a senior photojournalist with "AM News" was severely beaten 
by over ten policemen who later transported him to the Surulere Police 
Station for interrogation. Ajala of "This Day" newspaper, Olakitan of 
"Tell" magazine, and veteran photojournalist Obe were also beaten and 
seriously injured by police. Ajala and Olakitan were rushed to a nearby 
hospital for treatment.
   On December 16, ten security operatives lay siege to the "AM News" 
office, demanding to know the whereabouts of editor-in-chief Bayo 
Onanuga. They were seeking Onanuga to place him under arrest. Onanuga 
remains in hiding. The security operatives reportedly did the same at 
the offices of "Tell" magazine. 
   On December 16, all 55,000 copies of "Tell" were seized at the 
printing house. The seizure followed the magazine's publication of an 
article titled "The Release of [Chief Moshood] Abiola: The World Waits 
On [General Sani] Abacha." 
   On December 15, arsonists torched the circulation department of "The 
Guardian" newspaper. Damage was minimal because the fire was quickly 
brought under control.
   On December 15, Adedisi Dejo, Emmanuel Piper, Yeni Oldwolabi and Iyi 
Isaac, reporters and contributors to the paper, were held for 
questioning by Lagos police.
   Finally, CPJ intensified its call for the release of the four 
journalists (Christine Anyanwu, George Mbah, Ben Charles Obi and Kunle 
Ajibade) who were convicted to fifteen years in jail for their alleged 
participation in an alleged coup plot against the military regime.

Uganda
UK Report Predicts Museveni Win In '96 Polls

The Monitor (Kampala)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Gerald Owachi

   Kampala - A report issued by the authoritative London-based Economist 
Intelligence Unit (EIU) has predicted a Museveni victory in the forthcoming 
presidential elections.
   "It will be very surprising if President Yoweri Museveni, is not returned 
to office next April as the elected president,: the just released 1995 4th 
quarter country report, says.
   The report, however, doubts whether all sections of society will accept the 
legitimacy of his election.
   At the same time it casts a shadow over the loyalty of the army towards any 
other person other than Museveni. "The army remains Mr. Museveni's trump 
card," it states, therefore disqualifying the possibilities of the army 
supporting any other democratically elected government.
   It also suggests that the legislative elections in May 1996 will produce a 
better political balance in parliament, and thereby defuse some political 
tension.
   According to the report, NRM is already confident of victories in Karamoja 
-- because NRM has allowed the K'jongs to keep their guns. Busoga--VP 
Kazibwe's home area, Bugisu, Kapchorwa and his traditional base the South-
west.
   The report further states that, "Mr Museveni is even trying to tempt former 
president, Idi Amin, back to Uganda in order to capitalise on his support in 
the North West.
   The EIU report which briefly portrays the current political and economic 
state of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, cites the new constitution and the 
escalating military expenditure of the Uganda government as a possible source 
of disagreement between the donor community and the Government.
   According to the report, "the USA clearly believes that a five-year wait 
before the issue of multi-partyism can again be tested is too long. It adds 
that European countries previously reluctant to show their resentment on the 
matter, have now formally joined the US in pressing for an early 
constitutional amendment.
   "The government reduced the defence share of budget expenditure from 36% in 
1990/91 to 13% in 1991/92, but then raised it again during the following two 
years and brought it up to 30% this year [1995}," the reports notes. The donor 
community is not at all happy with this trend regardless of the insecurity in 
the north and along the Sudan border.
   The report says that the rift between president Moi of Kenya and Museveni 
which used to be portrayed as a largely personal matter, has developed into "a 
more substantial rift based on the different approaches to systems of 
government." It blames the failure to achieve regional cooperation on this cat 
and mouse relationship between these two leaders.
   The strike by medical workers last September is cited in the report as a 
possible beginning of demands to be floated by the public sector workers. 
This, the report goes on, would result into an inflationary wage spiral that 
would threaten the climate of economic stability which has been achieved in 
recent years.
   It is expected to be compounded by unfavourable economic prospects 
especially following the recent decline in coffee prices. The end of this 
coffee boom was marked by the October fall in the value of the shilling, after 
a two year spell of stability, the EIU report notes.

South Africa
Foreign Trip Could Clear Constitutional Logjam 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Marion Edmunds

   Johannesburg - Over drinks in hotel bars in Germany last week, new 
friendships were formed that bode well for the writing of the final 
constitution.
   During a week-long, fact-finding tour to Germany, Inkatha Freedom 
Party (IFP), African National Congress (ANC) and National Party (NP) 
politicians were able, for the first time since the IFP walked out of 
the Constitutional Assembly last year, to talk to each other -- 
sometimes late into the night -- about South Africa's constitutional 
future.
   Back home this week, the delegates were cautiously optimistic about 
the effect the mission would have on the constitution-writing process 
and, in particular, on the stand-off between the IFP and the ANC over 
international mediation.
   At this stage -- and it is early days yet -- the signs of a new 
interparty rapport are good, with even the IFP delegates taking a more 
amiable line than usual.
   IFP negotiator, Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela, said 
this week he had already briefed party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi about 
the trip and Buthelezi had been "positively surprised" at what he had to 
say.
   Mzimela said of the trip: "I think we got the chance to interact 
across party lines ... if the group had had the power to make decisions, 
certainly there would have been movement on issues because we were able 
to understand a lot of things collectively."
   Mzimela believed there would be follow-up talks between parties on 
what had been learnt, but would not commit himself on whether the IFP 
would return to the Constitutional Assembly to participate fully in the 
final, and most important, phases of the constitutional negotiations.
   He said international mediation had not been mentioned during the 
visit, and in any case "the media have overplayed the whole issue".
   "If we in South Africa could solve our problems, we would not need 
international mediation ... what we did realise abroad was that the 
international mediation was not just an IFP and ANC problem, it was a 
problem to be resolved by all the parties," he said.
   A source in the German delegation said that a particularly good 
relationship had been established between the three M's -- Mzimela, 
National Party Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer, and his ANC 
deputy Valli Moosa -- the same trio who met to resolve the international 
mediation crisis last year, and abandoned the attempt in bad humour.
   Democratic Party constitutional expert Colin Eglin said this week the 
trip could be intepreted as a "diluted form of international mediation", 
as it was away from home and because they learnt from the Germans.
   A report on the tour is being drawn up by the three technical 
advisers who accompanied the team. It is possible that this report will 
form the basis of further discussions with the IFP and parties within 
the Constitutional Assembly.

Moseneke To Lead PAC?  

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Vuyo Mvoko

   Johannesburg - Former Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) deputy president 
and now chairman of Telkom, Advocate Dikgang Moseneke, has been 
approached to lead the party.
    This was confirmed by PAC MP Patricia de Lille late this week. De 
Lille, however, said she did not yet know what his response has been.
   This follows the resignation of general secretary Maxwell 
Nemadzivhanani early this week, which renewed attention to the troubled 
party.
   Nemadzivhanani said he had received a lot of criticism from party 
members, and so felt he should hand over to other "capable" people. He 
told the Mail & Guardian he planned to look for work in the government, 
but he was keeping his options open.
   Since its disastrous results in both the 1994 national elections and 
last year's local government elections, the PAC has been plagued by 
allegations of leadership ineptitude which were particularly directed at 
its dour president Clarence Makwetu.
   Makwetu held on to the party's senior position by eight votes in 
1994, against a last-minute challenge from Motsoko Pheko, who had 
arrived from overseas on the penultimate day of the party's four-day 
congress in Mmabatho. Pheko is now deputy president and most likely to 
be elected president.
   Last month the PAC's student wing the Pan Africanist Students 
Organisation (Paso), declared the party was in an "anarchical state of 
affairs" and was experiencing a "leadership crisis".
   Paso called for the ousting of Makwetu, Maxwell Nemadzivhanani (whom 
they described as "arrogant and devisive"), MP Gora Ibrahim, and former 
deputy president Johnson Mlambo.
   Following Paso's call the PAC National Executive Committee decided to 
change the status of the party's annual general conference, scheduled 
for Easter weekend, to a congress where a new leadership can be elected.
   De Lille confirmed there was a lot of agitation within the party, but 
denied it was crumbling to the ground.
   Moseneke told the M&G: "No. I decline. It's great to know I'm still 
loved out there, but I have no interest in a political career."

South Africa
Report takes WWF To 'Tusk' 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Eddie Koch and Rehana Rossouw

   Johannesburg - The Department of Military Intelligence was heavily 
involved in the illegal sale of elephant tusks from Angola between 1978 
and 1986 -- and a commission of inquiry, established by the South 
African Defence Force in 1988 to probe these deals, was a white-wash.
   This is the main finding of the Kumbleben Commission which this week 
released a 200-page report about its inquiry into the smuggling of rhino 
horn and elephant tusks in South Africa. The commission was appointed by 
President Nelson Mandela in October 1994.
   Justice ME Kumbleben also criticises Operation Lock, the 
controversial covert operation by former British special forces officers 
to combat poaching in Southern Africa in the late 1980s, and says the 
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the head of its South African branch must 
take some responsibility for the behaviour of this unit.
   The Kumbleben report finds there was large-scale destruction of 
wildlife, including elephants and rhinos, in north-eastern Namibia and 
Angola as a result of the 1980s wars in those countries. Most of the 
ivory and rhino horn obtained by poachers during this period was 
illegally exported through South Africa by SADF military intelligence.
   The Roos Commission, set up by the defence force in 1988 to probe 
press reports of military involvement in the illicit trade, claimed that 
only about 500 tusks captured by Unita from poachers were handled by the 
military from 1978 onwards.
   Kumbleben describes this commission as a "charade" designed to 
exonerate the SADF.
   The report lambasts a scheme hatched by conservationists in the late 
1980s to use former British special forces officers to combat poaching 
in Southern Africa. It describes Operation Lock -- financed by Prince 
Bernhard of the Netherlands and set up by John Hanks (then the WWF's 
project manager at its headquarters in Geneva) -- as being "accountable 
to no one".
   Kumbleben also suggests that more than 100 rhino horns provided to 
these officers by the Natal Parks Board and conservation authorities in 
Namibia for supposed sting operations were later misappropriated by 
members of Operation Lock.
   Sections of the report contain extracts from a secret document 
(called Q in the report) which shows that the anti-poaching operation 
was infiltrated by members of South African military intelligence after 
it set up headquarters in South Africa. This was apparently designed to 
ensure Operation Lock could be "put to good use by the necessary South 
African information collecting departments".
   The document claims that Colonel Ian Crooke, the commander of 
Operation Lock, had offered to help in "the monitoring of anti-South 
African bodies which are situated overseas".
   Evidence presented to the commission suggests that document Q -- 
which appears to be an internal Operation Lock memo -- was drawn up by a 
South African military intelligence officer called Mike Richards, who 
had managed to infiltrate the operation.
   Kumbleben questions claims by Hanks that the WWF, the world's biggest 
conservation NGO, was not aware of Operation Lock's activities.
    It goes on to stress, however, that "those responsible for putting 
Lock in place did not have the ulterior motive of Lock functioning as 
some sort of espionage or intelligence collecting agency for the RSA. It 
was intended by them to be an anti-poaching or anti-smuggling operation 
and nothing more. It may have later been contaminated by other 
objectives and considerations referred to in document Q."
   Hanks said his involvement in purchasing rhino horn to entrap 
smugglers was a sincere attempt to save Africa's dwindling black rhino 
stocks.
   "It was nothing to do with Operation Lock, it was a totally different 
project. The WWF had done nothing wrong in this regard."
   With the assistance of Prince Bernhard, Hanks raised R250 000 to 
purchase rhino horn to trap smugglers. Although the horn was never again 
accounted for, Hanks believes it was money well spent. "There was a 
group of people tested to do the undercover work. They never reported to 
the WWF."
   Hanks said he could not comment further until he had read the 
Kumbleben report.

De Kock Trial To Focus On Mlangeni Assassination 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Mail & Guardian reporter

   Johannesburg - The Eugene de Kock trial reopens on Monday with a 
cross-examination of former Vlakplaas policeman Joe Mamasela who is 
expected to provide the court with details about police involvement in a 
number of political murders in the 1980s.
   The trial will then focus on the assassination of human rights lawyer 
Bheki Mlangeni whose head was blown apart by a bomb planted in a 
cassette recorder.
   A number of witnesses -- including the man who manufactured the 
Mlangeni bomb -- are likely to tell the court that De Kock, former 
commander of the notorious Vlakplaas unit, arranged for the deadly 
parcel to be sent to his old enemy, renegade policeman Dirk Coetzee, in 
London.
   Coetzee was unable to pay demurrage costs in Lusaka and it was then 
sent back to lawyer Bheki Mlangeni who had been listed as the sender. 
When Mlangeni received the package, he placed a cassette in the 
recorder, put on the headphones and detonated the device.
   The Transvaal Attorney General's office may interrupt the trial after 
it resumes in order to charge De Kock in connection with the smuggling 
of weapons to Inkatha Freedom Party paramilitary camps during the early 
1990s.
   Senior IFP officials -- including Themba Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu -- 
will be implicated in the gun-running operations while the name of 
Inkatha senator Phillip Powell is expected to feature prominently in the 
case.
   The Mail & Guardian is aware that the AG's office is also working on 
prosecutions against three police generals mentioned by Judge Richard 
Goldstone as having been involved in dirty tricks operations. These are 
Krappies Engelbrecht, Basie Smit and Johan le Roux.
   Officials in the AG's office declined to comment on the matter.
   These cases are due to be finalised this year.

Is TV Relaunching ... Or Re-sinking? 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy and Justin Pearce 

   Johannesburg - The grand plan for a spectacular relaunch of the SABC 
to shake off the last vestiges of its heritage as a bastion of Afrikaner 
nationalism, has been dampened by a last-ditch bid by the language 
lobby.
   When the Rapportryers and other bodies dedicated to the protection of 
the Afrikaans language signalled that they would fight -- through the 
courts, if necessary -- any downgrading of their language on the 
national broadcaster, the Independent Broadcasting Authority had to sit 
up and take note. In the interim Constitution, the Afrikaans language 
lobby has a powerful weapon, and the Independent Broadcasting Authority 
(IBA), which had been relaxed about the formalities of SABC's planned 
changes, would be vulnerable to legal attack if it did not follow the 
letter of the law and hold public hearings, which would allow the 
language lobby to pursue its objections.
   That sparked off this week's power struggle between the two premier 
bodies of South African broadcasting, both of which are determined to 
show that they are in charge of reshaping the public broadcaster.
   The SABC for the moment lacks IBA approval to amend its television 
broadcast licences in such a way as to allow the corporation to spread 
South African languages equitably across all three new channels as it 
had planned to do next month. The IBA is refusing to give this approval 
until public hearings have been held in terms of the Broadcasting Act.
   The SABC is to press on with its plans to relaunch its TV services on 
February 4, but the still-unchanged broadcast licences mean the 
corporation now has two weeks to revise schedules which took months to 
compile.
   The IBA and SABC accuse each other of provoking this crisis. The SABC 
said it had held discussions with the IBA as early as September and that 
the regulatory body was "well aware" of what was coming.
   IBA sources in turn said the authority had repeatedly informed SABC 
top management of the need to make a formal application to amend its 
broadcast licence.
   The SABC further alleges that, based on discussions held between the 
parties, there "did not seem to be a problem" until earlier this week 
when press reports alerted the SABC to the IBA's decision against 
granting an immediate amendment. The possibility of legal irregularities 
in the SABC's plans was first made public when Afrikaner organisations 
threatened the SABC with court action.
   The Rapportryersbeweging said programme restructuring and language 
changes by the SABC were being done single-handedly by the corporation. 
The Rapportryers threatened to take the SABC to court and to make 
submissions to the IBA regarding the planned relaunch.
   The IBA was alerted and the SABC was informed that it would have to 
comply by amending its licence and allowing for public scrutiny.
   SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu said the launch on February 4 
was not challenged by the IBA at the parties' last meeting in mid-
December, adding that the corporation was "made to understand that the 
amendment would be a minor technicality". The IBA denied this.
   Some sources see the IBA-SABC wrangle as a misunderstanding due to 
bad communication; others believe it is a power struggle over who has 
the greater authority, while others insinuate that were it not for the 
stir caused by the Afrikaner men-only movement, the stand-off between 
the parties would have been averted.
   The question that remains is whether the two had agreed in principle 
on the amendment being granted as a mere formality and whether plans 
were upset by a small Afrikaans fringe group insisting on its democratic 
right to scrutinise the new SABC changes.
   SABC communications head Ken Modise insisted that no individual was 
responsible for the misunderstanding, since each meeting between the 
parties was attended by at least three representatives from each 
organisation.
   IBA spokesman Amos Vilakazi denied that there was a power struggle 
between them, adding that the IBA was merely doing its regulatory duty.
   The SABC is adamant that it was complying with the Broadcasting Act 
by handing in its application for an amendment when it did. According to 
one SABC official, the IBA had dragged its heels in getting the 
application gazetted and this contributed to the delay in notifying the 
public of imminent changes within the SABC.
   There is a feeling within the SABC that the IBA was whipping up a 
logistical storm in a teacup, and that it did not have the right to 
dictate the language preference used on the SABC.
   The IBA, however, felt that the handing in of the application two 
months ago -- in early October rather than in mid-December -- would have 
been more acceptable and would have allowed for public scrutiny.
   "The effect of the application is that it transforms public 
broadcasting in this country and, while we are not opposed to the SABC, 
we are opposed to the procedurally incorrect manner in which it has gone 
about doing it," an IBA source said. He stressed the IBA was merely 
doing its job as a media regulator.
   In the wake of this week's fiasco, SABC management has asserted its 
commitment to public consultation, and has argued that going ahead with 
its revised plan was the best way to give the public an idea of what the 
changes involved.
   "We believe the public will be better informed once they have seen 
what is offered," Modise said.
   Modise confirmed that the corporation is to go ahead with its 
February 4 relaunch while still abiding by the terms of its existing 
licences. This will, however, involve a rearrangement of the schedules 
in order to keep the dominant languages on each channel the same as at 
present.
   SABC sources suggest the corporation paid little attention to the 
need to seek a formal licence amendment, lulled into false security by 
the fact that the IBA had raised no objections when African languages 
were introduced into TV1's Good Morning South Africa.
   However, licences stipulate the dominant languages for each channel. 
While the GMSA changes did not change the status of English and 
Afrikaans as the dominant languages on TV1, the changes that were 
planned for February 4 would have reached much further.
   Briefing TV staff on Wednesday, Jill Chisholm, head of Television 
News Production and acting head of television, pointed out there was no 
precedent for a South African broadcaster applying for a licence 
amendment as opposed to a fresh licence, hence the lack of clarity over 
correct procedure.
   Chisholm also expressed disappointment that changes which "are part 
of a root and branch transformation" of the SABC had been stymied by the 
problems raised by the IBA, when in fact the IBA and SABC were in 
agreement on the kind of transformation which the corporation needed to 
undergo.
   Stressing the need for discretion, Chisholm expressed concern about 
"running into IBA sensitivities about power and authority".
   Wednesday's briefing was the first time that staff who will be 
implementing the new programme format had been officially informed of 
the plans. Chisholm apologised to staff for the fact that they had heard 
about the changes in line-up in the press before being briefed by the 
SABC. The briefing was intended to take place earlier but had been 
delayed.
   Staffers have in the meantime voiced frustration at what they see as 
the superficial nature of the changes planned at the SABC, at the 
confusion over the lines of managerial command, and at the corporation's 
tardiness in informing them about the changes.

News Viewers Vote With Their Remotes 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy

   Johannesburg - The SABC's news and actuality coverage -- the mainstay 
of the broadcaster's operation -- has lost more than a quarter of a 
million viewers over the past year.
   The corporation's eight o'clock English news slot has suffered a drop 
of a minimum of 100 000 viewers, while the equivalent 30-minute 
Afrikaans bulletin lost 200 000 viewers.
   The new, "improved" Agenda Newsline also suffered a decline of about 
100 000 viewers, but it is not clear from market research where the 
audience has moved to.
   There has been a "steady decrease" in the number of people who watch 
news and actuality, said SABC news and actuality research manager, Dr. 
Stoffel Blaauw, adding that people either watch only half the news, 
change channels, or just switch off their television sets for the night.
   Blaauw said the decline began when the SABC shifted from being a 
commercial broadcaster to becoming a public broadcaster, adding that the 
drop of 300 000 viewers was a "minimum average" of the total number of 
people lost to news and actuality.
   "The drop began as early as September 1993, when the political agenda 
of the SABC changed and it had to adapt to a changing South Africa by 
ridding itself of the stereotyped black television channels -- the 
former TV2 and TV3 -- and market a television service that was more 
representative of the broader spectrum of South Africans," Blaauw said.
   He said the SABC's top brass was trying its best to broadcast to all 
language groups but, because it was a mammoth task and one could not be 
all things to all people, certain local English and Afrikaans groups 
were becoming "increasingly annoyed" with the drop in standards of 
television, especially news and actuality.
   With about 10,5-million households connected to television, a steady 
decline of this nature could see a drop of close to a million viewers by 
the time the next elections are due.
   Blaauw predicted that people would be increasingly incensed to find 
that, with the relaunching of channels, the corporation was using 
material which was "currently on the shelf" because of time and 
budgetary constraints.
   He said top management was, despite having its own agenda, open to 
suggestions gathered from research conducted and keen to improve the 
image of the SABC, but added that the "new look" SABC would be a case of 
"let's wait and see what happens".

Rugby: Luyt Dynasty Expands Its Turf 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Nicole Fritz and Vuyo Mvoko

    Johannesburg - Rian Oberholzer, Louis Luyt's son-in-law, has left 
his job as South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) tournament 
director to take up a permanent appointment in Australia as chief 
executive of Sanza -- the company which will control rugby broadcasts in 
the southern hemisphere.
   Sanza came into being after a R2-billion deal Luyt, together with 
Australia's Leo Williams and New Zealand's Richie Guy, signed with media 
mogul Rupert Murdoch.
   Effectively, this contract gives Murdoch exclusive television rights 
to all southern hemisphere provincial and international rugby for the 
next 10 years.
   Oberholzer's appointment as head of Sanza is being seen in some 
circles as a transcontinental expansion of the Luyt dynasty -- which 
includes Luyt's son, Louis Luyt junior, who is general manager of Ellis 
Park and Luyt senior's personal assistant.
   Oberholzer is also a trustee of the Transvaal Rugby Sports Trust. The 
trustees control voting rights and rights to dividends and interest in 
respect of the Transvaal Rugby Football Union's investment in Ellis 
Park.
   Oberholzer's move and reports of Luyt's property sales have fuelled 
speculation that Luyt intends to leave the country. Two weeks ago the 
Mail & Guardian reported Luyt's house in the plush Johannesburg suburb 
of Saxonwold had been placed on the market, apparently for a staggering 
R7-million.
   It has also been reported that Luyt's luxurious Ballito holiday-home 
was up for sale over the festive season, but was inexplicably withdrawn 
after a short period.

Education In Crisis: Teachers Face Cut-backs 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Philippa Garson and Vusi Mona

   Johannesburg - TENS of thousands of teachers around the country will 
soon have to pack up their bags and move to under-resourced schools or 
be retrenched.
   The government's commitment to equity in schools and the severe 
constraints on the education budget mean many schools will have to cut-
back on the number of teachers they employ.
   The squeeze on the education budget, and the fact that many provinces 
have already overspent on last year's budget, is forcing schools to cut 
back on the number of teachers they employ by increasing teacher/pupil 
ratios to 1:40 in primary schools and 1:35 in high schools over a period 
of five years and cutting back on subject choices.
   Ironically, the subjects the country needs the most in terms of human 
resource development, like science, will be the first to go, because 
these are the smaller, and more expensive classes to run. So too will 
the better, more experienced teachers bear the brunt of the cut-backs, 
as they are the more expensive to employ.
   But the only way that provinces can balance their books is by 
slashing back on teachers salaries -- which swallow 85% of the education 
budget. According to some, the number of teachers currently in 
employment is roughly adequate for the country as a whole. For others, 
no amount of redeployment will absorb the excess number of teachers 
generated by the new teacher/pupil ratios. The 1994 national 
teacher/pupil ratio was 1:34 in primary schools and 1:27 in high 
schools, implying that enforced new ratios will generate a surplus of 
teachers. There are already as many as 15 000 unemployed teachers.
   Glaring inequities exist in terms of teacher distribution, with an 
abundance of teachers and small classes in most formerly white schools. 
It is in the many township schools, in peri-urban informal settlements 
and in rural areas, where teacher shortages exist.
   Teachers wanting to keep their jobs will have no option but to 
relocate to the areas where they are needed. But moving teachers to 
poorer areas brings with it a host of legal, financial and social 
obstacles, said Peter Buckland of the National Business Initiative. In 
terms of the Educators' Employment Act, affecting state-aided or model C 
schools, schools have the right to choose which teachers to employ. To 
redeploy teachers would mean amending this legislation.
   Moving teachers to other schools also implies the need for travel 
costs, relocation costs and in some cases, accommodation costs -- money 
which the government doesn't seem to have.
   Then there is teachers' resistance to moving on the one hand, and 
communities' antagonism towards "outside" teachers coming to take up 
jobs when their own teachers are unemployed. Many white teachers would 
balk at moving to volatile informal settlements where they may not be 
welcome.
   The South African Teachers Union has agreed in principle to 
redeployment, if it means that jobs can be saved. "We are backing 
redeployment in that we are backing teachers' jobs. But we need a 
strategy to attract teachers to impoverished areas," said general 
secretary Thulas Nxesi.
   Issues such as housing arrangements and travel allowances would have 
to be negotiated, Nxesi added, warning that last-resort retrenchments 
would meet with resistance. "We don't believe there's an oversupply of 
teachers. If they talk retrenchments we will do whatever we can to 
protect our members' jobs."
    Gauteng MEC Mary Metcalfe said travelling expenses could not be paid 
however. She said redeployment had already been negotiated with the 
teachers' unions for the moving of teachers "from the better-off to the 
more under-resourced schools to be phased in over the next two years. 
People will be offered redeployment to areas within reasonable distances 
from where they live.
   "Educationally we'd agree that smaller class sizes are better but we 
are going through a period of massive reconstruction and we simply 
cannot afford smaller classroom sizes."
   Metcalfe added however that even if the new ratios were complied 
with, the province could still not meet its budget. This would point 
towards inevitable retrenchments. Metcalfe refused to confirm this in 
the absence of a finalised budget or negotiations.
   According to Jane Hofmeyr, also of the NBI, "teachers will have to be 
retrenched unless we relook at the teacher/pupil ratios and the 
education budget". In her view, it is time to consider loans from the 
World Bank. "We don't want a debt trap forever but there are few 
countries that don't use loans at some time or another. It is a critical 
time for us in terms of human resource development."

Rector Urges Universities To Share Apartheid's Backlogs

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Philippa Garson

   Johannesburg - The call by the University of the Western Cape's new 
rector, Cecil Abrahams, for the province's three universities to take 
joint responsibility for its disadvantaged students has prompted mildly 
defensive attitudes from two wealthier sisters, the University of Cape 
Town and the University of Stellenbosch.
   Abrahams has called for the three universities in the Western Cape to 
share the burden of disadvantaged students and take some of the load off 
his own university with a streamlined, common admissions centre.
   Abrahams outlined his proposal in a graduation speech at UCT last 
month, calling for "universities as a collective (to) establish a common 
applications centre where we agree to divide among ourselves a pre-
determined percentage of applicants who have been historically 
oppressed.
   "I propose as well that we address together the difficult financial 
situation facing students. It is vitally important that the university 
sector in this region develop in an orderly and financially viable 
manner. This is not a time for any one of our universities to gloat at 
the struggles and misfortunes of a particular university," he said.
   Abrahams told the Mail & Guardian the educational and financial 
poverty of disadvantaged students should be the responsibility of all 
three institutions. "This would reduce the responsibility of one 
university to deal with all the backlogs apartheid created."
   He said he feared a repeat of last year's admissions saga at UWC 
which resulted in scores of students being turned away for non-payment 
of fees.
   Abrahams said that UCT's response had been "polite", and Stellenbosch 
had not yet responded. He hoped however to schedule a meeting on the 
issue next month.
   UCT acting Vice-Chancellor Wieland Gewers said he was "very 
interested" in the line taken by Abrahams, but suggested that many co-
operative developments had taken place of which Abrahams had perhaps not 
been aware.
   "We've been very active in inter-technikon and university co-
operation in the Western Cape." A group of five institutions, namely the 
three Western Cape universities, Peninsula Technikon and Cape Technikon, 
has established a vice-rectors' group that meets frequently to promote 
co-operation on issues of common concern like staff development and 
sharing of libraries, said Gewers.
   The Western Cape Tertiary Institutions Trust had already raised funds 
for all the institutions and a single mechanism for all five libraries 
was being implimented. Gewers hinted that Abrahams was "not fully 
conversant with the number of students we do have that are black (51%). 
"
   He said that his university was flooded with 17 000 applications this 
year and had only 3 000 places.
   The University of Stellenbosch was also keen to remind Abrahams of 
existing regional co-operation structures and of its own numbers of 
disadvantaged students, which the university was already battling to 
fund.
   Stellensbosch Vice-Chancellor A Van Wyk said the university had been 
increasing its admission of disadvantaged students at an "exponential 
rate and 17% of 1995's intake of first year students were from that 
group." Van Wyk said Abrahams suggestions, which he noted with 
"interest", should be taken to the National Commission on Higher 
Education.
    Abrahams said he was aware of the Committee of Five Tertiary 
Institutions but believed the issue was "urgent enough" to be dealt with 
by top leadership as soon as possible.

Intelligence To Investigate Police Spy Scandal 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Gaye Davis

   Johannesburg - Intelligence officials hope to have their own 
investigation into the police bugging scandal wrapped up as early as 
next week and will be forwarding a report to both President Nelson 
Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
   "We will get to the bottom of this -- the who, the how and the why," 
deputy co-ordinator of intelligence Moe Shaik said this week of the 
spying row which saw police and intelligence chiefs all but accuse each 
other of lying.
   The investigation by the National Intelligence Co-ordinating 
Committee (NICOC) centres on allegations that former security policeman 
Dirk Coetzee, now an National Intelligence Agency operative, told SAPS 
member Inspector H Moodley he had been assigned to spy on top-ranking 
policemen -- a charge Coetzee denies.
   The probe also focuses on whether or not listening devices or 
equipment were found connected to top-ranking policemen's telephones.
   Shaik refused to comment this week when asked whether an 
investigation by Telkom had thrown doubt on whether bugs were in fact 
found.
   He did however concede a failure to properly assess the impact the 
allegations could have if made public. Shaik said he discussed "rumours 
circulating" with SAPS commissioner George Fivaz as soon as he heard of 
them. Fivaz "was aware of them and could put them in context". In what 
proved a serious miscalculation, they agreed to let the matter rest 
there.
   Shaik said this week: "Our collective response was sluggish. A story 
we dismissed as media hype, that we thought was essentially a non-issue, 
threatened to become a national crisis.
   "The lesson to be learned is that we need mechanisms to deal with any 
issue that -- whether deliberately or unintentionally -- could threaten 
the fragility of the transition."
   The investigation, by the NICOC, is one of three launched in the wake 
of newspaper reports that the National Intelligence Agency was bugging 
top-ranking policemen. Coetzee, Moodley and his commander, the head of 
the National Priority Crimes Unit, Major-General Suiker Brits had all 
been interviewed, Shaik said.
   A judge to head an independent inquiry announced by Deputy President 
Thabo Mbeki last week has yet to be appointed, although Minister of 
Justice Dullah Omar told the M&G he expected an announcement would be 
made during the course of next week.
   Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence will be meeting 
on February 7 to consider reports it has called for from both the SAPS 
and NIA and to decide whether to call individuals to testify before it. 
Its inquiry begins officially on February 12.
   Shaik said NICOC's report would first be discussed within the 
committee, which brings together the National Crime Intelligence Service 
of the SAPS, the NIA and the South African Secret Service, before being 
forwarded to President Mandela and Deputy President Mbeki for a decision 
on how to proceed.

De Klerk Aims for Nat Party Revival 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Gaye Davis

   Johannesburg - National Party leader F. W. de Klerk has yet again had 
to insist that rumours of his party's imminent demise were exaggerated.
   De Klerk's irritation was not so much with the "disgruntled 
individuals" who, by leaking a strategy document to the Afrikaans Sunday 
newspaper Rapport had set themselves "on a course of sabotage", but with 
the fact that the document had been interpreted as saying the NP was 
preparing to dissolve.
   De Klerk faced having to correct this misinterpretation by saying 
what was really intended -- that far from dissolving, the NP meant to 
act like an alka-seltzer on the political digestive tract, saving it 
from the indigestibility of a one-party state threatened by the ANC's 
dominance.
   But his ire was compounded at having to show more of his hand than he 
would have liked. The plan was for him to unveil the vision of a new, 
right-of-centre political movement, aimed at injecting fluidity into 
South Africa's democracy, on February 2.
   Seeing De Klerk, flanked by NP executive director Fanus Schoeman, 
media head Marthinus Van Schalkwyk and Cape leader Dawie de Villiers, a 
question arose. How could they expect the public to have confidence in 
their ability to transform the political landscape when rearranging the 
furniture within their own party was proving so problematic?
   In fact, De Klerk does not see the NP  as necessarily leading the 
movement it is proposing, which will need substantial black support to 
survive.
   He has been engaged in intensive talks with business, religious and 
community leaders he wants to support the formation of a movement, 
founded on Christian values, that could draw support on issues like 
bringing back capital punishment, retaining anti-abortion laws, lowering 
taxes and limiting state power.
   He wants to establish common ground with the other minority parties 
through "regular discussions", but an alliance is not necessarily going 
to emerge. Essentially, NP strategists are looking for growth to 
congregants in the ANC's church who might be encouraged, ahead of 1999 
and a new general election, to cross the floor.
   These are non-racial issues, around which De Klerk hopes to rally 
people on the basis of shared values as a way of shattering what NP 
strategists see as racially-based voting patterns.
   A clause in the interim constitution demands that MPs crossing the 
floor resign their seats. It is not repeated in the draft new 
constitution, but may yet appear: the ANC would not want members elected 
by voters who backed the party, rather than voting for an individual, 
free to do political waltzes.
   But members -- and supporters -- might just be tempted, if there was 
a viable opposition amounting to more than tiny parties relegated to 
being permanent opponents of the majority party without any hope of ever 
coming into power. To be viable, it would have to be non-racial and 
forward-looking, with no hint of being concerned with furthering narrow 
ethnic interests.

Soccer: This Fish Is Poetry In Motion 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Mark Gevisser

   Johannesburg - Monday afternoon at the Old Eds Health & Racquet Club 
in Houghton. It's only 48 hours after they were crowned national heroes, 
and the Bafana Bafana seem bemused, rather than irritated, by the fact 
that only a few autograph-hunting children recognise them. "Excuse me!" 
calls a fluorescent kugel, "what team are you?"
   Doctor and Shoes have led an invasion of the aerobics class, pealing 
with laughter as they throw their gold around. Zane, meanwhile, is 
throwing indignant teenage girls off exercycles. Augie is primping his 
pecs down in freeweights. Coach Clive is gamely puffing his way through 
a circuit. The Feesh, it goes without saying, is in the water, doing 
laps.
   Later, signature bird's-nest hair tamed by a back-to-front baseball 
cap, the youngest member of the South African squad  -- and the one most 
likely to hit the international big time -- lopes across the floor to 
laugh at his buddies in the aerobics class.
   There's something mesmerising about Mark Fish. The gangly white boy's 
jerky, too-long limbs sometimes seem to be caught in adolescence (he is 
21), beyond his control, until they snap, in a moment, into the machine-
like precision which earned him the "Man of the Match" vote last 
Saturday when South Africa trounced Cameroon.
   There's no white player black South Africans love more; there's no 
South African defender who gets as much attention from the crowd. 
"Feeeesh!" the supporters cried every time his boot tapped the ball on 
Saturday. "Feeeesh" they cry every time he plays for Orlando Pirates.
   And it's not just because his name, like "Shhhhoooeees", rolls easily 
off the collective tongue of a stadium-full of people. It's not just 
because he is a defender who never loses a tackle, no matter how 
aggressive the striker, who is given to blazing lone storms across the 
length of the field into the other team's goal-box and who reads a game 
like no one else on the field. No, it's because he is raw, a rebel, easy 
to find (that hair!), easy to read.
   There's something intimidating about the artistry of a Khumalo or a 
Mosheou, something inaccessible about the lofty Masinga; through Feesh, 
though, you can live the match, following the fortunes of your team as 
they ripple through his posture and register on his features.
   Coach Clive Barker puts it best: "What impresses most people about 
Mark Fish is his body language. He's unpredictable, a character. A Jonty 
Rhodes, a James Small. He betrays to the crowds what we're trying to get 
across."
   Barker clearly adores his youngest ward: "He's not my first choice 
for the national team! He's my first, second and third choice!" The 
bluff, no-nonsense coach plays his part so perfectly you wonder if he 
hasn't stepped off the pages of Whizzer & Chips. But Fish stirs even the 
coach to poesy: "If I were in the trenches of World War I and I had Mark 
Fish next to me, even if there were 1 000 soldiers storming us, I'd be 
convinced we'd still win. He's a fighter."
   It's no secret there are talent scouts from the European clubs here 
for the African Cup of Nations, and they've got their eyes on Fish. 
There have been rumours about Manchester United, and it's believed the 
Italians are also showing interest. Soccer writers caution, though, that 
a star in malnourished South Africa might not even register a blip on 
the Italian or British landscape.
   Barker believes that Fish "may have the potential to hit the jackpot, 
to make the big league if he manages things right. But he may yet go 
into the category of the George Bests." Fish, you see, is Party Animal 
Number One in the South African squad. He loves to drink and he can get 
unruly. The squad still chuckle at how he told Mike Atherton he was 
"ugly".
   "He loves a good party," says Barker, "and his parties go on longer 
than anyone else's." As does his hair, even though Barker's caught wind 
of a rumour that, if the Bafana Bafana get to the finals, a certain 
Feesh might be sporting an "exotic, punk, short, blue do".
   There's none of that Mark Fish sitting opposite me at the bar of the 
Sunnyside Hotel. He is the consummate Pretoria Boys High alumnus: well-
spoken, very polite. He talks, for example, of "Mr Barker" and "Mr 
Mandela".
   It's clear he doesn't really like the limelight, but he plays ball 
anyway, attempting to answer questions and admitting, sheepishly, that 
his mind is elsewhere. Despite his youth, he is one of the most popular 
members of the squad: it's hard not to like him.
   He is not self-conscious about being a white boy in a black sport. 
His best buddy -- and room mate at the Sunnyside -- is Pirates captain 
and fellow Pretoria homeboy (and rabble-rouser) Edward Motale. "Fish," 
says Motale, "is not like other whites. I take him to Mamelodi, to 
Tembisa, and he'll get up and dance even though he's the only white. He 
won't give a damn, he'll just boogie and then others will join him. With 
other whites it's different. They need special attention one cannot 
afford."
   After Saturday's victory, Fish chose to go with his mates to a bar, 
"Tings and Times" in Pretoria, rather than joining the team at the 
Randburg Waterfront. Johannesburg, he says, is "flashy and phoney and 
false, all these guys who dress to impress". Motale often accompanies 
him on his Pretoria sorties -- a place not known for its mixed venues -- 
where the pair has become known as "New South Africa".
    Fish lives in one of our land's strange interstices, unrecognised by 
his home culture, but a folk hero to millions. "I'll go to a restaurant 
with a girlfriend and the only one who'll recognise me is the waiter, 
and he'll insist I go into the back and meet all the kitchen staff."
   Perhaps his ease with this is a function of his youth: he was in 
nappies during the Soweto uprising. He is, truly, a post-apartheid babe. 
Although he is "not rushing to join the ANC", he acknowledges that, 
because soccer has taken him across the railway line, he does have an 
insight into the ravages of apartheid his white peers may not have. But 
there is something a little too defensive -- or perhaps just young -- in 
his comment: "I know about apartheid years, but I wasn't there. It's got 
nothing to do with me. I never hated blacks."
    Fish, like Eddie Motale, spent most of his childhood playing soccer 
at Pretoria club, Arcadia Shepherds. But, while Fish remembers Arcadia 
with unqualified warmth, Motale's stories are full of the slights of 
petty apartheid. He was left behind in the showers when the white boys 
went to the pub, he was dropped from the Colts team even though he was 
clearly the best player and at rival Berea Park he was not allowed to 
use the facilities.
   Fish -- like most white South Africans -- wants to erase race; Motale 
-- like most black South Africans -- can't. Motale lives with his 
parents in Mamelodi; Fish lives with his grandparents in Arcadia. 
Motale's mother is a cleaner at Pretoria University; Fish's mother is a 
sales manageress at Edgars. Motale had a hard time finishing school and, 
aged 29, lives for and through soccer. Fish is in the middle of a Unisa 
marketing degree and thinks he may want to move into sports psychology.
   There are intimations that Fish had a difficult childhood -- his 
parents are divorced, and those who know him well say, elliptically, 
that his drive on the football field is related to his "background" -- 
but he does not talk about this. The greatest conflict of his youth 
seems to have been that timeworn one of white South African schools: 
soccer versus rugby.
   Pretoria Boys High is a great rugby-playing school. They wanted him 
to play rugby, he wanted to play soccer. At primary school, he was head 
boy. But in white South African high schools, soccer -- the terrain of 
dagga-smoking rebels -- is positively unpatriotic, so at "Boys High" 
Fish assumed a more marginal existence. He speaks, now, with 
indignation, about how the school "did nothing for me, and now has the 
cheek to ask me to donate money to a new library. When Robbie Brink made 
the national rugby team, they said he was Boys High's first Springbok. 
Well what about me? I was already playing for the national soccer 
squad!"
   He clearly doesn't like authority. Soccer administration in this 
country is "corrupt ... the administrators get all the money and the 
players don't get the respect they earn. I tell you, if I get picked for 
a European club, if it's Clive Barker as coach I might consider coming 
back to this country. Otherwise, forget it."
   Right now he's listening to the group LIVE on his walkman, 
particularly "this one song, Lightning Crashes, about the world and how 
fucked up it is". It figures that his favourite movie is What's eating 
Gilbert Grape? Even though he is as gregarious as Johnny Depp is dark, 
there's something unmistakably teen-rebel about him. It's not 
nihilistic, wear-black, fuck-you or gangsta-rap rebellion; it's rather 
the indie-rock rebellion of vague social conscience, long sideburns and 
mellow attitude -- REM and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers are two of his 
favourite bands.
   And yes, he is a poet. A promising one at that. Changes (see above) 
is filled with the nostalgic romanticism of an alienated Generation-X 
yearning for more essential times, when there was nothing to mediate our 
experience and we were mad bodies "dancing on the hillsides" rather than 
"pair[s] of eyes" staring, through the dark, at TV sets.
   He wrote the poem for Clive Barker's wife, a ballet dancer, but it is 
clearly a meditation on his own career. We are no longer all "dancers", 
but now "cleaved" into "actor and spectators", soccer-stars and fans. 
"We are obsessed with heroes who live for us/ and whom we punish."
   Mark Fish must know that he has now become one of those heroes.
   CHANGES, by Mark Fish 
   Dancer 
   entertain with your 
   sweet dangerous flow.
   I watched your body

   New Woman, timeless dancer

   There are no longer "dancers" the possessed 
   The cleavage of men into actor and spectators 
   is the central feel of our time.
   We are obsessed with heroes who live for us

   If all the radios and the televisions were deprived 
   of their sources of power, all books and paintings 
   burned tomorrow,

   all the arts of vicarious existence

Mozambique 
Row over IMF Plans

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Eddie Koch and Carlos Cardoso

   Johannesburg - A row has broken out over International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) plans to impose tight curbs on wage hikes and the few social 
security benefits that still exist in Mozambique.
   The country has one of the poorest economies in the world and one of 
the lowest annual incomes per head for its 15-million people: $90 to 
$100 (about R315 to R360).
   The row began when the IMF started negotiating a new agreement with 
the Mozambican government in September last year. The Mozambican 
government had just agreed to increase the minimum wage of $14 (about 
R50) a month by 37,5%.
   The IMF responded by pointing out the post-election government had 
not met all its budget-cutting targets and issued a hard-line statement 
about the need to tighten up the fund's basic controls for Third World 
economies. These include cutbacks in state expenses, curbs on inflation 
and monetary circulation, financial reform and further privatisation.
   Officials from the IMF have since softened their stance after a 
number of Mozambique's donor countries -- which usually back the 
organisation's medicine for ailing economies -- wrote a letter saying 
the Frelimo-led government, which won the election last year, was 
actually doing well in terms of economic reform and that the fund should 
relax its hard line.
   However, IMF officials have indicated they will not relax monetary 
constraints and availability of investment capital until the government 
slashes the country's inflation levels, currently running at around 40%, 
down to 15%.
   The fund has also been criticised for ignoring the informal sector in 
Mozambique. It says this accounts for 30% of the country's GDP, while 
senior government sources insist that it is as high as 60% -- and 
operates as the most important cushion against starvation, rampant crime 
and redistribution of resources.
   Yet average wages for children on the dumbanengues (black markets) 
range from 30 000 to 75 000 meticais (R10 to R25) a month, plus one meal 
-- much less than the already abysmal R50 minimum in the formal sector.
   The International Confederation of Trade Unions (ICFTU), which held a 
workshop in Maputo in November last year, urged the IMF to realise that 
the country's informal sector had mushroomed as a byproduct of the tough 
austerity programme.
   "The government must begin to accord proper attention to the needs of 
workers in this sector, with a view to integrating them into the formal 
economy," says the ICFTU report.
   The ICFTU also urges the fund to negotiate its new package of 
financial constraints for the next three years -- which is expected to 
be finalised in Maputo next month -- with organised labour and emerging 
civic organisations. The international union organisation also wants 
measures designed to ensure food security and social spending for 
vulnerable groups such as women, youth and the aged.

Mozambique
US Millionaire Plans Indian Ocean Dreampark 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Eddie Koch

   Johannesburg - "Yo! You and you! Yo!" The big Texan is standing 
beneath the thudding turbine of a chopper in the middle of the 
Mozambican bush. He is whooping and yelling and pointing at a group of 
bewildered peasants who huddle behind a tree to protect themselves from 
a sandstorm whipped up by the helicopter as it swooped into their 
settlement.
   Gradually, above the cacophony, the villagers realise the American is 
telling some of them to "stop fiddle fucking" (a phrase repeated so 
often it could be called his company's motto), get into the air and take 
a look at the natural beauty that surrounds them. This is John Perrott, 
general manager for flamboyant millionaire James Ulysses Blanchard III, 
and he is bringing his employer's version of rural development to one of 
the poorest countries in the world.
   The vision of Blanchard Mozambique Enterprises is to create a massive 
wildlife and tourism mecca stretching from Inhaca Island off Maputo 
through the staggeringly beautiful Machangulo Peninsula, across the 
Maputo Elephant Park, where one of Africa's last free-ranging elephant 
herds lives, and then down to the South African border in the south.
   The Machangulo Peninsula has the world's highest forested dunes which 
jut, south of the island, into a subtropical sea abounding with coral 
reefs, dolphins, rays, sharks, marine turtles and endangered dugongs 
(strange sea mammal which gave rise to the mermaid legend because it has 
breasts to suckle its young).
   The $800-million masterplan, outlined in a book called the Black 
Bible by Blanchard's men, includes hovercrafts to ferry jetsetting 
tourists from Maputo to Inhaca; a Mississippi Steamer which will become 
a floating hotel and casino off the island; a chain of upmarket lodges 
on the beaches and inland lakes that dot the pensinsula; a national park 
that will be supplied with the big five and other animals in the biggest 
game restocking exercise ever undertaken in human history; scuba diving 
schools; game fishing expeditions; an aquarium; and a steam train to 
ferry tourists through this wonderland of wild game and marine life.
   South African consultants have advised Perrott that his dream to 
import a group of Bushmen from the Kalahari into the Mozambican theme 
park is likely to discredit the project. So has he given up the idea? 
"Hell no! If I get my way, I'll bring some of them little guys out here. 
Can you imagine tourists on the steam train looking out of one window 
and seeing elephants and rhino? Then they'll look out of the other and 
see the little bastards running around with their loin clothes and 
poison-tipped arrows ... The way I see it we'll bring them rhino here 
and save them from going extinct so why not bring the little guys who 
are also going extinct?"
   It is unlikely that either the Botswana or Mozambique governments 
will grant permission for Bushmen to be part of the scheme. But the 
masterplan is being taken seriously by the government in Maputo.
   The biggest obstacle in Perrott's way is that in 1987, at the height 
of Renamo's civil war, the Frelimo-led government granted South African 
timber giant Sappi a concession to plant more than 30 000 hectares of 
land with a plantation of bluegum trees -- in partnership with two 
Mozambican firms.
   The Maputo government's aim was to bring a big South African business 
into the area as a bulwark against bands of Renamo rebels, who waged a 
destructive civil war in the area, with clandestine support from 
elements in the South African military.
   Little thought was given, at that stage, to the fact that the 
concession zone is part of an incredibly rich area of plant diversity, 
known as the Maputaland Centre of Endemism, and that the commercial 
plantation will destroy botanical species which occur no where else on 
Earth and also one of the last tropical grasslands left in southern 
Africa.
   An environmental impact study commissioned by Sappi has recognised 
that the plantation could have serious negative impacts on the 
biodiversity and water resources of southern Maputo province and has 
recommended the planted area be reduced from 32 000 to 21 000 hectares 
so the bluegums can be kept away from rivers and inland lakes in the 
area. The study points out that the plantation, which could earn 
Mozambique some R80-million (about $23-million) a year and create 12 000 
new jobs (not all of them full-time), does not prevent other companies 
from implementing ecotourism programmes in the Elephant Park and on the 
Machangulo Peninsula.
   But Perrott will have none of this. The Blanchard proposal, he 
explains, could bring in an investment of $800-million and will create 
20 000 jobs in the long run. However, it depends on "critical mass", a 
realisation of the grand plan, and it cannot have a patch of bluegums in 
the middle of it.
   So James Ulysses Blanchard III has presented an ultimatum to the 
Mozambicans. He will not go ahead unless Sappi is out.
   Perrott's job is to persuade the local population and the media that 
his boss is right, which is why he is now in the middle of the bush with 
a chopper and a convoy of four-by-fours conducting an exercise in what 
the newspaper contingent on the trip dubbed the Texas School of 
Community Communication.
    While the local chief, his wife and two other volunteers from the 
village are taking a flip in the helicopter, the Texan begins dishing 
out colourful
   T-shirts with a huge map of southern Mozambique on the front 
proclaiming that the area is now a national park. The logo on the back 
says -- in English even though the villagers speak only Shangaan or 
Portuguese -- "Nix to water guzzling bluegums".
   Women, men and children scramble for the T-shirts while a group of 
men gather around Perrott and his Mozambican translator. "Tell them they 
gonna have shares in this project," says Perrott. "The elephants we 
bring here are gonna belong to them too. Now you tell them that in your 
best Shingaan (sic)."
   Perrott insists that a democratic approach is vital for conservation 
to work and that his company will treat the local communities as equal 
partners. "We're gonna put a fence up and make this place a national 
park and they will be able to choose. We gonna come here and say: 'Okay, 
now you're in a national park. Your village can either get fenced in or 
you can have them wild animals walking right through your main street'."
   Early in February the Cabinet will meet in Maputo to decide on the 
bluegum-plantation-versus-ecotheme-park row. The debate has become 
Mozambique's equivalent of the St Lucia controversy in South Africa and 
is likely to be the biggest and most complex economic decision the 
Mozambican government has ever had to make.
   Cabinet members appear divided on the issue. The agriculture ministry 
favours the plantation because it is ready to proceed and will bring 
immediate jobs to the depressed area. The environment ministry wants the 
ecotourism plan because the plantation will cause irreversible damage to 
Mozambican wildlife while it provides raw materials for the South 
African paper industry.
    Another source of concern in the Cabinet is that Blanchard -- a 
cold-war warrior from the 1980s with close links to far-right groups in 
the US --  has good friends in Renamo and also the Inkatha Freedom Party 
in KwaZulu-Natal.
   For the time being though, it appears that opinion in Maputo's 
government and intellectual circles is swinging Blanchard's way. The 
government will insist on a proper land-use plan and assurances that the 
ecotourism project will not be used to benefit Renamo during the next 
elections, or link up with seccessionist movements in KwaZulu-Natal. It 
also plans to set up a group of monitors to ensure that the rhetorical 
commitment to a partnership with the local landowners is put into 
practise.
   But it now seems that the man who once bankrolled a rebel army to 
wage a war of incredible destruction and brutality (the US State 
Department once described Renamo atrocities as worse than those of the 
Pol Pot regime in Cambodia) is likely to be rewarded with control over a 
huge chunk of Mozambique's richest province.
   It is just one of the many paradoxes that pervade this poor country. 
"To understand it," says one of the officials who works with Perrott on 
the project, "you must realise that Mozambique in the past hasn't had 
bulldozers that work. Now we have one that does."

Madonna Of The Margins

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Ricardo Dunn

   Johannesburg -  Mexican artist Frida Kahlo appears on T- shirts, 
calendars and in stage plays. Why are we so fascinated by her?
   Little Frida, a cafe catering to the lesbian and gay community in 
West Hollywood, is a shrine to the memory of Mexican cult-painter Frida 
Kahlo. Surrounded by neo-Mexican decor, inspired by Kahlo's house in 
Mexico City, you can even order a "Frida salad". Little Frida is but one 
outpost in a merchandising empire that churns out T-shirts, earrings, 
aprons, clocks, pins, calenders and posters bearing Kahlo's now world-
famous images. You might even come upon such fetishistic objects as 
Frida Kahlo masks.
   Kahlo's life has been documented in Spanish, English, German, French 
and Japanese. A number of serious biographies can be found on the 
shelves of bookshops and museums; one has even been written for 
children. She has been the subject of documentaries, feature films, 
stage plays -- a character becomes obsessed with her in Harry Kalmer's 
Frida Kahlo's Eyes, now running at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre -- 
numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing. In May 
1989 Elle magazine ran a 16-page feature on Kahlo as embodying the 
"spirit of Mexico", while in Vogue of February 1990 there was a 10-page 
interpretation of the "romance of Frida Kahlo". It comes as no surprise 
that Madonna has invested a sizeable sum in the hopes of bringing the 
Kahlo myth to the silver screen.
   So, who was Frida Kahlo? And what is it about this strikingly 
beautiful but tragically handicapped artist, who painted her life story 
on tin and masonite, that has inspired a huge cult following?
   Kahlo began painting as a teenager in Mexico City in the 1920s, while 
recovering from a near-fatal bus accident in which she was impaled on a 
metal pole. At 21 she married renowned muralist Diego Rivera. Although 
she lived in a conservative, patriarchal culture, and in the heyday of 
murals, when a woman making small, highly personal paintings could not 
win much respect, she valued her idiosyncratic talent. Kahlo challenged 
and refashioned social codes, sometimes by cross- dressing -- appearing 
in photographs or paintings in men's clothing -- or by montaging her 
head on to the bodies of male patriarchs.
   Her self-portraits express the burdens that weighed on her: 
unbearable physical pain, the grief that Rivera's affairs prompted, her 
homesickness when living abroad and her sorrow at not being able to bear 
a child.
   It is tempting to draw parallels between the tragic life of Van Gogh, 
an artist recently made "sexy" by the media, and that of Kahlo. But Van 
Gogh is known primarily for his work. In the case of Kahlo, the popular 
image is of the artist herself: the characteristic eyebrows which she 
connected to create the illusion of masculinity, the elaborate hair, the 
light moustache which she darkened, and, of course, the dressy Mexican 
traditional costumes which she adopted to affirm her identity and to 
hide her broken body. It is her appearance, not her art, that has graced 
the pages of Elle and Vogue.
   Despite Kahlo's larger-than-life standing, she painted less than 150 
pictures in her brief career, with barely half of them considered top-
notch. Admired by Picasso and adored by the Surrealists, she held only 
two shows during her lifetime. Today, prices for her works have 
skyrocketed to more than $3-million a piece.
   The current fascination with Kahlo began in the 1970s, when her work 
generated excitement in the women's liberation movement. But it was 
Hayden Harera's 1983 biography of Kahlo, simply titled Frida, which 
elevated the painter to the level of superstar. 
   Looking at Kahlo's contemporary appeal, Harera writes that '"as a 
Hispanic woman, a bisexual, an invalid and an artist, Kahlo had all the 
qualifications for a cult figure; she embodied everything not straight, 
male and Anglo ... For a people preoccupied with psychological health, 
fearful of Aids and appalled by drug abuse, the gritty strength with 
which she endured her illness is salutory. Although her painting records 
specific moments in her life, all who look at them feel that Frida is 
speaking directly to them."
   This, many say, has led to the representation of Kahlo as a kind of 
mascot of marginalisation. It is the portrayal of Kahlo as a victim that 
has encouraged the many myths that have been formulated around her. 
Stories of her childhood accident and her obsessive relationship with 
Rivera become more brutal and bizarre as they are retold. One story 
maintains that Kahlo's clothes were ripped from her body during the bus 
accident. As she lay naked, a bag of gold-dust that a fellow traveller 
was carrying split open and covered the artist's body. But it is not 
only devotees who have enjoyed fabricating fantastic twists to Kahlo's 
already unconventional life. The artist herself, although born in 1907, 
insisted she was born in 1910 -- the start of the Mexican Revolution. 
   So Kahlo herself contributed to her status as a symbol of cultural 
diversity -- a status some critics say has diluted the significance of 
her work. Yet by demystifying the work of Kahlo and other artists the 
privileged doors of the art world are opened to consumers of popular 
culture. In a 1992 travelling exhibition organised by the Studio Museum 
of Diego Rivera in Mexico City, a number of "Fridita" artists 
participated, while cross- dressing performance artists paid campy 
homage to Kahlo. Many gay artists find Kahlo, who paraded her liaisons 
with other women, a source of strength because of her unconventional 
approach to gender.
   Parodoxically, although Kahlo is considered a populist, she was 
intensely annoyed when she noticed that some of her admirers were 
attempting to adopt her meticulously constructed image. As early as 1933 
she was mocking: "... some of the gringa women are imitating me and 
trying to dress _ la Mexicana but the poor souls only look like cabbages 
and to tell the truth they look absolutely impossible".
   Frida Kahlo's Eyes is at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre until 
February 24

The Soprano Who Stole The Show

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Coenraad Visser

   Johannesburg - After Luciano Pavarotti's concert in early January, 
many were heard to wonder about Kathleen Cassello, the stunning young 
soprano who so completely stole the limelight at this event. Few were 
aware that it is almost exactly 10 years ago that she was a prizewinner 
in the Unisa International Singing Competition in Pretoria.
   Cassello took third place in what was arguably the best field ever 
assembled for this competition. Her fellow victors are also household 
names today: Sumi Jo is the queen of twittering coloratura sopranos, 
while Marilyn Mims is a regular at New York's Metropolitan Opera.
   Cassello, an American whose family hails from Naples, won a string of 
vocal competitions during the 1980s. As the 1985 winner of the Pavarotti 
Competition in Modena, she sang Musetta in Puccini's La Boheme with 
Pavarotti as Rudolfo. After her European debut the same year, she 
travelled the globe, giving more than 200 performances as the Queen of 
the Night in Mozart's Die Zauberflste. 
   Today she sings a wide repertoire, including all the major Mozart 
roles and Verdi heroines such as Leonora in Il Trovatore, Gilda in 
Rigoletto and Violetta in La Traviata. Her Gilda has already proved to 
be rather special: she made her La Scala debut in this role under the 
baton of Riccardo Muti, and was acclaimed last year when she sang as 
Gilda opposite the current tenor heartthrob, Roberto Alagna.
   On the evidence of her Pavarotti concert, Cassello (who, admirers 
will be sad to hear, has not yet made any recordings) is one of the most 
versatile sopranos around. In one evening she was a moving Mimi in 
Puccini's La Boheme, an agonising Violetta, and a powerful Lucia in 
Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.
   One can only hope someone from Pact Opera was there. A house that has 
been so unlucky in the repertoire in which Cassello excels will never be 
forgiven if it fails to secure the services of this exciting singer, in 
the early stages of what promises to be an astounding career.

Pavarotti Against All Odds

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   Johannesburg - They trampled through the dust in their droves to hear 
the rotund tenor from Modena: elderly matrons in bridesmaids' dresses, 
beautiful youngsters in cocktail minis and clumpy designer shoes, and 
sensible folk in gear more befitting the rugby stadium in which the 
concert was held. Inside, vendors of snacks and cold-drinks cried out 
their wares, seemingly oblivious to the occasion.
   Not even a brief downpour could dampen the determination of the 
assembled throng to hear their idol. A pity, then, that the 
circumstances should have been so unfavourable. Over a woefully 
inadequate sound system Pavarotti sounded like he was singing on a 
scratchy 78 recording; bad acoustic planning had the singers' voices 
echoing around the stadium, and the odd sound balance had the orchestra 
playing far away. And the giant television screens which were supposed 
to allow one a close-up view of the singers mostly flickered and went 
blank.
   How does one judge the quality of any performance under these 
circumstances? With great difficulty. What was clear was that, at 60, 
Pavarotti's voice is still in excellent condition when amplified and not 
subject to the strain of projecting without help in a big auditorium. 
One was struck by the ease of his delivery, by those hallmark top notes, 
and by his unique ability to sculpt the Italian texts exquisitely.
   On the other hand, there was frustration at the sameness of his 
characterisations and at his predictable recipe for pleasing the masses: 
his matter-of-fact vocal delivery, slightly rushed, with top notes being 
belted out for all their worth and sustained far longer than required by 
the composers. And then there was the surprising memory lapse in the 
middle of Che gelida manina, an aria he must have sung literally 
hundreds of times around the world.
   It was only in the closing Neapolitan songs and E lucevan le stelle 
from Puccini's Tosca that one heard a true artist at work.
   Rightly, the greatest applause was reserved for soprano Kathleen 
Cassello, who outsang and outacted her mentor in their duets and her 
solo excerpts. Her heartfelt E strano from La Traviata and closely 
characterised Si, mi chiamano Mimi from La Boheme brought the house 
down.
   Conductor Marco Armiliato impressed with his understanding of the 
various operatic styles on the programme. Unfortunately the same cannot 
be said for the ragged National Symphony Orchestra and the surprisingly 
hopeless SABC Choir and the Bonisudumo Choristers. Why bother with this 
odd collection, so clearly unfamiliar with operatic style, when there 
was a superb opera chorus and orchestra just down the road? It was, 
perhaps, simply another instance of bad -- should that be arrogant? ---
artistic judgment.

South Africa Reconsiders Exchange Controls

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Simon Segal 

   Johannesburg - Perhaps the most tricky decision facing South Africa's 
monetary authorities is when to lift exchange controls.
   It might be too slow for some, but South Africa has adopted a phased 
approach. The abolition of the financial rand system in March last year, 
the granting of limited permission for financial institutions to swap 
assets with foreign investors, and the Reserve Bank's (RB) phased 
withdrawal from the forward cover market all reconfirm the authorities' 
determination to liberalise South Africa's foreign exchange market and 
to create an investor-friendly environment for foreigners.
   Some see the smooth transition from the dual to a single currency 
system as an argument for the quick abolition of all exchange controls.
   But RB governor Chris Stals' firm conviction is that South Africa 
must first prepare the way and lead the country into a situation where 
the lifting of exchange controls is a non-event.
   The million-dollar question is when does South Africa reach this 
situation. Some feel that reserves have improved sufficiently and the 
exchange rate stabilised satisfactorily that the time is now right to 
lift exchange controls.
   Stals has said it will take to 1997 or 1998. He notes that backlogs 
have built-up for international diversification in the asset structure 
of South African investors and is concerned about the huge pent-up 
demand with institutional investors and managers of portfolio funds for 
some diversification into foreign assets. 
   As a start, since July last year, the RB is allowing insurance 
companies, pension funds, and unit trusts to invest abroad if the 
investment is swapped by a foreign investment in South Africa, thus 
leaving no net loss of foreign exchange reserves. By mid-November, the 
RB had approved asset swaps worth R5,6- billion.
   The RB is also reducing its role in the forward foreign exchange 
market where it allows banks a greater role. The RB's share of forward 
transactions fell from 18,5% in July to 14,2% in September and its 
short-term forward book dropped by $5,7-billion from the end of March to 
the end of November.
   Stals' cautious approach is based on the presumption that South 
Africa must first ensure greater stability in the underlying market 
forces before entrusting the determination of important prices to market 
forces.
   The RB's exchange rate policy is still one of a floating exchange 
rate system operating within the constraints of certain foreign exchange 
controls. In this situation, it is extremely difficult to assess the 
rand's level.
   Stals notes that in a new global environment, where exchange rates 
are determined by volatile capital movements, the conventional concepts 
of over/under-valued currencies, based on the principle of purchasing 
power parity, have little meaning. In today's world the rand can easily 
appreciate as a result of capital inflows despite a growing deficit on 
the current account.
   Ultimately, net capital inflows and a stable exchange rate cannot be 
achieved or maintained through superficial intervention or controls. 
There is no alternative for sound monetary, fiscal and other macro-
economic policies. International capital markets will be the 
adjudicators of these policies.
   In this regard, South Africa has virtually fully normalised its 
international financial relations and cannot ignore the norms and 
standards for financial discipline.
   Over the past year, South Africa has re- established normal relations 
with multi- national bodies such as the United Nations and the World 
Bank, and joined various international regional bodies such as the 
Organisation of African Unity and the African Development Bank. The 
country obtained various international credit ratings which enabled it 
to raise new funds on the international capital markets.

South African Currency on the Rise

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   Johannesburg - The rand has stabilised remarkably compared to those 
heady days over 1985 to 1993 when it was in a free-fall against all the 
world's major currencies.
   There are numerous ways of looking at a currency's value.
   The best measure is to consider its nominal effective value. This is 
an index comprising a basket of currencies weighted according to the 
value of transactions South Africa does in that currency.
   The Reserve Bank's index, with a base of 100 in 1990, averaged 81,25 
in 1993, 73,71 in 1994 and 69,52 in 1995, a depreciation of six percent 
which is not that different from the gap in the inflation rate between 
South Africa and its major trading partners. The index is currently at 
70.
   The real effective exchange rate of the rand, which is the nominal 
value adjusted for producer price differentials between South Africa and 
its trading partners, has barely changed from 98,66 in January 1995 to 
98,57 in September (the last available figure). In 1994, it averaged 
97,18.
   Over 1995, the rand depreciated by only two percent against the US 
dollar (nine percent in 1994), five percent against the British pound 
(10%), 11% against the Japanese yen (18%) and 16% against the German 
mark (11%).
   Compared to May when the rand was at its year's low, the currency has 
actually appreciated against the dollar (from 3,7 to 3,64 this week), 
the pound (5,9 to 5,62) and the mark (2,66 to 2,51).
   The average daily turnover rose from $4- billion in the last quarter 
of 1994 to $4,9- billion in the second quarter of 1995 and $5,2-billion 
in the third quarter.

South Africa Faces Public Sector Strikes in 1996

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Rowan Callaghan

   Johannesburg - A report on strike action in 1995 has shown that, 
despite disastrous predictions, there were less strikes last year than 
in previous years.
   Compiled by Andrew Levy and Associates, the report said that the 1995 
level was the lowest since 1988. But the industrial relations 
consultancy does not expect the same to happen this year.
   "With the new Labour Relations Act there will be a tendency to test 
its boundaries and this will cause an increase in strike action. It will 
become easier to go on strike," says Andrew Sparks of Andrew Levy & 
Associates. 
   According to the report an estimated 1,6- million mandays -- the 
number of workers multiplied by the number of days on strike -- - were 
lost to strikes in 1995. In 1994 the amount of mandays was 3,9-million 
while in 1993 it was 3,6-million mandays. 
   The main trigger causing strike action was found to be disputes over 
wages, "indicating the wide gap between expectations and delivery".
   "I think the reason there have been fewer days lost is because it 
seems as if there is an increased maturity between both parties, 
management and unions," comments Sparks.
   This maturity is not yet evident in the public sector and among state 
parastatals where the majority of strike action took place. 
   Sparks attributes this in part to the fact that strikes in these 
sectors were only allowed recently and "both management and workers are 
therefore relatively new to the negotiating process". 
   He is confident, however, that the maturity in the private sector 
would eventually spread to the public sector.
   However, he predicts that most of the strike action this year will 
still take place in the public sector for some time to come.

Satellite Group Plans Pan-African Links

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Leon Perlman

   Johannesburg - South Africa recently hosted a special meeting for 
Rascom, a pan-African satellite organisation dedicated to providing 
Africa with its own satellite for relaying telephone, data and 
television signals.
   African countries are paying up to R1,5- billion a year through 
obligatory routing of intra-African telephony traffic through Europe. 
   The 120-delegate meeting in Cape Town provided the first detailed 
implementation plan for pooling African satellite requirements, 
currently spread over some 11 Intelsat satellites.
   With the substantial loss of first-world country business to high-
capacity fibre optic cabling, Africa is seen by satellite companies as 
the next revenue growth point. 
   The first Afrocentric Rascom satellite, the R750-million Intelsat 
804, is under construction by Lockheed and is scheduled to be launched 
in the first quarter of 1997. 
   This should be followed by the launch of the Intelsat 805. Both 
satellites are expected to be launched into orbit by Chinese Long March 
rockets. 
   The 804 will provide high-power coverage of the entire African 
continent, South America, parts of Europe and the Middle East, and even 
the east coast of the United States. 
   "We aim to pool African resources to create a network for 17 African 
countries for their domestic television, data and telephony needs. We 
believe that the best way for Africa to be developed is via a regional 
approach to be able to show a market big enough to attract regional as 
well as international players," Intelsat group director Hamadoun Toure 
told the delegates.
   But while the 804 would pool the capacity needs of African nations 
currently served by some nine Intelsat spacecraft, Toure says that some 
services will not be moved -- primarily because of the need for costly 
upgrades to earth station equipment. 
   The capacity on the 804 -- which is still under construction -- is 
already swamped and another satellite will be ordered. The 805 will be 
the first dedicated land-mass African satellite, orbiting in geo-
stationary orbit above Zaire. 
   Many of the Rascom delegates expressed concern about funding for the 
project. Intelsat requires a prepayment of more than US$200- million. 
   Telkom's presence at the meeting surprised many observers considering 
it is not an official Rascom signatory. 
   However, the three Telkom representatives all played an active part 
in the deliberations. Most of the capacity on the proposed 805 satellite 
has already been requested by Telkom. 
   This appears to dovetail with Telkom's plans to integrate its planned 
South Africa to Far East (SAFE) fibre cable with the intra-African 
Rascom 805 satellite network. 
   Telkom is likely to contribute handsomely in proportion to its usage 
of the 804 and 805 satellites. It is the largest Intelsat user in Africa 
by far. 
   Sources in Rascom say that South Africa's official entry into the 
organisation will occur within months, if not weeks. They say that these 
assurances have been already been given by Telkom chairman Dikgang 
Moseneke.

Benin
Voodoo Receives Official Nod

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   BENIN - Africa's traditional ancestor worship and appeasement of the 
spirits is now officially fashionable in the small West African nation 
of Benin.
   The government of President Nicephore Soglo declared January 11 a 
national holiday to mark the recognition of voodoo as a religion. Voodoo 
is a religion based on belief in witchcraft and magical rites.
   Westerners still refer to voodoo variously as a "cult", "culture", 
"animistic" or "paganism".
   The curtain-raiser to the installation of voodoo as an officially 
recognised religion was the "Ouidah 92", the first festival of voodoo 
culture and arts which took place from February 8 to 18, 1993 in Ouidah 
some 45 kilometers west of Benin's capital, Cotonou.
   At the time, the organisers of the international event which was 
opened by President Soglo, took care to suppress the religious basis of 
voodoo.
   He was accompanied by two high priests of voodoo - Sossa Guedehongue 
and Dagbo Hounon.  It was a carnival affair.
   At the inauguration of the festival, President Soglo emphasised that 
voodoo was the common link between Benin -- indeed the whole of the west 
coast of Africa that had provided the slaves during the era of slave 
trade -- and the black diaspora of the Americas and the Caribbean.  Many 
of the guests came from Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago and West Africa.
   The President pointed out that at least 4 million out of Benin's 7.5 
million people worship ancestors or spirits at one time or another. 
Those are clearly staggering figures for a country that is regarded 
mainly Catholic, with Islam considered the second mainstream religion.
   Benin is a poor country whose economy was ruined by the misguided 
marxist military dictatorship of former ruler Matthew Kerokou.
   By 1990, 40,000 civil servants had not been paid their salaries for 
at least six months.  Yet by 1992/1993 so highly regarded was the voodoo 
festival that the government undertook to pay CFA francs 400 million (US 
dollars 800,000) of the CFA francs 800 million (US dollars 1.6 million) 
budget for the whole extravaganza.  France offered about CFA francs 100 
million.  The rest of the money came from the diaspora.
   Soglo claims 3 million Beninois or descendants of Beninois, migrated 
abroad either by the effects of slavery in the 18th Century or in later 
years.
   Voodoo preceded slavery on the west coast of Africa by three 
centuries.  The practice thrived in West Africa by the 15th century.
   Alan Anderson of the Centre for the Study of New religions in 
Birmingham, United Kingdom says Beninois are not alone in the practice 
of voodoo.
   "Voodoo is the traditional religion of West Africa," he emphasised. 
It was suppressed in the colonial period when it was equated with 
witchcraft and it continued to be sensationalised by magazines and 
Western writers in modern times.
   One of the prominent aspects of voodoo is appeasement of spirits 
through sacrificial offerings of children and domestic animals. 
Traditional liquor is offered as "libation" for the purpose.
   It is not yet clear how the Catholic Church in Benin views the latest 
developments.  Officially it has the largest number of followers of any 
one religion in the country.
   However it is interesting to note that the head of the Roman Catholic 
Church, Pope John Paul II, during his most recent visit to Africa last 
September, remarked about the similarity between the Communion with 
Saints in Catholicism and ancestor worship in African religions.
   Indeed, at the Resurrection Gardens in Nairobi, the Pope received an 
African traditional priest who officially blessed him.
   Dr. Anderson points out that African traditional religions are being 
revived in many places in Africa.  Very often, traditional religions and 
Christianity exist side by side in Africa.

Kenya
Milk Cooperative In Dire Straits

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   NAIROBI - The giant Kenya Co-operative Creameries (KCC), is broke and 
cannot pay farmers over Kshs.1.5 billion (US$.27 million) owed them for 
deliveries made since August 1994, the Minister for Agriculture, 
Livestock Development and Marketing Mr. Simeon Nyachae admitted in a 
press statement on January 16.
   Minister Nyachae noted that a total restructuring was necessary if 
KCC was to be rescued.  "There is need to re-formulate the future role 
of KCC in the short and long-term," Nyachae said in the press statement.  
"KCC continues to pay over Kshs.30 million (US$ 54,000) interest per 
month for its overdraft and farmers are not being paid," said the 
Minister.
   The Agriculture Minister added; "In the short-term , this would mean 
immediate selling of stocks to pay farmers and clear the overdraft, 
overhaul the management, and introduce a new pricing system to take care 
of both domestic and external markets."
   About the medium and long-term plans for saving KCC from imminent 
collapse Nyachae said that there was need to legally establish the 
status of KCC and "hand over the responsibility (of running it) to the 
original owners (farmers) who can decide to run it either as a co-
operative or a company."
   The giant dairy farmers' organisation is said to be holding rotting 
products worth Kshs.2.4 billion (US$50 million) in its store.  The items 
cannot be sold either locally or abroad due to "poor management and poor 
marketing strategies."
   A section of the local press reported that the "cash strapped Kenya 
Co-operative Creameries has in the past sabotaged private individuals 
out to market the company's products out."  It further said that the 
organisation was receiving 800,000 litres of milk daily but was able to 
sell only 500,000 litres, with the rest going to waste.
   Kenya Farmers Association (KFA) Chairman, Mr Mark Too also called for 
the immediate decentralization of the KCC.  He said that farmers and the 
public have been kept in the dark about the operations of KCC. "Previous 
directors used their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of 
farmers," he added.
   Since its inception in 1925, the Kenya Co-operative Creameries has 
grown to become a monopoly in dairy processing and distribution in 
Kenya.  Today, KCC is the oldest and largest co-operative society with 
more than 40,000 members in the country.  It operates 11 collecting 
centres, 11 processing factories and has workforce of well over 4,000 
employees.
   In 1968 the Kenya government rationalised milk distribution by 
withdrawing operating licenses from KCC's main competitors thus giving 
it monopoly.
   For the next decade KCC was rapidly expanded through provision of 
government loans and government guaranteed external loans.  In 1980, the 
company surplus reportedly started declining and in 1987 KCC started 
experiencing loses altogether.
   Between May 25, 1989 and August 9, 1991 KCC was managed by a 
government appointed management commission, following an outcry from 
dairy farmers about mismanagement of their organisation and an appeal 
from them to save it from imminent collapse.  The commission was also 
enjoined to write a prescriptive report which is yet to be made public.
   In the second half of 1994, KCC started experiencing serious 
financial and management problems and the government appointed a task 
force in May 1995 which has run the dairy firm to date under the parent 
Ministry of Co-operative Development.
   Meanwhile dairy farmers across the country have added their voices to 
the nationwide condemnation of KCC's management.  Dairy farmers from the 
North Rift region, one of the leading milk producing parts of the 
country, are reported to have "called for the total overhaul of KCC 
management and disbanding of the appointed Task Force."
   "The government should restructure KCC with the aim to streamline its 
operations to reduce overhead costs and have the current Task Force 
disbanded," Richard Barkoyet, one of the farmers' representatives said.
   Commenting on the cash strapped KCC, the Chairman of the Kenya 
Farmers' Association Mr. Mark Too said; "I can only compare KCC to a 
vehicle which veers off into a ravine.  You need a broader perspective 
to rescue what remained of it than the usual cranes."

Uganda
Cardinal Attacks Tax System

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   KAMPALA - The head of the Uganda Catholic Church Cardinal Emmanuel 
Wamala has attacked the country's tax authority saying it is "anti-
people".
   Speaking during the launching of the Catholic Church-owned Nsambya 
Hospital Development Fund in the Ugandan capital on January 15, Cardinal 
Wamala decried the "brutal high taxation of medicines and other 
essential Ugandan imports".
   Cardinal Wamala told Christians at the function presided over by 
President Yoweri Museveni; "Taxation should be aimed at improving the 
well being of common people --- but to tax medicines meant to save their 
lives is not only making their lives difficult but condemning them to 
death."
   Cardinal Wamala's remarks come at a time when the Ugandan business 
community is complaining about high tax rates in the basically import 
oriented economy of this East African country.
   The Chairman of Uganda Importers, Exporters and Traders Association 
Captain Mike Mukula, told President Museveni during a meeting he held 
with the association on January 16 that the Anti-Smuggling Unit of 
Uganda's tax body is so high-handed that it confiscates a loaf of bread 
from a poor Ugandan simply because he has bought it from neighbouring 
Kenya, where 90 per cent of Uganda's manufactured goods are imported 
from.
   But President Museveni defended his government's tax policy saying it 
is meant to protect up-coming Ugandan industries from foreign products.

Ghana
Religious Leaders Intervene in Presidential Row

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   ACCRA - Religious leaders in Ghana announced on January 16 they had 
met Vice-President Kow Arkaah in a move to heal the deepening rift 
between him and President Jerry Rawlings.
   The row between the two men, rooted in a split between the formerly 
allied political parties they respectively lead, came to a head when 
Arkaah accused Rawlings of punching him during a December 28 cabinet 
meeting.
   Rawlings has since repeatedly and publicly suggested that Ghana's 
parliament should find a way to get rid of Arkaah, but Arkaah has said 
he would not bow out voluntarily under any circumstances since the 
president has no power to sack him.
   But two dozen leaders from six religious bodies, including Ghana's 
Catholic Bishops' Conference, the Council of Independent Churches and 
the Federation  of Muslim Councils, met Arkaah on January 15 to work 
towards resolving the dispute.
   The delegation's spokesman and general secretary of the Christian 
Council of Ghana, David Asante Dartey, said the six bodies were very 
concerned about the rift and wanted to ensure the prevailing peace in 
the country is not threatened.
   Dartey commended Arkaah's prompt response to the delegation's request 
for an audience and said a similar request had been made to the 
president.
   "It is because of my love for peace and conviction in finding a 
lasting solution to the country's problems that I consented to meet the 
religious bodies," Arkaah said of the meeting.
   Before the alleged attack, Arkaah had claimed cabinet meetings were a 
focus for high-level corruption in Ghana.
   According to the official version of events, Rawlings did not assault 
the Vice-President, but simply pushed him to encourage his departure 
from the meeting on account of the insults he had allegedly made.
   The intervention by the religious leaders came shortly after Arkaah, 
who had accused Rawlings of punching him during the cabinet meeting, 
boycotted the opening of Parliament on January 12.
   "It would appear as if I offer myself as a punching bag to offer 
someone political enhancement," Arkaah said, referring to "insults" from 
Rawlings and his supporters which followed Arkaah's allegation that the 
President had punched him in full view of ministers during the December 
28 cabinet meeting.
   "Today's occasion was one only for the president to make a statement, 
just like last January 8 parade. I attended the parade and was subjected 
to a tirade of insults without the opportunity to exercise the right of 
reply, so I wanted to avoid a repetition," Arkaah said.
   During anniversary celebrations on January 8, Rawlings said of 
Arkaah:  "He tends to subvert the government from within."
   During his 90-minute address on January 12, Rawlings repeated a 
suggestion made on January 8 that Parliament should find a way to sack 
the vice president.

Burundi
Tutsi Extremists Bring Capital To A Standstill

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   BURUNDI - Extremists from Burundi's Tutsi minority brought business 
in the capital Bujumbura to a standstill on January 16, the second day 
of a strike launched to force President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya to 
resign.
   Despite a major deployment by crack army troops, residents of the 
troubled city appeared unwilling to go to work for fear of ethnic 
clashes, and banks, many offices and public services did not open their 
doors.
   The standstill was brought about without violence by a Tutsi 
movement, Youth Solidarity for the Defence of Minorities (SOJEDEM), led 
by Deo Niyonzima and Tutsi extremist organisations, which accuse 
Ntibantunganya, a Hutu in charge of a shaky coalition, of conniving with 
Hutu extremist gangs fighting a guerrilla war against the Tutsi- 
dominated army.
   With its turnout early last week the army clearly distanced itself 
from the extremists, but it is frequently accused of collaborating with 
them in the small central African highland nation, where relief workers 
estimate that ethnic killings claim about 30 lives every day.
   Hardliners in the main Tutsi opposition party, the Union for National 
Progress (UPRONA), had also planned to hold a demonstration in front of 
the party's headquarters, which were under tight military security.
   UPRONA radicals want their party to withdraw confidence in 
Ntibantunganya and pull out of the coalition and the national assembly, 
formed in September 1994 in a bid to stave off mass bloodletting between 
Tutsis and Hutus.
   Burundi, like neighbouring Rwanda, is a powderkeg where 50,000 people 
were massacred after the first elected Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, 
was killed in a foiled military coup in October 1993, which the then 
government survived.
   On January 15, diplomats said the authorities had put up a remarkably 
united front against the Tutsis, but the extremists gained ground the 
next day despite an overnight warning from Defence Minister, Lieutenant-
Colonel Firmin Sinzoyiheba, who said he put the Tutsi extremists in the 
same basket as "those who wreck bridges, sabotage power lines and water 
supplies -- all those whom we are fighting."
   For three months, Bujumbura has been without electricity and has also 
seen water stoppages caused by sabotage.  The Defence Minister called on 
the security forces, which have taken a battering from Hutu extremists 
in attacks to "act with firmness, lucidity and serenity".

Uganda
Commission To Probe Church Diocese

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   UGANDA - The Church of Uganda has set up a commission to probe the 
alleged mismanagement of funds in the south western Anglican Diocese of 
Mityana.
   The Bishop of the diocese, the Right Rev. Wilson Mutebi on January 16 
announced that the commission will investigate failure by the diocese to 
meet its financial obligations during the past seven years.
   "It will assist the church to find out whether the problem is with 
priests, Christians or the administration at the diocese" the Bishop 
said.
   He also announced the suspension of his diocesan secretary Rev. Canon 
Samuel Kamya who allegedly failed to account for US dollars 7,000.
   The bishop's revelations follow a recent declaration by Church of 
Uganda Archbishop Livingstone Nkoyoyo to the effect that the church 
would take action against "corrupt and inefficient bishops".
   Church of Uganda officials say this announcement by the Anglican 
Archbishop was facilitated by the amendment of the church's constitution 
"empowering" the Anglican prelate to discipline bishops in the wrong and 
take overall charge of the Church affairs.
   Anglican Christians here see the move as a result of widespread 
dissent in the church over alleged corruption and abuse of power by 
church officials.
   Although Archbishop Nkoyoyo did not cite any concrete examples, it is 
generally believed that he was targeting the Church of Uganda eastern 
diocese of Busoga where some Christians have accused their Bishop 
Cyprian Bamwoze of mismanagement of funds and church affairs.

Ethiopia
Rebels Broadcast From Former Soviet Union

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   NAIROBI -  A rebel Ethiopian group is using a radio transmitter in 
the former Soviet Union to broadcast propaganda against the Addis Ababa 
regime of Meles Zenawi.
   The transmissions are on shortwave frequencies and appear to have 
started in early January. According to a spokesman for the British 
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) East African radio monitoring facility in 
Nairobi, Kenya, the Oromo Liberation Front started the evening 
transmission early this year after the apparent discontinuation of their 
broadcasts from transmitters in the United States where they were first 
monitored last year.  Such broadcasts are illegal in the US.
   The BBC monitoring facility believes the radio station is based in 
the Ukraine "where there is a lot of spare transmission capacity at the 
moment."  The contact address for the station is given as Berlin, 
Germany.
   The shortwave signal is described as "good though somewhat noisy."
   The rebel station does not put out news broadcasts, though it carries 
strongly worded commentaries, critical of the government in Addis Ababa.  
Despite the mid-1995 devolution of power to the provinces that allowed 
the various regions in Ethiopia to enjoy autonomy, the radio accuses the 
Tigrean people - the tribe of the executive Prime Minister, Meles 
Zenawi, of taking the rest of the country for a ride.
   Some correspondence is also read on the radio.  One letter asked why 
there are no battle reports on the broadcasts giving information about 
the war waged in Oromia by the Oromo Liberation Front.  The presenter 
promised that battle reports should be expected in the near future.
   The Oromo people are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia (indeed in 
Africa) with a population of 30 million of Ethiopia's 55 million strong 
population.
   The geographical location of Oromia, (homeland of the Oromo) is 
southern Ethiopia.  It covers more than 500,000 square kilometres of the 
territory - double the size of the United Kingdom.
   Many Oromos say successive Ethiopian regimes dating back to 
Abyssinian King Menelik II, in the 1880s, looked down on or segregated 
Oromo people.

Zimbabwe
Catholic Church Refuses To Register Its Own 

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   HARARE - The Roman Catholic Church in Zimbabwe has refused to 
register its relief agency, the Catholic Development Commission (CADEC), 
under a controversial new law, the Zimbabwe News Agency (ZIANA) reported 
here on January 16.
   Church spokesman Oskar Wermter told ZIANA that Catholic bishops were 
unhappy that the new act, which sailed through parliament last year gave 
a cabinet minister absolute powers over non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) without providing any legal recourse.
   "The bishops are unhappy with the act, which gives the minister 
enormous powers and there is no legal redress," Wermter said.
   "Voluntary organisations cannot defend themselves even if the 
minister receives false information.  Natural justice demands that there 
is recourse to law," he added.
   The church warned that if it is pressurised to register, it will 
challenge the matter in court to determine the constitutionality of the 
Private Voluntary Organisations Act, an amendment of the 1974 Welfare 
Act designed to monitor NGOs.
   When the bill was  enacted, many NGOs were concerned but reacted 
cautiously, though of late some have openly criticised the act, which 
puts them under the direct scrutiny of the government.
   The Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS) last month said 
that the act went far beyond legitimate oversight of NGOs by the 
government, threatening their independence and opening the way to 
governmental abuse and corruption.
   ZIMRIGHTS said the new law allowed the Public Service, Labour and 
Social Welfare Minister to take over the running of NGOs on a number of 
"vague and ill-defined" grounds.
   The human rights organisation said that members of NGOs could now 
easily be "suppressed" for criticising actions taken by the government 
and the new law "is intended to serve as a club against outspoken NGOs 
in the future."
   A number of international NGOs operate in Zimbabwe, providing relief 
and development programmes.
   Meanwhile, Zimbabwe's former Prime Minister Bishop Abel Muzorewa 
launched his campaign for the March presidential elections on January 17 
with a vitriolic attack on President Robert Mugabe, likening him to "a 
cruel, drunken father."
   Muzorewa, 71, who was prime minister briefly before independence in 
1980, said he had returned to active politics because he was "shocked 
and heartbroken by the abortion of our independent nationhood at the 
hands of Mugabe and his associates."
   He accused Mugabe and his ruling Zimbabwe African National Union- 
Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party of "instilling fear among people of all 
races in Zimbabwe, so that they now live and behave like rats that have 
been chased by cats all day."
   Muzorewa is one of only two challengers who have announced their 
intention to run against Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly 16 
years.  The other is the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, who faces trial in 
February on charges of plotting to kill Mugabe and overthrow the 
government.
   All three men, in their 70s, are veterans of the nationalist struggle 
that ousted the white-minority government of Ian Smith in the 1970s.
   Sithole's ZANU-Ndonga party currently holds two seats in the 150-seat 
parliament, while Muzorewa will be standing as a candidate for the 
United Parties (UP), a coalition of opposition groups which has no MPs.
   Muzorewa, a Methodist bishop and conservative politician, served in 
parliament for four years after independence but was arrested in 1984 on 
security charges.
   He was released before elections in 1985, but after his party failed 
to secure a single seat he quit politics. Speaking on January 17 at a 
news conference here which was packed with his supporters but with 
government-controlled television noticeably absent, Muzorewa said 
corruption and mismanagement since independence had plunged Zimbabwe 
into the "worst poverty and worst unemployment ever experienced."
   Muzorewa pointed to Mugabe's recent salary increase of 100 per cent 
at a time of economic hardships and steep rises in the cost of staple 
foodstuffs as a sign of the government's arrogance and insensitivity.

Kenya
Methodist Church Consecrates First Woman Bishop

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   NAIROBI - The Rev. Maureen Elizabeth Jones made history on January 14 
by becoming the first woman bishop in the African continent.
   She was consecrated Bishop of the Methodist Church in Kenya at St. 
Peter's Methodist Church, Langata, in the outskirts of Kenya's capital, 
Nairobi.  The ceremony was conducted by Presiding Bishop of the 
Methodist Church in Kenya, Bishop Zablon Nthamburi.
   Bishop Jones, who was born in the small town of Stamford, 
Lincolnshire, England on May 24, 1939, arrived in Kenya in January 1969 
as a lay woman worker.  She was initially based in the Tana River and 
Lamu Districts in the Coastal Province.
   Rev. Jones recalls that she worked with women and children in that 
region "in the field of development, both physical and spiritual."
   After five years of service she proceeded to St. Paul's United 
Theological College, Limuru, to help in the training of pastors' wives.  
In 1976 she went for theological training "and preparation for the 
ordained ministry" at Bristol College in the United Kingdom.
   Rev. Jones returned to Kenya at the invitation of the Methodist 
Church of Kenya in July 1979, served as a minister on probation for one 
year and was ordained in the "ministry of Word and Sacrament" in June 
1980.
   She served as a minister at the Kariokor Methodist Church up to 1985. 
In 1986 she was transferred to Kariji Circuit in Pwani (Coast) Synod 
where she worked for the next seven years.  In 1993 she was transferred 
to the Langata Circuit.
   Asked what she felt after beating three other male contestants, Rev. 
Jones told APS; "To be honest, I did not expect it....I am very moved 
and very honoured."
   A congregant pointed out that Rev. Jones garnered the 83 votes, half 
of all the votes cast because "she is very dedicated to her work and 
very sensitive to the needs of her congregation."
   Rev. Jones said that working as a bishop, and particularly as a white 
female bishop among blacks does not make her feel discriminated against.  
"I have lived with these people for many years and I have never felt 
discriminated against," she added.
   The history of the Methodist Church in Kenya goes back 133 years when 
three missionaries of the United Methodist Free Churches arrived in the 
country.  Thomas Wakefield, James Woolner and Dr. Ludwig Krapf planted 
the first Methodist Church at Rabai, on Kenya's coast in July 1882.
   Later, the church moved to the interior of Kenya arriving in Meru, 
Eastern province in 1910.  In 1967 the Methodist Church of Kenya became 
autonomous.  Soon after, it opened missions in Northern Kenya (1967), 
Western Kenya (1973) and Kwale-Coast- (1977).
   In 1994 the church launched an insurance brokerage firm and is 
currently in the process of establishing a full fledged university. The 
Methodist Church in Kenya has a following of some 650,000 faithful.
   Before coming to Kenya, Rev. Maureen Elizabeth Jones trained and 
worked as a social worker in the United Kingdom.  She says that she 
worked "with deprived and disabled children" for 11 years. "I have a 
great love for young people and this has very much influenced the shape 
of my ministry here in Kenya," she told APS.

Chad
Peace Talks Collapse

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   FRANCEVILLE, GABON - Round-table talks on the political future of 
Chad ended in failure here on January 9 after most of the armed rebel 
groups present refused to sign a framework document to end civil strife 
and install a democratic system in Chad.
   Gabonese President Omar Bongo was forced to put an end to the meeting 
late on January 9 after the document failed to win enough backing.
   "Since you say 'No' then I want the discussions to stop there," Bongo 
told participants at the meeting, which finally started on January 6, 
six hours late, with the aim of ending 30 years of civil war in Chad and 
bringing the Chadian rebels into the democratisation and election 
process now underway.
   The meeting grouped representatives of the Chadian government, legal 
political parties, trade unions, various associations and armed 
opposition groups, plus mediators and international observers.
   The final document was read out to the participants by Gabonese 
Foreign Minister Casimir Oye Mba, then signed by Bongo, Chadian 
President Idriss Deby and President Ange-Felix Patasse of the Central 
African Republic and Mahamane Ousmane of Niger.
   Most of the 12 representatives of legalised parties signed the text, 
but some abstained along with several representatives of associations 
and trade unions.
   But out of the 15 armed opposition groups present, 13 refused to 
sign, while the two groups which signed were a faction of the Movement 
for Democracy and Development represented by Moussa Medella and a 
recently-created group called AFUD, about which no information was 
available.
   Most of the opposing groups wanted detailed discussions between them 
before a text could be agreed on and signed, contrary to signing a 
document followed by discussions.
   But when some of the rebel participants called for the resignation of 
Chadian President Deby, Bongo accused them of coming to Franceville "to 
sabotage the round-table talks."
   Bongo's text had called on all signatories to renounce use of force 
to conquer and keep power and appealed to them to uphold democratic 
processes as the only path to a lasting political settlement in Chad.
   It also called for immediate ceasefire and amnesty, for armed groups 
to be transformed into political parties and for defence and security 
forces to be reorganised "along republican lines."
   The meeting was originally scheduled for last December but had to be 
postponed amid disagreements over the participants from the Chadian 
side.  All 58 legal political parties in the country wanted to be 
represented as did the guerrilla groups, which total 15 according to 
Chadian Prime Minister Djimasta Koibla.  Chad has a population of some 
5.5 million people.
   Finally it was agreed that the political parties would be grouped, 
sharing a total of 10 representatives.  Some protested, demanding a 
greater role, but none refused to take part.
   The Gabonese government sent envoys to Chad itself, to Benin, Libya 
and Algeria to involve the armed groups, while Djimasta Koibla visited 
Chad's neighbours, including the Central African Republic, Cameroon and 
Nigeria.
   The Chadian Premier said the government's aim was to get the external 
opposition leaders to return to the country and take part in the normal 
political process.

Sierra Leone
Ousted Leader Flown To Guinea

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   FREETOWN - Military head of State Captain Valentine Strasser of 
Sierra Leone was ousted in a palace coup on January 16 and replaced by 
his deputy and armed forces chief.
   Reports say the 29-year-old Strasser was immediately flown by 
helicopter to neighbouring Guinea (in handcuffs), together with his wife 
and children.  Captain Strasser now joins the man he overthrew at the 
end of April 1992, former President Joseph Momoh, who also lives in 
exile in Guinea.
   Meanwhile, the Sierra Leonean government has asked Ghana to grant 
Captain Strasser political asylum and Ghanaian authorities say the 
request is under consideration.  Sierra Leone state radio announced that 
the new leader Brigadier Julius Maada Bio, has imposed a dusk to dawn 
curfew.
   Another report says the new leader of the National Provisional Ruling 
Council (NPRC) has sacked all government officials seen to be actively 
involved in party politics.
   Director of Defence Information, Lieutenant Colonel Karifa Kargbo, 
who made the radio announcement, accused Strasser of wanting to cling to 
power.  "Captain Strasser has been removed from office and has safely 
left these shores due to his blatant attempts to implement legislation 
intended to be harmful to the democratic process," Kargbo was quoted 
saying.
   Although diplomats remain sceptical of Brigadier Bio's motive, the 
new NPRC leader has announced in his first national radio broadcast that 
elections scheduled for February 26 will go ahead as planned to return 
the country to democratic civilian rule.
   He also called on the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of Foday 
Sankoh, which has been fighting the government since 1991, to come to 
the negotiating table without pre-conditions.  Brigadier Bio promised 
the rebels a general amnesty and urged them to participate in the 
forthcoming elections.

Zambia
Society Campaigns For Widow's Rights

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by APS Correspondent

   Nairobi - Most human beings are somehow familiar with the feeling of 
utter loss when a family loses a beloved member.  But not every bereaved 
family experiences the combined anguish of the absence of a breadwinner 
and disappearance of family property, thanks to practices that demand 
that relatives also "inherit" movable belongings left behind by the dead 
person.  Widows in Zambia, under the umbrella of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church have formed a society that is fighting for the rights of widows, 
widowers and their children.
   For Charity Changwe, there was nothing wrong with the decision made 
by her in-laws to shift the funeral gathering of her late husband from 
her flatlet in Kamenza township to the residence of the deceased's elder 
brother in the mine township, about two kilometres away in the same 
Zambian town of Chililabombwe.
   After  all, like other countries in Africa, it is a common tradition 
among Zambian communities to hold lugubrious meetings at the house of 
the eldest member of the surviving family in a given locality.  In 
addition, the company flatlet Changwe shared with her late husband, 
Chris, a surveyor with the giant Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) 
at the time of his death in hospital on June 26, 1993, was unsuitable 
for the funeral gathering which demands a log-fire in the yard.
   But little did Changwe know she had been tricked.  For, on return to 
her flatlet a week after interring Chris at Kakoso Cemetery, she found 
all the goods missing from the house.  She could not believe the sight 
of her house which now resembled a playground.
   Sofasets, dinning table and chairs, a fridge, two beds and 
mattresses, and other household goods were no longer there.  She was 
heart broken for the second time in a week.
   "I learnt later that on June 29 while we were burying Chris,some men 
went to the house with a lorry and took all the goods.  My neighbours 
thought I was shifting from the flat since my husband had passed away," 
Changwe told a stunned seminar on the plight of widows and their 
children, held recently in Chililabombwe about 400 kilometres north of 
the Zambian capital, Lusaka.
   To date, she has never seen the goods and efforts to recover anything 
including the fridge bought from her earnings as a ZCCM mine police 
constable, failed.
   But this young widow is not alone in her predicament.  Many in this 
Southern African country continue to endure untold suffering at the 
hands of in-laws, despite the enactment by Parliament of the Laws of 
Intestate Succession Act and the Wills and Administration of Testate 
Estates Act, aimed at protecting widows, widowers and their surviving 
children after the death of their bread winner.
   According to the Intestate Succession Act which deals with the 
distribution of property in a situation where the deceased left no will, 
the widow or widower is entitled to 20 per cent of the property, 50 per 
cent goes to the children, the other 20 per cent to the deceased's 
parents while the remaining ten per cent is given to the dependants, who 
in this case is the person or persons who are/were maintained by the 
deceased immediately before death.
   The Wills and Administration of Testate simplifies the making of a 
will and provides for adequate financial and other provisions to be made 
in a will.
   However, the continued suffering of widows and their children is the 
concern of many sympathisers in Zambia and more so fellow women who 
congregate under the Women Missionary Society of the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in Chililabombwe.
   With funds from America's Southern University Democratic Governance 
Project, the women have launched a public awareness campaign "aimed at 
conscietising the general public and challenging every wing of society 
through seminars to join in the campaign to fight against wide-spread 
property grabbing and ill-treatment of widows and orphans," says 
campaign co-ordinator, Rev. Paul Bupe.
   Rev. Bupe says no matter how some people might try to justify this 
scourge of ill-treatment of widows, the practice remains evil in the 
eyes of God.
   "This cruel act is condemned from the religious point of view.  What 
the Bible has established let no culture or tradition change, says Bupe 
who supports his statement by quoting from Exodus 22:22:24 in which God 
disapproves the act:  "Do not ill-treat any widow or orphan, if you do, 
I, the Lord will answer them when they cry out to me for help and I will 
be angry and kill you.  Your wives will become widows and your children 
will be fatherless."
   Ironically, according to Rev. Bupe's observations, Christians are in 
the forefront in disobeying God's ruling, in most cases on a woman- 
against-woman basis.
   It is the women who make widows crawl on their knees on hard ground 
for a long distance and smear them with mud and mealie meal (paste from 
maize meal) on the eve of the burial of their late spouses. Helpless 
widows are abused in the name of cleansing, God forbid with HIV lurking.
   Opening the seminar, Deputy - Mayor of Chililabombwe, Mr. Curp Mwaba 
said lack of public information on the law of succession is responsible 
for the suffering of widows.
   "Property grabbing and other forms of ill-treatment of widows is as 
cancerous as AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and must also 
equally receive corresponding attention," Mr. Mwaba said.
   Seminar participants had different views when they cited poverty as 
one of the causes of property grabbing.  "Many people have turned the 
death of a relative to be a means of gain.  Like vultures, relatives 
wait patiently for the demise of a wealthy kin in order to share all his 
property at the expense of the widow and orphans," a participant said.
   Some said jealous sisters of the deceased often exhibit the most 
hostile attitude towards the widow because they think they are closer to 
their brother and regard the widow as a stranger.  Such sisters seize 
the opportunity at funerals to vent out their revenge on the hapless 
widow especially when she did not receive them well and cared for them 
when their brother was alive.
   Another argued that the situation can be unpleasant in cases where 
marriages of the sisters were not stable whereas that of the deceased 
brother was smooth.  It is worse in strained marital relations whereby 
the widow ends up being blamed for the death of her husband. This is 
worsened by the belief that "culture demands" that the widow be 
mistreated.
   However, the participants were unanimous that there is no specific 
yardstick for mistreating widows.  They singled out ignorance about the 
law of succession among the victims, perpetrators and the law 
enforcement officers as being major contributing factors to the problem.
   As Changwe admits; "I had no idea at the time of my husband's death 
that laws exist in Zambia to protect widows.  Otherwise, I should have 
taken the matter to the magistrates court for redress after the police 
turned me away saying the issue was civil and that it should be dealt 
with domestically between my family and in-laws."
   And, considering that she was five-months pregnant with her first 
born child, Changwe also feared she would prematurely lose this valuable 
gift from God in questionable circumstances.  She felt unsafe to 
antagonise her in-laws over her goods.
   "Although I was neither physically harassed nor sexually abused, fear 
of witch-craft grew in intensity when my pregnancy went beyond nine 
months.  I gave birth to a baby girl in the eleventh month," she 
revealed.
   In his contribution to the debate, Chililabombwe Magistrate, Mr. 
Kaengele Mulenga criticised the conduct of the law enforcement officers 
for displaying ignorance about the law of succession when they are 
supposed to be knowledgeable.
   "In many cases, the police turn away victims reporting the loss of 
their property believing the matter is of civil nature.  This is not the 
case as this is a criminal offence which carries custodial sentences for 
the guilty," he said.
   According to Mr. Mulenga, a person found guilty under the law of 
succession can either be fined a maximum of Kwacha 500,000 (about US 
dollars 590) or get a jail sentence of three years with hard labour or 
both fine and imprisonment as the court might determine.
   He suggested that police officers under-go orientation courses on 
succession statutes in order for them to deal with widows' complaints 
fairly.
   Seminar participants who included civil servants, mine and Zambia 
police officers, the clergy and widows also blamed weak and biased 
administrators in the distribution of property and corrupt local court 
justices for the disparities in the dispensation of cases of this 
nature.
   "When a family has a principled and well respected person, very often 
the administration of property is done according to the law and the 
widow is protected and cared for," they observed.
   Unlike other widows, Changwe's employment as a mine police constable, 
helped her recover from the shock of losing her property. She is now 
happily settled in a two-bedroomed ZCCM house in the mine township 
raising her daughter now aged over two years.
   Her advice to potential widows is: "Be brave and have no fear of 
witch-craft.  Take property-grabbing in-laws to court if need be." Some 
timely advice indeed.

Angola
Combatants Agree On Troop Encampment

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by APS Correspondent

   Luanda - After two-months break in the Angolan peace process, coupled 
with several incidents of ceasefire violations, the Angolan government 
and UNITA rebels have taken a major step forward with an agreement on 
the new composition of the army and the encampment of their excess 
guerrilla forces.
   More than 26,000 soldiers of the former rebel Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola (UNITA) movement will be integrated into a new 
Angolan defence force of some 90,000 men.  Of the 63,000 ex- guerrillas 
in Jonas Savimbi's UNITA, 26,000 will join the new army, 200 the air 
force and 100 the navy.
   The figure, announced in the Angolan capital, Luanda on January 15, 
was decided on at meetings in the past week between members of the 
general staff of UNITA and the regular armed forces of President Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos' ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola (MPLA) government.
   Both UNITA and MPLA, protagonists in Angola's civil war for almost 
two decades since independence from Portugal in 1975, agreed that other 
soldiers in their ranks -- some 180,000 men -- will not be demobilised 
immediately but assigned to a new force responsible for rebuilding 
civilian and military infrastructure destroyed during the bitter 
conflict.
   The UNITA fighters named to the new defence force in line with a 
peace pact signed in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994, will be selected 
once all the former rebels have been disarmed and encamped in 15 sites 
prepared for them under the United Nations' supervision.
   Negotiations on the structure of the future army and the distribution 
of posts will continue.  The Luanda government has offered UNITA six 
places on the general staff of the defence force, including that of 
deputy chief-of-staff, a government source said.
   The UNITA representative on the joint peace commission established 
with the government, Isaias Samakuva, on January 15 went to Bailundo, 
the movement's headquarters town in central Angola, to consult with 
Savimbi on Luanda's proposals.
   The resumption of military talks is expected to lead to progress in 
the encampment operation, although no timetable has been fixed.  "We are 
not yet in a position to confirm the beginning of this operation," a 
UNITA delegation member said.
   On January 12, UNITA declared that it will free all prisoners of war 
(POWs) it is still holding, a joint commission for verifying peace in 
the southern African state said.
   The release of the POWs -- both military and civilian -- was due to 
be supervised from this week by the International Committee of the Red 
Cross, (ICRC) sources said, but did not give the exact number involved.  
The government has so far released 341 prisoners, while UNITA has freed 
20.
   A timetable aimed at putting the Angola peace effort back on a firm 
track was reached "formally" at a meeting on January 12 between 
representatives of the rebel group and the joint commission.  It 
requires
   UNITA to bring back to their bases its combatants in three locations 
-- Negage and Quibaze, both in the north, and Londiibali, in the centre 
of the country -- by January 20.
   The government, meanwhile, is to remove its troops to barracks in 
Uije and Bengo provinces, both in the north, according to the timetable 
which was proposed by the UN Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM).
   The talks had gone on hold after clashes between fighters from both 
sides in the north, threatening the success of a peace plan signed in 
November 1994.  UN sources in Luanda said a list of UNITA officials who 
would be part of a new Angolan government of national unity would be 
discussed at the next meeting between President dos Santos and the UNITA  
leader Jonas Savimbi.
   The United Nations did not say when the meeting would take place, but 
Angolan radio said it could be held before January 20.  Since the Lusaka 
peace accord was signed in 1994, UNITA and MPLA have met three times in 
Zambia, Gabon and Belgium.
   Under the Lusaka peace accord, which ended 20 years of civil war in 
the sprawling former Portuguese colony, the Ministers of Geology and 
Mines, Trade, Health and Tourism are to be UNITA officials.
   Also reserved for the rebel group are seven vice-ministerial 
positions, including Defence, Interior, Finance and Agriculture, plus 
three provincial governorships and six ambassadorial posts.
   The former rivals are also due to discuss the repatriation of 
mercenaries they employed during the war.  Last week, the government 
sent home 460 South Africans who had been fighting on its side, but 
UNITA claims that Luanda had employed a total of 5,000.
   The move forward in the peace process comes as the head of the UN 
Security Council sought to boost the peace process in Angola by urging 
President dos Santos and the UNITA opposition leader to meet soon 
without conditions.
   "I appeal strongly to you to build upon progress made in negotiations 
in the past few days and to do everything necessary to resolve the 
outstanding issues which are blocking the peace process in Angola," 
Britain's Sir John Weston wrote on behalf of the 15-member council.
   The council expressed "serious concern about reports of continued 
violations of the ceasefire" as well as slow progress on practical 
implementation of obligations of peace agreements.
   The council said it was expecting a response from the two men via 
United States ambassador to the Untied Nations Madeleine Albright who 
was about to set out on a visit to Africa.  That response as well as 
concrete actions will be "critical factors" as the council considers the 
possible renewal of the 6,400-man UN mission next month.
   On January 4, 50 people were killed in southern Angola during a dawn 
attack by rebels from the UNITA movement, the governor of the province 
of Huila Kundi Payama announced in a statement carried by the official 
Angolan News Agency (ANGOP) monitored in Lisbon the same day.
   In the statement, Kundi said that an unknown number of rebels from 
UNITA took part in the attack on the town of Chivulo, located in Huila 
province, where the military situation had escalated in recent weeks 
following the return to the area of a UNITA leader.
   The incident came just as the Angolan government and former rebel 
leaders from the UNITA movement resumed negotiations a day earlier on 
setting up a national army in line with the November 1994 Lusaka peace 
accord.
   The talks resumed following an emergency meeting in Luanda on January 
2 between UN special envoy to Angola Alioune Blondin Beye and 
representatives from the government and UNITA.
   UN officials said that during the meeting, the UN also denounced the 
Angolan government for allowing one of the army units to capture the 
town of Kitoke in Uije province during the Christmas holidays.
   The incident neither claimed any victims nor sparked any clashes with 
UNITA soldiers, the officials added.
   Clashes between the two sides in recent months had raised fears about 
the country's commitment to the Lusaka Peace Accord, under which rebels 
were to disarm and both sides were to quarter soldiers before merging 
into a new national army.
   On December 8, US President Bill Clinton also warned President dos 
Santos, during a visit to Washington that ceasefire violations in the 
battle-scarred African nation could jeopardise its improving ties with 
the United States.

Uganda
NGOs Call For Donor Pressure

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Crespo Sebunya

   Kampala - Much has been said about Uganda rising from ruins to become 
a showcase of a positive economic recovery programme.  But non- 
governmental organisations here say the same donors who are praising 
this East African country for its overall statistical progress, should 
now pressurize the government to address itself to the plight of 
millions of ordinary Ugandans who are wallowing in poverty.
   Residents of Kyotera town some 160 km south of Uganda's capital, 
Kampala held their breath as tens of military tanks rumbled through 
their dusty town, wrecking the just tarmacked section of a highway that 
leads into neighbouring Tanzania.
   Military authorities say that some 84 tanks were imported through 
Tanzania last November, a sign of increasing scale of Ugandan armament 
programme which is worrying donors who now say the programme accounts 
for more than 30 per cent of the country's budget.
   The collision course between Ugandan government and the donors over 
defence is not very difficult to discern.  The government explains that 
security needs are back on the high table because the country feels 
besieged by hostile neighbours.
   President Yoweri Museveni recently said that there are only two 
countries in the region he is on talking terms with -- Rwanda and 
Tanzania.  He suspects that other countries harbour rebel groups bent on 
destabilising Uganda.  "These countries fear a repeat of the type of 
revolution that happened in Uganda in their countries," Museveni has 
been quoted saying.
   He also believes that beefed up security also guarantees the welfare 
of investors.  To date, Uganda's Investment Authority has recorded 
nearly US dollars 2.5 billion but only 10 per cent of the amount has 
been actually invested in the country.  Among the reasons given for 
holding back is the uncertainty of this East African country's political 
situation.
   Uganda has however assured "doubting Thomases" that her 
demobilisation programme would result in a decline in defence spending.  
When the National Resistance Movement (NRM) took power in 1986, it built 
up a force of nearly 130,000 soldiers.  Then, the government reasoned 
that it had many enemies to fight. At one time 14 rebel groups were 
operating in the country.  Thus the high defence spending was tolerated.  
And as the number of rebel groups was scaled down and the government 
started demobilising its troops, there was a sigh of relief.
   The troops were reduced down to 50,000 and correspondingly defence 
spending went down.  According to the latest parliamentary report 
covering the 94/95 financial year, defence spending had dropped to 8 per 
cent of the national budget.  But then it is picking up again and 
according to latest figures from the United Nations Children's Fund 
(UNICEF), spending on defence has gone back to 30 per cent.
   But the government says there is need to modernise the army.  Mr. 
Amama Mbabazi, Uganda's Defence Minister is of the opinion that the army 
is now faced with well armed rebels and therefore needs to improve its 
efficiency.
   He notes that the country has to be guarded against external threat, 
especially from Sudan where both former President Idi Amin's soldiers 
under the West Nile Bank Front and Joseph Kony's rebel Lord Resistance 
Army (LRA) are based.
   But many concerned Ugandans believe defence is eating up resources 
which would otherwise have gone to the improvement of the people's 
welfare.  Both donors and non-governmental organisation are also worried 
about the trend in a country whose population is increasingly wallowing 
in poverty and disease, and want donors to do something about it.
   At a poverty alleviation conference held last November in Uganda, the 
NGOs said that some form of pressure ought to be put on the government 
so that it responds to the needs of the people.
   "The Ugandan government should be made to accept highest social 
conditionalities in form of higher budget allocation in health and 
education," Gary Bercker, one of the resource persons at the meeting 
said.
   He said that out of the country's 18 million people, 13 million live 
below the poverty line.  About 76 per cent of the 2.2 million pupils who 
enter primary schools do not complete seven years of education and only 
three per cent make it to university.
   Mr. Bercker said donors can prevail upon the government to address 
the increasing levels of poverty in the country.  "Poverty reduction is 
still an after-thought and not an integral part of the government policy 
formulation," he said.
   Bercker's concern is shared by the 1400 NGOs operating in Uganda. 
They say there are many intangible causes of insecurity in the country, 
especially when the population is dissatisfied with what they get from 
the government.
   NGOs, most of whom interact with one another and with the people, 
have proved to be spokespersons for the population.  They have served as 
an alternative to the government in availing the much needed services, a 
quality that puts them in a better position to understand what are 
likely to be causes of social conflicts.
   Social disruptions and discontent have increasingly been demonstrated 
through industrial strikes, especially by government workers.  Most 
dramatic was the strike by doctors who felt that their demand for better 
pay among other conditions has not been met.  Railway workers and 
teachers too have expressed their grievances through similar 
demonstrations.
   "The government should look into the issue of equity which requires 
that the distribution of benefits from growth must be addressed, if the 
poor are not to be further marginalised," Dr. Fred Opio, the Makerere 
University Executive Director for Economic Policy Research said.  His 
concern was that the government is yet to show commitment to the plight 
of the poor at a time when there are increasingly huge sums of money 
saved from the ongoing economic reform programmes.
   A statistical bulletin released by the Ministry of Finance in June 
1995 says Uganda saved up to US dollars 100 million in programmes such 
as the retrenchment of 148,000 civil servants.  The publication also 
notes that the privatisation programme allowed the country to collect 
nearly US dollars 90 million through privatisation receipts.
   It was hoped that this money would be utilised in the improvement of 
much needed services.  For instance, the World Bank says that the Uganda 
Electricity Board (UEB) is in great financial distress.  The board needs 
US dollars 100 million annually to be able to extend its services to the 
different areas of the country.
   But then, this should have been possible if the monies saved from the 
privatisation were applied to improve these services.  But when the 
report on privatisation was read, it was discovered that some of the 
money has been lent to private investors who have bought some of the 
companies, much to the annoyance of the parliamentarians.
   Nevertheless the government says that it has embarked on four 
measures to improve public resource expenditure.  The Minister for 
Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Joash Mayanja Nkangi says 
the government has already established a medium term expenditure 
framework where all sectors are involved in preparation of the budget.
   He says the application of these measures will see the budget share 
of the health sector rise from the current 12.1 to 15.4 per cent in the 
next financial year (96/97) while that of education will move from 17.9 
to 22.6 per cent in the same period.
   He also points out that the government has redesigned its priority 
programmes to serve as many people as possible.  "Before 1991, health 
expenditure skewed towards high cost hospital services that tended to 
benefit the few, while education was skewed towards secondary and 
tertiary institutions," he explained.  Now special attention will be 
paid to primary health care, rural water supply and primary education.
   Although these measures have taken hold, it would be long before 
tangible improvements are seen.  For instance, the per capita 
expenditure on health has risen to only US dollars 8 while the accepted 
standard is US dollars 12.  So far NGOs feel that pressure has to be put 
on the government so that it does not backslide.
   And their prayers were partly answered when donors asked the 
government to use money saved from relief programmes in the social 
sector.
   A debt management programme drawn by experts from the Bank of Uganda 
and an international team of experts from the newly created Eastern and 
Southern African Initiative in Debt and Reserves Management (ESAIDARM), 
World Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD) introduced two new components in the debt management programme.  
Through the programme, up to US dollars 20 million of the debt will be 
converted into local currency and be invested in social and 
environmental sectors.
   At the same time, donors have agreed to establish a multi-lateral 
debt fund where donors will avail unspecified balance of payment support 
to the government to offset amounts owed to multilateral institutions 
like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and African 
Development Bank (ADB).  The fund which is being supported by Denmark, 
Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland among others, will release more 
funds to the social sector instead of having the same directed to 
servicing the external debt.
   According to government estimates, multilateral debt servicing 
accounts for up to 30 per cent of the national budget.  But it is 
expected that the new measures will reduce this by half to between 11 
and 12 per cent annually.  To ensure that the Ugandan government follows 
the plan, donors are expected to review the debt programme on a 
quarterly basis.
   But then, this is only part of the answer.  There are strong feelings 
especially in Uganda, among government opponents that the authorities in 
Kampala need to be more reconciliatory to neighbours.
   "It was wrong to sever diplomatic relationship with Sudan for this 
closed all avenues towards peaceful resolution of the conflict," said 
Mr. Paul Kawanga Semogerere, an aspiring presidential candidate.
   This subject also elicits some form of sympathy among senior 
government officials.  Mrs Betty  Bigombe, the Minister in charge of 
Pacification of the north said that when all is said and done, 
negotiations are still part of the answer.
   "It is very difficult to police our long stretch of the border we 
share with Sudan, thus it may be through negotiations that peace can be 
achieved," she emphasised.

Zambia
Africa Cup Games Drug Free

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 22, 1996 (19960122)
by Goodson Machona

   Bloemfontein - Games being played at the Africa Cup of Nations in 
South Africa have been declared as drug free, ten days before the close 
of the competition. Organising committee  chairman Dr Peter Matsheke 
said on Friday in a press statement: "So far all players have been 
clean." He explained that each of the four venues has a centre where the 
tests are being carried.
   "At half time, the match commissioners and team officials of the two 
competing teams randomly select two players from each team by drawing 
two numbers per team out of a bag," Dr Matsheke said, adding: "The 
players are identified 15 minutes from the centre by their team 
officials and doctors where the taking of samples is administered by a 
CAF appointed doctor." According to Dr. Matsheke, the players are 
allowed to choose the containers for their samples.
   "These containers are coded and only the secretary general of CAF, 
Mustapha Fahmy, knows the identities of the players when he receives the 
results between 36 and 48 hours after the tests are carried out," 
explained Dr. Matsheke.
   The samples are being tested at the University of Bloemfontein which 
according to Dr. Matsheke "is the only international Olympics committee 
(IOC) accredited laboratory in Africa."
   During Zambia's game against Algeria, Zeddy Saileti and Harrison 
Chongo were picked for testing and have since been cleared.
   Meanwhile, Zambia could still get in the quarter-finals with one 
point from the tie against Sierra Leone on Wednesday night in the Group 
B Africa Cup of Naions finals here.
   But no such thought is being entertained by coach Roald Poulsen or 
his 22- man squad who says no chances were going to be taken and his 
players were going to go for the kill to top the group.
   "Our aim is to win and end at the top of the group,"declared Poulsen. 
"We will put all our energies into the game." He added: "The boys know 
what is at stake. They will go out for an outright win."
   Combative winger, Jonson Bwalya agreed.  " Our aim is to beat Sierra 
Leone convincingly so that we top the table in group B and stay in 
Bloemfontein," he said. "Sierra Leone is a good team. we have to respect 
them," warned Jonson. But team captain Kalusha Bwalya is confident his 
boys will pull off a win . "The boys are keyed up after the Burkina Faso 
match and are more determined than ever to make sure of a place in the 
last eight," Great Kalu said
   Zambia's breath taking 5-1 win over Burkina Faso on Saturday night 
meant that they are now heading group B on goal difference.
   The scoreline was too much for the Burkinabe that  coach, Idrissa 
Traore refused to attend the mandatory mixed post match press 
conference. But nearly everyone here in Bloemfontein is full of praise 
for the Zambian  team.
   Former Aston Villa and Wimbledon stirker John Fashanu had this to 
say:  " This is the best team performance so far. Kulusha led by 
example, it makes me feel at 33 I am not too old to play soccer."

Zambia
President's Actions Sow Seeds of Anarchy

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 22, 1996 (19960122)
by Fred M'membe (Column)

   Lusaka - President Chiluba's position on the method of  adopting the 
constitution has nothing to do with respect for the sovereignty of 
Parliament but much with fear of losing power if clauses that level the 
play field and broaden political competition are put in the 
constitution.
   The President's fear of losing the benefits of power, and not of  the 
opportunity to help create a better  Zambia for all, was made very clear 
at last month's MMD's extraordinary convention.
   The President reminded his government officials of the deprivations 
they will have to endure if he and the MMD were voted out. He reminded 
them of the houses, the cars and offices they will lose. But he failed 
to acknow-ladge that he will be the greatest loser as he is the highest 
beneficiary.
   This is what worries President Chiluba. This is what seems to propel 
him in all that he does. But the disastrous endings of people who pursue 
the goals of vanity in the world are many. And President Chiluba is 
pushing this country on that path. I beg all men and women of goodwill 
to go down on their knees to beg President Chiluba not to drag our 
country into chaos. A constitution that is not accepted and respected by 
a large section of society is a recipe for bloodshed. The President and 
his people, as defence minister Ben Mwila once remarked, have 
accumulated enough money to go and live abroad comfortably.
   The government seems to be running out of arguments to justify its 
refusal to adopt the Constitution through a constituent assembly.
   Opening the fifth session of the seventh National Assembly, President 
Frederick Chiluba warned that the government will not bow to pressure 
from some elements with axes to grind to adopt the constitution through 
a constituent assembly.
   The President also cautioned that any other procedures dictated to by 
disgruntled elements would only entail the law of the jungle. This type 
of language is very familiar to most Zambians. It is not different to 
former president Kenneth Kaunda's language during the Second Republic.
   But I fail to appreciate the link between one being disgruntled with 
President Chiluba and the method of adopting the constitution. What is 
personal about the Constitution? Can any reasonable person really 
personalise a Constitution? Is the Constitution of the Republic of 
Zambia a personal property of the President and his friends in the MMD 
club, which they can resolve to disband tomorrow?
   Can a citizen's rights be measured on the basis of his or her 
disposition towards those in power? The plural society Zambians ushered 
in 1991 had at its core, the empowerment of those with axes to grind 
them and the disgruntled to be disgruntled. Dissent is a constitutional 
right that must be scrupulously respected. President Chiluba was at one 
time a 'disgruntled' person with 'an axe to grind' with former president 
Kaunda. 
   Our Constitution will, and should, not be an exclusive product of the 
friends and supporters of a president. It should be a product of all 
Zambians - whether friends and foes of President Chiluba. This is the 
depth to which the President has sunk the constitutional debate! And 
this being the case it is understandable why the 'disgruntled' and the 
'axe grinders' are not comfortable with President Chiluba's method of 
adopting the Constitution.
   The more President Chiluba opens his mouth over the Constitution the 
more I am convinced he is not being honest and forthright with the 
Zambian people. The President's argument that a constituent assembly 
takes away the powers of Parliament is not very convincing when the 
Constitution of the Republic of Zambia provides for a referendum 
whenever there are any amendments to the Bill of Rights.
   The Constitutional Review Commission had proposed an extension of the 
Bill of Rights, in line with the MMD manifesto of 1991, which would have 
required subjecting the Constitution to a referendum. But President 
Chiluba, it appears, is not prepared to have anyone outside his control 
have any significant influence on the constitution, and he consequently 
got rid of all the proposed amendments to the Bill of Rights, in order 
to stay clear of a referendum, even if this meant breaking a written 
election promise.
   The 1991 MMD manifesto, on which President Chiluba claims he was 
elected, on page 3 promised: "The MMD is committed to extending the Bill 
of Rights to embrace categories such as the rights of the press and 
children and rights against all forms of discriminations against women.  
The MMD will uphold the Bill of Right with all its power."
   But this is not the only promise that has been expediently abandoned. 
The MMD promised not to subordinate the rights of the minority to that 
of the majority. But today, over the constitution, the MMD wants to use 
its parliamentary majority to subject all Zambians, even those who are 
not members of the MMD, to a party constitution.  
   The MMD manifesto on page 11 promised:  "The MMD upholds the 
democratic principles such as ... non-subordinations of the minority to 
the majority and the right of the minority to defend its interests 
publicly if their interests are threatened." The Munyama Human Rights 
Commission, in its report, politely noted the party's departure from 
this position. But what is much more worrying with the commission's 
observations is that the MMD has negated on the extension of the Bill of 
Rights when there are concerns that the courts are not doing much to 
advance liberties.
   "The judiciary was accused of being too timid and passing judgments 
that favoured the government, and were against the civil liberties of 
individuals," reads the Munyama Human Rights Commission report, adding: 
"It was then argued that fighting human rights  cases in court was an 
exercise in futility."
   And even Nelson Mandela, a law-abiding attorney whose desire for the 
freedom of his people to live in dignity drove him to become a criminal, 
turned this family-loving husband into a man without a home, forced this 
life-loving man  to live like a monk for more than a quarter of a 
century in jail, when his 'hour' won, he did not want to single-handedly 
write a constitution of South Africa.
   In his book, "Long Walk to Freedom", on page 743 Mandela writes: "We 
polled 62.6 per cent of national vote, slightly short of the two-thirds 
needed had we wished to push through a final constitution without 
support from other parties. Some in the ANC were disappointed that we 
did not cross the two-thirds threshold, but I was not one of them. In 
fact I was relieved; had we won two-thirds of the vote and been able to 
write a constitution unfettered by input from others, people would argue 
that we had created an ANC constitution, not a South African 
constitution. I wanted a true government of national unity."

YWCA Funds Small Scale Entrepreneurs

by Masauso Lungu

   Lusaka - About 400 small scale entrepreneurs would benefit from the 
US$240,000 budget for training set aside by the  Small Scale Business 
Development Centre at the Young Womens' Christian Association (YWCA) in 
Lusaka. Project Chief technical Advisor, Wendy Fitzgerald, said in an 
interview yesterday the programme will start on February 5, and run for 
a year.
   "We have budgeted $240, 000 for 1996 programmes and we hope to run 
about 8 short courses in various areas in small scale businesses," said 
Fiztgerald. Last year the centre trained about 300 small scale 
entrepreneurs, and some of the participants who attended the courses say 
it was beneficial to train at the centre.
   "I attended a three week course in small business development and I 
have improved very much in my operations and I think I am doing fine. I 
learnt a lot," said Evelyn Mwale of Lusaka's Longacres in an interview 
on Thursday.  The centre was established in 1993  by YWCA with Irish 
Aid.

'Apathy' Worries SA Soccer Boss

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Goodson Machona

   Bloemfontein - South Africa's soccer boss, Solomon "Stix" Morewa has 
expressed worry at the poor crowds attending the on-going Africa Cup of 
Nations games.
   Briefing pressmen and women on Tuesday, Morewa said the situation was
getting out of hand and would meet Confederation of Africa Football 
(CAF) officials this week with the aim of reviewing gate charges.
   Unreserved seats have been priced at R25 while reserved seats are 
going for R30.
   Poor crowds were seen during the Zambia versus Algeria and Sierra 
Leone versus Burkina Faso matches here in Bloemfontein and also during a 
night game on Monday at the giant FNB stadium where fewer than 2,000 
people watched the match.
   "The poor attendence is worrying us. We are to hold meetings with CAF 
to review the situation," said Morewa.
   Meanwhile, chairman of the organising committee here in Bloemfontein, 
Veli Mahlangu, has appealed to influntial local leaders to draw the 
attention of the community to the Africa Cup of Nations games being 
played at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein.+++His appeal comes in 
the wake of the poor crowds that attended the two matches so far played 
in Bloemfontein.
   "This is very sad," said Mahlangu during a cocktail party hosted by 
Bloemfontein mayor, Jani Mohapi, in honour of the four competing teams 
and CAF officials.
   "We accept that African teams are mainly a foreign entity to our 
fans," Mahlangu said. "But we had hoped local fans would appreciate the 
chance if seeing the teams in action and therefore support their games."
   But some Bloemfontein residents interviewed say they are boycotting 
the games because of the exclusion of Bloemfontein-born local starand 
1995 national soccer league Player of the Year, David "Lesilo" Modise to 
the South African national team.

Soccer: Now Team Gets Serious

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Goodson Machona

   Bloemfontein - A serious mood engulfed the Zambian squad as they 
prepared for tomorrow's clash against Burkina Faso.
   The situation was further compounded after Algeria took over the 
leadership of Group B when they beat Sierra Leone 2-0 last night.
   Coach Roald Poulsen last night drilled his army in a gruelling two 
hours training session under floodlights.
   Poulsen's emphasis was to make sure his players got used to playing 
under the floodlights. Zambia's two remaining preliminaries have been 
slated at 20.00 hours.
   But Poulsen said he was not worried about Zambia playing their two 
remaining preliminary matches under flood lights.
   "There is definitely no problem," Poulsen on Wednesday night adding 
"There is no difference playing under flood lights or during the day."
   According to Poulsen, playing at night was a blessing in disguise 
because the temperatures here were stifling.
   "You cannot expect the players to play soccer in temperatures in the 
region of 32 degrees centigrade. Naturally the heat will inhibit and 
stifle their type of play," Poulsen said.
   But he admitted that it would have been better had the games been 
played during the day.
   "In Zambia, we play soccer during the day. But the boys are adapting 
well and looking forward to the games," Poulsen said.
   Camp manager Solly Pandor agreed. "I wouldn't say playing under flood 
lights is an advantage or disadvantage. But the morale in the camp is 
very high. There are no injuries and the boys are raring to go," Pandor 
said.
   So determined and sharp were the players in their workout that one 
Burkinabe journalist remarked; "Our boys are in trouble."
   Today is a rest day for the team. "We are taking them on a sight-
seeing tour of Bloemfontein but training will continue tomorrow, with 
two sessions, one in the morning and one in the evening," Pandor said.
   And Algeria yesterday beat a determined Sierra Leone side and 
immediately took over the leadership of Group B with four points from 
two games.
   A goal in each half were enough to push Sierra Leone into second 
position ahead of Zambia and Burkina Faso.
   Zambia plays Burkina Faso on Saturday while Algeria will have to wait 
for their last game against Burkina Faso.

Zambia
Three Quarters of Budget Donor Funded

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 18, 1996 (19960118)
by Anthony Mukwita

   Lusaka - Seventy five per cent of Zambia's annual budget and 
development projects was donor funded in 1995, Finance Minister Ronald 
Penza disclosed in an interview yesterday in Chisamba.
   Penza said only 25 per cent was contributed to the overall budget by 
the taxpayer.
   "It's my intention to run Zambia at a profit but we have 70 per cent 
of theinvestment being foreign while 75 per cent of the so called budget 
is provided for by the donors, " Penza said. "It will take another 15 
years to get out of the current debts."
   And debt repayment obligations have also compounded Penza's 
headaches.
   "It's unfortunate that the $1.3 billion we got from the donors will 
only be used to repay debts," Penza carped. "We will have to repay at 0. 
05 per cent interest over a period of five and half years since now our 
credit worthiness is more enhanced."
   And this week opposition Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) challenged 
in an open letter to the President for the government to explain where 
it was taking the money from tax collections since almost everything in 
the country is donor funded.
   But Penza dismissed LPF's charges saying understanding of economics 
seemed to be a problem in the party.
   "Twenty five per cent of Zambia's money went to the budget and 
Chongwe (LPFpresident) does not understand economics," Penza said. " He 
is just politicking."

Only 80,000 Register As Voters In Lusaka

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 18, 1996 (19960118)
by Reuben Phiri

   Lusaka - Less than 80,000, of a targeted 480,000 eligible citizens, 
have registered as voters in Lusaka so far, disclosed Lusaka Province 
registration officer, John Mulenga, in an interview yesterday.
   Mulenga, said the exercise which had picked up towards the close of 
the initial deadline is now slowing down again.
   He called on employers, NGO's, churches and other interested groups 
not to
 relax because of the extension but continue with publicity.
   "We need a lot of publicity if we have to meet our target of 483,496 
of eligible voters in Lusaka alone," Mulenga said. "We have only 
registered 79,965 as at January 10."
   But public liaison officer at Elections Office, Joel Sikazwe, said in 
an interview yesterday that the statistics reported in the press and 
attributed to his office were incorrect.
   "I am still compiling the data," Sikazwe said. "It will be 
communicated to the press when we are ready."
   And Elections Office will pay the field polling officers their 
allowances for the initial part of the exercise tomorrow.
   "Money has been released to pay the field officers for the first 
phase and we hope to pay the officers in Lusaka by Friday," Mulenga 
said.

Zambia
Where Is Tax Money Going? Opposition Party Asks

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 17, 1996 (19960117)
by Anthony Mukwita

   Lusaka - Opposition Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) on Tuesday 
challenged President Frederick Chiluba in an open letter to explain 
where the taxpayer's money was going as most services government claimed 
to be providing were donor funded.
   The LPF letter claimed money from taxes was not being spent on things 
the majority of the people were crying for.
   "Government is not feeding the vulnerable groups," LPF claimed in its 
open letter to the President of Monday. "Donors are."
   LPF further charged that government was not supplying medicines in 
hospitals as the drug kits too came from donors.
   But neither State House nor the finance ministry or Ministry of 
Health wasprepared to respond to LPF's charges.
   "I think the issue is really a ministry of finance one so you should 
try MrPenza," said President Chiluba's public relations and press aide, 
Richard Sakala, in an interview yesterday. " I don't want to answer it 
in general terms."
   And health minister Michael Sata was also not in a position to defend 
hisministry, or the President, over the supply of medicines to 
hospitals.
   "If the letter was addressed to me I would have commented but since 
it wasaddressed to the President I cant comment," Sata said in an 
interview yesterday.
   And finance minister Ronald Penza and deputies could not be reached 
for comment as they were locked in a budget meeting.
   LPF accused government of not providing services that matched up to 
the value of taxes collected.
   "Government has not released money promised for maintenance from the 
Road Fund, despite fuel levies being increased in 1995," LPF's open 
letter to the President read, adding: "Government supplies of books and 
desks to schools have tickled to a halt. Government has not invested in 
water supply since the donors finished their drought relief programs."
   LPF advised President Chiluba to take advantage of his address at the 
opening of Parliament on Friday to restore hope to the people of Zambia.
   "We urge you to address how your government will reduce and re-target 
publicexpenditure in order to deliver the goods and services and what 
measures thegovernment will put in place to revive the economy and 
achieve growth in 1996," LPF urged.
   LPF claimed there was ample evidence of "flagrant extravagance in 
higher levels of government".
   "New cars, new offices, new furniture, and trips overseas," the 
letter stated. "Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) has confirmed that there 
is no shortage of money. In fact ZRA collected more money than budgeted 
for in 1995."

United States and Africa
[DOCUMENT] Southern Africa Media Group Criticizes U.S. Embassy

Africa News Service
January 15, 1996 (19960115)

   Statement by the Media Institute of South African (MISA), December 
15, 1995.
   United States embassy in Maputo confirmed that they have banned a 
U.S. journalist, Joseph Hanlon, from speaking to the ambassador and any 
of his staff regarding Mozambique. Ambassador Dennis Jett, told MISA on 
December 15 saying: "Hanlon is an unprofessional journalist whose 
reporting is totally and consistently biased. It is a waste of time 
talking to him."
   Hanlon is author of several books which focus on Mozambique. He also 
edited the "Peace Process Bulletin", put out by AWEPA (Association of 
European Parliamentarians for Southern Africa). In recent years, Hanlon 
covered, in detail, implementation of the 1992 peace accord between the 
government and the Renamo 'rebels'. And according to the Mozambique 
Information Agency (AIM), these credentials make Hanlon the best 
informed U.S. journalist on Mozambique.
   AIM reported on November 6,1995 that Hanlon requested, as he had done 
many times before, interviews with the U.S. embassy staff but press 
attach=E9 Adrienne O'Neal told him that nobody had any time to talk to 
him. "I informed her that the embassy has been talking to me for the 
past 15 years", Hanlon told AIM. On October 25, AIM reported, Hanlon 
spoke to O'Neal again but she replied: "I have talked to people here in 
the embassy and explained your concern and they say that nobody in the 
US embassy or at USAID will have time to talk to you". AIM reported that 
when Hanlon asked why this ban had been put on him, O'Neal is quoted as 
saying she did not have to give any reasons. But she is further quoted 
as having added: "There is a history to this."
   AIM reported that Hanlon had never had any problem in speaking to US 
officials during the pacification and election periods, even though what 
he wrote was frequently critical of US policy towards Mozambique. Hanlon 
said he did not understand the embassy's sudden change of the attitude. 
"Had the Mozambican government done this to me, the American embassy 
would have raised hell, and claimed that freedom of the press was under 
threat," Hanlon is quoted as saying. And added: "For a country that 
supposedly believes in freedom of information, the embassy's position is 
grotesque," and added, "it will be interesting to see whether the 
embassy's flagrant denial of freedom of information will figure in the 
next U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Mozambique."
   However, Ambassador Jett argued that although the embassy has banned 
Hanlon, the action does not affect freedom of press. "The government 
will not prevent journalists investigating their findings. But if the 
government doesn't want to talk to you, you can't force them to. It is 
my choice to take up questions," Ambassador Jett said. He further said 
that he talked to Hanlon extensively in the past, but he finds "his 
information in the books not good. Hanlon is hopelessly biased."

United States and Africa
[DOCUMENT] U.S. Ambassador Defends Refusal of Interviews to American 
Reporter

Africa News Service
January 15, 1996 (19960115)

   Maputo - Letter from the American Ambassador to Mozambique, Dennis 
Jett
to the publication MediaFax.
   Dear Editor of Mediafax:
   Permit me to respond to your editorial of December 19. In that 
editorial you called the American Embassy's refusal to give Joe Hanlon 
interviews with Embassy and USAID personnel a "flagrant violation of 
freedom of the press, freedom of expression and the right of person to 
be informed." Mr. Hanlon, AIM and Domingo have all made similar 
accusations. You also said that I, as ambassador, have no right to ban 
any embassy employee from speaking to a journalist.
   Clearly you do not understand the values behind the concepts you are 
so vigorously defending. I do not think this arises from different 
definitions of the terms involved, even though the American constitution 
and the Mozambican constitution are not identical on these points. The 
American constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom of 
expression by declaring that the Congress shall make no law abridging 
the freedom of press, or of speech. It should therefore be obvious to 
anyone that an embassy cannot violate freedom of the press in the 
American sense of term, since only the parliament in a particular 
country can pass a law that would interfere with a journalist's ability 
to express or publish his opinions.
   The Mozambican constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom 
of speech as well, but uses somewhat different words to accomplish this. 
Article 74 of the constitution states:
   "1. All the citizens shall have the right to freedom of expression 
and to freedom of the press, as well as the right to information.
   2. Freedom of expression, which includes the right to disseminate 
one's opinion by all legal means, and the right to information, shall 
not be limited by censorship. 
   3. Freedom of press shall include in particular the freedom of 
journalistic expression and creativity, access to sources of 
information, protection of professional independence and 
confidentiality, and the right to publish newspapers and other 
publications." 
   Since the Embassy has done nothing to prevent Mr. Hanlon from 
expressing his thoughts or publishing them, clearly the only question 
that arises is whether the embassy has violated Mr. Hanlon's right to 
information or his right to access to sources of information.
   Mozambique's press law, law number 18/91, contains article 29 
entitled "Access to sources of information." It states "Access to 
OFFICIAL (emphasis added) sources of information shall be granted to 
journalists in the course of their work." Would the distinguished editor 
of MediaFax have his readers believe that Article 29, which only 
mentions "official" sources of information, is referring to the 
information of all governments in the world and not just that of the 
Mozambican government? 
   In any case, I and other members of this Embassy have frequently made 
ourselves available to the press in those cases where we believed it was 
productive to do so. At the same time, Mr.Hanlon's request for 
interviews was not the first we have declined because we thought it 
would not be useful.
   Since access to official sources of information obviously does not 
apply, that only leaves the question whether Mr. Hanlon's right to 
information could have been violated. Article 3 of law 18/91 entitled 
"right to information" states: "In the field of the press, the right to 
information means the ability of every citizen to inform himself and to 
be informed of facts and opinions of national and international 
consequence, as well as the right to release information, opinions and 
ideas through the press." The citizens of Mozambique therefore have the 
right to inform themselves and be infomed by journalists. Would the 
distinguished editor of Mediafax have his readers believe that this 
should be interpreted that any time anyone refuses to answer any 
question of any journalist, that the rights of all 16 million 
Mozambicans have just been violated?
   Has the distinguished editor of MediaFax never heard in his 
professional career the response "no comment"? Has he never had a phone 
call that was not returned or never had a question he posed that was not 
fully answered? If this has happened in the past, why have you not 
informed the people of Mozambique in each and every instance in which 
their rights have been violated? 
   I think the above argument demonstrates the total absurdity of the 
assertion that the Embassy's decision regarding Mr. Hanlon violated 
freedom of the press, freedom of expression or the right of the people 
to be informed. You also made the point, however, that as ambassador, I 
did not have the right to ban anyone in the embassy from speaking to a 
journalist.
   When it comes to expressing official government opinions during 
official working hours -- which is what Mr. Hanlon requested -- I not 
only have the right, but the obligation to ensure that official 
positions are expressed coherently and consistently. I also have the 
obligation to the taxpayers of the United States to see that their money 
is not wasted. We have spent many hours in the past answering Mr. 
Hanlon's questions, which failed to improve the quality of his 
reporting. Using more time of embassy personnel to respond to more of 
Mr. Hanlon's questions, given his ideological orientation and lack of 
objectivity, would therefore be a waste of such resources.
   Would the distinguished editor of MediaFax have his readers believe 
that any journalist has the right to ask any question of any employee of 
any organization at any time and that no one in a position of authority, 
be it a manager, minister or ambassador, has the right to determine 
whether or how the question will be answered? If that is the case, 
Article 27 of law 18/91, which lists the rights of journalists, fails to 
include such a right and nowhere else in that law or in the constitution 
is such a right described.
   I believe this is more than just a case of not understanding the 
letter of the law; it is also a fundamental lack of comprehension of the 
spirit of the law. This lack of understanding is not limited to this one 
occasion. When the Embassy's press attache wrote you in November 
regarding Mr. Hanlon, you took offense at her suggestion that an entity 
of the government like AIM perhaps doesn't understand freedom of the 
press. You termed this an insult to you and the other journalists who 
had worked at AIM and you pointed out "AIM journalists had to continue 
to struggle a great deal for this press freedom, sometimes without 
success."
   While you may have struggled, I would agree that you did not succeed. 
When you were director of AIM, Renamo was never mentioned by name, but 
was always referred to as the "armed bandits." Today AIM only describes 
Renamo as "the former rebel movement." It never calls Renamo "the 
largest opposition political party" or even "an opposition party." 
Frelimo, on the other hand, is always referred to as the "ruling party" 
or the "governing party" which is an accurate description of the present 
without reference to the past. Do AIM's readers need to be reminded 
every day that Renamo was once a rebel movement? If it is AIM's 
intention to teach history, in view of its successful struggle for 
liberation from colonialism, why isn't Frelimo ever referred to as a 
"former rebel movement?"
   This problem with nomenclature is perhaps a small example of bias, 
but I am not the only one who doubts AIM's impartiality. The following 
quote regarding AIM may interest you: "the service, however, causes some 
controversy, as many professionals are of the opinion that it is a 
service of governmental propaganda instead of being an information 
service with independence and objectivity guaranteed by law." The quote 
is from an article on page 5 of the August 28, 1995 issue of "Savana," 
an excellent newspaper that I recommend you read.
   Some would argue that it is pointless to enter into a debate about 
freedom of press with those who do not understand it or choose to ignore 
the values that are its foundation. Others say that arguing with an 
editor is a no-win situation since he (or she) will always have the last 
word.
   While I do not disagree with these arguments, I think it is an 
important debate nonetheless because the peace which Mozambique now 
enjoys is by no means assured. One academic study which I read recently 
concluded that during the last fifty years in countries where there had 
been civil wars that were ended through negotiation, in one half of them 
war broke out again.
   Whether Mozambique is part of the half that succeeds in not repeating 
the tragedy of the past will depend, to a large degree, on whether 
democracy succeeds here. Democracy can function successfully only if the 
institutions that are its foundations can function. In addition to a 
strong legislature and an independent judiciary, a free press is one of 
those essential institutions. Can the press be free if it is owned by 
the government? Is AIM your argument that it can? As the editor of the 
oldest independent publication in Mozambique, your opinions in this 
regard should be taken seriously.
   When reading the accounts of those who worked for two years to 
negotiate the General Peace Agreement in Rome, one theme is consistent. 
The mutual lack of confidence that the two parties had in each other 
repeatedly complicated the process. The climate created by a biased and 
unobjective press clearly contributed to this mutual lack of trust. The 
role played by the press therefore probably served to prolong the war 
and certainly served to make implementation of the peace more difficult.
   Distinguished editor of Mediafax, perhaps you should spend less time 
complaining about your friend being denied an interview and more time 
worrying about the threat to continued peace in Mozambique posed by some 
of those who practice your profession.
   Since article 33 of law 18/91 describes the right to reply, I trust 
you will not violate my rights and will publish this letter in its 
entirety.
   Along with the hope that the New Year brings greater understanding of 
and appreciation for freedom of the press and freedom of expression, 
please accept assurances of my highest consideration.

United States and Africa
Congressional Resolution on Kenya

Washington Office on Africa
January 13, 1996 (19960113)

   Washington, D.C. - Rep. John Porter is submitting the following 
concurrent resolution this week; which will be referred to the House of 
Representatives Committee on International Relations, Africa 
Subcommittee.
   CONCURRENT RESOLUTION: Expressing the sense of the House of 
Representatives concerning the political and human rights situation in 
the Republic of Kenya.
   Whereas the Governments of the United States and the Republic of 
Kenya have enjoyed friendly relations as the Republic of Kenya has been 
an important and politically stable ally to the United States in Africa;
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya is a major tourist destination in East 
Africa enhancing its economic and political importance to the United 
States;
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya is one of the largest recipients of 
United States foreign assistance in sub-Saharan Africa;
   Whereas such foreign assistance had been offered to encourage 
democratic freedoms, human rights, and political stability in the 
Republic of Kenya;
   Whereas after nine years as a single-party state led by the Kenya 
Africa National Union, a 1991 constitutional amendment restored multi-
party democracy;
   Whereas the Kenyan Constitution guarantees the rights of assembly, 
association, conscience, and expression;
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya, as a signatory to the United Nations 
Charter, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
the African Charter, is obliged to adhere to its international legal 
obligations and to protect the fundamental human rights of all its 
citizens;
   Whereas despite the 1991 Constitutional amendment restoring multi-
party democracy, the Government of Kenya continues to wage a campaign of 
repression designed to eliminate criticism and dissent;
   Whereas Government of Kenya security forces have harassed and 
detained government critics, including former cabinet members and other 
advocating multi-party democracy;
   Whereas former member of Parliament from Nakuru, Koigi wa Wamwere, 
who has been recognized as a determined opponent to ethnic cleansing, 
brutality, and corruption in the Republic of Kenya, has been targeted by 
the Government of Kenya for his political beliefs and has spent the 
batter part of the last nine years in police detention;
   Whereas numerous international human rights groups and independent 
international observers have concluded that the trial and sentencing of 
Mr. Wamwere and his two co-defendants, Charles Kuria Wamwere and G.G. 
Njuguna Ngengi, to four years in prison and six "strokes" (lashes with a 
cane), was conducted in a manner that was inconsistent with 
international legal standards, that the charges against the defendants 
were unsubstantiated by the evidence, that much of the evidence was 
fabricated, and that the trial was not conducted by an independent and 
impartial tribunal;
   Whereas the Government of Kenya continues to intimidate and harass 
human rights attorneys, peaceful demonstrators, and human rights 
activists by regularly interfering with many civil liberties, including 
freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association;
   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya, especially political 
prisoners, are detained in prison for indefinite periods of time without 
being charged with a crime;
   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya charged with crimes remain 
in prison for excessively lengthy periods of time without being brought 
to trial;
   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya are often subjected to 
various kinds of torture, including beating with sticks, fists, handles 
of hoes, and gun butts, often resulting in permanent disability;
   Whereas life threatening prison conditions in the Republic of Kenya, 
including sexual abuse, severe over crowding, poor diet, inadequate 
health care, substandard bedding materials, and flooded or unheated 
cells led to several hundred deaths in prison in 1994;
   Whereas despite constitutional provisions to the contrary and the 
Kenya Police Commissioner's June 1993 announcement that torture was 
prohibited and would not be tolerated, there continue to be credible 
reports that police and security forces resort to torture and brutality 
to break up licensed public assemblies;
   Whereas the President of Kenya exerts overwhelming influence over the 
country's judiciary, including through the President's refusal to renew 
contracts of the three High Court Judges who have issued rulings adverse 
to the government; and
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya's political stability is threatened by 
the Government of Kenya's repression of individual rights and democratic 
freedoms and its intolerance toward political dissent:
   Now therefore be it resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring),
   SECTION 1: STATEMENT OF POLICY:
   It is the sense of the Congress that the Government of Kenya should:
   1. Uphold the rights of assembly, association, conscience, and 
expression, which are guaranteed in the Kenyan Constitution;
   2. Adhere to its international legal obligations under the United 
Nations Charter, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, and the African Charter;
   3. End all intimidation and harassment of those who are critical of 
government policies and those working for democracy in Kenya, 
particularly individuals within the church, the press, and the legal and 
academic communities;
   4. Either charge and try or release all prisoners, including persons 
detained for political reasons;
   5. Cease all physical abuse or mistreatment of prisoners;
   6. Release Mr. Koigi wa Wamwere and permit him to exercise his rights 
of free expression, association, and political participation in a multi-
party democracy; and
   7. Restore the independence of the judiciary.
   SECTION 2. ASSISTANCE TO REPUBLIC OF KENYA: It is the sense of the 
Congress that the United States should consider reducing, and possibly 
suspending, military and economic assistance to the Republic of Kenya 
unless the Government of Kenya makes substantial progress in addressing 
the concerns set forth in Section 1.

Africa-at-Large
World Football Stars on South African Stage

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Lungile Madywabe 
   Johannesburg - Some of the world's greatest players will from this 
weekend grace South African soccer pitches. This is despite the debacle 
surrounding the withdrawal of champions Nigeria.
   Nigeria have the largest contingent of players plying their trade in 
Europe, but the 15 nations taking part in the tournament are packed with 
players who are playing for top overseas clubs. 
   As the world's leading clubs broaden their search for talent, Africa 
has become a good hunting ground for them, and stars from many poor 
African countries are now earning fortunes with the rich European clubs. 
   The most well known of these is George Weah, who is having a great 
season with Italy's AC Milan. Since re-admission, South Africa has also 
exported many local stars with John "Shoes" Moshoeu, playing in Turkey, 
being the most expensive player.
   GEORGE WEAH (Liberia)
   GEORGE APPONG WEAH is simply the best player on earth at the moment. 
World soccer's governing body, Fifa, confirmed that on Monday when Weah 
was voted World Player of the Year.
   He has played much of his football outside his war-torn country, 
starring for a French club before moving to the Italian Serie A giants 
AC Milan. But Weah's love for Liberia has led him to contribute some of 
his earning towards the national team and he has inspired them to their 
first appearance in the African nations Cup.
   National coach Wilfred Lardner knows that in Weah he has someone 
around whom he can build a strong team capable of upsetting the 
tournament's favourites. Liberian minister of sport Francois Massaquoi 
said: "He has shown the world that Liberians are not just killers, but 
also decent people with talent and mastery of certain crafts." 
   With Nigeria out of the finals and Weah leading their attack, Liberia 
have a good chance of advancing to the knockout stage of the tournament.
   ANTHONY YEBOAH (Ghana)
   ANTHONY YEBOAH has not lost the goal touch that prompted England's 
Leeds United to pay $3,4-million to Eintracht Frankfurt for his 
services. He was a prolific goalscorer in the German Bundesliga and 
Yeboah's continued appetite for what he is paid to do earned him the 
goal of the month award in September and October last year. 
   Asked about his much-publicised squabble with team captain Abedi 
"Pele" Ayew, he said: "Blown out of proportion". However, Ghana 's 
failure in Tunisia 94 was attributed to internal quarrels. Having failed 
in two previous tournaments, Yeboah knows that this may be his last 
chance. The 30-year-old striker has a lethal shot with both feet and if 
his 25-yard scorchers do not elude him, he may be the top goal scorer of 
the tournament.
   DOCTOR KHUMALO (South Africa)
   WAY back in 1992 in Zimbabwe, when South Africa were beaten 4-1 in a 
African Nations Cup qualifier, the most talked about player then was 
Doctor Khumalo (right), with the Zimbabweans dubbing him a "nurse". He 
has come a long way since then, and has put in some assured and skillful 
performances for the national team. 
   The Kaizer Chiefs idol always plays in patches but with a strong 
contingent around him he can rise to the occasion.
   He spent the latter part of last year rueing a botched deal with a 
club in Argentina but  next season he is likely to play in the revamped 
American league. Khumalo will be looking to make a big impression at 
this tournament so that he can clinch himself a better deal in a more 
competitive league than the United States. 
   KALUSHA BWALYA (Zambia)
   TEAM captain Kalusha Bwalya will best be remembered for leading 
Zambia to the finals of the 1994 tournament in Tunisia against Nigeria 
after he was one of the survivors of the 1993 plane crash in Gabon which 
killed all but three members of the national squad. "Great Lusha" is 
still with us today because he simply missed the flight.
   Those who saw the 1994 finals will remember how close Bwalya came to 
equalising in the final against Nigeria, hitting the crossbar with a 40m 
drive.
   The 33-year-old Bwaly is currently playing for Club America in Mexico 
and with Johnson Bwalya and Kenneth Malitoli alongside him, this left- 
footed midfielder could give goalkeepers a hard time. Having come that 
close in Tunisia with a makeshift squad, this time around they may hit 
the jackpot.

South Africa
Task Force Looks at Government Info and Media Ownership

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy

   Johannesburg - The task team appointed by Deputy President Thabo 
Mbeki to look at the media will be reviewing the South African 
Communications Services (SACS) -- government's current communications 
model -- in a bid to find new and more effective means of disseminating 
government information to the public.
   A brief for Friday's meeting sent by Mbeki's office to all ten 
members of the task team urges participants to concentrate on 
investigating, among others issues, the relationship between SACS and 
those print and electronic media structures not linked to government.
   Freedom of Expression Institute chairman Raymond Louw, who is a task 
team member, said the team would also be reviewing the government's 
existing policy on communication and placing "special emphasis" on re-
assessing affirmative action policies.
   "Ownership and control of the media, and how it affects government 
communications is also one of the key issues for the task team," Louw 
said.
   Another member of the task team, the Sowetan's political editor, 
Mathatha Tsedu, said foreign control of the media by large conglomerates 
and monopolies should be a priority for the task team because foreign 
ownership impeded the process of ensuring a "diversity of voices" among 
the press.
   "I believe that the large groups controlling the media should 
unbundle and relinquish shares. Sowetan staffers have appealed to the 
Independent Group to sell its stake in the Sowetan and allow them to buy 
shares. This displays the urgency with which our team has to discuss 
foreign control of the media," Tsedu said.
   More than 80 percent of South African print media is controlled by 
four major players: namely, Times Media Limited, Independent Newspapers 
Holdings, Perskor and the Nasionale Pers.
   Although members agreed on the issue of spurring affirmative action, 
some feared that government may resort to "undesirable means" of 
implementation such as using government advertising money to implement 
the policy.

Parliament Prepares Intelligence Probe

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Gaye Davis

   Johannesburg -   Parliament's watchdog over the intelligence 
community faces its most crucial test as it prepares to uncover the 
truth behind the police spying scandal.
   The Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence thrashed out its terms 
of reference for its investigation into police claims that top members 
were being spied on by agents of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), 
which has denied the allegations, during a five-hour meeting behind 
closed doors this week.
   "We have already had our battles with the intelligence services. How 
we deal with this case is a test for us as far as the public is 
concerned," committee chair, African National Congress MP Lindiwe 
Sisulu-Guma, told the Mail & Guardian.
   The committee is responsible for monitoring the two national 
intelligence services -- the NIA, which deals with domestic threats, and 
the South African Secret Service, which deals with external threats -- 
as well as the intelligence arms of the police and defence force. Its 
power lies in its legislated right to approve or veto budgets: "We hold 
the purse-strings," said Sisulu-Guma.
   Public interviews of seven nominees shortlisted for the post of 
Inspector General of Intelligence -- a civilian who will deal with 
complaints of abuses from the public and within the services themselves 
-- start on February 20.
   The candidates have been drawn from a list of nominees submitted by 
all seven political parties and three nominated by members of the 
public.
   The final choice must be approved by a 75 percent majority in 
Parliament -- more than the two-thirds required to amend the 
constitution, because of the nature of the job.
   Since it started work four months ago, the committee has had to 
scrutinise intelligence budgets, learn about the services it is supposed 
to monitor, and find a balance between transparency and secrecy. 
   "It's the most difficult balancing act imaginable. We must do it 
properly or the concept of transparency will be destroyed." It will 
report to Parliament on its work during February. "Nothing will be 
excluded without our first consulting all the political parties and 
nothing will be included that jeopardises the national interest."
   The committee meets on February 7 to consider reports on the spying 
scandal it has called for from the police and the NIA, and to decide 
whom to subpoena to give evidence. It will investigate the truth of 
allegations of the use of bugs and other surveillance of senior police 
officers and prepare a report, with recommendations, for parliament and 
the executive.

South Africa
Man Who Exposed Police Misdeeds Regrets Six-Year-Old Confession

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Peta Thornycroft
   Johannesburg - It's been a long time coming, but Dirk Coetzee has had 
enough. He now regrets having spoken out in 1989 about killer squads in 
the South African Police.
   His confession six years ago about his own role in sanctioned murders 
and his breathtaking exposure of the rot deep in the South African 
security police has brought him little but grief. When he first told 
Vrye Weekblad reporter Jacques Pauw his story, both he and his claims 
were ridiculed in much of the then mainstream media. He had to spend 
four years in uncomfortable exile, in constant fear of being 
assassinated.
   And the propaganda machine within the South African Police, and the 
remnants of that machine which is still functioning, has pursued him 
relentlessly. This week was the final straw.
   His old colleague, National Police Commissioner George Fivaz (who 
probably owes Coetzee at least a good lunch for alerting the African 
National Congress that he was "untainted" and therefore probably the 
best compromise to be the future National Commissioner), chose to ignore 
him and go public with another man's accusations against him
   Fivaz decided to endorse a version of events given to him by another 
former security policeman Inspector HT Moodley: Moodley claims Dirk 
Coetzee told him he was under orders to bug senior policemen at a 
meeting at National Intelligence Agency headquarters six weeks ago.
   Coetzee scoffs at this. His version is that Moodley, "a pleasant 
fellow," visited him at NIA HQ and asked him to make a statement about 
the assassination of ANC lawyer Griffiths Mxenge in Durban in 1981. 
Mxenge's brother had decided to ask the police to charge Coetzee after 
participating in a Yorkshire Television documentary in which Coetzee 
once again repeated his confession, that under orders from his superiors 
in the security police, he sent his men to kill Mxenge.
   Coetzee says he told Moodley at the "relaxed" meeting he would not 
make a statement to the police, but he would be telling the Mxenge 
story, for the last time, to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
   Coetzee, uncomfortable in his NIA job as a "spook", says he has 
neither access to "bugging" devices, nor has he ever been involved in 
bugging operations in his life, and that he is in the wrong department 
at the NIA to do any bugging, even if he knew how. He also claims that 
nobody in the NIA asked him to do any bugging, ever.
   According to Coetzee neither Fivaz nor anyone else, including his 
bosses at NIA, asked him his version of the bugging allegations 
contained in a report by Independent Newspapers' investigative unit, 
Spectrum.
   Coetzee learned of Fivaz's statement early last Thursday morning when 
a friend phoned him to tell him the newspaper reports were being aired 
on radio news bulletins.
   Coetzee is bewildered about why he was the last to find out, and 
said: "Let me and Moodley have a lie detector test." Moodley refused to 
talk to the M&G, and referred us to Fivaz.
   Coetzee is not supposed to talk to the press. He would far prefer to 
be back in the police, which he left on "medical grounds" after a 
disciplinary hearing in 1986.
   He's an unconventional, outspoken wild card for the new government. 
In an interview with Tribute magazine before the elections he accused 
the ANC intelligence community of incompetence, and that didn't do his 
career much good. And he's not sure, after this week and his outrage in 
the press, what his job prospects are like with the NIA.
   And he's deeply hurt that some men who covered up and lied about the 
hit squads are generals in the police, while he is ill-placed in the 
state spy shop. Coetzee is not an angel, but so far he has never been 
caught in a lie.
   Fivaz told the M&G late on Thursday he had at no stage commented on 
the veracity of the allegations against Coetzee. He said he had 
discussed the bugging with intelligence boss Mo Shaik, who had decided 
to let the matter rest.

Police Accused Over Christmas Day Massacre

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Eddie Koch and Mehlo Mvelase

   Johannesburg - Police either colluded in the Christmas Day massacre 
at Shobashobane or are guilty of negligence in the run-up to the attack 
that left 19 people dead in the KwaZulu-Natal village, according to a 
television documentary to be broadcast by SABC's Agenda programme on 
Sunday night.
   The documentary includes strong criticisms from Captain Shaun 
Vollenhoven, former commander of the police station near Shobashobane, 
of the co-ordination of the security operation in the area before the 
attack.
   Vollenhoven, who has been transferred from the police station at his 
own request, feels that his efforts to introduce new and more community-
friendly policing methods in the area had been consistently undermined.
   "The old police structure which we are trying to change now is still 
not ready for change," says Vollenoven in response to queries from the 
film crew about lack of co-ordination in the way police behaved before 
and during the massacre.
   The documentary, made by Mail & Guardian Television with the SABC, 
includes an in-depth examination of how the massacre took place and 
explores the possibilities for restoring order to the region.
   One of Vollenhoven's key criticisms relates to the lack of 
communication between the police station and various other security 
operatives in the area. He was, he said, unable to provide an 
explanation for the fact that an Internal Stability Unit patrol, which 
was supposed to have been on duty in the area, was not present at the 
time of the attack in Shobashobane. He was also not informed about 
houses being searched and weapons allegedly being confiscated in 
Shobashobane on the day before the attack.
   "I was not aware of the search by outside units," says Vollenhoven. 
"This creates a perception that police are siding with one party."
   The documentary points out that these anomalies occurred even though 
African National Congress leaders and independent monitors had informed 
senior police officers that an attack on Shobashobane could be expected 
in the Christmas period.
   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has asked Neville Melville, police 
reporting officer for KwaZulu-Natal and former advocate, to head up a 
special task force that will probe allegations of police complicity or 
negligence regarding the massacre. Members of the Investigative Task 
Unit, a crack team of detectives that reports directly to Mufamadi, will 
help with this probe.
   Police Commissioner George Fivaz has also sent a top team of 34 
detectives to Port Shepstone to investigate the massacre, headed by 
Pretoria detective Bushie Engelbrecht. Fivaz announced in a press 
statement that extra informers would be sent into the area and that the 
use of extra powers, granted to the provincial commissioner under the 
Police Act, was also possible.
   Engelbrecht's men began interviewing eyewitnesses and survivors of 
the massacre on Tuesday this week. The team has issued warrants of 
arrest for four suspects believed to have been involved in the attack. 
   In addition, a National Public Order Policing (Pop) Unit will be set 
up in Natal under command of former ISU commander Vernon Hunter. The Pop 
teams will set up temporary bases in various hotspots of the province 
and will concentrate on the South Coast.
   These moves represent an effort by the national police commissioner 
-- along with Mufamadi's office -- to stamp their authority on the 
province. The Inkatha Freedom Party has insisted policing is primarily a 
provincial matter and has already signaled its intention to oppose 
"unilateral" intervention by national authorities. 
   "We are worried by Fivaz's comment that more spies will be sent into 
the province as we have been victims of unlawful espionage on our 
officials by members of the intelligence agencies," said IFP secretary 
general Ziba Jiyane.
   The Inkatha leader says the new measures on the South Coast could 
amount to anti-Inkatha intervention by central government in the 
province. "We are not saying the central government should not be 
involved in security matters in KwaZulu-Natal. But Schedule Six of the 
Constitution says policing is also a provincial issue and as long at it 
[national intervention] is done in a unilateral way this is invariably a 
partisan approach."
   The action by the national police authorities and Jiyane's response 
indicates that the Shobashabane killings may have initiated a major 
conflict between the central and provincial governments over who will 
control the way KwaZulu-Natal is policed.

Mandela's Children Fund Corners Donations

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Marion Edmunds

   Johannesburg -  President Nelson Mandela's high-profile Children's 
Fund has netted more than R12- million since its inception last year, 
with a further R24-million pledged to it. while humbler non-government 
organisations (NGOs) are battling for money.  
   As a result, NGOs are frightened that Mandela's Midas touch is 
proving so successful that it is threatening their own ability to raise 
funds to care for South Africa's poor and homeless children. 
   These NGOs, many of which have lost foreign funders in post-apartheid 
South Africa, are desperate for larger donations from big business to 
help disadvantaged children, and are eyeing the millions in Mandela's 
fund with envy and reservations. 
   Mandela's Children's Fund has received R12- million, with a further 
R24-million pledged to it over the next five years. There are now 28 
members in the President's Club --individuals, businesses and foreign 
governments that have matched Mandela's donation to the fund and whose 
members are giving R150 000 or more over five years. The club includes 
US actor Denzil Washington, the Norwegian government, Barlows, Coca-
Cola, Pierre Cardin and M-Net.
   The marketing director of the South African National Council for 
Child and Family Welfare, Hennie Oosthuizen, said this week: "I believe 
that the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund has the potential to take donors 
away from child welfare organisations because it can offer exposure to 
donors, and all we can offer is accountability. We need some of that 
money in our organisation and we could use it successfully."
   The chief executive trustee of the Fund, Jeremy Ractliffe, responded 
by saying, "I do not know of any of our donors who have given to the 
Mandela's Children Fund through not funding some other NGO in the field 
we concentrate on ... I would welcome discussions with NGOs who feel 
that they have lost out to the Fund."
   It cannot be disputed that Mandela's name sanctifies his Children's 
Fund, giving it a political and emotional appeal of international 
standing. (Those who become part of the President's Club receive a 
certificate signed by Mandela, as well as a photograph of the donor with 
Mandela.)
   Smaller, humbler NGOs -- which have worked for decades in South 
Africa's forgotten communities -- are throwing up their hands in 
despair, saying that they just cannot compete with the Mandela name. 
This is ironic, given the fact that these NGOs were the unofficial 
conduit for foreign funds during apartheid years, funds which, in many 
instances, helped prepare South Africa and the African National Congress 
for the transition to democracy.
   Chairperson of the Save the Children Fund, Mary Hanna, said this week 
that it was becoming increasingly difficult to raise money and that 
high-profile funds were attracting donations which had previously gone 
to Save the Children. 
   "The demands are increasing and the funds are not ... we have had to 
severely curtail our nutrition programmes in places like the Northern 
Province, for example, and as far as we know there is no other 
organisation working there to take our place." 
   Johannesburg Child Welfare has retrenched 22 social workers this year 
to cope with the drop in funding, according to Anne Bown, manager of 
funding and public relations. 
   Bown said people were much less generous than they used to be and 
that they were struggling to find donors, especially needed as the state 
had cut its subsidy by R1-million, and foreign governments were giving 
to the Reconstruction and Development Programme. 
   The funding and development manager of the Child Welfare Society in 
Cape Town, Jetty Botes, said that the society's 1996 to 1997 budget was 
short by more than a million rand and that it would have to cut projects 
unless saved by a windfall.
   "Corporations provide 15 to 20 percent of our funding currently -- 
this is less than it used to be," she said.
   Ractliffe said this week that information and application forms were 
freely available and that he had distributed R3 500 brochures about the 
Fund.
   He said the Fund focused on organisations that were on the coal-face 
of development work and working directly with communities. The fund's 
brochure states that it assists organisations working with disadvantaged 
children, with a particular emphasis on children in detention, children 
who have had no formal education, who are handicapped, and homeless 
children. 
   Ractliffe said 92 grants had already been made, many to projects 
involving street children. Altogether R1,5-million had been disbursed 
and more than R5-million would be paid out in 1996, he said. The Fund 
intended to allocate not less than 75 percent of the interest from its 
capital base and 25 percent of its annual opening capital to projects 
every year, he said.
   The Mandela Children's Fund has, in conjunction with other NGOs, 
helped to fund a Youth Development Centre at Leeuwkop Prison in Gauteng, 
a similar centre at Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal, and has donated R38 000 
to the NGO Streetwise. The decisions about which NGOs and organisations 
to fund would be made at quarterly meetings by a committee of 14 
managing trustees.
   While the NGOs' official line is one of regret and restraint, their 
off-the-record comments tend to be resentful and, at time, vicious. 
"Nobody wants to say anything because it is politically incorrect to 
criticise the Mandela fund," said the source. 
   But Ractliffe is not exempt from criticism. He has been accused of 
trying to turn the Mandela fund into a personal empire, and of eluding 
telephone calls by NGOs attempting to establish information about the 
fund. 
   "Ractliffe is the fund," said a source. "You can't get past him."
   Ractliffe said, "I have no desire to create a personal empire. All 
the information about the Fund is freely available. People who want to 
talk to me should keep trying, because I am always here."

South African Mineworkers May Not Support Trade Union Strike

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy

   Johannesburg - The Congress of South African Trade Unions cannot 
count on the support of its main affiliate, the 300 000-strong National 
Union of Mineworkers (NUM), in its planned anti- privatisation strike on 
Tuesday.
   Although, as a Cosatu affiliate, the NUM is bound to some degree by 
the federation's decision to strike, ambivalence is being displayed 
among some key NUM members.
   The strike, aimed at what Cosatu terms the "unilateral restructuring 
of state assets", could fail, with one senior unionist, who wished to 
remain anonymous, describing Cosatu general secretary Sam Shilowa's 
militant stance as "mere posturing".
   NUM general secretary Kgalema Motlanthe was tight-lipped about the 
strike, saying it was "inappropriate to comment", since talks between 
Cosatu and various other parties could "succeed in reconciling 
differences" and possibly reach agreement on the objectives of 
restructuring within the public and other sectors."
   "All federation decisions are binding on affiliates,'' Motlanthe 
said.
   However, should the NUM, as a backbone union of the federation, fail 
to render its support, Cosatu's "show of strength" will not make an 
impact.
   Cosatu spokesperson Nowetu Mpati said she did not doubt the NUM would 
support the strike, especially as it participated in the decision- 
making process. "The strike will continue as planned, and we have 
distributed pamphlets in all the regions," Mpati said, adding Cosatu's 
affiliates had pledged "strong support" for the strike.
   The strike is, however, ill-timed, with factory workers returning a 
day before Cosatu plans to show its "force of strength". The Federation 
of South African Labour Unions (Fedsal) also indicated last week that it 
had no intention of participating in the strike.

Taxpayers to Pay Ex-Generals' Legal Costs

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Vuyo Mvoko

   Johannesburg - The taxpayer is going to pay legal costs for former 
defence minister Magnus Malan and 10 senior officers in their murder 
trial which begins in early March in Durban.
   General Malan and his co-accused, including former SADF chief General 
"Kat" Liebenberg, are accused of complicity in the massacre of 13 
civilians at KwaMakhuta in KwaZulu-Natal in 1987.
   The indictment against Malan and the others includes allegations 
about a secret sub- committee of the State Security Council which 
approved millions of rands for training Inkatha hit squads in the 
Caprivi from 1986.
   Malan and others were arrested after the Durban-based Investigation 
Task Unit found secret documents linking them to the training of the 
hit-squads and the execution of the massacre.
   Responding to a Mail & Guardian inquiry this week, Lieutenant-Colonel 
Damien de Lange, on behalf of the Minister of Defence, said defence 
costs of former SADF as well those of South African National Defence 
Force (SANDF) members involved in trials are and will be borne by the 
ministry. He would not explain how this decision had been reached beyond 
saying it was "at the instruction of the Treasury for Finance". He said 
he presumed the decision had been taken by the Cabinet.
   De Lange said there was no provision to recover the money if the 
accused were found guilty. He said some would probably not be able to 
pay back the huge sums involved in their defence. 
   Office of the President spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the payment 
of the defence costs of the Malan 20 was never discussed in Cabinet.
   The South African taxpayer has already paid out more than R3-million 
in legal costs for the defence of former policeman, Vlakplaas commander 
Eugene de Kock, in a trial which will probably end in March.
   African National Congress spokesman Carl Niehaus said the 
organisation was "extremely uncomfortable" with the situation, but 
understood the dilemma facing the ministry, and that as long as there 
was a legal provision it was difficult for the ministry not to abide by 
it.
   However M&G has learned there is some unhappiness about the 
government paying for the defence of Malan and his co-accused in the 
recently formed Secretariat for Defence. The Secretariat was established 
to ensure civilian accountability in the military.

BP Chooses First Black Exec to Lead Africa Division

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Lynda Loxton

   .TEXT  Johannesburg - Frederick Phaswana, the new chairman and chief 
executive of British Petroleum Southern Africa (BPSA) and head of BP's 
13-country Africa Division, is no cosmetic, affirmative action 
appointee, but a BP man through and through.
   This was borne out by the roar of approval that met the news of his 
appointment at the group's Cape Town offices from people he had worked 
with for more than 30 years.
   Not only is he the first South African to run the Southern African 
operation, but he is the first black man appointed to head one of BP's 
five regional divisions.
   The son of a tailor and a domestic worker, he was born in the 
Northern Transvaal town of Louis Trichardt in the heart of conservative 
white Afrikaners.
   A bright pupil, Phaswana was sent to a Calvinist training college for 
primary school teachers at Bethesda near Pietersberg at the age of 13.
   On completing Form Two, he went on to another church-run school, 
Emmarentia High School to complete his school leaving certificate.
   But his stay at the school was prematurely halted when, three months 
before he was due to write his finals, he was expelled. The pupils had 
been protesting against the creation of the Republic of South Africa and 
some were woken up at two in the morning. Torches were shone in their 
faces and rifles poked in their ribs.
   "They were only doing their job," Phaswana said without any 
bitterness.
   "I wasn't hurt or anything like that. I was just rounded up with 10 
others in my class, told to dress and put on a train back to Louis 
Trichardt.
   "They told me that I would not be able to write my finals, even to 
finish school at all, unless I joined the police or the civil service, 
of course."
   But Phaswana had registered to write his finals and had an 
examination number, which was all the examiners needed. So he was sent 
to a school in a rural area where he wrote his matric, obtaining a 
university exemption.
   Because he was good at languages, Phaswana set his heart on a degree 
leading to a career in court interpreting. His brother agreed to help 
him finance his studies, but either forgot his promise or found it too 
difficult.
   Anxious not to lose a good student, the university of the North 
contacted the then joint service company run by BP and Shell and 
arranged a bursary. The two companies set up in their own right in 1974.
   He went on to study part-time for an Honours degree in energy 
economics through Unisa and for a Masters degree in Dutch literature 
through Rand Afrikaans University. 
   In the meantime, he needed a job and went to the oil company saying: 
"Listen here, you gave me a bursary, now give me a job." The company was 
somewhat taken aback, but agreed to take him on in its personnel 
department.
   "I hadn't a clue about BP, personnel or anything else, so I asked 
what it was they did. When I gathered that they sat in an office and 
made plans for the chaps working at the bottom of the organisation, I 
said; 'Well, if that is what I am going to be doing, I think I had 
better go out there and work with the people on the ground. Then maybe I 
would become a better personnel officer.'"
   Phaswana rolled drums in depots and filled rail tank cars for some 
years but by 1973 he was a personnel officer and identified as a fast 
tracker. By 1988, he was appointed a general manager responsible for 
various portfolios.
   Phaswana was appointed to the board of BPSA in 1989, and in 1992 he 
became president of BP Nederland and BP Belgium, based in Amsterdam and 
Brussels.
   On the question of black advancement, Phaswana said that whites had 
little to fear from their black colleagues. Rather than complain about 
the lack of black skills, they should acknowledge that they themselves 
had been living in a restricted business environment.
   "In developing black staff, we have perhaps not applied ourselves as 
hard as we should," Phaswana said.
   "It is a difficult problem, but we could have moved faster, more 
fundamentally. There is headroom for everyone to grow now and that is 
perhaps different from the past."
   Phaswana takes over at a time when the South African oil industry is 
undergoing fundamental restructuring and he is under no illusions about 
the size of the task that faces him.
   After years of tight secrecy and government regulations covering 
virtually every aspect of the business, deregulation and a greater 
openness have become the order of the day.
   One of the most contentious issues in the industry is continued 
government subsidies to oil-from-coal producer Sasol. Even though these 
are being gradually scaled down, the fact that they continue to exist at 
all has been a bone of contention.
   "We in BP do not have a problem in investing in the new refining 
capacity the market will soon demand," Phaswana said. "The caveat is how 
you do this when the playing field, set by government essentially, is 
uneven."

South Africa
Rain Water Economic Growth

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Simon Segal
  
   Johannesburg - The South African Agricultural Union (SAAU) estimates 
that the good rains, should they continue into March could add 1,5 
percentage points to South Africa's economic growth rate in 1996 (and 25 
percent to South Africa's gross agricultural income of R30-billion in 
1995).
   This will account for around one-quarter of total economic growth in 
1996. It will also raise agriculture's contribution to gross domestic 
product (GDP) from 4,6 percent in 1995 to more than six percent.
   The only region in South Africa not to benefit from the rains are 
parts of the Northern Transvaal.
   The main beneficiary of the rain is the maize industry which is now 
looking forward to a crop of seven to 10-million tons. Last year's crop 
was 4,4-million tons. Local consumption is around seven million tons, so 
South Africa should be able to export maize this year and restore its 
stockpile.
   The wheat crop is estimated at 2,3-million tons (1,8-million last 
year) which should cover domestic consumption. Horticultural output is 
expected to grow 10 to 12 percent, while animal production should remain 
constant as herds are rebuilt.
   Despite the rains, the SAAU does not expect food prices to drop over 
the year as demand picks up when world food stocks are at their lowest 
levels in 30 years.
   Those foods that South Africa exports - mainly fruit and wine - could 
see price rises of over 10 percent. Other price rises should average 
around 10 percent.
   The rains will also not reverse the narrowing trade gap between 
agricultural imports and exports. In 1994, when South Africa enjoyed a 
bumper agricultural season, agricultural exports totaled R8,3-billion 
and imports R4,9-billion. The Agricultural department reckons in 1995 
exports were up 15 percent (to R9,5-billion) and imports 20 percent (to 
R6- billion). The rise in imports was largely due to loopholes in meat 
importation which has subsequently been tightened.
   For 1996 the "guesstimate" is for exports to rise 10 percent (to 
R10,5-billion) and imports to increase by 15 percent (to R6,8-billion). 
The trend is clear - in a deregulating agricultural industry, imports 
are increasing at a more rapid rate than exports.
   So the rains will bring more food, although not cheaper, and 
contribute favourably on a net basis to South Africa's balance of 
payments.

South Africa
Expensive Oil-from-Gas Plant Presents Conundrum

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Aspasia Karras 
  
   Johannesburg - Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs, the old 
stalwart of the South African political theatre, Pik Botha openly 
concedes that Mossgas was a purely strategic investment that made 
absolutely no economic sense. 
   In fact, so categorical is he that he wryly points out, "If this had 
happened in a private company, the board of directors would have been 
fired." 
   Barring the irony, the statement about one more apartheid white 
elephant, is illustrative of the current privatisation debate. 
   The gas into oil conversion plant doubled its projected costs, so 
even though the plant is now producing a cash profit, it will never 
manage to put a dent in the R11-billion that it eventually cost the 
state. This, however, is history. 
   Botha concedes that he would never have taken that cabinet decision 
again; the question that now prevails is, what to do with it, and who 
should do it?
   A brief summary of the "conundrum", as cabinet has characterised the 
issue, is difficult. 
   Mossgas and the Central Energy Fund (CEF) are pushing for an 
investment of R840-million in the Mossgas plant, in order to develop 
satellite fields and to introduce compression, from which they expect to 
yield a net income of about R2,5-billion in 26 months. 
   These figures have been challenged on the basis that the projected 
income was taking into account artificial elements, like tariff 
protection, and synfuel levy, which in light of the deregulation and 
rationalisation of government involvement in liquid fuels, is falsely 
premised. 
   The monitoring committee has opposed this, although it is prepared to 
contemplate limited compression, and has demanded that a survey of the 
marketability of Mossgas be undertaken. 
   The prospective buyer, or "invisible man", is being negotiated with 
the appointed consultants Rand Merchant Bank and international 
consultants Arthur D Little.
   Some of the prospective buyers include: a troika composed of Sasol, 
Sentrachem and AECI, who plan to convert Mossgas into methanol 
production; an elusive Taiwanese option that brings into focus South 
Africa's continued flirtation with the wrong part of China; Sasol; 
Gencor; and even a recent suggestion from Deputy President Thabo Mbeki 
that Malaysia is willing to bid. 
   The deadline for the consultants to make a judgment call is the end 
of February, and while Botha is reluctant to estimate a price tag, what 
he does say is that a decision needs to be taken urgently on whether to 
invest, as the oil well is about to run dry. 
   The projected 25-year supply has dwindled to a mere five which means 
that the elephant will lose even more investment appeal, if production 
stops altogether in 1997 and Mossgas loses its cash-positive position. A 
decision on whether to invest the R840-million is of dire necessity
   The question needs to be asked: why should the government privatise 
if there is an option of relative profitability? Neil Morrison of Rand 
Merchant Bank states that "To proceed with privatisation or changing the 
role of the state, it must demonstrably lead to tangible benefits for 
the various stakeholders, in particular labour and the historically 
disadvantaged."
   Wielding his double-edged sword, Botha is the first to concede that 
oil is one of those strategic trump cards for any country, and yet 
questions the rationale of state involvement in industries in which it 
has very little expertise, resources and skill. 
   The much-slammed Moseneke report, as well as the upcoming Cosatu 
strike, bring the question into bold relief. 
   In determining the country's long-term interests, the urgency of 
certain decisions takes on tragic proportions. Botha attempts to resolve 
the conundrum with a typical rough and ready, diplomatic answer, "Prize 
number one, for me is to sell it but also to negotiate that the new 
owner produces a new product, so as to continue to generate economic 
stability and development in that part of the country."
   He is full of those grand Rhodes-like visions, for development, 
eloquently conjuring up images of the Southern African Power Pool 
agreement to develop the Zaire rapids, solar power projects to be 
facilitated by the CEF, and tourist attractions in the Soutpan. 
   But most evidently the question of what is really in the country's 
good still troubles him. "Do you save on foreign exchange and earn 
income on fuel, or go for the jobsaving option that a conversion to 
methanol would provide? Perhaps a combination is more viable by 
retaining the state interest in part.
   "The argument could also follow a different route, create long-term 
viability, but lose foreign exchange and suffer temporary job losses."
   He is clear about electricity, though, "It is not in our interest to 
privatise, there needs to be centralisation, our status quo is a result 
of the fragmentation, there exist over 300 suppliers, and 2 000 tariffs, 
there is no clarity or security for potential investors. I have great 
faith in Dr Ian McRae (head of the National Electricity Forum) - he is a 
man of vision and imagination."
   It is probably imagination that is needed in the question of 
privatisation. Morrison argues, "Government has to make the choice 
whether to squander the future as a competitive economy or to make hard 
adjustments right now. Policy matters, the decisions government makes, 
affects directly which shareholders benefit and which don't."
   As to Mossgas, Rand Merchant Bank is still mum, arguing that it is 
premature to comment. 
   Botha, in a pithy allegory, sums it up by quoting a phrase that ex-
cabinet minister Piet du Plessis has on his prison wall, "In die konsert 
van die lewe is daar geen program nie" which Botha then slyly adapts to 
"In die konsert van Mossgas is daar geen program nie."

Soccer: Cameroon Lion Meet Home Team in Cup Openers

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Lungile Madywabe
  
   Johannesburg - South Africa opens the 20th African Nations Cup finals 
on Saturday with a tough clash against Cameroon at the FNB Stadium in 
Johannesburg, and in the Group of Death - the other teams are Egypt and 
Angola -- every point will be vital.
   Because of the recent problems the Federation of Cameroon Football 
(Fecafoot) has had with Fifa over the government's interference with the 
election of Fecafoot members - coupled with the bad result on the field 
-- Cameroon come here as underdogs. 
   But it must not be forgotten that six years ago Cameroon stunned the 
world when they beat two-time world champions Argentina in the opening 
match of the World Cup in Italy. Cameroon sank Argentina with a first-
half goal, and doggedly -- with nine men -- they defended until the 
final whistle to record a historic victory. 
   Rated as the "no hopers" in Italy, the west African country got the 
result that was to give African teams the respect they deserve on the 
international stage. 
   African champions in 1984 and 1988, and quarter-finalists in 1990 in 
Italy, the players of the Indomitable Lions will more than likely be 
able to withstand the pressure of the occasion on Saturday afternoon. 
   To use the words of one soccer official, 10 seconds before the game 
the South African players would have sweated three times more than their 
opponents. The simple reason is that Bafana Bafana have never played 
such an important match since their arrival back in the international 
arena. 
   But much has also changed since South Africa first took those first 
tentative steps back onto the international stage. South Africa can 
boast a run of seven unbeaten games this year and include in their line-
up of seasoned strikers the likes of Wolverhampton Wanderers' Mark 
Williams and Philemon "Chippa" Masinga of Leeds United. 
   However both remain doubtful starters. Masinga will only arrive on 
Friday as Leeds played a cup game on Wednesday and Williams sustained an 
ankle injury doing duty for his team last weekend. 
   National coach Clive Barker seemed undisturbed, saying: "I am sure 
everyone will be fit for Saturday." Williams may be fit but Masinga 
playing after 10 hours on the plane would be asking too much. 
   Previously players and officials have used jet-lag as an excuse for 
bad performances, but with so much to play for one hopes that there will 
be no silly excuses. 
   Neil Tovey, the South African captain affectionately known as 
"mkhukhu", will have to marshal his defence against the likes of 
Francois Omam Biyick, Augustine Simo, Alphonse Tchami who now wears the 
famous number nine Roger Milla jersey. 
   Cameroon coach Jules Nyongha will pin his hopes on the dazzling 
midfielder Roger Feutumba to exploit any South African weaknesses. 
Feutumba played for Mamelodi Sundowns for most of this year so he has 
experience of local conditions and players. 
   With injury doubts about their forwards South Africa go into this 
game without too many attacking options and Daniel Mudau, who came in as 
a late replacement for Sean Dundee, is also suffering from an ankle 
injury.
   Shaun Bartlett, who made his debut for South Africa in the recent 
Simba Four Nations Cup, will have to test his abilities against the big, 
strong Cameroon defence. 
   One thing that still baffles me is why the enterprising Umtata Bucks 
striker Brendon Augustine was left out. He last wore South African 
colours when he scored an equaliser against Mozambique in a friendly.
   Comforting news is that Barker said he would call on him should the 
worst come to the worst. The winger Helman Mkhelele should be a constant 
menace down the line if he is played.  
   Their financial problems aside, Cameroon are sure to give South 
Africa and their supporters a run for their money. The two teams have 
met four times, sharing the spoils twice, with South Africa winning one 
and Cameroon taking the other. 
   The tournament is played in a round robin system, with three points 
for a win. The top two teams in each group will go through to the 
quarter-finals. 
   At this knockout stage, in the event of a draw after full time, 30 
minutes extra time will be played followed by a penalty shootout if the 
two teams are still even.

Sailing: Yacht Rises To The Occasion

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jonathan Spencer Jones

   Cape Town - CAPE TOWN put on her finest with an almost windless 
morning giving way to a fresh 20-knot south-easterly for the start of 
the Rothmans Cape to Rio on Saturday, and hundreds of well-wishers 
lining the seashore and on craft from jet skis to ocean-going tugs 
turned out to cheer the fleet on its way.
   For the 46 entrants -- eight of the smaller yachts having taken the 
early start on January 2 -- the weeks and months, and in some cases 
years, of preparation came to fruition with the firing of the start gun 
by Deputy Minister of Defence Ronnie Kasrils at 3pm, and they were led 
off by the Whitbread 60 Corum Meteorite skippered by Frenchman Pierre 
Mas and German Hasso Plattner's hi-tech ILC 70 Fancourt's Morning Glory 
down to the first mark off Granger Bay.
   Rounding just astern of Corum Meteorite, Fancourt's Morning Glory's 
spinnaker was the first to fly, however, and she surged ahead to lead 
round the second mark off Mouille Point -- and take the newly instituted 
Telkom Trophy as the first yacht to do so -- before setting a westerly 
course to clear Robben Island to seaward.
   First of the South African entries round the second mark was the new 
Simonis 60 Warrior skippered by Rick Nankin, but opting instead to take 
full advantage of the south-easter, led the majority of the remainder of 
the fleet out of Table Bay on the "traditional" spinnaker run inshore of 
Robben Island.
   The fleet soon started to spread, however, and by the end of the 
first day at sea, during which Fancourt's Morning Glory covered a 24- 
hour race record of 330 miles, some 150 miles separated the maxis from 
the smallest yachts at the rear, with Warrior marginally in the lead on 
handicap.
   But day two belonged to the Lavranos-designed 77-foot maxi Daly's 
International Insurances skippered by Mike Daly sailing a more westerly 
course than the leaders and notching up 296 miles to put her into the 
lead on handicap, before reverting to the more north-westerly routing as 
her wind ran out.
   By the end of the third day, Fancourt's Morning Glory had 
consolidated her lead to almost 40 miles ahead of a neck-and-neck 
Nicorette skippered by Swede Ludde Ingvall and Corum Meteorite following 
a slightly more southerly route, as well as moving into first place on 
handicap, four minutes ahead of Nicorette, while Warrior had slipped to 
fourth, behind third-placed Wizard with Jan Reuvers at the helm showing 
her form after a slow start.
   In the cruiser monohull class, Durban yacht Dream Reach skippered by 
Colin Bryson held a marginal lead over Richard Holloway's Aquacoco, 
while in the multihull class, Colin Kenny's catamaran Manx -- sporting a 
revolutionary unstayed carbon fibre rig -- had moved into first place 
ahead of early leader Basic Instinct skippered by Kieran Draper.

Cricket: Winning Team Has Some Problems to Solve

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jon Swift
   Johannesburg - There is a time for reappraisal and reassessment in 
every sphere of diverse activity the universe has thankfully thrown our 
way. Such must surely be the case in the light of the truly heroic klap 
Hansie Cronje and his side gave the Poms over three glorious days of 
Cape sunshine.
   And equally gratifying to finally break this country's one-day duck 
after four abortive attempts against England in a stirring victory at 
the same venue just five days later.
   Right now, despite concerns about the brittle quality of the top 
order, there is the no doubt sage advice to the effect of the "if it 
ain't broke, don't fix it" variety being applied. This unquestioning 
philosophy has some merit, but there are some areas which can be 
addressed immediately before it all gets broke faster than anyone can 
fix it.
   The first is surely the question of a back-up wicketkeeper at 
national level. This is a priority both for the incumbent, Dave 
Richardson, and the future of the national team. Richardson has played 
every test since this country's readmission from the years of self-
imposed darkness and, it must be added, played every one with 
distinction. He has borne an unenviable task with equanimity and taken 
the pressures which have so often been thrust unwillingly on him low 
down the order with dignity and calm.
   But it also cannot be denied that at 36 he is getting very close to 
his sell-by date. It is time, perhaps, to use the lateral thinking that 
has so often been lacking in all this country's sporting endeavours to 
this particular problem which is fast closing in on the selectors.
   We have had any number of pretenders to Richardson's crown. Erroll 
Stewart has come and gone. Steve Palframan has come and gone and then 
come again. Gerhardus Liebenberg was offered a brief flirtation, and 
youngsters like Nick Pothas and Paul Kirsten are waiting in the 
provincial wings.
   Palframan is the heir apparent as the incumbent South Africa "A" - 
such an exercise in alphabetic semantics this name for a team - and 
among the 20 named for the initial World Cup squad. One must question 
his ability close to the stumps against a spinner like Paul Adams 
though. Adams is going to be around for a while. The man behind the 
stumps will have to grow with him.
   And why, too, did Palframan not do exactly what Richardson did when 
Adams had him floundering and ask the teenage wrist spin wonder to 
explain what he was doing?
   Richardson's perception of the Adams wiles improved dramatically 
after an on-pitch conflab at Newlands. For the reserve side against 
England at Kimberley, Palframan never quite seemed to get the hang of 
it.
   Liebenberg, one feels, will never wear the wicketkeeping gloves with 
any real panache, although there can be little doubt that he has a fine 
future as a batsman.
   Pothas is rapidly improving behind the stumps under the tutelage of 
Ray Jennings at Transvaal and has a maiden ton against the English to 
show that his batting is coming on in leaps and bounds.
   Kirsten has all the pedigree and the competitive nature of his 
pedigree and one feels that he will one day take the step that the 
Kirsten family seem to regard as a natural progression.
   But none of them look really ready to step in if Richardson decides 
to call it a day ... and yet there is an answer if the selectors look 
past the obvious.
   Rudi Steyn has all the credentials even if it is a while since he has 
stood behind the stumps. He kept wicket with some distinction for South 
African Universities and has also been considered good enough to open 
the batting for this country. He also has the advantage of nine years on 
Richardson.
   Steyn is, in perhaps a different light, the type of multi-discipline 
player coach Bob Woolmer is on record as saying he is looking for.
   The multi-discipline approach has already thrown up Shaun Pollock, 
Jacques Kallis and - if you include his batting heroics with Dave 
Richardson in the 73-run last wicket stand which ultimately was a major 
factor in winning the test and series at Newlands - Paul Adams.
   On Adams, several volumes have already been written about a man who 
has yet to reach his 19th birthday and play a hat-trick of test matches. 
   There are still some patently raw patches about him which a career 
slated to be a long one will surely iron out. 
   The unique strangulated action and a control far beyond his years are 
always going to give opposition batters problems.
   But Adams, who has already learnt to disguise his grip, needs to 
concentrate on the speed of his run-up for the arm ball he bowls so 
well. His pace quickens perceptibly up to the wicket and makes it easy 
to pick.
   The youngster also needs to learn that the simplest way to get the 
ball to loop up to the bat is to deliver from half a yard (it is after 
all an imperial game) short of the crease. 
   These fairly simplistic things he will learn. He is too good a player 
to ignore them.
   Pollock, too, has been a revelation. He has a superb action and the 
fire to take the batsman on physically which makes a great fast bowler. 
Surely, this cannot be argued after his five- wicket haul at Newlands. 
Or his four for 34 in the opening one-day encounter against England at 
the same venue.
   Grafted onto this is a growing confidence in his undoubted ability 
with the bat shown in the stand at Kingsmead with Allan Donald and the 
sparkling 66 off a like number of balls in the 50-overs match at 
Newlands.
   Kallis, while he does not have the pace of a Pollock or a Donald or 
indeed the frustrating guile of Adams, is a more than useful medium 
pacer and will only grow in this department as his test experience is 
rounded out.
   But there remains one point to consider. The pressure on Kallis with 
the bat is far more intense than the pressure on the Cape 20-year- old 
with the ball. 
   And one senses that while Pollock and Adams have been allowed to play 
their natural games, Kallis has operated under the severe restrictions 
of a preconceived game plan and his place in the batting line-up.
   It returns us to the use of lateral thinking. Kallis is naturally 
aggressive with the bat and equally at home in the troublesome No 3 
spot. Against England in the decider in Cape Town he was neither. And 
this with Hansie Cronje battling to find anything approaching the form 
he is capable of.
   Talent, it is true, will come through eventually, but placing 
shackles on it either slows the growth or stunts it altogether. Giving 
Kallis a freer rein while impressing him with his responsibilities at 
the crease could have been one solution. 
   Moving him up an order which has stuttered and started at the top end 
is another.

South Africa
Cape Town Presses Olympic Bid

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Julian Drew 

   Johannesburg - Eleven cities will go to the starting blocks in the 
race to host the 2004 Olympic Games, it was revealed in Lausanne on 
Wednesday. That was the deadline set by the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC) for the filing of candidatures at its headquarters in 
Switzerland.
   Until Wednesday it was like trying to predict the outcome of a race 
without knowing who the runners would be but the contestants are now 
clear-cut in the bid to secure the IOC's nomination in September 1997. 
Besides Cape Town the other cities are: Athens, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, 
Lille, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, San Juan (Puerto Rico), Seville, St 
Petersburg and Stockholm. 
   Although there had been much speculation about a Chinese bid, either 
from Beijing, who lost out narrowly to Sydney in the bid for the 2000 
Olympics, or Shanghai, they declined to file, much to the relief of 
South Africa. 
   Whether the mandarins in the politburo were too disheartened with the 
unfathomable workings of the IOC after losing with what they had 
incorrectly considered a winning ticket, or they were simply making way 
for their "comrades" in Africa, remains to be seen. But with China out 
of the way South Africa should have sole sway over the emotional and 
political votes. And, provided this country can deliver a competent 
technical bid, those votes should be enough to see the Games come to 
Africa for the first time. 
   Chris Ball, chief executive officer of the Cape Town 2004 Olympic 
Bid, was upbeat about Cape Town's chances, but he warned against 
complacency. "I believe every single candidate must be taken seriously. 
There are still 21 months of this process to go and a lot can still 
happen. There have been surprises in the past.
   "For example, in the contest for the Winter Olympics when Lillehammer 
won it was not the favourite. Therefore one should never discount one's 
competitors, " said Ball. 
   Obviously it is prudent to avoid counting your chickens before 
they've hatched for past experience has shown that the only certainty is 
that there are no sure-fire favourites where the members of the world's 
most exclusive club are concerned. 
   For historical reasons Athens was considered to be a foregone 
conclusion to host the Centennial Olympic Games this year but lost out 
to Atlanta through what many believe was the Coca-Cola factor. Also, 
1988 hosts Seoul were considered no match for Nagoya and Mexico City was 
thought to be the least likely of the four candidates for the 1968 
Olympics because of its altitude. 
   South Africa has much going for it in terms of "the missing ring" 
factor which refers to Africa (represented by the black ring among the 
five Olympic rings) never having hosted the Games, together with the 
enormous amount of goodwill that exists towards this country at the 
moment. 
   But there are also issues which will favour some of the other cities. 
South America has never hosted the Games, which could favour Buenos 
Aires or Rio. 
   South Africa should be able to count on Africa's 19 members among the 
IOC's full complement of 106 but with Istanbul bidding for the second 
time, six of Africa's 19 votes could join an Islamic block if talk of 
block voting is to be believed. 
   Rome can be expected to mount a strong challenge with the powerful, 
although not necessarily popular, athletics supremo, Primo Nebiolo, 
leading the hunt for votes - something he has proved rather adept at 
when ensuring his own position. 
   But Rome has hosted the Games before, as has Stockholm. The Swedish 
capital will pose a threat with its superb array of infrastructure 
already in place together with a proven record of efficiency and a 
national environmental policy without equal. But providing South Africa 
does its homework properly it is difficult to see it losing. 
   "Our responsibility is to make sure that we submit a very 
professional technical plan. We must not rely on emotion. We must 
compete and be professional and that's what we intend to do," said Ball.
   "We want our technical bid to be as competent as anybody's and I hope 
that we will then be able to persuade people not only that Cape Town is 
the best place to have the Olympic Games in 2004, but also that there is 
validity in the concept that an Olympics in Southern Africa can make a 
major impact on the socio- economic and socio-political future of this 
part of the world."
   Socio-economic impact is perhaps the greatest worry for most South 
Africans, particularly the residents of the Western Cape. Many people 
believe that the Games will prove to be an economic extravaganza the 
country can ill afford and that the taxpayer and ratepayers will end up 
footing any deficit.
   Ball and his committee are well aware of such perceptions. "We are 
starting a proactive approach in Cape Town which will be extended 
nationally to give more details of the real facts, our capability and 
the excitement of the bid. Until now we've tended to keep our heads down 
and deal with the preparation of the physical product. That was a policy 
decision. We felt that we couldn't go ahead and make a noise until we 
were satisfied we were on absolutely firm ground. We are now quite sure 
that we are on firm ground," said Ball. 
   What the South African public is going to want reassurance about is 
the cost of the bid, but if the preliminary operating budget is accurate 
there is no need for alarm. It is predicted that the total revenue for 
the Games from television rights, sponsorships and ticket sales will be 
R4,21-billion which will produce a net surplus of R94 million after the 
Games are over.
   These revenues have made allowance for R504- million to go towards 
the provision of facilities in a total capital expenditure budget of 
R1,761-billion of which only R978- million will come from central 
government. 
   These funds from government are required to upgrade the road and rail 
system in Cape Town and would have to be spent at some time in the 
future anyway. The government is therefore only being asked to bring its 
funding forward to assist with the staging of the Games. 
   This means a shifting in the priorities of some of the government's 
transport budget but in terms of the benefits of staging the Games it 
will be more than worthwhile. The bottom line for the ratepayers of Cape 
Town is that the Games will not cost them anything and they will be left 
with an excellent set of sporting facilities and a much improved 
transport infrastructure. 
   Of course this scenario relies on the assumption that Ball and his 
team have got their sums right. But with R2,5-billion in television 
rights already guaranteed (more than was budgeted for) from NBC's 
television deal with the IOC late last year and a well tested IOC 
marketing programme, much of the revenue is assured irrespective of 
where the Games are held. 
   The trick is going to be in keeping the cost of sports facilities to 
a minimum while still meeting the requirements of the International 
Sports Federations. Cape Town's operating budget is lower than Atlanta's 
(R5,69-billion) but higher than Sydney's (R3,46-billion at the time of 
bidding). Such figures can be misleading though because they do not 
always include the same things and the viability of Cape Town's figures 
will only really be put to the test when they are reviewed by the IOC's 
Evaluation Commission. 
   On January 23 the bidding cities will be briefed by the IOC in 
Lausanne on the electoral procedure. They will then have to finalise 
their bid books containing the technical details covering 19 different 
themes relating to the staging of the Games. 
   These must be submitted to the IOC by August 15 and then towards the 
end of September the Evaluation Commission will begin its inspection 
visits to the candidate cities. The commission will present a report to 
the IOC next February and four of the 11 cities will be nominated as 
finalists for the bid. 
   These four cities will then be allowed to canvass the members of the 
IOC and the host city will be selected in a secret ballot at the IOC 
session in Lausanne on September 5 1997. 
   Ball and many others believe the Games are an economic opportunity 
South Africa simply cannot afford to miss. Certainly the staging of the 
Games provided a major boost to the economies of Japan and Korea which 
went on to become major world players. But by the same token Mexico also 
held the Games and has remained very much a Third-World economy. Only 
time will tell which route South Africa will take?

U.S. Lawyers Advise on Constitution.TEXT 

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 9, 1996 (19960109) 
by Masautso Phiri 

   Lusaka - Two American public lawyers have praised the preamble and 
provisions of the 1991 Zambian constitution on press freedom and freedom 
of speech which they say echoes similar sentiments in the American 
constitution.   But they have advised Zambians to debate openly if such 
provisions are to become a reality.   "I am speaking as an outsider but 
I see natural rights of the individual in the words in the preamble like 
inherent, inviolable," said US lawyer David Putter.   Speaking at the 
United States Information Service (USIS) centre yesterday  in a 
discussion organised jointly by the centre and the Law Association of 
Zambia, Paul Berch and Putter pointed to some 1991 provisions which they 
said were similar to those in the American constitution.   "It is the 
principles and analyses of the American constitution which we can apply 
to the Zambian constitution. There may be parallels," Berch advised. 
"The preamble to the 1991 constitution recognised the relationship 
between the people and the government."   Putter added: "The language of 
the 1991 constitution recognises the individual person as the source of 
power." According to Putter the 1991 Zambian constitution "makes a 
strong statement which you will find in the American constitution" on 
press freedom and speech.   "Where government is based on the individual 
the scale of justice is tilted in favour of the individual and 
government has to justify its actions,"  Putter said.

Pro-Democracy Group Calls for Independent Electoral Commission 

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 10, 1996 (19960110)
by Reuben Phiri

   Lusaka - The Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) yesterday 
called on the government to seriously consider de-linking the Electoral 
Commission from government to enhance democracy.   FODEP's call comes 
barely a week after opposition parties called for the resignation of 
chairman of the Electoral Commission Justice Weston Muzyamba for 
abdicating his constitutional and legal responsibilities to the 
government. 
   FODEP alluded to this view saying even matters of extension of the 
registration exercise are being referred to cabinet by the commission.  
"Only cabinet can decide making the commission totally toothless," 
carped FODEP secretary Bishop John Mambo.   Mambo accused members of the 
ruling MMD of having a "short memory" because they had agreed during the 
Cathedral meeting in 1991 that the Elections Office would be autonomous.   
"We agreed that whoever comes into power and forms government, the first 
step was to de-link the Elections Office from government," Mambo said. 
"But it seems people have short memories."   FODEP said that the 
commission has to be seen to be independent and this is paramount as 
people are identifying it with the ruling party. 
   Meanwhile, Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president Alfred 
Zulu said extension of the voters registration will not make any 
difference to the apathy that has rocked the month long exercise. He 
instead suggested the issue should be first taken to parliament to amend 
the act which he described as outdated.   "The government should amend 
all acts, rules and regulations that impede initiative in the 
registration of voters," Zulu said in an interview yesterday.

Lusaka Stock Exchange Readies ZCCM Shares

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 10, 1996 (19960110)
by Sipo Kapumba

   Lusaka - Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) is finalising details which 
would lead to the listing of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) 
"B" shares.   LuSE general manager Charles Mate said in an interview on 
Monday that a lot  of work had been done so far towards achieving that 
goal and what remained was "tidying up the loose ends which are too 
numerous to mention".   ZCCM released a prospectus in February last year 
in which it stated that it would like to float 35,470,620 of its "B" 
shares on the exchange but to date they have not. And these account for 
39.7 per cent of ZCCM's total shares.   Anglo American Corporation, 
through its subsidiary company Zambia Copper Industries (ZCI) Holdings 
Limited, owns 27.3 per cent of these "B" shares while the rest are held 
by various sections of the public.    The government owns the remainder 
of the 60.3 per cent of ZCCM shares, classified as "A" shares.    Stock 
exchange analysts say the delay in listing the "B" shares was due to 
disagreements between ZCCM and LuSE about how the floatation should be 
done.   Last month discussions between the LuSE and ZCCM intensified and 
now there is speculation that the two have agreed on a date for the 
listing, but Mate  denies this. "We are working on it, but we have not 
finalised it. I can't give a date because I have not got one," Mate said 
on Monday.   He added that he was reluctant to give further details 
because any "careless and uncalculated statements could have global 
repercussions on stock markets".   But ZCCM insists all has been done on 
its part, and what remains is for LuSE to sort out."We applied for the 
listing so it is up to them to comment on the matter," public relations 
manager Francis Musonda said in an interview on Monday.
   But some analysts have questioned the wisdom of listing the ZCCM "B" 
shares on the exchange given that the company is experiencing declining 
production  and if the government sticks to its plans, it will not be 
until next year before the mines are privatised.   Theo Bull, a member 
of the Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industries (ZACCI) 
said in an interview on Saturday that it would be unwise to invest in 
the shares before fundamental issues like privatisation were addressed.   
In addition he said floating the "B" shares would not have much impact 
on ZCCM because the more important "A" shares would still be in 
government control.   Stock brokers, like Finance Securities' Nduba 
Namoonde, say the listing of ZCCM shares was welcome and it would make 
the LuSE the second largest  capitalised exchange in the region after 
the Johannesburg exchange and would lead to increased business on the 
exchange. 
   Namoonde said the prospects for the company were getting better 
especially that the government has indicated that it would like to 
recapitalise the mines with the involvement of Anglo American 
Corporation. He added that investing in ZCCM when the company is not 
doing very well at the moment means that people will buy the shares 
cheaply but would be able to sell them at a profit when the company's 
fortunes change.-0-

Government Extends Voter Registration

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 11, 1996 (19960111)
by Staff Reporter

   Lusaka - THE government finally succumbed to opposition pressure 
yesterday and extended the voters registration exercise by another month 
effective today. But MMD national secretary, health minister Michael 
Sata, has advised that extensions will not be upheld forever.
   "We can not keep on extending deadlines. What happens if again people 
don't register?" Sata asked in an interview yesterday. "Such extensions 
could derail our democracy because whatever register will be in place at 
the time of the deadline must be used." 
   And announcing the extension in Lusaka yesterday Electoral Commission 
chairman Justice Weston Muzyamba said the Elections Office needed K2 
billion to pay the officers running the exercise.    "I have been 
informed by the Director of Elections that K1billion is needed for the 
work done so far and another K1billion for the period that has been 
extended, " Muzyamba said. "We have to raise this money as soon as 
possible because without it, this extension will be meaningless, the 
registration officers need to be paid."   The exercise will run until 
February 9.    Muzyamba, however, warned that the public should make 
good use of the  extension because there might "not be another after 
this one". And Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) has hailed the 
government's decision to extend the registration exercise saying it was 
a "healthy sign" 
   "It's very important to note that the government can at least adhere 
to people's demands because it would not have really augured well had 
they  ignored people's calls," FODEP secretary Bishop John Mambo said in 
an  interview yesterday.   Last week opposition parties piled pressure 
on the government urging it to extend the registration period. Mambo has 
also said "in the future, the commission must be made totally, 
independent so that decisions like those of extending should not await 
the  government approval."
   He said the commission should be independent enough to look at all 
disputes arising from the elections in order to make the whole 
democratising process more meaningful.   President Frederick Chiluba 
almost missed the deadline for the exercise in Ndola yesterday when he 
was among the last people registering on the  scheduled final day of the 
exercise.

KLM Launches Direct Flights to Zambia

by Masauso Lungu

   Lusaka - KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' first flight to Zambia will touch 
down at Lusaka  International Airport at 14:20 hours today.The airline 
will fly twice-weekly, on Mondays and Wednesdays, into Lusaka using an 
MD 11 aircraft. And the northbound, or return, flights will be the same 
day.   Aero Zambia managing director Mengistu Yewon-dwossen has welcomed 
the KLM flights to Lusaka as a boost to the country's tourism 
industry."The flights will bring in a lot of tourists in the country 
from Europe and that will be beneficial to the country," Yewo-ndwossen 
said in an interview.   But Yewondwossen had some 'personal' worries 
about KLM's entry into the Zambian market. " At the moment we will not 
be affected but as soon as we fly to London I think we shall be very 
much affected as it will increase competion with us, and British 
Airways," Yew-ondwossen said. "But it will give customers a lot of 
choice."   Today's KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight is expected to be met 
by communications and transport minister Dawson Lupunga, the Netherlands 
ambassador to Zambia Jan Peter Dykstra and members of the travel 
industry.   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' MD 11 is configured to carry 37 
business class passengers and 260 in the economy section

Government Forecasts Six Percent Growth

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Anthony Mukwita

   Lusaka - A finance ministry financial expert yesterday said  Zambia's 
per capita income will grow by 6 per cent per year starting this year, 
following its move from the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) to 
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. 
   The expert, Hendrick Van der Heijden, disclosed this during a State 
House-organised press briefing. 
   Heijden, however,  said the growth heavily depended on how swift the 
government moves in privatising Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM). 
   "The current price of copper at the world market is $1.10 per pound 
and if Zambia increases to export well, the economy should be expected 
to be on track with our forecast," Heijden said. 
   He said with the availability of other exports at the export board of 
Zambia, no problem should be perceived in maintaining the growth rate. 
   "You will be surprised to find how much there is to export at the 
export board, flowers and other products, while if you visit the tobacco 
farmers, you will find them smiling because they are doing good business 
abroad," Heijden  said. 
   Zambia's graduation from SAP to ESAF is according to Heijden the 
largest contributor to the expected economic boom as it allows Zambia to 
borrow at  concessional rates. 
   But a press release by the World Bank shortly after Consultative 
Group meeting last December in Bournemouth said Zambia's external aid 
partners emphasised the vital link between good governance, economic 
growth, and improving the welfare of the Zambian people. The donors also 
registered concern on governance issues. In response, the Zambian 
government delegation reaffirmed its determination to continue on the 
path towards irreversible democratic change, including constitutional 
changes based on consensus. It also reiterated its strong commitment to 
free and fair elections. 
   But the government has continued to oppose and resist proposals by 
the opposition and civic organisations to adopt the constitution through 
a constituent assembly, insisting the parliament they dominate is the 
only legally empowered institution to do so.  
   "Everybody in Zambia is represented in parliament, and besides, only 
parliament can enact a Constitution while a constituent assembly can 
only vet some clauses," President Chiluba's public relations and press 
aide Richard Sakala reiterated the government's position at a press 
briefing at State House yesterday.

Zambians Urged to Take An Interest in Art

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Joe Kaunda

      Lusaka - A 50-year-old traditional potter has called on Zambians 
to develop an interest in art if they are expected to help preserve 
culture in the country. 
   Malita Chanda, who has more than 40 years experience in traditional 
clay pot making, said this in an interview on Wednesday at a Visual Arts 
Council (VAC) women's art workshop. 
   She said there was a need to learn simple traditional works such as  
clay pot making to help preserve our ailing cultural background. 
   "Tufwile ukusambilila ukub-umba ifya pala inongo ne fingi ifyaibela 
nga tu li no kusunga intambi shesu (We must try to learn activities like 
the moulding of clay pots and many other traditional works if we are to 
help  preserve our culture)," Chanda said in a local lunguage, Bemba. 
   Chanda, who is also a leading marriage counsellor in Lusaka, had been 
invited to teach women artists participating in the VAC women's art 
workshop skills in traditional pottery which she learnt while in her 
village in Kasama. 
   The workshop, which ends today, was organised to facilitate the 
exchange of ideas of women in the field of arts and attracted 22 women 
participants drawn from all provinces in the country. 
   At the same function veteran woman artist and VAC national treasurer, 
Agness Yombwe, on Wednesday revealed that the workshop concentrated on 
the exploitation of found materials (scrap material) which were 
inexpensive and readily available for use by the artist. It was  funded 
by the European Union/CICIBA at a cost of K3.1 million. 
   The workshop will be closed tomorrow by community development 
permanent secretary, Hellen Matanda with an exhibition of the artworks 
prepared during the 10-day duration of the workshop.

[Column] Market Economy Has Made Zambians More Productive

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Mwanachonga H Chipewo (Column)

   Lusaka - Scientists have dug up theories about human behaviour and 
have rightly postulated about what can make persons become ingenious to 
achieve a predetermined goal. The democratic governance  and the market 
economic system are the panacea which unshackles man from the bondage of 
dependance and indolence to the freedoms of choice, creativity, 
resourcefulness and ingenuity. 
   The last four years of practicing democratic governance and market 
economic system have vindicated this postulate. The moment the economy 
was deregulated and all impediments to trade both local and foreign 
removed, the once seemingly unwitting populace and docile citizenry 
simply jettisoned and reverberated into the commercial activity totally 
unprecedented in the history of the nation. Under the stimuli of hunger 
and poverty, the most aggressive among the citizenry sauntered into the 
world and brought into this country anything conceivable from the 
mundane to the most sophisticated to the benefit of all. In the 
euphoria, however, confusion has reigned. 
   The elements that have been caught on the left and napping in all of 
this ecstasy are the authorities. From empirical evidence and so far as 
things are happening, it is evident that the governmental regulatory 
bodies were and are still not prepared and have lamentably failed to 
cope with the dictates of the performance of the market economic system. 
The market economic system, while priding itself on the ability to 
provide goods and services in abundance and efficiently, more often than 
not  is wrought with vices and unbecoming trade practices which can 
wreak havoc in the economy. Fair competition is healthy but unfair 
competition is not. Unfair competition utilises resources inefficiently 
and erodes profit margins which are essential to the growth of any 
business enterprise. 
   Players in the market are not capable of regulating themselves for 
optimum operations. This is where different governmental bodies dealing 
with commerce and trade come in to establish rules and regulations to 
ensure that unfair practices are eliminated.  
   What should be borne in mind is the fact that the market economy 
calls for greater responsibility on the part of both government and the 
players in the market. 
   The government acts as the referee and for as long as the referee 
plays  the part efficiently and effectively, the players in the market 
will respond accordingly. 
   As of now, these regulatory bodies in government are dormant and 
starting soon, this article will begin analysing them one by one to show 
what they should do in order to help build a vibrant commercial practice 
in the country.

going International Tennis Championship, the Davis Cup, in the Kenyan 
capital of Nairobi. Zambia lost to Cyprus in all the three sets but 
managed to pull off a victory over Djibouti. 
   In the first matches against the much experienced Cyprus side, 
Zambia's Kachinga  
   Sinkala lost to Alkis Papamichael of Cyprus (6, 3) (6, 0), while 
another Zambian Sydeny Bwalya was beaten by Dembertos Lenodis (7, 5 ),

Sao Tome and Principe
President Selects Unity Cabinet

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Sao Tome - A national government of unity has taken over in Sao Tome 
and Principe after being appointed by President Miguel Trovoada to 
tackle the economic and social ills facing this former Portuguese 
territory off the coast of West Africa.
   The 12-member team headed by Prime Minister Vaz d'Almeida took over 
on January 5 but was not expected to endure much beyond presidential 
elections scheduled for March 3, only a month before Trovoada's mandate 
expires in April.
   The new government includes six members of the former Movement for 
the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP/PSD), which holds the 
majority in parliament and four ministers from the Independent 
Democratic Alliance (ADI) which backs Trovoada. One other minister is 
from the Democratic Opposition Coalition (CODO), which is not 
represented in parliament.
   The main opposition Democratic Convergence Party (PCD) which came to 
power in the years after the country abandoned single-party rule in 
1990, refused to join the national unity administration.
   D'Almeida on January 6 asked for a "grace period of 45 days to carry 
through some urgent measures".
   He said he would seek to "bring a new momentum to the administration 
to help the state restore its credibility" after the military coup which 
briefly unseated Trovoada last August.
   He vowed to be "rigorous and firm and to tackle the indiscipline and 
breakdown in law and order affecting the country".
   During his New Year message to the nation, Trovoada set March 3 as 
the date for presidential elections in the small Atlantic archipelago.
   Trovoada also expressed satisfaction at the outcome of inter-party 
discussions aimed at forming a government of national unity and 
thereafter named Vaz d'Almeida prime minister in place of Carlos da 
Graca.
   Vaz d'Almeida was deputy prime minister in Da Graca's outgoing 
government and is also deputy secretary general of the MLSTP/PSD 
liberation movement.
   Sao Tome and Principe, situated off the West African coast, gained 
independence from Portugal in 1975.

Ghana
Opposition Says President Must Resign 

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Accra - Two major opposition parties in Ghana have called on 
President Jerry Rawlings to resign following accusations by Vice-
President Kow Arkaah that Rawlings assaulted him during a cabinet 
meeting last month.
   Peter Ala Adjetey and Alhaji Asuma Banda, respectively leaders of the 
New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the Peoples Convention Party (PCP) told a 
press conference on January 4 that the behaviour of the president, in 
full view of the December 28 cabinet meeting, was unprecedented in the 
history of Ghana.
   Arkaah alleged that Rawlings kicked him in the groin, injured his 
left eye and tore his jacket in reaction to allegations of corruption.
   Arkaah, 68, said the violence had broken out after the president, 48, 
had walked into the meeting and accused his Vice-President of stating 
that corrupt practices went on during the regular cabinet sessions. 
"Before one could say anything, he gave me a terrible blow on the 
shoulder which sent me falling," the police document said, quoting the 
vice president.
   "I fell on my back. He began to pull me up but I would not allow him, 
so he tore up the shoulders of my jacket in the process. He then gave me 
a series of kicks in the groin," Arkaah said, adding that he never 
attempted to hit back "due to my respect for (Rawlings) as the President 
of the Republic of Ghana."
   But reading from a prepared statement, Adjetey said "the gravity of 
the act required that the president, in the interest of the dignity and 
honour of the Republic, resign his high office now."
   The incident was "not only unacceptable, but unpardonable in our 
social and cultural code of behaviour," he said.
   Rawlings' resignation is "the only way by which the dispute into 
which the presidency has fallen can be repaired," he said, urging 
Ghana's parliament to initiate impeachment proceedings against Rawlings 
should he fail to heed the resignation call.
   "The issue calls for a national, not partisan response as the matter 
goes to the very survival of the institutions of the Fourth Republic," 
it said.
   "Members of Parliament should not forget that this is an election 
year and (if they do not act) they would be left with the task of 
explaining to their constituencies why they could not take this action 
to restore the dignity of the nation," said Adjetey.
   Rawlings' National Democratic Conference currently holds 188 of the 
200 seats in parliament.
   On December 29, the cabinet confirmed that Rawlings confronted Arkaah 
on December 28 in reaction to allegations made by the vice-president 
that corrupt practices took place during ministers' meetings.
   The cabinet statement also suggested that unless Arkaah could 
substantiate his allegations, his presence on the cabinet would be 
problematic, but Arkaah has since said he would not resign over the 
issue, because Rawlings has no power under the constitution to sack his 
vice-president.
   But in his first reaction on January 8, Rawlings launched a scathing 
attack on Arkaah and asked: "How can a man who has formed an alliance 
with our opposition parties continue to be the vice-president of this 
government? He insists he can still sit in at cabinet meetings because 
the constitution says so, unless he tends to subvert the government from 
within."
   In his address during the third anniversary celebrations, Rawlings 
said the allegations of assault had soured the atmosphere for the 
Ghanaian government, its friends and potential investors.
   During the parade, watched by more than 15,000 people including 
diplomats, Arkaah sat passively beside his wife, Marian, and Rawlings 
and his wife, Nana Konadu, during the three-hour ceremony, during which 
the president took a military salute from 120 officers and 3,100 
soldiers.
   Arkaah, who had not been expected to attend, was greeted with cheers 
when his arrival was announced. Tension between the two men, who won 
elections on a joint ticket in 1992, has been common knowledge since 
early this year.
   In May, Arkaah called on Rawlings to rescind a controversial value- 
added tax, which sparked a wave of social discontent.
   A spokesman for the opposition Alliance For Change (AFC) said that 
Rawlings' behaviour was sufficient to merit his impeachment.
   "Rawlings is a disgrace to Ghana. How can a president behave this 
way?" he said. Rawlings has ruled this West African state since coming 
to power in a coup in June 1979.

Kenya
Government Agrees to Register Muslim College

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Nairobi - A directive by Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi that a 
Muslim teachers' training college be registered has brought to an 
amicable end a wrangle between the country's Muslims and the Ministry of 
Education.
   The presidential order on January 9 came following a meeting between 
the Head of State and a delegation comprising prominent scholars of 
Islam, Imams and Members of Parliament at Moi's Harambee House office 
here.
   The country's Muslim community, at loggerheads with Education 
Minister Mr. Joseph Kamotho over the registration of the shs. 20 million 
(US dollars 400,000) Mombasa (coast region)-based Islamic Teachers 
College in Mikindani area, had been warned by the ministry against 
establishing any academic programme. The Muslim community had earlier on 
expressed intentions to train 104 Islamic teachers annually.
   Consequently, the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM) had 
threatened to sue the government alleging religious discrimination while 
some zealots of the unregistered Islamic Party of Kenya (IPK) had 
declared a fatwa (death sentence) on Education Minister Joseph Kamotho.
   SUPKEM's argument was based on the fact that of the six private 
teacher training colleges in the country, five are run by Christian 
churches. They insisted that Muslims should also have their own colleges 
and charged that there is a serious shortage of trained muslims to teach 
Islamic Religious Education (RE) in schools. Most students are thus 
forced to opt for Christian Religious Education (CRE) which is more 
developed.
   Education Director Mr. Ezra Njoka had dismissed the problem as 
statistical. "We have enough teachers and we do not have the capacity to 
absorb them all. We are just not registering any more colleges," he had 
said before Moi's intervention.
   The delegation to the President's office last week was led by SUPKEM 
chairman, Prof. Al-Busaidy, who thanked the President on behalf of 
Kenya's Muslims and said there was no pre-condition for the Ministry of 
Education to employ graduates from the new college.
   The Ministry of Education plans to convert some of the 20 teachers 
training colleges it runs into secondary schools and polytechnics.
   Teachers remain some of the least paid Kenyan workers and often have 
their salaries delayed. Many Muslims however believe the government had 
blocked registration of the colleges - one at Mikindani, Coast Province, 
the other in Murang'a in Central Province - because it fears a 
connection with the IPK.
   Since its founding in 1991, the IPK has campaigned against what it 
claims to be official neglect and marginalisation of Kenyan Muslims who 
comprise about 10 per cent of the national population of 25 million 
people. Muslims, although spread out all over the country are mainly 
concentrated in the coastal region and northern parts of the country.
   On the whole, Christian-Muslim relations in Kenya have been peaceful 
but increasing suspicion seems to be rising between the two religious 
groups with the latter feeling the former are favoured by the State. 
President Moi is a Christian.
   Muslims have consequently cultivated a high media profile by 
sponsoring several programmes a week especially on the national radio.
   Although Christians have steered clear of the present controversy, 
there is no telling where the suspicion may end.
   However, by the time of going to press various reactions had been 
registered regarding President Moi's directive on the Muslim college.
   Opposition leaders and the unregistered IPK were of the opinion that 
Moi's move was merely a political ploy.
   Mombasa Mayor Ahmed Mwidani, in whose region the teacher's training 
institution is situated, supported the registration of the college 
saying the Head of State was concerned about the welfare of Muslims in 
the country.
   By January 10, students were reported arriving for enrolment for the 
1996 academic year.

Uganda
Anglican Head Reshuffles Leadership

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)


    Kampala - The head of the Church of Uganda Archbishop Livingstone 
Nkoyoyo has announced sweeping changes in the church in a move to curb 
what he called "corruption and inefficiency in the church top circles."
   The changes range from forced retirement of some of the Bishops whose 
terms have expired to forced transfer of some members of the laity.
   "Those bishops who have refused transfer should either quit or accept 
transfer," Archbishop Nkoyoyo said on January 8 in his first major 
statement published in Kampala since he came to office last year.
   In a pastoral letter entitled The Anglican Church of Uganda policy of 
work and guidelines, Nkoyoyo says the changes are meant to address 
"factors that have caused conflicts in the church leading to some 
followers quitting for emerging sects."
   The Archbishop said; "Some church leaders aim at only amassing wealth 
I will have no mercy on them." Although the Archbishop neither said when 
he would effect the changes nor named the leaders in question his 
remarks were generally understood to be reaction to the ongoing row in 
the eastern church of Uganda Busoga diocese, the biggest controversy in 
the church so far.
   Some Busoga Christians are locked up in a wrangle with their Bishop 
Cyprian Bamwoze whom they accuse of misuse of church funds.
   Bishop Bamwoze has recently rejected an appeal by Archbishop Nkoyoyo 
to consider retiring or transfer as a means to solve the crisis.
   Archbishop Nkoyoyo also said in his pastoral letter that the church 
of Uganda will soon issue its comprehensive position on general 
elections in the country scheduled for March this year.

young men between the ages of 18 and 40. Their objectives "are the 
encouragement of high ethical standards in commercial life, .. and 
service to the community."
   Receiving the water hand pumps on behalf of Ambassador Development 
Agency (ADA) which was behind their procurrement for the Makueni and 
Kitui rural beneficiaries, ADA Chairman, Dr. J.K. Yego, said the pumps 
will go a long way in benefiting "ADA outreach communities in semi- arid 
regions where water is scarce."
   In his speech, ADA Programmes Director Mr. Francis Muthoga, said the 
agency "works closely with poor communities in their endeavour to 
respond to people's spiritual and physical needs."
   The Ambassador Development Agency is a local, non-governmental 
organisation founded in 1985 and is committed to poverty alleviation in 
Kenya and beyond.

January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Tunis - The year 1995 was marked by an intense activity on the 
financial market in the Tunis Stock Exchange, with the global volume of 
transactions reaching 460 million Dinars.  An increase in the treated 
bonds was also recorded, with 34 million bonds exchanged in 1995 versus 
26 million in 1994.
   New legislation enacted in November 1994 and which became effective 
in 1995, encouraged investment in the stock market.
   Eight new companies joined the market through takeover bids, which 
has led to a balance between supply and demand and a decline of share 
prices.

[Document] U.S. Committee Protests Conviction of Ivorian Journalists

Africa News Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   New York. - Text of Letter from William A. Orme, Jr., Executive 
Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists,  to President Konan 
Bedie of Cote D'Ivoire.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to condemn the 
sentence imposed yesterday, 11 January, on Freedom Neruda, deputy editor 
of the daily La Voie.
   Neruda was sentenced to two years imprisonment and fined CFA6 million 
US$12,000) for "offenses against the head of state." 
   Before his arrest on 2 January, Neruda's colleagues, Abou Drahamane 
Sangare, director of publications of the Nouvel Horizon group which owns 
La Voie, and La Voie journalist Kore Emmanuel, were also each sentenced 
on 28 December to two years in prison for "offending the chief of 
state," and fined three million CFA (US$6,000).  La Voie was also banned 
for three months.
   Their charges stem from the 18 December La Voie article which 
suggested that Your Excellency brought bad luck to the Ivorian soccer 
team ASEC by attending the 16 December African Champions Cup final, 
which the favored ASEC lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates.
   CPJ contends that the sentences handed down against Neruda, Sangare 
and Emmanuel are excessive and unjustified.  Having previously written 
to Your Excellency on 4 January regarding this matter, we strengthen our 
call for the nullification of their convictions, and their immediate and 
unconditional release.
   We welcome your comments.

[Document] U.S. Committee Protests Arrest of Ivorian Journalist

Africa News Service
January 4, 1996 (19960104)

   New York. - Text of Letter from William A. Orme, Jr., Executive 
Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists,  to President Konan 
Bedie of Cote D'Ivoire
    The Committee to Protect Journalists writes to strongly protest the 
arrest of Freedom Neruda, deputy editor of the independent opposition 
daily, La Voie, and to condemn the sentencing of his two colleagues.
   Neruda was arrested on January 2, 1996 and held for questioning. The 
next day, he was taken to an Abidjan correctional institution and 
charged with insulting the head of state. 
   Neruda was out of town when his colleagues, Abou Drahamane Sangare, 
director of publications of the Nouvel Horizon group which owns La Voie, 
and La Voie journalist Kore Emmanuel, were summoned by police on 
December 21. Upon his return on January 2, Neruda presented himself to 
authorities.
   His charge stems from the December 18 La Voie article which suggested 
that Your Excellency brought bad luck to the Ivorian soccer team ASEC by 
attending the December 16 African Champions Cup final, which the favored 
ASEC lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates. On December 28, publisher 
Sangare and reporter Emmanuel were each sentenced to two years in prison 
for "offending the chief of state," and fined three million CFA 
(US$6,000). La Voie was also banned for three months. 
   As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of our 
colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ believes Freedom Neruda and his 
colleagues have been unjustifiably imprisoned, due solely to exercising 
their right to free expression. This right is guaranteed by Article 19 
of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 
9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, all to which, we 
respectfully remind Your Excellency, Cote d'Ivoire is a signatory. 
   CPJ strongly urges Your Excellency to immediately and unconditionally 
release Neruda. Moreover, we call for the reversal of the convictions of 
Sangare and Emmanuel, and their immediate release from prison. In light 
of Your Excellency's recent reelection to the Presidency, CPJ trusts 
that you will do your utmost to cease harassment of the independent 
press, and to ensure that journalists in Cote d'Ivoire may work free 
from intimidation and harm.
   Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.

[Document] U.S. Committee Protests Arrest of Nigerian Journalist

Africa News Service
January 4, 1996 (19960104)

   New York. - Text of Letter from William A. Orme, Jr., Executive 
Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, to Nigerian Head-of-
State General Sani Abacha.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to strongly protest 
the December 23 arrest of Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of the Lagos-
based Tell magazine, and to condemn the recent series of attacks on the 
independent weekly magazine.
   Igiebor, recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in 
1993, was arrested by six members of the State Security Service (SSS) at 
his home in Lagos. He was then transported to SSS Headquarters in 
Shangisha. Authorities continue to hold Igiebor in solitary confinement 
without charge, and are demanding that he reveal his sources for 
articles criticizing the military government. During interrogations, 
Igiebor has repeatedly stated that he receives no financial support 
outsiders or Nigerian citizens, and that any information he receives 
arrives by mail.
   On the same date of Igiebor's arrest, SSS agents confiscated 20,000 
copies of Tell magazine's Christmas Day edition. The week before, on 
December 16, 1995, 55,000 copies of Tell were seized from Academy Press, 
the magazine's printing house. Earlier this week, on January 1, Nigerian 
security agents unsuccessfully attempted to seize this week's issue of 
Tell, and subsequently resorted to seizing the publication from Lagos 
vendors.
   Igiebor's arrest followed the December 23 raid of the home of Tell's 
managing editor, Onome Osifo-Whiskey, and the December 15 detention by 
Lagos police of Adedisi Dejo, Emmanuel Piper, Yeni Oldwolabi and Iyi 
Isaac, also reporters of Tell.
   CPJ has also documented the December 15 arson of The Guardian; the 
December 16 siege of AM News; the December 19 police assault and 
detention of four photojournalists, Peter Obe, Segun Olakitan of Tell, 
Abiodun Ajala of This Day, and Bayo Ewuoso of AM News; and the December 
20 arrest of Lagos vendor Olabisi Akintoye for possession of 
"unpatriotic magazines."
   In addition, we note with alarm the New Year's eve bombing of the 
office of the Independent Communications Network-publishers of the The 
News, Tempo, and Tempofootball-which destroyed millions of naira worth 
of property, but thankfully caused no fatalities.
   CPJ welcomes news of the release of Fred Eno, senior aide to Chief 
Moshood Abiola; Wariebe Agamene, president of the Nigerian Oil and Gas 
Senior Workers Union; Amos Idalemo, also a union official; and Sylvester 
Odion Akhaine of the Campaign for Democracy.
   However, CPJ strongly urges you to immediately and unconditionally 
release Nosa Igiebor and to launch an independent investigation of the 
aforementioned attacks on the independent press.
   We welcome your comments.

United States and Africa 
Outlook for U.S. Policy 1996 

Africa Policy Information Center 
January 10, 1996 (19960110)
 
   Washington, D.C. - The political climate in Washington will likely 
remain extremely difficult for Africa advocacy this year. Funding for 
aid, peacekeeping and other U.S. international obligations is sure to 
come under renewed attack in the second year of the 104th Congress. Many 
congressional advocates for African issues, Republican and Democratic, 
are scheduled to retire at the end of the 1996 session, notably Senators 
Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Paul Simon (D-Ill.). And it is very 
unlikely that international issues, much less Africa, will figure 
prominently in the 1996 election campaigns.
   In general, therefore--short of a catastrophe on the scale of the 
Rwandan genocide in 1994 or Somalia's disintegration in 1992-1993--it 
will not be easy to attract high-level attention to African issues, even 
when they do not involve significant funding commitments. The one 
African issue that seems likely to stay in the spotlight is the campaign 
for sanctions to promote democracy in Nigeria--if, that is, the late-
1995 momentum of grassroots involvement and media coverage is 
maintained.
   Nevertheless, the prospects are good for maintaining some level of 
constructive U.S. involvement in strengthening ongoing ties with South 
Africa. Washington will also likely play a role in selected peacekeeping 
operations such as Angola and Liberia, in promoting debt relief for 
African countries, and in a number of aid initiatives. The extent of 
active U.S. support for pro-democracy and human rights efforts in 
Nigeria and other countries, going beyond business-as-usual diplomacy, 
will depend above all on the level of public pressure and press 
attention.
   
   Economies Grow, But So Does Debt Burden
   
   Economic growth rates for Africa in 1995 and 1996 were projected to 
be in the 3% range, considerably higher than the 1.5% average of the 
early 1990s. But this still falls short of the rate necessary to keep 
pace with population growth, much less provide a basis for sustainable 
growth. Reductions in flows of external assistance, together with a 
still-mounting debt burden, pose additional obstacles. However, rising 
capital flows into South Africa and expectations of increased growth 
there and in several other countries somewhat offset these general 
trends.
   A late 1995 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development highlighted prospects for foreign investment in Africa, 
which it termed potentially the most profitable world region. But long-
term economic difficulties and new burdens imposed by economic austerity 
programs mean most of the continent's people face a grim year of renewed 
hardships.
   Proposals for further action on debt reduction, including the more 
than $35 billion Africa owes to international financial institutions, 
will be under consideration in 1996. Congress may also try to shape an 
agenda for improving Africa's trade prospects. But both initiatives will 
have to overcome apathy as well as substantive opposition to new 
proposals.
   The prospects for economic advance also depend fundamentally on 
resolving and averting violent conflicts and on building and 
strengthening democratic institutions. In terms of security, the most 
intractable and devastating conflict in 1996, as in 1995, is likely to 
be the war in southern Sudan. But implementation of peace settlements in 
Angola and Liberia was still problematic as the year began, and 
escalation of mass violence in Rwanda, Burundi or both was an ever-
present danger. The struggle for democracy against the military regime 
in Nigeria is likely to be the most prominent African issue in 1996. 
Meanwhile, human rights activists and pro-democracy groups also face 
serious repression in a number of other countries.
   
   Countries and Issues
   
   Following are brief highlights of specific areas and issues on which 
U.S. involvement may make a difference this year.
   
   Conflict (Sudan and other countries): War continues in southern 
Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are caught in conflict 
between the brutally repressive Sudanese government and the Sudan 
People's Liberation Army, which has gained military ground in recent 
months. The international community is engaged in relief efforts, but 
efforts at mediation have stalled. Regime opponents in the north as well 
as the south have called for increased international pressure against 
the Khartoum regime.
   While on a smaller scale than in Sudan, ongoing or sporadic violent 
conflict or insecurity characterizes a number of other countries, 
including Algeria, Sierra Leone, Zaire, Somalia, the Tuareg area in 
northern Niger, and KwaZulu/Natal province in South Africa.
   
   Peace agreements (Angola and Liberia): Observers are hopeful that 
implementation of the peace agreements in these two countries will move 
ahead in 1996, but further delays are almost certain and renewed 
conflict a constant threat. In Angola, the demobilization of Unita 
troops called for under the November 1994 accords has barely begun, and 
government forces are highly suspicious that the delay will be used to 
rebuild Unita military capacity. And in Liberia it is still doubtful 
whether the resources and political will are sufficient for the agreed 
disarmament of combatants.
   
   Prevention of wider conflict (Rwanda and Burundi): The situation in 
these two countries continues tense and potentially explosive. Some 1.8 
million Rwandan refugees remain outside Rwanda, mainly in Zaire, where 
officials of the former Rwandan government responsible for the 1994 
genocide still hold sway over their army and most civilians. Delays in 
prosecutions for the genocide, and threats that the refugees might 
return or be returned home forcibly, are among factors making a new 
escalation of violence possible. In Burundi, ethnic violence will likely 
continue--and possibly escalate-- despite international mediators' 
efforts to maintain a delicate coalition between the predominantly Tutsi 
military and an elected multiethnic government.
   
   Democratization (Nigeria and other countries): The campaign for 
democracy in Nigeria gained new international prominence in late 1995 
after the Nigerian military regime executed enviromental activist Ken 
Saro-Wiwa and eight of his colleagues. Nigeria was suspended from the 
Commonwealth, and support for oil and other sanctions came from a wide 
range of groups around the world. Bills were introduced in the U.S. 
Congress which fell short of oil sanctions, but did include bans on new 
investment and a freeze on personal assets of top Nigerian officials. 
Governments were slow to move on more substantive measures, which were 
vigorously opposed by oil companies. The sanctions campaign will likely 
continue to grow in 1996, but it remains to be seen whether it can 
overcome excuses for inaction by governments.
   Meanwhile, in many other countries, notably Zaire and Kenya, the pro-
democracy momentum of the early 1990s has been difficult to maintain in 
the face of both repression and other ploys by incumbent regimes. In 
some countries that have recently held elections (for example, Ethiopia, 
Cote d'Ivoire), serious questions have been raised about the fairness of 
those polls. International donors, including the United States, have 
shown far more consistency in pressing for free-market economic policies 
than they have in demanding respect for human rights and political 
participation by diverse social groups.
   
   South Africa and the continent: In 1996 South Africa is likely to 
confront increasing disagreements among labor, business and different 
political forces over how to craft social and economic policies that 
address the legacy of apartheid inequality. The Truth Commission, headed 
by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, will begin its controversial work of 
investigating human rights abuses in the apartheid era. Conflict between 
the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party may escalate 
in KwaZulu-Natal, particularly around the local government elections now 
scheduled for May.
   Meanwhile, South Africa will be forced to deal with the challenge of 
identifying appropriate roles for itself on wider African issues, such 
as Nigeria. In doing so it must avoid the twin dangers of narrow 
isolationism and condescending paternalism toward other African states. 
Like the U.S. outside the continent, South Africa neither can nor should 
attempt to resolve every crisis. Its stance on key issues, regardless, 
will be closely watched by African countries and outside powers alike.

Burundi
[DOCUMENT] Security Council Condemns Killings 

United Nations Press Release
January 5, 1996 (19960105)

 ...United Nations -  The Security Council today condemned in the 
strongest terms those responsible for the daily killings, massacres, 
torture and arbitrary detention in Burundi and said they must cease 
immediately. In a statement read by its President, Sir John Weston 
(United Kingdom), the Council encouraged all States to take measures 
necessary to prevent such persons from travelling abroad and receiving 
any kind of support. It shared the deep concern of Secretary-General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the situation in the country and called on all 
concerned in Burundi to exercise maximum restraint and to refrain from 
all acts of violence.
   The Council reiterated that all those who committed or authorized the 
commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law were 
individually responsible and should be held accountable. It stressed the 
importance of the International Commission of Inquiry. The Council also 
reiterated its profound concern about radio stations which incited 
hatred and acts of genocide and encouraged Member States and others to 
cooperate in their identification and dismantling.
   Expressing grave concern at recent attacks on international 
humanitarian personnel, the Council said such actions had led to the 
suspension of essential assistance to refugees and displaced persons and 
the temporary withdrawal of personnel. It underlined that the Government 
of Burundi was responsible for the security of international personnel, 
refugees and displaced persons there and called on it to provide 
security for food convoys and the humanitarian workers.
   The Council welcomed the Secretary-General's decision to ask the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata to 
discuss with Burundi officials, steps which might be taken to defuse the 
situation and said it would consider his proposal for a deployment of 
guards in light of Mrs. Ogata's mission and reports reaching him from 
the field. It asked him to consider what role UN personnel in the region 
and other support personnel might play in Burundi.
   Stressing the importance of continued attention by the international 
community as a whole to the situation, the Council encouraged Member 
States to intensify contacts and visits. It reaffirmed its support for 
the Convention of Government of 10 September 1994 -- the institutional 
framework for national reconciliation -- and again called on all 
parties, military forces and elements of civil society to fully respect 
and implement it.

Uganda
Church Leaders Issue Warnings On General Elections

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Kampala - Leaders of Uganda's Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches 
have warned against intrigue, bribery and violence during this East 
African country's first election in over a decade early this year.
   "If any evil people come to you with evil money, dismiss them like 
how Jesus did with Satan," the Archbishop of the Anglican Church of 
Uganda Livingstone Mpalanyi Nkoyoyo said in a stern warning against 
bribery.
   The concern by the church leaders comes as both opposition candidates 
and those royal to the ruling Uganda National Resistance Movement liven 
up to Presidential and parliamentary elections expected to begin in 
March.
   In his New Year address the Head of Uganda's Catholics, Cardinal 
Emmanuel Wamala noted with concern "the serious disagreement" on 
Uganda's new constitution which he says may lead some people to go to 
"the bush."
   "Even (President) Museveni does not agree with some parts of the 
constitution like myself ... we should bury our differences and build a 
united Uganda," Cardinal Wamala said.
   The Ugandan Constitution which was promulgated last November 
entrenches and extends Museveni's nine-year old no-party system for 
another five years.
   Ousted Ugandan President Dr. Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress 
(UPC) and the opposition Democratic Party (DP) which have formed an 
Alliance under DP. leader Paul Semogerere say a constitution which 
imposes severe restrictions on political parties virtually banning them 
during the elections is "mockery of democracy".
   "It is like two men competing in a 100-metre race. One of them starts 
50 metres away a head of the other," Paul Semogerere told APS in a 
recent interview.
   President Museveni however dismissed the Opposition which have 
received sympathy from Western donors particularly the United States as 
"Foreign Parrots".
   "Although the basic underlined principles of democracy are Universal, 
the forms which democracies take must vary from one country to the other 
 ... parroting forms from elsewhere is a disservice to the development of 
democracy in our society," Museveni said in his New Year address to 
Ugandans.
   Meanwhile President Yoweri Museveni has commended the people of 
Nyabubushozi county, Mbarara district, 270 kilometers south west of 
Kampala for embracing the "gospel of development". He was speaking at 
the area church where he attended the New Year's thanksgiving service.
   He urged the church to get actively involved in programmes geared to 
motivate the people to work and improve household incomes in the social, 
political and economic sectors in the country.
   The service was delivered by George Birungi who also reported on 
steps being taken by the church to encourage income generating 
activities.

Egypt
Muslim Militants Kill Christians

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Cairo - Armed Muslim militants killed two Coptic Christian 
agricultural workers and dumped their bodies on a nearby railway track 
where they were crushed by a train in southern Egypt, police said here 
on January 4.
   Fundamentalists from the same group, the Jamaa Islamiyya, killed a 
third person and wounded five in an attack the same day in the same 
region of southern Egypt, a hotbed of extremists battling to overthrow 
the government of President Hosni Mubarak.
   The attacks took place in Minya province near the town of Mallawi, 
300 kilometres south of the capital, Cairo.
   In the first attack at the village of Al-Idara, militants shot dead 
Jamil Saad Said and Issa Yussef Georgi, whose crushed bodies were found 
on railway tracks by villagers.
   Police said the militants had killed the two farm workers because 
they suspected them of passing information to the security services 
about extremists hiding in nearby sugar cane fields
   In the second attack, a municipal guard was killed and three of his 
colleagues as well as two civilians were injured when Jamaa Islamiyya 
activists opened fire on them in the village of Gelba near Mallawi.
   On December 29, Islamic militants shot and critically wounded a 
doctor for raping a Muslim girl in a revenge attack on his clinic which 
left a Christian male nurse dead, police said.
   A group of gunmen broke into Dr. Boutros Maxwell Boutros's clinic in 
Fikriya village, Minya province, and sprayed the clinic with bullets, 
critically injuring Boutros and killing Christian nurse Makram Subhi 
Said, 45, before escaping, police said.
   Police said Boutros had previously received threats from armed 
extremists after he raped a 17-year-old Muslim girl from nearby 
Gemaliyya village, the hometown of a local militant leader, Farid Salim 
Kerdani.
   The girl's family had agreed not to seek revenge against Boutros in 
exchange for a monetary sum, a common practice in southern Egypt, where 
violent clan feuds are frequent and "crimes of honour" are often solved 
far from the courts. But armed Muslim fundamentalists from the town had 
vowed to avenge the girl's rape, police said.
   A day earlier, Muslim militants had also killed a tractor driver as 
he cleared sugar cane from a field in southern Egypt for police hunting 
fugitive extremists, police said.
   Police had ordered a group of tractor drivers on January 4 to clear 
away parts of the cane field near Mahras village outside Mallawi town, 
after receiving reports that militants were hiding there.
   Two extremists opened fire on the tractor drivers as they worked, 
killing Shahata Abdel Aziz Mohammed, 30. Police said officers returned 
fire but the two gunmen escaped.
   Militants frequently use the high-growing sugar cane fields in 
southern Egypt as cover for ambushes and hideouts.
   The latest deaths bring to 938 the number of people who have been 
killed since March 1992, when Muslim militants began a violent campaign 
to bring down Mubarak's government.

Mauritania
New Government Installed After Premier's Sacking

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Nouakchott - Mauritanian President Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya 
dismissed Prime Minister Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubakar on January 2 and 
immediately named Shaikh Alavia Oulod Mohamed Khouna to replace him, 
officials announced in the capital Nouakchott.
   The new premier has been Minister for Fishing and Economy since 
February last year.
   A former Finance Minister, Boubacar had headed the government for 
four years and no reason was given for his sacking, although an informed 
source said his departure would pave way for "a more politically solid 
team" to prepare for elections.
   Mauritania's opposition has been calling for the dissolution of 
parliament since the first multiparty elections in 1992, which it 
boycotted.
   Among other demands, they want a new electoral code, an independent 
judiciary and an impartial administration.
   And on January 3, Kouna announced his new government line-up, 
drafting in four new ministers and dismissing three others, a move 
political observers said suggested a continuation of Boubakar's liberal 
economic policies, which began four years ago.
   With the exception of the Rural Development and Environment 
portfolio, given to Sow Demba, all of the key ministries -- Interior, 
Defence and Foreign Affairs -- did not change.
   The new premier was replaced in his previous post as Minister for 
Fisheries and Maritime Economy by Baba Ould Sidi.
   Entering the government for the first time were Kamara Ali Gueladio 
(Public Health and Social Affairs), Boidiel Ould Houmeid (Commerce, 
Handicrafts and Tourism) and Seniya mint Sidi Haiba (Secretary of State 
for Women's Affairs).
   The three sacked ministers were Sgnoire Ould M'Barack (Public Health 
and Social Affairs Minister), Timera Boubou (Rural Development and 
Environment) and Mariem mint Ahmed Aiche (Women's Affairs).
   The shakeup comes just two days before a national convention of the 
ruling Democratic and Socialist Republican Party (PRDS), which will be 
centred on key decisions related to upcoming legislative and 
presidential elections.
   Reliable sources here said late December that general elections 
planned for February and March 1997 could be brought forward to the 
fourth quarter of 1996, but there was no official confirmation of the 
report.
   Local newspapers said parliamentarians of the governing party had 
been told of the possibility by Boubakar at a meeting.

Burundi
Despair Growing As Country Slides Into Anarchy

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Bujumbura - Fear has gripped Burundi as the country continues to 
slide into anarchy that threatens to lead to the eruption of the endemic 
ethnic bloodbath that has continued unabated in the two former Belgian 
colonies of Rwanda and Burundi.
   Burundian politicians have expressed despair as they see their small 
central African nation sliding into anarchy, while gunmen call the shots 
at the risk of sparking ethnic bloodletting as savage as Rwanda's 1994 
genocidal war.
   "If we are not vigilant enough, our country runs the risk of total 
collapse," warned President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in his 1996 New 
Year message.
   "The new year must be a year in which all these phenomena are swept 
away and defeated.
   The institutions, the numerous state services and organisations have 
the capacity to agree to work together to overcome these phenomena of 
fear, violence and uncertainty which threaten our people's future."
   He added: "I personally promise to do everything to root out of the 
state apparatus all those who are obstructing the state from operating 
normally and those who may try to sabotage it from within. The security 
forces and the administration must understand that they have no other 
raison d'etre than the protection of the interests of our people, whose 
primary interest is the right to life. In this struggle, the people must 
not be regarded as an object which can be manipulated to achieve 
whatever goals you want to attain, but as a partner, indeed the cardinal 
one," said the Burundian Head of State.
   The government radio echoed that warning on January 4 with the report 
of yet another massacre, which left seven people dead and 20 wounded in 
an attack in a southwestern town by men, some in uniform --wielding 
assault rifles and machetes.
   "The ideology of exclusion and genocide" is gaining ground and the 
economy is being destroyed, warned Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo in his 
own New Year message.
   In New York, United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
resuscitated a proposal he made in 1994 for a UN standby force to be 
deployed in neighbouring Zaire, and for guards to protect relief agency 
workers in Burundi.
   He warned of "a real danger of the situation in Burundi degenerating 
to the point where it might explode into ethnic violence on a massive 
scale.
   But analysts say members of the UN Security Council are unlikely to 
heed his call, made public on January 2 and the idea of UN troops here 
is fiercely opposed by the commanders of Burundi's own armed forces.
   That raises the prospect of an unhindered civil war on the scale of 
that in neighbouring Rwanda, where Hutu extremists killed more than half 
a million men, women and children in 1994 before being defeated by an 
army of rebel Tutsi. UN troops there failed to halt the genocide.
   Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, UN special rapporteur for human rights in 
Burundi lashed out last December at the international community, saying 
the passivity of the rest of the world was largely responsible for the 
fostering civil war.
   Most of the clashes here between Hutus, who make up 85 per cent of 
the population of 5.5 million, and Tutsis, who comprise 14 per cent but 
dominate the armed forces, go unreported. Diplomats and relief workers 
put the death toll at around 30 a day -- 10,000 to 15,000 last year, 
according to the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF - Doctors 
without Borders.)
   Thousands of Hutus have fled to Zaire, and even Rwandan Tutsis who 
had lived in Bujumbura since they were children have fled the capital.
   Eleven relief workers have been killed since August 1994, and a 
number of agencies, including the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC), the French-based International Action Against Famine, have 
recently suspended their operations or pulled out most of their 
expatriate staff.
   The Organisation of African Unity has discussed the probability of a 
UN-backed African force to keep the peace in Burundi, but the idea has 
been opposed by a number of influential countries in the region, such as 
Kenya, and appears to have made little progress.
   The government is a fragile coalition under Ntibantunganya, a 39-
year- old Hutu, and Nduwayo, a Tutsi. But the armed forces answer to no 
one but their commanders, and politics are increasingly dominated by 
extremists on both sides, observers say.

Malawi
State Appeals Former President's Acquittal

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
 
   Blantyre - The Malawian government has filed an appeal in the Supreme 
Court against the acquittal of former president Hastings Kamuzu Banda 
and five others on murder charges, a verdict that was seen here as the 
most controversial since the country attained independence from British 
colonial rule more than 30 years ago.
   Prosecutions Director Kamudoni Nyasulu, who led the prosecution 
against Banda over the deaths of four politicians, said January 4 he was 
appealing on points of law, pointing out that the High Court judge's 
summing up in the trial exceeded the proper bounds of judicial comment 
and made it difficult for the jury to convict the accused.
   "The judge misdirected the jury. All he was doing is to present my 
case and find faults in it," Nyasulu said of the acquittal on December 
23.
   The judge had told the seven-member jury that much of the 
prosecution's case during the five-month trial was speculative and 
circumstantial.
   Banda -- who ruled Malawi for 30 years before being ousted in 
elections in 1994 -- had been charged with conspiracy to murder along 
with his close aide John Tembo, constant companion Cecilia Kadzamira and 
three former police officers -- MacDonald Kalomba, Leston Kikaomba and 
MacWilliam Lunguzi.
   But in his ruling, Judge Mackson Mkandawire found Banda, Tembo, 
Kadzamira, Kalomba and Leston not guilty of murder and also ruled that 
Kadzamira and Lunguzi were not guilty of conspiracy to obstruct the 
course of justice.
   The jury's decision, which took just two hours to reach despite five 
months of trial, and the final verdict split the country along political 
lines, with supporters of Banda's opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) 
celebrating while many Malawians who have long been convinced of Banda's 
guilt were wondering how the jury arrived at its verdict.
   Justice Minister Collins Chizumila said after the verdict: "I haven't 
changed my mind that they are guilty. I don't know what went wrong. It's 
either incompetence or bribery. I've also heard the judge misdirected 
the jury."
   The judge had told the jury that most of the prosecution evidence was 
circumstantial and speculative. But the courtroom, packed with 
supporters of Banda's MCP, erupted with scenes of joy when the jury 
announced its verdicts and Tembo and the other accused leapt to their 
feet and gave the thumbs up sign, carrying shoulder high the senior 
British defence lawyer Clive Stanbrook.
   Banda, who once threatened to feed his opponents to the crocodiles 
during 30 years of untrammelled power in the tiny southern African 
nation, was tried in absentia because of ill-health and senility, and 
was at his house in Blantyre under Kadzamira's care.
   Tembo, believed to have been the power behind Banda as the former 
dictator became increasingly frail in recent years, told the crowd 
outside the courtroom that the verdict was "a reflection of the 
independence of the judiciary."
   The charges stemmed from the deaths in 1983 of cabinet ministers Dick 
Matenje, Aaron Gadama, John Sangala and parliamentarian David Chiwanga.
   It was officially announced at the time that they had died in a car 
accident, but an inquiry after Banda's ouster found that they had been 
battered to death, placed in a car and pushed over a cliff.
   The prosecution said the men had been murdered because they had 
become outspoken in their opposition to the misuse of government funds 
and were suspected of harbouring ambitions for power.
   A commission of inquiry after Banda's ouster had, however also 
established that they had in fact been murdered.
   The families of the four murdered Malawian politicians have also 
vowed that they would continue pressing for justice despite the 
acquittal of Banda.
   "We will continue to seek damages and find out who ordered the 
killings even if it means dying myself to find the truth," said a 
spokeswoman for the families, Mary Gadama, daughter of Aaron Gadama, one 
of the four politicians murdered in 1983. Mary leads a group of 
relatives fighting for compensation and for the murderers to be brought 
to justice.
   "How do you free murderers like that? It means in Malawi anyone can 
kill a person and get away with it. Somebody must be guilty of ordering 
the murders," she asked after the verdict was announced.
   Banda took power in impoverished Malawi after independence from 
Britain in 1964 and soon established a vice-like grip on the country, 
introducing a one-party state and ruling the country as a personal 
kingdom.
   He was accused of widespread human rights abuses while remaining an 
ally of Western nations for his staunch anti-communist stance during the 
Cold War, receiving visiting British royalty in a red Rolls Royce 
convertible and entertaining them to lavish banquets in his Sanjika 
Palace outside Blantyre.

Gambia
Junta Leader Announces Elections For June

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Banjul - Gambian junta leader Captain Yahya Jameh has announced that 
presidential and general elections will be held next June to restore 
normal constitutional democracy in this West African country.
   In his New Year's message broadcast on the night of December 31, 
Jameh said that the voting will be preceded by local council polls in 
May and that the Commonwealth would back Gambia in the electoral 
process.
   The three elections will be supervised by an independent commission 
recently set up by the military regime, which plans to return to 
barracks after 23 months in power, Jameh said.
   The military ousted civilian president Sr. Dawda Jawara in a coup in 
July 1994, prompting international donors, led by former colonial power 
Britain, to condemn the coup and suspend financial assistance.
   Jameh presented an optimistic account of the achievements of his 
regime, speaking of progress in education, transport, energy production 
and television.
   He said that tourists were flocking back after the "disaster of 
1994". This year, Gambia expects to host some 70,000 tourists, as in 
1992 and 1993.
   The Head of State also declared that Nigerian and Cuban doctors would 
take over from Chinese medical workers, who withdrew their cooperation 
after Gambia recognised Taiwan in July last year. Beijing considers 
Taiwan to be part of China.
   The presidential announcement came only three days after Captain Sana 
Babally, former vice-president of the tiny West African state of Gambia 
was jailed for nine years by a court martial here, after being accused 
of having plotted against President Jameh.
   Sabally was said to have headed two attempted coups -- the first in 
November 1994 and the second in January 1995.
   Jameh, who is chairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling 
Council, seized power in a bloodless coup on July 22, 1994 after 
toppling Dawda Jawara, who is in exile in Britain.
   Sabally, the vice-chairman of the Council, was accused of having 
participated in the January 1995 plot involving a Captain Sadibu Hydara, 
former Interior Minister who has since died in prison.
   Meanwhile, the military government is claiming more than US dollars 
11 million from Jawara for alleged fraud in an oil deal.
   In a statement published here on January 3, Jameh's government said 
it accepted the findings of a commission of inquiry into the deal set up 
in October 1994 under a Nigerian judge.
   The inquiry dealt with financial transactions linked to the supply of 
17.3 million barrels of oil supplied by Nigeria as aid to Gambia between 
1984 and 1988.
   Jawara, former Planning Minister Momodou Manneh, and a businessman of 
Lebanese origin, Jamil Said Mohamed, are accused of conspiring to resell 
the oil and pocket the proceeds.
   The oil should have brought in US dollars 42 million to Gambia's 
treasury, but only 2.6 million was actually paid in, a reliable source 
said.
   The statement said the government was demanding that Saidi Mohamed, a 
Sierra Leonean national, pay more than US dollars48 million to Nigerian 
national oil company.
   Former Sierra Leonean vice-president Abdulai Conteh, who was said to 
have facilitated the deal, was arrested last October and expelled from 
Gambia, where he had lived for several years.

Kenya
President Bans Scout Family Life Manual

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Nairobi - President Daniel arap Moi has banned a family life 
education manual compiled by the Scout/Girl Guide Movement in Africa.
   Announcing the ban on "Scouting Manual on Family Life Education in 
Africa", President Moi said on New Year's eve that the book contained 
foreign ideas and emphasised that not all things that have come to 
Africa are necessarily good for the continent.
   Moi directed that the sales of the manual compiled as a collaborative 
effort with the Margaret Sanger Centre of Planned Parenthood in New 
York, USA, be stopped immediately.
   The move is seen as placatory to the the Catholic Church in Kenya 
which particularly over the last two years, has campaigned consistently 
against the intended introduction in schools of secular sex/family 
education lessons which the Church claims would disrupt the moral fabric 
of the nation.
   The Scouting Manual on "Family Life Education for Africa" has been 
available in Kenya over the last eight years, but it came into 
prominence last August when the head of the Catholic Church in Kenya, 
Maurice Cardinal Otunga, who is also the Archbishop of Nairobi, and the 
Imam of Jamia Mosque in Nairobi, Sheikh Ali Shee, jointly set alight a 
pile of sex education books, condoms and other birth control- related 
items in a public ceremony in the city's Uhuru Park.
   But the African regional director of the Scouts movement Mr. 
Kieraithe Nyagah told APS he was apprehensive the negative publicity 
associated with the manual would cast the Scout/Girl Guide Movement in 
bad light.
   Mr. Nyagah underscored that the manual had been produced "with all 
the best intention in the world."
   "As scouts we have a duty to ensure that young people have a chance 
and access to materials that enable them to develop into wholesome 
citizens," he said.
   Some critics have charged that some of the illustrations in the 
manual were too explicit and indecent. Nyagah says these were intended 
to show the changes in a young person's body.
   While conceding that input came from all over the world, he 
emphasised that the bulk of the manual had been produced with local 
African expertise.
   Nyagah observed that no other country in Africa including the 
regional ocean nations, had banned the book.
   He observed, however, that like any other textbook that had been in 
use for sometime the manual was subject to review from time to time. 
"Where it has hurt the sensitivities of any community or religious 
affiliations, we are prepared to modify it accordingly," emphasised the 
Africa regional boss of the Scout's movement.
   Meanwhile, the presidential directive to ban the manual has received 
widespread support among Catholic clergy and bishops. Praising President 
Moi for his decision, Cardinal Otunga promised that the Catholic Church 
in Kenya would re-dedicate itself to strengthening the family fabric.

Finances Threaten Africa's Environmental Programmes

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Kafui Ameh

   Nairobi - African countries have been urged to intensify efforts 
aimed at achieving sustainable development through adoption and 
implementation of sound environmental policies. But as it came out 
clearly at the Sixth Session of the African Ministerial Conference on 
the Environment (AMCEN) in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, last December, 
financial constraints are the root cause of the continent's 
environmental dilemma. 
   Although the programme of action on the environment which gave birth 
to the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) was 
launched in Cairo, Egypt in December 1985, no deliberate programme was 
set up to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the continental 
organisation in 1995.
   At the Sixth Session of AMCEN held in the Kenyan capital from 
December 11 to 15, 1995, proceedings were dominated by discussions about 
the survival of the organisation and the source of resources to run it 
rather than achievements made in the last one decade.
   The tone was set at the opening of the Expert Group Meeting which 
preceded the ministerial meeting when the representative and Director of 
the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Africa Regional Office 
Mrs. Maria da Graca de Amorim called on African countries to focus 
properly on the situation confronting the continent.
   Mrs Amorim conceded that the African Ministerial Conference on the 
Environment had scored a number of inspiring successes such as the 
development and adoption of the African Common Perspectives on 
Biological Diversity and the significant inputs made by AMCEN to the 
process leading to the Regional Annex and resolution on urgent action 
for Africa with respect to desertification control.
   She however pointed out that the successful implementation of AMCEN 
programmes was being stifled by lack of financial resources and called 
for a discussion of modalities for fund mobilisation from member 
countries, bilateral and multilateral agencies.
   "There is an urgent need for AMCEN to streamline its programmes to be 
focussed more on sensitising African governments on sustainable 
development issues especially with regard to ratification and 
implementation of international conventions, and to back up these 
programmes with financial support," de Amorim said.
   She also called on the meeting to address the issue of formalising 
AMCEN by statutes as an intergovernmental body whose decision can be 
tabled at summit meetings of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and 
the establishment of appropriate institutional arrangements and linkages 
to make the conference secretariat more effective. Currently there is an 
amorphous secretariat comprising the UNEP, OAU and Economic Commission 
for Africa (ECA) personnel.
   "Do we want AMCEN to function independently or to remain an 
organisation that is permanently asking for charity?" That question 
posed later by the Senegalese Minister for Environment and Conservation 
of Natural Resources, Prof. Abdoulaye Battily reflected the mood of the 
ministerial meeting as participants considered the report of the group 
experts.
   Delegates expressed great concern about the unsatisfactory response 
by member countries to financial contributions towards trust fund agreed 
upon at the Fourth Session of AMCEN in 1991. Only Egypt and Seychelles 
had contributed US dollars 679,700 and 500 respectively towards the 
fund.
   The initial idea of the trust fund was that contributions would 
accrue over a five-year period (1992-96) after which interest yield 
would be used for the operational activities of AMCEN.
   After lengthy debate on whether to make contributions to the Trust 
Fund mandatory or voluntary, the African ministers decided that an 
urgent appeal be sent to member states to contribute to the fund while 
examining the possibility of adopting new measures of raising additional 
resources in order to facilitate the implementation of AMCEN programmes.
   The meeting also noted with concern the declining funding to the UNEP 
Environment Fund and urged all member states to honour their pledges to 
the fund.
   Perhaps the most significant decision was one to formalise the 
institutionalization of AMCEN as an intergovernmental organisation, 
providing the legislative framework including a constitution and related 
rules and regulations which will certainly cover financial 
contributions.
   The meeting also decided to continue with the 1994-95 programme of 
work into the biennium 1996-97 with some additional priorities. These 
would include sustainable industrial production, consumption and 
industrial development including aspects relating to the framework 
convention on change, environmentally sound management of all types of 
wastes including hazardous and potentially hazardous and toxic 
chemicals; as well as strengthening the African common perspective and 
position on the Convention of Biological Diversity through sensitization 
and awareness creation.
   Other priority areas identified included the rational management of 
African forests through the establishment of mechanisms for sub- 
regional cooperation and support to the implementation of the Convention 
to Combat Desertification and Drought.
   On the implications of major international events, the meeting agreed 
that AMCEN should fully participate in activities relating to 
environmental impacts within the framework of the UN agenda for peace 
and development and related programmes of action.
   The major international events highlighted by the Group of Experts 
meeting included the World UN Summit for Social Development held in 
Copenhagen last year, the 1995 World Summit for Women held in Beijing, 
China and the World Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II) 
scheduled for Istanbul, Turkey in June 1996.
   The AMCEN meeting also agreed that full support should be given to 
the assessment of environmental impacts of conflict and the resultant 
suffering by refugees and displaced persons as well as host nations.
   The session outlined five main areas of orientation that would form 
the focus of activities in the next two years. These comprise the 
sensitization and organisation of workshops, seminars and conventions 
within the available financial resources; support for the drawing up of 
national environmental plans of action and national Agenda 21 plans; the 
integration of the environmental impact assessment in development 
projects; capacity building, environmental education and public 
awareness; and the strengthening of sub-regional cooperation in 
environmental management.
   As the UN Under-Secretary General and Executive Director of UNEP, 
Miss Elizabeth Dowdeswell said during the opening of the ministerial 
meeting, AMCEN has a major role to play in reversing the continent's 
decline by judiciously using its vast resources, traditional solidarity 
and cooperation and international support.
   "The time has come for African countries to take their future into 
their own hands and not to allow their economies to be micro-managed by 
the international donor community. It is also incumbent on the donor 
community to listen more to Africa and seek partnerships as between 
equals, she said.
   While commending AMCEN for its contribution towards Africa's gradual 
transition to sustainable development in collaboration with the OAU and 
the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and other relevant regional 
and sub-regional institutions, Dowdeswell urged the Environment 
Ministers to press their governments to fulfil their financial 
obligations to the AMCEN Trust Fund to enable the organisation implement 
its laudable programmes.
   In his intervention, Prof. Battily had decried the presentation of 
lengthy speeches and rhetoric which did not address the real issues. 
"Where do African countries expect to get Samaritans to cover the 
financial aspect of the fight against environmental degradation?" he 
asked.
   Among the speakers who came up with some novel ideas was Samuel 
Nyambi, the Director of the New York-based UN office to combat 
desertification. Nyambi, a Cameroonian, suggested that AMCEN be renamed 
the African Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development 
(AMCED) to catch up with the spirit of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de 
Janeiro.
   Others also proposed that the conference be named the African 
Ministerial Conference on Sustainable Development (AMCOSD). Still, 
Nyambi argued that whatever name is finally retained, there was need for 
greater participation in the 1997 evaluation of the implementation of 
the Rio Conference Agenda 21 on sustainable development. "We need to 
prepare adequately for that session as we did before the 1992 Earth 
Summit because the issues are so crucial to Africa," he noted.
   In spite of the last minute shift of venue from Harare, Zimbabwe, to 
the Kenyan capital, the 20-plus Environment Ministers, more than 100 
government representatives and experts from 45 African countries, as 
well as about 25 international organisations who attended the Sixth 
Session of AMCEN, had enough food for thought.
   "We believe there should be greater inter-African consultation to 
ensure that we in Africa understand ourselves better and speak with a 
common voice at global fora on the environment," noted Dr. Farouk 
Brimah, Ghana's Deputy Minister for Environment, Science and Technology.
   Organisations represented included among others, the Organisation of 
African Unity (OAU), International Labour Organisation (ILO) the World 
Bank, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Southern 
African Development Corporation (SADC), and the UN Food and Agricultural 
Organisation (FAO).
   The Seventh Session of AMCEN will take place in Senegal in January 
1997.

Black And Beautiful But Skin Bleaching Persists

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Sam Gonza

   Nairobi - From time immemorial the enhancement of beauty has been a 
major preoccupation of the womenfolk. Not surprisingly, the beauty 
industry is among the ten largest industries in the world today. 
Unfortunately many products used in the pursuit of mostly "better" 
physical appearance have serious medical repercussions. This is true of 
skin bleaching creams, lotions, and soaps. In the Gambia, military ruler 
Captain Yahya Jameh has clamped down on skin lightening preparations, 
citing the medical dangers posed to the women in this West African 
country.
   On New Year's Eve, Gambian military ruler Captain Yahya Jameh decreed 
a complete ban on skin bleaching creams, lotions and soaps used as 
cosmetics by women in the Gambia. Captain Jameh said he had instituted 
the measure "for the good of the Gambian woman".
   But observers say the practice of bleaching the skin to obtain a 
lighter complexion is so widespread in Africa, banned items will simply 
be smuggled into the country. This is what has been happening in Nigeria 
for over 10 years now since skin bleaching products were officially 
banned in the mid-eighties.
   In spite of the documentation of the dangers over the last 20 years, 
millions of women continue to bleach their skins to obtain a lighter 
skin. The best approach to the problem would thus include education, an 
option already adopted by the Medical Women's Association of Nigeria 
(Lagos Zone).
   Among the main reasons cited by African women for lightening the 
skin, thus bleaching out the natural dark pigmentation that provides 
protection against the harsh rays of the sun - range from "men like fair 
complexioned women", "it is fashionable" to "purify the skin".
   Over the last ten years, the Medical Women's Association of Nigeria 
has intensified its campaign efforts to make Nigerian women understand 
that the process of lightening the skin is very hazardous indeed. The 
association has produced a pamphlet, Bleaching the Skin - What Every 
Woman Should Know, in which Dr. Osinuppebi-Cole observes that 
paradoxically while black people were bleaching their skin to look more 
beautiful, whites were seeking to acquire a turn by exposing themselves 
foolishly to the sun. "So while the blacks are seeking to become white, 
the whites are seeking to become dark, both exchanging good skin for 
cancerous skins", she says.
   In the 70s, skin bleaching creams containing as much as 7 per cent 
hydroquinone level - one of the main bleaching agents, were freely 
available in Africa. At the same time in America and Europe, creams 
containing one to two per cent level of hydroquinone were banned.
   Dr. Osinupebi-Cole laments that there was keen competition among 
manufacturers of skin bleaching agents and women demanded ever stronger 
chemicals. "The most serious damage to our women was done during this 
period," she argues.
   Today these soaps, creams and lotions originate in Asia, Europe, 
America and within Africa itself. One Irish woman Member of Parliament 
describes the trade in skin bleaching chemicals as "a scandal".
   Dr. Yetunde-Olumide says the habit of bleaching the skin "started in 
racially morbid countries like the United States and apartheid era South 
Africa.
   Hydroquinone and mercury in soaps are the main bleaching agents. 
Because mercury is absorbed through the skin it eventually leads to the 
development of various complications, notably kidney related.
   Officially, mercury products were banned in Nigeria in the mid- 
eighties but the same continue to flow into the country under such names 
as "Drula bleaching wax", "Skinguard", "Tura", "Concorde", "Roberts", 
"Neko", "Sukkisa", "Bango", "Jeribu" and many more.
   Dr. Yetunde-Olumide says the hydroquinone compound not only causes 
damage to the superficial skin cells, but has serious effects on the 
underlying connective tissues beneath.
   "Hydroquinone causes an acid called "homogentisic" acid to be 
deposited in skin tissue, eventually damaging the elastic properties of 
the skin as well as the ability of the skin to recover from injuries 
like cuts or surgery.
   Accordingly, long-term bleachers have serious complications when they 
go for surgery or even when they have minor cuts. "Wounds from even 
minor cuts become very difficult to heal. For the surgeon, it is a 
nightmare trying to stitch back the skin of chronic bleachers", says 
Olumide.
   Moreover, by removing the natural pigmentation of the skin through 
bleaching, the African woman is also exposed more intensively to 
dangerous rays of the sun. She becomes more prone to cancer of the skin.
   Dr. Olumide says at present there is no known cure for damage 
inflicted by skin bleaching. Having damaged their skin, some desperate 
women ask for a skin graft and feel terribly dejected when told that 
grafted skin cannot "take" because the entire associated structure had 
been damaged irretrievably.

Clergy Offers Solace To Pregnant Teenagers

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Dingaan Mpondah

   Nairobi - Shunned and blamed by their families for being persons of 
loose morals, pregnant unmarried women in Zimbabwe can now find solace 
in a church-based local centre that nurtures both mother and child and 
offers a stepping stone for a future with a purpose.
   Mwana Anokosha (local Shona language for "precious child") Home is 
the only centre of its kind in Zimbabwe and possibly Southern Africa. It 
offers temporary sanctuary to unmarried women, mostly teenagers with 
unwanted pregnancies who have been rejected by their boyfriends and 
families.
   Situated in Westwood, on the outskirts of the capital, Harare, "Mwana 
Anokosha" was set up in 1988 by the Shelter Trust, which is made up of a 
group of clergymen. It now has a full-time social worker who counsels 
and "rehabilitates" the destitute young women.
   When the women first come to the home, the social worker explained, 
most of them are so lonely, desperate and down-hearted that some have 
suicidal tendencies. A lot of time and effort is put into helping them 
overcome these feelings.
   In response to public criticism, many of the women wrote a joint 
letter to Harare's Herald newspaper last year and spoke frankly about 
their experiences. "We have been kept in an atmosphere of trust and 
confidence where we may await the birth of our children in peaceful 
surroundings. After the delivery of our babies, when we have grown to 
love them, we are able to be reunited with our families.
   "We are very upset to discover that some people feel we are young 
people of loose morals. This is not true, and can be confirmed by the 
people who know us. Most of us really believed in the proposals of love; 
we did not even think of using contraceptives ...," they wrote.
   The number of illegitimate or one-parent children in Zimbabwe is 
high. Despite the difficulty in obtaining official statistics on this 
sensitive issue, it is believed that roughly one in every four teenage 
pregnancies is illegitimate. Several young women have been convicted and 
imprisoned for baby dumping over the years.
   More than 1000 women have been offered temporary shelter at the Mwana 
Anokosha Home until such time that they were reunited with their 
families. However, besides offering refuge to these rejected pregnant 
women, Shelter Trust has now opened up a skills training centre called 
Mufandichimuka Training Centre in Harare, designed to offer a new lease 
of life to these women, most of whom could not support themselves and 
their babies when they left home.
   The co-ordinator of Shelter Trust, Sister Theresa Mangieri, said the 
centre has been named "Mufandichimuka" meaning the home of the 
resurrected.
   "When the girls come to us, they are always so desperate and without 
hope. But the moment they get skills they will then be able to live a 
new life. They are being resurrected hence the name Mufandichimuka," she 
said.
   The majority of the women who end up at Mwana Anokosha Home are those 
who dropped out of school before sitting for a public examination, 
either Grade Seven, Form One or 'O' Level and have no formal skills at 
all.
   Out of the more than 280 who visited Shelter Trust offices in 1995, 
56 per cent dropped out of school before sitting for a public exam while 
eight per cent were illiterate. Those who had work experience had either 
worked as domestics or vendors. Only seven per cent had either done 
dressmaking, knitting, till operating or First Aid. There was one 
university graduate.
   Sister Theresa told APS the number of under-age girls (13 to 17 
years) becoming pregnant was also on the increase. The majority of the 
abandoned women came from intact families, only 4 per cent came from 
single-parent families.
   "In practice, Shelter Trust has been approached by women, some of 
whom might have tried backstreet abortions and failed. With support and 
counsel, these women have developed a strong bonding with their children 
after delivery. Unjust social conditions and priorities of the parents 
and boyfriends encourage them to choose an option they are not 
comfortable with. The psychological damage of abortion for a woman 
cannot be measured. Women who have contemplated abortion, but have not 
acted, have a sense of well-being and joy after delivery," she said.
   The majority of the men inolved with these women were single did not 
want any responsibilities. Casual sex was reported to be on the increase 
as the use of contraceptives, according to the women, was almost non-
existent, despite concerted campaigns by the Zimbabwe National Family 
Planning Council.
   "In line with the needs of the marginalised single mothers we are 
going to start a day skills training. The centre is expected to be 
officially opened in January 1996 but a pilot project involving 100 
former clients was carried out from September 1995. We have sent out 500 
newsletters to former clients telling them about the centre and whether 
they will be interested and the response has been overwhelming. So far 
100 clients have said they would want to enrol.
   "Firstly we are going to offer a course in home economics, 
housekeeping, knitting, sewing and cooking - and later we will introduce 
practical courses. We are starting off with the areas that are necessary 
to them now. We will later introduce such courses as hair braiding so 
that they can earn some income," she explained.
   Apart from offering courses, the centre would, from time to time, 
invite public speakers on various topics including the Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and maintenance to educate the mothers.
   "In general, the women in our residential outreach programmes are in 
need of means of a livelihood after they give birth and are discharged. 
Their common cry is for employment. Our hope is that when the skills are 
acquired, the women will be able to earn a living either on their own or 
through employment," noted Sr. Theresa.
   Researchers indicate that male reluctance to accept responsibility 
for pregnancy, coupled with limited psychological and financial support 
from the family are all seen as the crucial determinants in baby- 
dumping, infanticide and child abandonment. And, according to the World 
Bank, the chances of women dying from pregnancy-related causes are 
highest in Africa among all developing regions of the world.
   This is largely due to the high population growth rate - now the 
world's highest at around 3.2 per cent a year - which is taking a severe 
toll on the health of the mothers.
   As a result, some 150,000 maternal deaths are recorded each year in 
Africa as a whole, a figure representing 30 per cent of all maternal 
deaths world-wide.

Mother Of All Jazz Festivals 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Itumeleng oa Mahabane 
 
   Johanneburg - Not quite Montreux in July or April in Paris, Cape Town 
in February nonetheless promises a feast for lovers of jazz. Next month, 
Cape Town will play host to the largest jazz festival ever held in South 
Africa. 
   The line-up includes some impressive artists: trumpeter Maynard 
Ferguson, Brazilian-born vocalist Tania Maria, guitarist Earl Klugh, and 
Don Grusin. The festival also brings back to South Africa singer Randy 
Crawford, while lovers of the big-band sound will be given the 
opportunity to hear the most famous of the biggies -- the Count Basie 
Orchestra. 
   After last year's debacle, when two Americans promoting a jazz 
festival in the mother city did a duck shortly before it was due to 
open, South Africans might well feel cynical. The prevailing air of 
scepticism has also meant that little has been written about the 
upcoming festival. But organisers Esther Miller and Gerry Spencer (who, 
it should be pointed out, had nothing to do with the earlier ill-fated 
event) have been working towards this for three years and insist that no 
one will be taken for a ride. 
   The two, both local jazz musicians, say intensive planning has gone 
into the festival, and that their approach differs significantly from 
that of last year's organisers. Firstly, Miller and Spencer say, no 
names were announced until artists' attendance had been confirmed. 
Secondly, sponsors were secured well in advance. The financial and 
logistical support of a major airline and financial institution has been 
secured, with American Express in charge of bookings and accommodation, 
and KLM acting as official carrier for the festival. 
   Spencer and Miller hope the festival will bring in hard foreign 
currency in the form of tourism. The sponsors are putting together 
special tour packages, while Captour has promoted the event in overseas 
exhibitions. Apart from a lot of inquiries, there are no firm bookings 
by foreign tourists as yet. 
   Certainly, the festival will give Cape jazz a much-needed shot in the 
arm (a dose is also needed by Johannesburg) The festival will make use 
of a range of large venues, including the Good Hope Centre, the Nico 
complex, and the Waterfront Amphitheatre and Theatre; throughout the 
week, smaller gigs will also take place at various jazz clubs. 
   Jazz students will benefit from workshops and clinics -- two a day, 
throughout the week - -- some of which will be conducted by Klugh, who 
is a musical educator. The creation of a scholarship for young South 
African musicians to study overseas is also in the offing. There will be 
collaborations between local artists and visitors, and Miller herself 
will perform with the Jack Van Poll Trio. 
   Miller and Spencer say they tried to cater for classical as well as 
mainstream jazz-lovers by inviting Wynton Marsalis to play with the Cape 
Town Symphony Orchestra (CTSO). Unsuccessful negotiations over a fee and 
bad timing for the CTSO put paid to that. But South Africans may yet 
hear the flawless if sometimes passionless trumpet of Marsalis -- the 
organisers say they will try to bring him out either next year or the 
year after. 
   Hopefully the festival will be a success, because Capetonians can 
look forward to this becoming an annual event. Miller and Spencer have 
secured the sponsors' support for the next five years, and are 
negotiating to have the festival concerts televised. 
   The Cape Town jazz festival runs from February 26 to March 3.

Of Patrons And Peers 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Carol Brown 
 
   Johannesburg - Gerard Bhengu, forgotten KwaZulu-Natal artist, is now 
the subject of a retrospective. 
   One of my childhood memories is of attending an art exhibition at the 
Payne Bros store in Durban. The exhibitor was Tretchikoff -- the 
controversial, popular and very rich artist who held his road shows at 
the elegant art- deco store which housed a gallery. It was interesting, 
therefore, to learn that Gerard Bhengu was also one of the store's 
proteges. When one of Bhengu's other patrons, Phyllis Savory, considered 
producing a book on the artist's work, she stated that she wished it to 
be "on the same lines as the Tretchikoff book that Mr Timmins produced a 
few years earlier". The book on Bhengu did appear, but, unlike his 
contemporary, Bhengu became neither a household name nor a millionaire. 
   While comparisons between the two artists are spurious, it is worth 
noting that both were popular and promoted by the same gallery, which 
operated with a commercial bias. However, the art market during the 
Fifties and Sixties was not geared towards the payment of high prices 
for works by black artists. Bhengu's first patron, Dr Max Kohler, 
encouraged him to sign his name as "Bhenger" in the hope that its 
Germanic sound would be more acceptable to a white art-buying public. 
   The retrospective exhibition at the Tatham Gallery has been curated 
to bring these facts to the fore. Works are classified in sections to 
highlight patronage rather than style or subject matter -- an approach 
raising questions of influence, personal agendas and economic pressures. 
This curatorial method, while relatively unusual in a South African 
context, demonstrates a serious art-historical approach to the subject. 
   Bhengu was born in 1910 in the mission settlement of Centecow, 
attached to the Marianhill mission, in southern Natal. It was here that 
he encountered Kohler, who was an amateur ethnologist and commissioned 
Bhengu to produce illustrations for his ethnological texts. The 
discipline and accuracy necessary for this type of illustration suited 
Bhengu's talents and he produced detailed and meticulous images. These 
were contentious among his peers: attitudes towards ethnicity, 
nationhood and tribal identity were highly controversial, particularly 
following the Native Administration Bill of 1927, which made tribal 
chiefs the leaders of all black South Africans, and exerted control 
leading to the bantustans and apartheid. 
   But it was through his portrayal of ethnic types that Bhengu's art 
achieved its popularity, especially among the tourists who frequented 
the Payne Bros gallery. Seeing a number of his sepia portraits together 
makes it obvious that he perfected a slick technique which allowed mass 
production, although this doesn't detract from his ability as a 
draughtsman. 
   As well as portraiture he depicted the rural countryside of his 
youth, but his view differed from the early white artists such as Thomas 
Baines, Jacob Hendrik Pierneef and Clement Senque, who showed the land 
as majestically devoid of humanity and waiting for the white settler. 
Bhengu's landscapes were peopled, showing the black person inhabiting 
and working the land. As discussed in the catalogue by Leeb du Toit and 
Zaver Dinos, these images could be seen to express ideas of rightful 
ownership and perpetuation. 
   According to contemporary accounts, his freest and most creative work 
was that which no longer exists except through photographs, sketches and 
verbal descriptions. These were murals commissioned by the herbalist EG 
Tembe in 1959, and a mural for the Wesleyan Methodist Institute in 
Durban in 1942. They were both created for black audiences and the 
latter was said to be the earliest example of black protest art in South 
Africa. Both these murals have been destroyed, but written accounts seem 
to confirm that the fact of a different audience affected his work 
strongly. 
   Bhengu died, poverty stricken and unheralded, at the age of 80. This 
exhibition highlights his talent and the manner in which economic and 
educational pressures of his time influenced his art. It forms an 
important addition to South African art history, but unfortunately will 
only be viewed in KwaZulu- Natal. It deserves a wider audience. 
   The retrospective runs at the Tatham Gallery in Pietermaritzburg 
until January 7, and at Durban Art Gallery from January 28 to February 
26.

Business and Finance
Not Nailed By Success 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Vuyo Mvoko  
 
   Johannesburg - A levelling of the playing fields is necessary for 
black businesses to succeed, argues Dr Nthato Motlana.
   Chairman of New Africa Investments Limited (Nail), Dr Nthato Motlana 
is not out of the running for industrial finance company Johnnic. He 
told the Mail & Guardian recently that he is planning to raise R6-
billion for a stake in Johnnic, one of the three companies into which 
mining house Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI) has been 
unbundled. 
   Johnnic controls Times Media Limited and the South African Breweries 
among others. Motlana says R3-billion of the capital will come from Nail 
and its subsidiaries, one of which, Metropolitan -- which controls 
Methold -- has over R8-billion in net assets. 
   Motlana does not hide his political leanings which, over the past 
couple of weeks, saw him being accused of meddling with the editorial 
freedom of The Sowetan newspaper. 
   It was alleged that Motlana had been under pressure from the African 
National Congress to force Sowetan staff to "toe the ANC line". 
   While he admits to having been approached by President Nelson Mandela 
who raised problems with some of the Sowetan's articles, the man who 
says he was once seen as "the Trojan horse who acquired the paper on 
behalf of the ANC", denies any interference. 
   How do his ventures benefit the black community? Irate, he replies: 
"Whenever anybody goes into business, he goes for himself. Anyone who 
pretends to the contrary is a liar or a fool. Write that down, and go 
and tell them!" 
   He pauses, then bursts into laughter, apparently regretful at his 
cantankerous outburst. Then slowly, he continues: "Anyone who does not 
sleep, preparing and going from meeting to meeting, is doing it for 
himself. What happens to other people is as a result of your own 
personal empowerment." 
   Indeed, Motlana opposed a move by Anglo American to transfer 20 
percent of The Sowetan shares to a black community trust with 
beneficiaries such as the Educational Opportunities Council, the Get 
Ahead Foundation and a host of homes for the mentally handicapped, 
arguing that black "entrepreneurs", like their white counterparts, 
should have the opportunity of real ownership. 
   Motlana denies purchasing the impoverished weekly New Nation, now a 
sister publication of the Sowetan, because of ANC pressure. 
   The losing gamble was owing to the role the paper played in the 
transformation of the country, he says, but if it does not recover in 
the next six months, "we'll forget it". 
   'You know," he says with a smile, "I've paid my dues to my community 
and my country. I cannot understand why they don't pick on (Real Africa 
Group chairman) Don Ncube, Thebe Investments, or the Kunene Brothers. Is 
it obscene to make money? 
   "There are others who make money but they don't go ask them what they 
do for the community, they do that only to Motlana. They must go to 
hell, man! 
   "I'm sick and tired of Sam Shilowa and Zwelinzima Vavi. Sick! Sick! 
Sick! When they get stuck in the middle of a speech they insert Motlana, 
whoaaa! Whether they do not have the intelligence to think further than 
Motlana, I can't understand." 
   Motlana had been foretold, he claims, by people like international 
businessman Tony O'Reilly, that he would be hated for his business 
acumen. 
   "Sometimes I get mad when people think I started being involved in 
business because the ANC was unbanned and Nelson Mandela got out of 
prison." 
   "My first company was called Phaphama Afrika Commercial Enterprises, 
formed in the 60s, when it was almost impossible to do so. You had to 
kick shins and push hard, there were no loans for black people and no 
premises in town. 
   "I'm chairman of Lesedi Clinic, the first black-owned private clinic 
in this country. I'm the founder chairman of the 80 000-member Sizwe 
Medical Aid Fund. We built the Takalani home for the mentally 
handicapped in Soweto. 
   "When people ask me, how do you benefit your community? I say look 
back at my record: I've been involved in politics since age 18; detained 
as secretary of the ANC Youth League; on the dock with Mandela in the 
'Sisulu and 19 others' trial of 1952; once was chairman of 18 community 
organisations; formed the Get Ahead Foundation; went around the world 
and collected money to create a fund that helped people like Sakkie 
Macozoma get a Masters degree in Communication." 
   "Even before Black Like Me, we started Africare, the first black hair 
products manufacturing company. We did not succeed because banks would 
not give us money, our guys did not have MBAs, and we had no marketing." 
   Nail's hopes to raise the capital needed to purchase a stake at 
Johnnic were once dashed by capital constraints, he says. "I hope people 
will not say the Motlana group is being favoured. We have that critical 
mass. 
   If we don't do it, somebody else will". 
   Motlana says Nail was interested in buying a portion of Telkom, but 
was barred by Telkom's insistence that foreign companies must come, not 
in partnerships with local black companies in the name of black economic 
empowerment, but on their own. 
   He laments this, arguing no black company can provide "international 
connectivity, foreign capital, better management and new technology." 
   With regard to the pyramid control of businesses in the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange, he says it "has been the standard structure in South 
Africa. Look at Murray and Roberts, Sancorp, Sanlam, Anglo American. 
Then when a young black company like Nail goes to the stock exchange, 
they say No." 
   Talk of flattening the pyramids, he says, is not fair to the emerging 
black business, "there should first be a levelling of playing fields." 
   On Nail's plans for 1996: "We want to consolidate. We'd like to focus 
on telecommunications, obtain a TV licence, increase our stake in 
newspapers, and I won't tell you the rest." 
   "What people should be asking is, how did you get where you are. We 
can share ideas, form groups together and move forward."

South Africa 
Cricket: Breathing New Life Into An Old Game 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Jon Swift  
 
   Johannesburg - Paul Adams has brought unbridled enthusiasm and joy to 
a team which already has grit and courage 
   It is well as we move into a new year to savour some of the tragedies 
and failures of the 12 months just past. For the cricketers contesting 
the current series, the breaking of a savage countrywide drought has 
been an unwanted hindrance. For the squatters of Maritzburg it has meant 
total devastation and, in well over 100 cases, loss of life. 
   But on both admittedly widely different counts, one cannot but 
rejoice in the resilience of the human condition. The surviving 
squatters are hastily rebuilding their shattered lives and a nation 
mourns for them as they fight their way out of the morass of a 
catastrophic natural disaster. 
   And surely, no South African -- no matter how insensitive -- can see 
the lack of playing days the heavens have allowed against the touring 
English under Mike Atherton against any other backdrop. 
   Yes, the cricket is important and as lifegiving in its own way as the 
waters which have, in their overabundance after almost a decade of arid 
refusal, abruptly taken the lives of so many. 
   And yes, it is important to all of us in this emergent admix of 
peoples and tongues, cultures and conditioning, that the nation have 
success to show in the face of such adversities. 
   For as the flood-ravaged communities on the banks of the Umsunduzi 
tackle their devastated lives anew, cricket has been given a like chance 
to present a renewal of spirit to graft onto the courage and fortitude 
which has marked the ethos of this country's teams since our 
readmittance in 1992. 
   It has not been an easy series to quantify and certainly not an easy 
one for the players of both sides to contest. The disappointment of the 
rained-out first and third tests at Centurion Park and Kingsmead have 
been one factor. 
   The refusal of Atherton and his English batesman to bow to the raw 
pace of the South Africans has been another. Certainly, Atherton's 
unbeaten 185-run, 10-hour 44-minute stay at the crease to deny a result 
at the Wanderers in an innings of true cricketing integrity is not an 
individual effort which will be lightly discounted. 
   Neither can you lightly dismiss the maiden century by the gritty Gary 
Kirsten at the Wanderers or his two half-centuries which earned him the 
Man of the Match award in the drawn fourth Test at St George's Park last 
week. 
   But it was in the disappointment of Port Elizabeth with yet another 
Test without a result in a series which had rapidly been running out of 
steam that the essence of rebirth came to light. And fitting that St 
George's Park, the venue for the first international this country ever 
played when they took the field against CA Smith's English invaders back 
in 1889, should have provided it. 
   For two things made this meeting between South Africa and England 
different from any international played before. The first was a chubby-
faced youngster from the humble environs of Grassy Park on the Cape 
Flats with the strangled action of a capsized terrapin. 
   The second was a muscular politician with thick spectacles, a voice 
like broken glass and a former postal address on an isolated island not 
far off the coast from the mountain which looms large over Newlands 
where the two teams are currently engaged in the series decider. 
   Paul Adams became the youngest player to wear cricket's green and 
gold at 18 years and 340 days. It was only his sixth first-class match, 
an honour he rightly earned and, many would argue, two tests overdue. 
   Coach Bob Woolmer summed it up in one succinct phrase: "He looked 
like he's played Test cricket for 15 years," he said. Indeed. 
   Adams took a modest four wickets on a flat and unresponsive pitch in 
his debut, but in this performance, there was the roots of a renaissance 
in the game. Adams plays the game with the unbridled enthusiasm and 
inner joy which its originators in the Vale of Hambledon surely intended 
for the world's most glorious game. 
   In this alone, Adams has something to give back to the team which the 
exposure to the professional pragmatism of the English and the cynical 
sledging of the Aussies have taken from it. 
   It would be both premature and unpardonable to heap all the 
responsibility for ensuring this new spirit follows through on his young 
shoulders, but the sight of captain Hansie Cronje's smile when Adams 
dismissed Graham Thorpe to register what we must believe will be the 
first of many Test victims was evidence enough that the young man has a 
special magic about him. 
   And, just for a moment review the new life Adams injected into the St 
George's Park brass ensemble. The music even had Jonty Rhodes turning 
Mapantsula in the field. If this is the new voice of South African 
cricket, long may that voice roar. 
   Which brings us to the second man in the equation, Minister of Sport 
Steve Tshwete. Tshwete has never been shy of tacking his flag to the 
mast. He cried openly at South Africa's early cricketing successes and, 
though an avowed rugby man, has been one of the great advocates of the 
game under the new dispensation. 
   Tshwete forsook the padded seats of the official enclave, shed his 
jacket and took to the stands to join the extended membership band, wave 
the flag and add his voice to the on-going celebration that was the very 
heart of this dull draw. 
   One shudders to think of the discord Tshwete's vocal cords engendered 
in his immediate surroundings. But in Tshwete doing what he did, there 
was the very embodiment of what Krish Mackerdhuj and Ali Bacher had 
claimed as administrators and Kepler Wessels, Cronje and the teams they 
have led have attempted so ardently and so well to put into practice as 
players. 
   It is well that Newlands -- incidentally the venue of this country's 
second Test against Smith's tourists before the turn of the century -- 
has become so vital in the equation of the current England tour. 
   No cricket lover would begrudge the fact that a ground which retains 
its beauty and majesty despite the ravages development has wrought, 
should be the place to settle matters once and for all. 
   It is home to Adams, Kirsten and Brian McMillan -- perhaps the only 
player alongside Donald who can claim true world class among the South 
Africans during this series -- although the young spin bowler can only 
claim a fleeting relationship. 
   The crux of the issue though is not that Kirsten and McMillan have 
got centuries. Or that Atherton and Graeme Hick -- a superb 141 at 
Centurion Park -- have managed their top scores in Test cricket. 
   Neither does it hinge on wicketkeeper Jack Russell's world record 11 
dismissals behind the stumps to some wayward South African batting and 
his stubborn refusal to leave the crease after Meyrick Pringle had given 
him an early life in the same match. Or even that Shaun Pollock is 
developing into both a frighteningly dangerous new ball exponent and a 
polished lower middle order bat. 
   It all really hangs on a contrast of attitude. 
   England have always seemed to be playing not to lose. 
   The naggingly negative line adopted by Dominic Cork -- far and away 
the best of the England bowlers on tour -- and Richard Illingworth in 
the second innings at St George's is as much evidence of this as the way 
the tourists have packed their batting line-up and consistently refused 
to employ the erratic power and pace of Devon Malcolm. 
   Cronje and his side have played to win. That they have not yet 
managed this is proof of Woolmer's contention that they are not a 
collection of individual stars, but rather a cohesive, tough and 
sometimes uncompromising collective. 
   In this, perhaps Cronje and his men embody on the sportsfield, the 
refusal to lie down in adversity which has been shown by the sad spectre 
of the squatters on the banks of the Duzi. 
   For these are as much the people our current crop -- Hansie Cronje, 
Gary Kirsten, Andrew Hudson, Daryll Cullian, Jonty Rhodes, Brian 
McMillan, Dave Richardson, Shaun Pollock, Craig Matthews, Allan Donald, 
Jacques Kallis, Nicky Boje and Paul Adams -- are playing for as the 100 
000-plus who bought tickets for Newlands before a ball was bowled. 
   And who all the future wearers of the national flag -- above whatever 
emblem the officials come up with next -- must strive to represent. 
   The advent of Adams has shown what is attainable. And that cricket in 
this country can truly be for all, politician or pleb. There is new life 
in the old game yet.

Soccer: All The Nations For The Cup 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Lungile Madywabe  
 
   Johannesburg - A host of Africa's top stars will converge on South 
Africa next week for the African Nations Cup finals 
   When Kenya's sports minister Hussein Maalinm Mohamed said that his 
country was withdrawing from hosting the African Nations Cup, because of 
a lack of funds, the Confederation of African Football (Caf) did not 
hesitate to appoint South Africa in their place. 
   If South Africa succeeds in its handling of the tournament, it may 
well be the recipe for hosting the 2006 World Cup. Caf president Issa 
Hayatou has already given his full backing to South Africa's bid to host 
the world's biggest soccer bonanza. 
   But for now the 20th African Nations Cup showdown starts next 
Saturday at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg, with South Africa against 
Cameroon, the two-time winners of this tournament and 1990 World Cup 
quarter- finalists against England. Cameroon won the tournament in 1984 
and 1988. 
   South Africa will be hoping to increase to seven the number of 
countries to have won the tournament as hosts. 
   The Black Stars of Ghana, four-time winners, first won the 
championship in 1963 when it was held in Accra. They also hosted and won 
it in 1978. Together with Egypt they share the privilege of being the 
only countries that have defended the title. 
   The Black Stars will be looking to Leeds striker Tony Yeboah and 
captain Abedi Pele Ayew. They come to the tournament having last claimed 
it in 1982 when it was hosted by Libya. 
   Hoping to equal the winning ways of Ghana are the three-time winners 
the Pharoahs of Egypt who hosted the cup in 1959 and 1986, and made sure 
on both occasions that it stayed there. Egypt also won it on its 
inception in 1957 in Sudan. 
   Algeria won the cup in 1990, failed in Senegal in 1992, before a 
total nightmare in Tunisia 94 when they were banned for using an 
ineligible player. 
   Two other teams from Southern Africa have made it to the finals 
despite the politcal upheavals that have been taking place in their 
countries. Angola deserve all the support they can get from their fans. 
In the words of South African coach Clive Barker they "must surely be 
ranked the darkest horses of the tournament". 
   Mozambique will give a few of their opponents a run for their money, 
taking into account their recent performance against South Africa who 
beat them 3-2 after the visitors had taken the lead twice. 
   South Africa is once again surrounded by controversy with the 
chairman of the technical committee of the South African Football 
Association, Jomo Sono, who also serves as an adviser to Barker, not 
being informed of the final selection of the squad. The surprise 
exclusion of Brendon Augustine of Umtata Bucks was also a surprise to 
many. The insistence on including Lucas Radebe of Leeds United despite 
doubts about his fitness has also raised eyebrows. The Leeds coach has 
reservations about Radebe's ability to keep pace with the demands of the 
tournament. 
   Tunisia, who have been hosts twice and have never won the cup, will 
be hoping to put all the traumas of 1994 behind them. They are in the 
same group as Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, both of whom are favourites to 
finish first and second in the group forcing Tunisia to pack their bags 
early. 
   Gabon was the first team to pack their bags in Tunisia and the gods 
must surely have turned their backs on them. They are in the same group 
as the reigning champions Nigeria.. 
   Protests over the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other activists in 
Nigeria have made their team's participation in the tournament doubtful. 
Nigeria is to make a decision on Friday whether they are coming or not 
and, if they decline, then Guinea will be the replacements 
   Most of the Ivory Coast players come from the Asec Mimosa club and 
one wonders how their coach Pierre Pleimelding will be able to mentally 
refocus some of the players whose guts and determination were tested to 
the full when they recently lost to Orlando Pirates in the Champions 
Cup. 
   The stars of the tournament may well be Liberia, inspired by the 
European and African footballer of the year George Weah. They nearly 
withdrew from the tournament because of finance, and Weah had to dig dip 
into his pocket to make sure that Liberia make the best of their first 
appearance at the finals. 
   After many of the team members had been killed in a plane crash in 
Gabon in 1993, Zambia nearly won the cup in Tunisia when they were 
beaten 2-1 by Nigeria in the finals. Having come so close to winning the 
cup in 1994, this may well be their chance to lift it. 
   Burkina Faso come to the finals as the only team with an unbeaten 
record in the qualifying matches and are the first team from Africa to 
have qualified for the World Cup in 1974 in Germany. They have eight 
foreign-based players in their team. They will be counting on Seydou 
Traore who plays for FC Bressuirein in France and Abdoulaye Kassoum 
Ouerdraogo who is based in Germany with FSV Franfurt.   
   Zaire has won the cup twice, in 1968 and 1974. They were booted out 
in the quarter- final stage by eventual winners Nigeria in 1994. In the 
qualifying stages they beat Morocco at home, before going on to draw 
with Ivory Coast. Among some of their foreign-based players are Ngole 
Kona of Genderbirligi in Turkey and Mbote Ndinga of Vitoria Guimaraes.  
   Sierra Leone will be coming to the finals for the second time. They 
also nearly withdrew from the tournament for financial reasons. Kewullay 
Conteh of Atalanta in Italy and Lamine Conteh of SV Meppen in Germany 
will lead their team.

Boxing: Take Me To Atlanta 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Julian Drew  
 
   Johannesburg - From humble beginnings in Venda, Ntsudzuluseni Ndou is 
heading for the Olympics in Atlanta. 
   In Venda Ntsudzuluseni means "take me to another place", and for 
Ntsudzuluseni Ndou boxing has done just that. The 18-year-old from 
Thoyandou is Atlanta-bound in July as a member of South Africa's Olympic 
team after winning the silver medal in the featherweight division at the 
All Africa Games in Harare last September. 
   Ndou is better known by his English name of Philip, which is easier 
on the tongue for most people. The tall matriculant is lean and mean and 
uses his long reach to stay out of trouble. He is confident about his 
prospects in Atlanta. "I think I will do well at the Olympics because I 
know there is nobody in Africa who is better than me," says Ndou. 
   A strange statement you might think for someone who was beaten to the 
gold medal at the All Africa Games, but for anyone who saw his final 
against Egypt's Saleh Abdelbary it is not surprising at all. To say he 
was cheated of victory is something of an understatement. "It was the 
worst decision I've seen in 45 years of amateur boxing," says national 
team manager Dan Bushney. 
   Ndou completely dominated the fight but when it came to adding the 
points from the scoring machines of the five judges it was clear that 
some of the North African judges were less than impartial in their 
observations. "It wasn't a hard fight for me. My hardest fight came in 
the semi-final against the Mauritian who was a very tough opponent. I 
found the final very easy in comparison but the judges robbed me. They 
said I was the loser but everyone else who saw the fight said I was the 
winner. The guys from Egypt and Tunisia just didn't want South Africa to 
win," says Ndou. 
   Such controversial decisions have long been part and parcel of 
amateur boxing. But internationally the situation has improved now with 
a wider spread of judges and fewer ideological divisions around the 
globe. 
   The new scoring system introduced at the Barcelona Olympics has also 
made it difficult to rig results. Now, for a scoring blow to count, 
three out of the five judges must hit the button on their scoring 
machines within one second. In Africa though there is a dominance of 
officials from North African countries and they are accused of helping 
each others' boxers at the expense of other countries. 
   According to Bushney, the only way to change this is to get more 
judges from the rest of Africa onto the African Boxing Confederation's 
panel which is an issue that South Africa intends addressing in the near 
future. 
   It was Ndou's victory over Josian Lebon of Mauritius in the semi-
final which impressed observers though. The short, stocky Mauritian was 
a strong and experienced fighter but Ndou fought intelligently to turn 
the tables on him. Ndou used body blows and moved quickly to tire him 
and kept him at arm's length so he couldn't land too many telling blows. 
"It was a difficult fight because we both knew each other's styles after 
sparring together at our training camp in Kroonstad before the All 
Africa Games. But Bodo (national team coach Bodo Andreass) had watched 
him closely in Kroonstad and he altered my style a little to confuse him 
and I just fought to my strengths," says Ndou. 
   Ndou only got into the national team last year after winning the 
South African title as a 16- year-old in 1993 and retaining it in 1994. 
He puts much of his recent improvement down to the arrival of Andreass 
at the end of 1994. Andreass is a former East German amateur boxer who 
spent four years coaching the Nigerian national team which won two 
silver medals at the Barcelona Olympics. 
   He came to South Africa at the request of the National Olympic 
Committee of South Africa (Nocsa) which seconded him to the South 
African National Amateur Boxing Organisation (Sanabo) under its 
Operation Excellence programme. "He is a very experienced coach and he 
knows a lot about boxing. He has really taught me a lot and that is why 
I did well in Harare. I think Nocsa should keep him on after Atlanta 
because our results have really started to improve under him," says 
Ndou. 
   The lessons he has learnt from Andreass are also starting to pay off 
at the Makwarela Boxing Club in Thoyandou where he coaches the other 
boxers in a makeshift club house in one of the classrooms at his school. 
"I have improved so much with Bodo and everything he has taught me I 
also teach my boxers here in Venda. I show them how to train properly 
and now we have two juniors and six seniors who are the best in Venda. 
This year they will go to the South African championships and I know 
they are going to do well," says Ndou. 
   For now though Ndou's eyes are focused far beyond the national 
championships and on the Olympic Games which are now just over six 
months away. "It is a great honour to fight for your country at the 
Olympics and it is important not to let your country down. I must go to 
Atlanta and work hard to show people what it means to be a South African 
champion and make people respect this country," says Ndou. 
   If Ntsudzuluseni Ndou can do anything like as well as he did in 
Harare in the much more demanding Olympic arena he won't have to worry 
about being taken to another place. He will be made for life and have 
his name etched indelibly in the annals of local sporting legend.

[DOCUMENT] Luba Art Exhibit Opens

Museum for African Art (New York)
January 05, 1996 (19960105)

   New York - MEMORY: Luba Art and the Making of History is the first 
American exhibition to present the art and culture
of the Luba of Zaire and the first ever to explore how Luba works of art 
function in the reconstruction of memory and history.
   While Luba Sculpture is among the most beautiful of African arts, it 
also reveals astounding philosophical complexity.  The Luba, one of the 
most important kingdoms of central Africa (southeastern Zaire) from the 
17th through 19th centuries, highly value the recounting of royal 
history, and encode its complexity on an array of stunning art objects 
created precisely to stimulate and guide memory.
   MEMORY presents over 100 of these unique objects which enable the 
Luba to remember and re-interpret their collective past. Memory boards, 
beaded emblems, ornamented royal scepters and axes, thrones, divination 
instruments' wooden figures and body arts each have a particular visual, 
tactile and spatial vocabulary. It is this incised, symbolic coding 
system that helps the Luba remember the esoteric information, pivotal 
events, royal personages and political relationships that make up their

Sudan
Khartoum Attempts To Strengthen Its Defences At The War Front

Sudan Democratic Gazette (London)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)

   London - Reeling from the the speed of the recent Sudan People's 
Liberation Army (SPLA) offensive in the civil war, the National Islamic 
Front (NIF) regime in Khartoum has alternated between crying out for 
help from a limited number of friendly states and accusing all and 
sundry of aiding and abetting the SPLA in what the regime has described 
as a foreign invasion of Southern Sudan.
   The United States of America is at the top of the list of Sudan's 
enemies, closely followed by Israel, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda and 
Egypt. Claiming that the SPLA had neither the means nor the technical 
know-how to carry out such an offensive, Khartoum has constructed an 
incredible conspiracy theory involving all of the above named states.
   According to Khartoum, Eritrea supplied the SPLA with tanks and 
weapons which were transported from Massawa on the coast through 
Ethiopia and Uganda and into Southern Sudan. Egyptian Military transport 
planes were also used to carry weapons and equipment via Uganda. So far 
the regime's propaganda ministry has failed to produce any evidence to 
back up its bizarre theory. The regime claims to have captured tanks and 
other weapons with Eritrean and Ugandan markings on them, and also 
claims to have claims to have killed or captured Eritrean  and Ugandan 
officers and troops.  However, Khartooum refuses to produce this 
evidence for independent verification. This is not surprising because it 
is not beyond the regime's capacity to forge such evidence.  At some 
point the regime claimed that it had killed 263 Ugandan soldiers at Kit. 
The claim was easily ridiculed because a British Broadcasting 
Corporation (BBC) news team was at Kit with the (SPLA) forces and could 
testify to Khartoum's lies in a "Focus on Africa" programme the 
following day,
   In Khartoum itself, the regime has tried to whip up a hate campaign 
against the few US nationals still resident there. The US embassy has 
countered this by issuing its own mimeographed statements and widely 
distributing them across the Three Towns capital. The US has denied 
providing any support for the SPLA or having any involvement with the 
opponents of the regime. The US regards Khartoum's allegations as being 
counter-productive to the ongoing dialogue designed to improve US-regime 
relations
  The US has taken Khartoum's threats seriously enough to recall its 
ambassador from Sudan for consultation. It is believed that while the 
ambassador was in Washington, D.C., he suggested that a forthcoming 
visit to the US by SPLA leader Colonel John Garang be canceled. The 
ambassador argued that to receive Colonel Garang at a senior level would 
give credence to reports of clandestine US support for the SPLA and as 
such could enflame the problems in Khartoum. In the event, the SPLA 
leader arrived on schedule and was received at the same official level 
he is usually accorded. In spite of the ambassador's concerns, it would 
appear that the Clinton administration finally took the view that to 
cancel the visit would be tantamount to giving in to the regime's 
blackmail. That would be an inappropriate way to conduct UA foreign 
policy, considering the number of rogue regimes it has to deal with 
world-wide. Khartoum protested about the visit, but Washington ignored 
them.
   The government of Uganda responded quite sharply to Khartoum's 
allegations and threats. In November, it had merely mentioned that it 
took Khartoum's threats to invade Uganda seriously and was on the alert 
to repel any such invasion. Last month, however, the Ugandans took a 
much stronger line and on 6 December a presidential statement demanded 
that Khartoum cease its support and assistance for the Lords Resistance 
Army (LRA) or Ugandan commandos would be dispatched into Southern Sudan 
to deal with the Ugandan rebel group.
  "If Khartoum continues to send in these armed bandits to kill our 
farmers, women and children in Northern Uganda, and to plant anti-
personnel mines in the countryside, we will have no choice but to send 
in our commandos to pursue, search and destroy the LRA bandits inside 
Sudan.
   Unable to motivate or properly supply its ground forces in the South 
and the Nuba Mountains, the regime has begun to depend more heavily on 
aerial bombardment of civilian targets. The regime has increased the 
number of raids it makes each day. In late November and early December, 
reports claimed that the regime had begun to use chemical warfare in the 
Nuba Mountains. The chemicals are believed to have been supplied by the 
Iraqis who have used such weapons against their own internal opponents. 
The Iraqis have also provided planes and troops
   The former Soviet republic of Belarus has sold ten planes to 
Khartoum. They are long range bombers and cost $150,000,000. The deal 
was a purely economic one rather than an ideological marriage between 
the two countries. As the regime is known to be strapped for cash, this 
deal begs the question of where the money to buy the planes actually 
came from. It is believed that Iran and the oil rich state of Qatar 
split the bill between them. The planes have already been delivered and 
have begun bombing raids over the South.  Belarus also supplied 
technicians and pilots.
  Iran has recently supplied the regime with other military equipment 
and weapons. It is also the regime's main supplier of fuel for its 
military operations in the South.
   The Islamic states of Indonesia and Malaysia have also supplied 
military equipment to the regime, having been swayed by the NIF's pleas 
that its Islamic system is under threat from the infidels and is 
therefore worthy of support
   The injection of equipment and weapons has yet to have impact on the 
fortunes of the regime in the war. It is doubtful whether they will have 
any real impact because in order to utilize the regime needs to have 
trained personnel at the battlefront. The regimes forces are demoralized 
at present and those in outlying posts are suffering from a shortage of 
provisions. The regime's troops are ill fed, ill supplied, ill equipped 
and ill motivated whilst operating in the hostile environment of the 
South. The recent SPLA victories have only added to their problems and 
reduced the morale even further.
   In Juba two battalions of troops have disobeyed orders to move out 
into the countryside by spinning out their requisition of necessary 
supplies for future operations. These troops were visited in December by 
a succession of the regime's leaders in a bid to build up their morale. 
Dr. Hussan Abdulla El Turabi and Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, the foreign 
minister, both visited Juba. In addition, first vice president General 
Zubeir Mohammed Salih led a number of senior military figures on a visit 
to the troops,
   The regime's leaders are having to face up to the fact that troops on 
active duty in the South are less convinced by propaganda than the 
civilians in the North may be. These troops have experienced the reality 
of battle at first hand and know that the SPLA is a committed enemy 
fighting for a cause it believes in. They feel less enamored by their 
own cause and the brainwashing about angels and infidels they received 
before coming south.
   Khartoum's forces have very good reasons for feeling demoralized. A 
conventional army used to regular supplies and meals is now having to 
make do on subsistence rations. Whereas their enemy, the SPLA is used to 
such hard conditions, Khartoum's forces are not.  In many outlying 
military posts, the regimes troops are surviving on bread and hot onion 
sauce served once a day.
   The troops have also been immobilized by a fuel shortage and most of 
the transport vehicles are inactive. The troops have to carry out all 
their operations on foot. Ammunition is in short supply, replacement 
uniforms are non-existent and the conventional army now looks more like 
a poorly supplied guerrilla army than the SPLA does.
   Reports last month have spoken of large scale desertion by the 
regime's forces around Juba and they are trying to make their way back 
to Northern Sudan by whatever means available. In November, seventy 
soldiers returning to Juba from a defeat at Pageri boarded a steamer 
bound for the North rather than report to the Army HQ. The steamer was 
halted down river at Bor, eighty miles north of Juga, where the soldiers 
were arrested and detained. The regime fears that is demoralized troops 
return to the North and publicize the true situation in the war, then 
the public will clamor for peace and recruits for the army will be even 
harder to find that they are already.
   The regime has uncharacteristically issued a statement about the 
situation in both Kapoeta and Torit denying that there is any military 
confrontation with the SPLA around the two towns. The statement 
denounced the people who have been undermining the regime's war efforts. 
The denial was unsolicited and might shed further light on the situation 
if it is looked at in a more critical majjer. Why bother to deny 
something that has not been publicized by the enemy unless there is some 
truth in it? The SPLA has only reported on actual battle successes and 
has seen no need to make sweeping statements about the overall situation 
in the war. It is the regime which feels the need to do this and it is 
surely a sign of its own concern. 
   The battle fronts around Kaya, Kajokeji and Morobo have been quiet. 
Independent reports have revealed that the SPLA has put all three towns 
under siege together with the strategic town of Yei. Any SPLA victories 
in this sector would have positive repercussions on the situation in 
Western Equatoria and Bahr El Ghazal, as far as the guerrilla army is 
concerned.
   Attempts by the regime to distract attention away from Eastern 
Equatoria by launching offensives in Bahr El Ghazal and against Western 
Equatoria have so far failed. The attempts to arrange, through bribery, 
bases in the Central African Republic and Zaire, in order to launch 
attacks on Western Equatoria, have so far proved fruitless. The local 
officials have noted Khartoum's generosity and have made higher demands 
for payment. Khartoum's financial resources are limited and each time 
its representatives return to Sudan for more money, they get back to the 
CAR and Zaire to be faced by new officials, all expecting some kind of 
payment. Bribery is proving to be an expensive and inefficient way of 
conducting the war.
   The SPLA is still in control of Western Equatoria and its forces are 
ready for the regime's offensives from whatever direction. The most 
likely routes are from Wau across the Bo River, or from Rumbek, although 
the direct route from Juba via Rokon, Mundri and Maridi might also be 
targeted. There is an old hilly route from Yei to Maridi which the SPLA 
is also monitoring.
   The schism in the SPLA in 1991 handed much of Upper Nile to the 
regime because the SPLA-United forces, later to be renamed the Southern 
Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM), chose to work with the regime 
against the mainstream SPLA. Commander Nyuon's forces have since April 
1995 been controlling the overland route from Malakal to Bor and on to 
Kapoeta and Torit, by being in control of Ayot, Akobo and Watt. His 
forces are even siad to have reached as far North as the Zaraf Island of 
Panjak. In order to take advantage of this overland route in the dry 
season, the regime now has to fight its way for almost the entire 300 
kilometers  from Malakal. Commander Nuyon's SSIM forces are reported to 
have reached Doleib Hill, some fifteen hundred kilometers from Malakal.
   The regime's propaganda machine has released many stories in recent 
weeks reporting that 30,000 fresh troops have been airlifted to Juba, 
ready to take the battle to the SPLA.  The story made impressive reading 
for the Northern public but did little to threaten the SPLA in Eastern 
Equitoria because the truth is somewhat different. 
   In reality, the regime's press gangs in the North  have rounded up 
any male aged fourteen to twenty-one foolish enough to be seen in 
public. They have been dragged out of homes and schools or mearly 
rounded up off the streets. Instead of taking them to training camps in 
the North, they have been immediately airlifted to camps in Juba, from 
where there is little chance of escape. Forcibly enlisted into the 
Popular Defense Forces (PDF), they are being given rudimentary 
instruction on how to fire a rifle before being despatched to the 
battlefront. It is little wonder that the PDF's causality and mortality 
rates have been so high and its forces so ineffective. More than 3,000 
youngsters died on the battlefield at Awingbul alone in October.
   One of the unspoken tragedies of this press gang policy is that the 
relatives of the young men have no idea what has happened to them or 
where they actually are. Those lucky enough to go to a camp in the North 
rather than straight to the South are kept incommunicado from their 
parents and relatives who are not allowed to visit them. Inquisitive 
relatives are told that the young men have volunteered to train for the 
jihad. Parents of underage boys are told that they are undertaking their 
compulsory national military training in order to qualify them for their 
next stage of education.
   Whilst the regime's policy is quite successful at getting the young 
men to the South, it is less adept at motivating them to fight, even for 
the jihad. Once the young men have been exposed to rotting corpses, 
badly wounded contemporaries and a highly motivated enemy, they become 
utterly demoralized.
   Despite the regime's oft-quoted desire to send a one million strong 
militia force to the South, the SPLA continues to survive and fight 
back, leaving many observers to wonder why the regime even bothers to 
suggest it. mere numbers have proved to be insufficient in the heat of 
battle. Morale and motivation have proved to be far more significant  
and on both counts the SPLA is leaps and bounds ahead of the regime's 
forces.

Zambia
Taxpayers' Money Being Used To Deny Truths

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Lucy Sichone
 
   Lusaka - In the past months, State House has been running continuous 
advertisements in the government-owned media, especially the Zambia 
Daily Mail to refute all "unpleasant" stories carried by The Post on the 
government and President Chiluba. The denials are supposedly meant to 
discredit The Post and project it as a newspaper on a "malicious 
campaign" against Chiluba and his government. In this edition, Zambia 
Civic Education Association chairperson Lucy Sichone (right) gives her 
view of the newspaper and the propaganda journalism being orchestrated 
by State House.
   The Post was not my favourite newspaper.  Infact early in 1995 there 
was a period when in exercise of my right and freedom to speech, press 
and communication, I stopped buying The Post with one other independent 
newspaper which I still do not read.
    I began buying and reading The Post when it came to my attention 
that a propaganda department in the tradition of UNIP's Ministry of 
National Guidance but renamed productivity department had been 
established at tax payers expense for the sole purpose of containing The 
Post Newspaper. A propaganda institution is always established as a 
desperate attempt to hide the truth. That is why propaganda journalism 
and information dissemination is a unique speciality of vicious 
dictatorship such as Hitler's propaganda ministry which marketed murder 
of the Jews in gas chambers as hot and refreshing showers for the 
victims.
   Consequently, I considered it my duty to read The Post so that I 
could determine the reasons why Richard Sakala was spending scarce 
public money at a time when hospitals have no free medicines to give to 
under five children on rebutting Post stories especially if the said 
stories are not true and are therefore not worth the consideration of 
intelligent Zambians like myself.
   Upon my resumption of reading The Post and upon close scrutiny of the 
"Kim  II Sung" adverts by the productivity department on the issues 
raised by The Post, it became transparently clear to me that the target 
of the propaganda is not the substance of The Post stories; the target 
is the managing director, Fred M'membe.
   With all due respect to Fred, I should say that he does not posses 
all the awesome qualities and capacity for destruction of Zambia's 
integrity as a nation that are attributed to him by Richard Sakala and  
Chiluba.  But I am aware that Fred possesses a huge ego that attract 
attacks from an individual who believes that he should be the sole 
source of power in an alpha/omega sense. That is why in my case Fred is 
not my friend, like the apostles of Jesus the two (2) of us would not 
agree who between us is the greatest and since I do not manage a 
newspaper and I have no money for productivity advertisements to enable 
me to settle the issue of who is the greatest between Fred and myself; 
it is better we are not friends or foes.
   Coming back to the issue of Fred verses Fred, I was particularly 
intrigued by one of Sakala's advertisements which concerned a story in 
the International Herald Tribue which reported that the supremo of the 
Post Newspapers has been arraigned on so many criminal defamation suits 
that he may total up a record 100 years of imprisonment. 
   The international Herald Tribune is an "Establishment" paper whose 
unquestioned status in the press and media world is aristocratic.  It is 
the newspaper which I have observed is served with champagne in the 
first class cabin of British Airways as I make my measured and dignified 
way to the third class cabin.
   I was concerned therefore that a newspaper of the Herald standard 
could devote space and money on a pedestrian story about the possible 
imprisonment of some small time editor of a small time newspaper in a 
third world country.
   After much reflection and analysis of the issue, it dawned on me that 
the story was not about Fred M'membe and the possibility that he may be 
imprisoned for 100 years; the purpose of that international Herald story 
was about the current government of the Republic of Zambia and its loss 
of credibility, integrity, honest to an extent where the small time 
editor of a small time newspaper can rate a total of a 100 years 
imprisonment for alleging that the President's father is alive and well 
and was mistakenly asking for the fattened pig!!!
   The international Herald could have produced massive copy about 
Zambia's loss of good governance by writing about KK's deportation to 
Malawi, corruption and drug trafficking, obtaining money by false 
pretences ostensibly to write a fictitious constitution to stand the 
test of MMD governance; that the Herald did not use any of these serious 
and substantive issues to demonstrate Zambia's regression to 
dictatorship but instead used copy on mere Fred M'membe is evidence of a 
satirical indictment of our governors in the mode and style of Animal 
Farm.
   In short my dear Richard Sakala the enemy is not  M'membe but 
yourselves (reference Julius Caesar) The International Herald story, the 
non-aligned movement disgust with the intended deportation of KK, the 
not accepted constitution, our general loss of international 
credibility, voter registration apathy, the tunnels fiasco and M'membe's 
International Press Awards, which are irritating to all of us victims of 
press freedom are a consequence of government's misdeeds, dishonesty and 
incompetence.
   Recently, I was horrified to be told by the President himself that 
his humiliation at the non-aligned movement conference over the 
deportation of KK was a set up by KK himself as it was not government's 
intention to consign the former President to Malawi. The reports on KK's 
deportation were issued through the government media by government 
spokesmen.  I only repeat what I have stated elsewhere that it will not 
be possible for this government to change without a true and honesty 
confession of its sins of commission  and omissions and as long as 
Richard Sakala and even Chiluba continues to attribute the consequences 
of their misdeeds to KK, M'membe, Sichone (never one to leave myself 
out) etc there can never be any salvation for themselves or MMD and we 
have KK and UNIP to prove the truism of this political fact.
   The serious problem of the MMD government image as petty, vindictive 
and intolerant because of its incompetence will not be resolved by 
personal attacks on individual citizens their integrity and/or lack of 
it. After all news institutions such as the Herald Tribune , BBC do not 
use The Post  or Fred M'membe as the source of their copy. Any story 
which rates attention of reputable international media is based on 
proper research and collection of data on governance, press freedom, 
electoral systems and so forth. Personal attacks on individual citizens 
merely compound the problem and when the President becomes directly 
involved in the propaganda, the Presidency itself is brought into 
disrepute. In the circumstances, it becomes completely unacceptable, 
indeed it is criminal for the government to abuse tax payers money on 
the kind of advertisements that we have seen against The Post and 
M'membe when the culprits for our international disgrace are in cabinet, 
the police force, electoral commissioner and the public relations unit 
at State House.
   The producer and director of productivity department propaganda 
should be reminded that misuse of public funds on personal issues is a 
criminal offence. And one of these days, sooner rather than later, there 
will be need to answer charges of theft by public servant involving 
millions of Kwacha for personal gain. The Nuremburg trials have laid 
down the principle that "I was only taking orders" is not an adequate 
defence to save the person so accused from imprisonment or capital 
punishment. 
   Those advertisements whose only achievements has been to vest Fred 
M'membe with abilities and capacities which even the President of the 
USA does not possess should come to an end. Attention should be given to 
addressing those issues of misgovernance that have given the government 
a bad name at
international fora.
   Further and at a personal level, the obssession by the productivity 
government and State House with Fred has given him an edge in the 
undeclared contest between him and myself as to who is the greatest. In 
the circumstances I would have no choice but to commence proceedings 
against the Attonery General in which I would pray for the following 
orders: 
   That the productivity department should begin immediate 
advertisements against me for tarnishing Zambian's Human Rights Record 
with my clandestine domestic relations, Sam Ngoma can be retained to do 
the necessary copy with his earnings paid directly to the Times of 
Zambia to ensure that honest journalists like Hicks Sikazwe continue to 
receive their salaries. 
   That the said productivity department should be ordered to arrange a 
Nightline programme and address to the nation by the President  FTJ 
Chiluba in which it can be stated that specially prepared sharp tooth 
will be used to sort out the same domestic relations which I am using to 
tarnish Zambia's human rights record abroad and traumatising leaders 
children like Prince William, Prince Harry, John Major Jnr., Castro etc.
   I will need these orders in order to show Fred M'membe that he is not 
the greatest; that all of us ordinary citizens rate the same kind of 
attention from our government.I will stop here and once again find 
comfort in Byron "if I laugh at any mortal thing, it is that I may not 
weep".

Soccer: Nigeria Given A Chance

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Staff Reporters

   Luaka - Nigeria has been given an ultimatum by the Confederation of 
African Football (CAF) to reconsider pulling out of Africa's soccer 
tournament in South Africa or face sanctions. 
   The CAF gave the military government in Abuja until last evening to 
make it's final decision and threatened to suspend the country, which 
won the Africa Cup in Tunisia in 1994, from international competitions 
for up to six years.
   The ultimatum was  communicated to the Nigerian government yesterday 
in Younde, Cameroun by CAF president Issa Hayatou and  that Guinea was 
being drafted to take the place of Nigeria if they did not respond to 
the ultimatum.
   Nigeria announced last week that it was withdrawing from the Africa 
Cup of Nations on the grounds that South Africa could not gurantee the 
safety of the team in the tournament which starts this next week. 
Nigeria is favourite to win again this year.
   It is believed the Nigerian government was nursing grudges against 
South Africa because of the attitude shown by President Nelson Mandela 
after nine political activists from the minority Ogoni group were 
executed in Nigeria on November 10 last year.
   Mandela was at the forefront of a British Commonwealth campaign to 
isolate Nigeria after the executions. This led to a souring of relations 
between the two countries, both regarded as Africa's super powers. 
Officials in South Africa have said the tournament will go ahead with or 
without Nigeria. The games will be played in Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, 
Durban and Port Elizaberth.

Zambia Has No New Kit For Africa Cup Games

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Reuben Tonga

   Lusaka - Zambia has no new kit for the Africa Cup of Nations after 
their much publicised John Fashanu backed deal with Reebok flopped at 
the last minute when suppliers were reported to be on Christmas holiday. 
Instead Zambia has resorted to cheaply designed uniforms from 
Johannesburg to make up for the blow after efforts to get the London kit 
failed.
   Fashanu's representative a Mace yesterday confirmed the absence of 
the uniform saying arrangements were being made to get it from South 
Africa.
But FAZ treasurer Musa Kasonka denied that there was no kit for the team
saying it would be picked in Bloemfontein, South Africa.
"It is not true to say we have no kit. Because arrangements have been 
made
for the kit. Instead of using the British Reebok we are going to use the
South African one which is better kit than what we had in the last
four-nations competitions," he said.
Zambia had protested over the poor quality of the kit it had been given 
by
Reebok at the Simba four-nations tournament- yellow  and green sets.
A Blue Orchid director Mace, currently in the country to finalise the 
kit
arrangment to be used by Zambia at next week's Africa Cup of Nations,
confirmed that the kit will be made in South Africa.

Zambia
How Has Entertainment Scene Been In 1995?

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Goodson Machona

   Lusaka - Let us continue with events of last year. Some dissatisfied 
musicians called for the dissolution of the Zambia Union of Musicians ( 
ZUM ) executive claiming it had mishandled cash and was not representing 
the musicians adequately.
   ZUM general secretary, Webster Malama, was even accused of faking the 
death of the Sakala Brother so that he could obtain welfare money. 
However despite the brahuha, ZUM managed to open a music resource centre 
at the Evelyn Hone college to help musicians without instruments.
   Shortly after, ZUM was given a short in the arm when it received a K4 
million grant from the government. However, a planned gig to commemorate 
the death of the national team flopped after the organisers, Jah 
Entertainment, failed to secure a suitable set of musical instruments.
   Lusaka-based playwright, Maurice Tembo formed a drama group called 
Forum For Drama ( FODA ) and lined up a series of programmes which, 
however, are yet to see the light of day.
   This year, the Lusaka theatre club degenerated into some rough house 
catering for boozers. Club manager, Norris Malauzi admitted that there 
was a problem but attributed the lack of artistic activity to the fact 
that most of the time the auditorium was booked by outsiders. 
   And, as matters degenerated, the playhouse was gutted but members 
managed to raise K20 million to refurbish the joint. On a brighter note, 
playwright Maurice Tembo made an appearance on the British Broadcasting 
Corporation television programme "Great Railways Journey."
   Tembo
   And while Tembo was shining on BBC, a University of Zambia student, 
Anderson Ngulube was awarded $5,000 by an American organisation for his 
poetry but he was unable to go and receive the award as he could not 
raise money for an air ticket.
   Another author, Beenwell Sinyangwe, had his book "Quills of Desire" 
mentioned in the coveted African Book Publishing Records ( ABPR ) while 
Zambian artist, Joe Muzala, was invited to the prestigious South African 
award exhibition which was held in South Africa sometime in June.
   In August, artistes of all shades converged at the Star Market and 
held a two day bash to commemorate the passing of former radio dee jay, 
Timmy Mvula. New Generation front man, Frank Chitembwe, flew to the 
United Kingdom and recorded a self titled solo album featuring some 
Samba, fusion of Zambian rock and gospel.
   About the same time too, emergent singer James Ngoma recorded a debut 
album entitled "Chamanyazi" which performed relatively well on the local 
market.   
   Amayenge
   The Amayenge had to cut short their American tour after they 
encountered problems. According to band spokesman, Brian Chilala, their 
promoter made off with their earnings while the band leader Chris Chali 
had to return home to attend his wife's funeral.
   Raggamufin don, Daddy Zemus, sold the rights to his "Salaula" LP to a 
newly formed promotion outfit Digital Network International but the move 
was condemned by most local musicians. For the first time, local 
musicians got together and petitioned the Zambia National Broadcasting 
Corporation ( ZNBC ) to begin paying them copyright royalties for any 
song or video's played on ZNBC.
   Shortly after, chairman of the Zambia Copyrights Society ( ZAMCOPS ) 
Jagari Chanda, was invited by the World Copyrights Organisation ( WBO ) 
to attend a copyright seminar in Switzerland.
   Towards the end of the year, a white girl was picked to represent 
Zambia at the Miss World pageant but the move was not without 
controversy. But perhaps the saddest moment of the year was when veteran 
singer, Derek Mbao, passed away after an illness while in prison.
   "Its the saddest moment in the history of Zambian music," ZUM general 
secretary, Webster Malama moaned. And before our tears could dry, the 
music fraternity lost yet another good musician in former Witch 
guitarist, Emmanuel Makulu.
   Tshala Muana
   Foreign singers made forays into the country.  Zairean sassy singer, 
Tshala Muana breezed in.  She was followed by another Zairean Yondo 
Sister.  A month later Le General, Dafao jetted in.  But his shows were 
far from impressive. Zambian singers based in foreign lands also paid a 
courtesy call to their
mother land.  
   Sweden-based singer Ken Simuyemba came into the country and so did 
the Ubale Girls and guitar virtuoso, Rikki Illilonga. The women ganged 
up and came up with a project called Women In Music  to promote women 
musicians.  Shortly after, they organised a talent show for emergent 
female musicians artistes at the Chainama hotel.   They have gone 
further and organised a tour of the Zimbabwe-based Zairean band, the 
Lubumbashi Stars which was be performing at various venues in Lusaka 
over the New Year period.
   Ras Willie
   Ras Willie who was facing a charge of trafficking in obscene material 
was acquitted by the Lusaka High court after the prosecution failed to 
establish a prima facie case against him. The Amayenge's planned tour of 
Zimbabwe fell through after the venues they had ear marked for their 
shows were booked by other people.
   Last week saw the crowning of Tamara Kaluba as Miss Universe-Zambia 
but the choice did not go down well with most revellers. Lastly but 
definitely not the least, the Go Banana's night club and the former 
Kuku's night club were given  new leases of life after extensive 
renovations .
   Hoping you have caught up with 1995, we look forward to taking you 
through 1996 with more and wider entertainment coverage.

Zambia
Membe Joins Presidential Race

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by  Reuben  Phiri

   Lusaka - Clergyman and human rights activist Reverend Franklin Membe 
yesterday declared he was joining the race for the Zambian presidency in 
the forthcoming elections during a press conference at Lusaka's Fairview 
Hotel.
   Membe said that he had intended to contest for presidency in the year 
2001 but has been compelled to do it this year  because  "the rate at 
which the MMD government is going is dangerous".
   "I do not see any seriousness on the part of Chiluba to avert 
bloodshed in the country," Membe said. Asked what his chances were 
against MMD's  President Chiluba and UNIP's Kenneth Kaunda, Membe said 
with adequate funds and a fair election he could win.
   "Its never too late," he said. " MMD came together in less than a 
year." Membe said he will stand on a political party whose name he will 
be announcing soon after completing consultations. And Membe accused 
President Chiluba, without adequate proof, of using undemocratic methods 
to hold on to power.
   "He is recruiting more policemen and soldiers when people are 
suffering because he wants to use them to hold on to power,"Membe 
said."Because Kaunda has announced his intention to contest presidency, 
there is money for two thousand police officers."
   Reverend Membe is the estranged husband to local government and 
housing deputy minister Wendy Sinkala Membe.

Zambia Has No Policy On Information Technology

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Nkandu Kapepula

   Lusaka - If Kabunda Kayongo, the fourth minister in as many years at 
science and technology ministry, keeps her end of year promise to the 
information technology (IT), 1996 could be the dawn of a promising era.  
   On December 1, Kayongo used Computers Society of Zambia seventh 
computers communications fair as an excuse to declare she will roll out 
a national IT policy this year. Could this be another of those empty 
slogans? 
   That is not an uncharitable question to ask. Incidentally, this is 
not the first time government has gone public about the urgent need of 
an IT policy. Nor is it true to infer that there is no IT policy at the 
moment. It is there - a monumental patchwork of here-today-gone tomorrow 
guidelines.
   As far as history of both Kaunda and Chiluba administration goes, the 
IT portfolio has never been distinctly delegated. The result is that 
today four ministers are directly involved with the IT enterprise and 
are ostensibly pulling in different directions.
   Other than the science and technology ministry, communications and 
transport, information and broadcasting, and commerce, trade and 
industry, bureaucrats have separately courted the IT community with 
different agendas. Computer Society of Zambia, for one, gives the 
impression that there is no difference between the four. It collaborates 
with any of them as it deems convenient.
   And there lies the critical problem of lack of focus and absence of 
unity of purpose. The knock-on effect is that the IT industry is on the 
back step. Witness the confusion on trade tariffs, legislation on 
intellectual property rights, the resistance to open the telecoms market 
and a discordant skills development effort.
   As far as Penzanomics stretch, a compact disc (CD) bearing Yondo 
Sister's music is of the same value  as one with Micr-osoft's Office 95 
groupware! That is not all. Information and broadcasting ministry sees 
no impropriety in lumping computer programmes with poetry and music in 
its copyright laws. 
    Enter communications and transport ministry. It hand-picks the board 
of directors of the Communication Authority, the nat-ion's telecoms 
industry regulator, without representation from the native computer 
industry. Either the ministry is not convinced computers, communications 
and electronic media are converging and that it needs well-versed 
advisors in these fields or it has time-warped.
   When primary and pre-schools across the border in Mozambique and 
Namibia are being equipped with donated computer systems-thanks to their 
creative bureaucrats- God knows when the ever uncertain private 
initiatives of our universities will yield an IT prog-rammes.
   Far more striking, the guys at SGS and Zambia Revenue Authority do 
not care whether our nascent IT industry swims or sinks. Never mind that 
there is absolutely no computer hardware manufacturing here to protect 
from imports, their business is to make Zambians pay more than even the 
manufacturers demand.  
   Yes, SGS has been instructed to ignore invoice prices demanded by 
manufacturers and substitute them with what is in its 'opinion' is the 
right value. The reason is that the treasury under Ronald Penza, whom 
even MMD vigilantes cannot entrust to lead their obscure finance and 
economic committee, must collect more taxes to pay its hopelessly 
bloated civil services, finance dubious jaunts etc.
Surprisingly,  political rhetoric is heavily skewed towards hoodwinking 
a supposedly unassuming populace that this is the ideal climate to lure 
foreign investors. What is attractive about setting up a shop where one 
has to pay for receiving a call (not sending) on cellular phone? Not in 
an age where technology has improved so much that before long the cost 
of dialing Lusaka from New York would be the same as ringing one's next 
door neighbour, that is not science fiction but reality.
   For inspiration, India is a ready reference point,. Its software 
industry grew more than 50 per cent last year posting a turnover of 850 
million United States dollars. This is far much more than our export 
earnings from copper sales in the
corresponding period.

Zambians Used 7M Condoms In 1995

Post of Zambia
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Masautso Lungu

   Lusaka - About 7 million Maximum Condoms were used in Zambia in 1995 
alone, racking in about K52.5 million of income to local maximum agents, 
the Zambia Social Marketing Projects (ZSMP).
   And ZSMP has taken another step further to Reality, a female condom.  
"We've six months in which to access the market for Reality , but it is 
selling well in our outlets," said ZSMP marketing manager, Chris Mukkuli 
in an interview yesterday. "For instance we sold about 1, 500 packets of 
Reality in December, and we  hope that it will improve though there are 
more men buying it than women."  Mukkuli also disclosed that there has 
been overwhelming response from the public in Maximum Condoms.
   "We sold 6.7 million condoms in 1995. The level of acceptance and 
awareness is so high that every sexually active person would want to use 
the Maximum Condom," said Mukkuli. "That it is our business to see 
people using condoms to prevent the spread of the deadly diseases and 
promote family planning. "
   And the stores manager at S.J Patel Supermarket, Henry Mangani, is 
delighted by the figure sold which is close to the national population 
of
about 8 million people.
"We're proud that Zambia Social Marketing Project has sold 7 million 
condoms and I feel we've contributed to this figure as we've sold 
maximum condoms since they were introduced on the market," said Mangani. 
   Last year's figure accounts for over 50 per cent of all the sales 
ZSMP made between 1992 when it launched maximum and 1994. Between this 
period ZSMP sold only 12.2 million condoms. 
   Maximum is also changing the packaging of the condoms to make it even 
more appealing and convenient to carry. "We will this year change from 
the square shaped box to a pillow shaped package which will be more 
convenient for the consumer to carry," Mukkuli said.

Zambia Stock Trading Slowed by Small Number Of Firms

Post of Zambia
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Sipo Kapumba

   Lusaka - Trade at the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) has been seriously 
affected by the low number of companies being floated there and the 
general poor state of the economy, experts have said.
   LuSE general manager Charles Mate and Finance Securities general 
manager Nduba Namoonde said, in separate interviews, on Wednesday that 
an increase in the number of listed companies from the present two, 
Chilanga Cement and Rothmans of Pall Mall, and the stabilisation of the 
economy could boost the level of activity on the LuSE.
And Mate said companies on the stock exchange could be likened to 
commodities and "the wider the variety on offer, the more likely the 
public was to being attracted to trade in them".
   However, Mate said the stock exchange cannot dictate to the 
government through the Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund the pace at which 
companies should be floated to the public because this was their 
prerogative.
   This year Zambia Oxygen, Zambia Sugar and Zambia Breweries shares are 
expected to be listed on the stock exchange but their timetables is yet 
to be announced.
Mate also said the stabilisation of the economy through a reduction in 
inflation which in-turn could lead to a drop in interest rates would 
present shares as an attractive option to the traditional method of 
saving money in Zambia which is through maintaining bank accounts. "The 
wider participation of individuals in share ownership was an important 
objective of the privatisation programme which the LuSE was there to 
facilitate by enabling as many people as possible have access to shares 
in companies being privatised," Mate said.
   Namoonde said there is need for tax concessions to companies go 
public if the stock exchange is to develop. "For the stock exchange to 
grow the government needs to create a conducive atmosphere through tax 
concessions for companies which want to float their shares to the public 
on the exchange," he said. "The government should give tax relief to 
companies floating their shares to the public so that more are willing 
to do so."
   In addition, Namoonde said the government could help put public 
confidence into the exchange by stabilising the economy so that people 
do not simply concentrate on consumption but also start saving even by 
way of share ownership.

Controversy Slows Voter Registration

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 3, 1996 (19960103)
by Masautso Phiri

   Lusaka - Lack of visible control, direction and coordination of the 
work of the Israeli firm, Nikuv, contracted by the government to prepare 
the voters' register and cards is said to be frustrating the work of the 
Electoral Commission.
   And neither the government, through the office of the Vice-President, 
nor the Electoral Commission, through the Elections Office, seems to 
have discernible control over, or even knowledge of, the activities of 
Nikuv. And this apparent 'mystery' over Nikuv seems to be compounding 
the fears of the opposition that the ruling MMD wants to use the firm  
to rig the elections.  
   This 'invisible' control of Nikuv also seems to be one of the major 
obstacles to the smooth completion of the exercise.
   The Electoral Commission and Elections Office's lack of supervisory 
powers over Nikuv is said to have left the commissioners and officers 
frustrated. Issues of control of Nikuv, funding, cards distribution and 
registration appear to be the worrisome issue at play.
   "We have nothing to do with either the contract to register voters or 
Nikuv," said chairman of the Electoral Commission, justice Weston 
Muzyamba in a telephone interview last week.
   But it is not only the Electoral Commission and the Elections Office 
that knows little, or nothing, about Nikuv, the permanent secretary in 
the office of the Vice-President, to whom the firm is believed to be 
reporting, also seems to be uneasy about the firm's voters' registration 
business. 
   "I am not in a better position to discuss the subject. You have 
caught me off hand. I am not able to comment," said permanent secretary 
in the office of the Vice-President, Philip Daka, in a telephone 
interview last Friday. He was asked to comment, among other issues, on 
the government's ability to distribute the 4 million cards to voters who 
exercise estimates to registered by next week Wednesday. And the cards 
would only be available for distribution to the registered voters 
sometime in February.
   Opposition parties have expressed worry that some voters may not 
return to registration centres to collect their cards and they fear for 
the security of those cards whose owners would either have died or are 
unable to collect them for one reason or another.
   And the Electoral Commission, although appearing unhappy with this 
arrangement, is not prepared to criticise it.
   "This is what has been decided by government. Find out from the 
government chief spokesman if the elections commission was involved in 
this," said Electoral Commission spokesman Joel Sikazwe said in an 
interview last week. The Electoral Commission and Elections Office's 
frustration were also noticed and observed by leaders of the opposition 
who they met last week.
   "I noticed the difficult circumstances they are working under and it 
showed they were not happy about the arrangement," Zambia Democratic 
Congress deputy secretary Azwell Banda observed in an interview last 
week. 
   "They said they had recommended the issuance of cards immediately 
after registration but the government refused." 
   But not even Nikuv officials, based at Lusaka's Hotel 
Intercontinental, are willing to explain their activities.
   "I am also a technician and I cannot say anything. I don't know what 
it has to do with you, anyway," said projects manager, Setton, in an 
interview last week when asked to explain his firm's role. "Are you a 
Christian, the Bible says don't force."

Major Parties Meet

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 3, 1996 (19960103) 
 
   Lusaka - Four presidents of opposition parties will today meet to 
formalise their common stand on several national issues.
   Secretaries of UNIP, Liberal Progressive Front and National Party 
have met three times to pave the way for today's meeting. 
   "The first meeting agreed on three issues - voter registration and 
Nikuv, constitutional reform and President Frederick Chiluba's 
citizenship," said special assistant for press to UNIP president Muhabi 
Lungu. "But we unanimously agreed to suspend discussion of President's 
citizenship because it might overshadow serious issues." 
   Today's meeting follows an earlier meeting between UNIP president 
Kenneth Kaunda and LPF president Rodger Chongwe at which an outline of 
common understanding was agreed. The two parties were later joined by 
the National Party and for today's meeting by the Zambia Democratic 
Congress.
   And yesterday UNIP officials were tight-lipped about the venue of the 
meeting.
   "We cannot announce the venue before the presidents agree," said  
UNIP's vice secretary general Fenwick Chifunda.

State House Snubs Group

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 3, 1996 (19960103)
by Goodson Machona
 
   Lusaka - State House has thrown out an offer by the Foundation for 
Democratic Process (FODEP) to mediate in the on-going 'conflict' between 
President Chiluba and Post editor-in-chief Fred M'membe.
   In a telephone interview yesterday, President Chiluba's public 
relations and press aide, Richard Sakala, said the issues raised by 
M'membe in his letter to Chiluba were criminal and only the courts can 
settle the matter.
   "There is no question of reconciliation between President Chiluba and 
Fred M'membe," Sakala said.  "What is there is for the two parties to 
meet in court."
   But Women for Change executive director, Emily Sikazwe, says that if 
what M'membe wrote in his letter  was criminal then the President's 
attacks on him, to which he was responding, should also be criminalised. 
"If what M'membe wrote to the President is criminal then the President's 
remarks on M'membe on the Night Line  programme is also criminal," 
Sikazwe said.
   She said it was unfortunate that President Chiluba would like to take 
M'membe to court without waiving his own immunity so that he too can be 
prosecuted.
   "The President has immunity and it would be grossly unfair to take 
M'membe to court without waiving his immunity," Sikazwe said. 
   But FODEP general secretary, Bishop John Mambo, has maintained that 
his organisation will still go ahead and mediate in the stand off.
   "As FODEP we feel we should mediate in the conflict between  
President Chiluba and Mr M'membe," Mambo said in an interview yesterday, 
adding: "This week we will be writing to President Chiluba so that we 
can arrange a meeting for these people."
   He said going to court is not the best solution.
   "Court proceedings take between three to five years to conclude and 
that will not help anybody," Mambo said, adding: "We don't have to wait 
until M'membe or Masautso Phiri (Post special projects editor) has an 
artificial accident for people to act." 
   He dispelled claims by UNIP chairman, Malimba Masheke, that  "FODEP 
and MMD are one".
  "I am above a person that can be used by anybody," Mambo seethed and 
noted that it was President Chiluba's special assistant for press, 
Richard Sakala who is "not courageous enough to call M'membe to State 
House to discuss the issue. That is why we have decided to put a brake 
on this issue".
   But ZIMT president, Alfred Zulu, said no Non Governmental 
Organisation has the right to mediate in the matter.
   "If the President feels offended its up to the judiciary to take 
effect and not an NGO," Zulu said in an interview on Monday.
   The 'conflict' between Chiluba and M'membe has generated a lot of 
interest among civic and political leaders who have criticised FODEP for 
the stand it took over the letter written to President Chiluba by 
M'membe soon after his Christmas eve ZNBC  Night Line Radio programme.
   The Zambia Democratic Congress, the Zambia Civic Education 
Association, the National Party, the Liberal Progressive Party, the 
United National Independence Party (UNIP), the Zambia Independent 
Monitoring Team, the Inter African Network for Human Rights and 
Development (Afronet ) and the Catholic Commission for Peace and Justice 
have all come out in support of M'membe and criticised FODEP's stand 
which they described as "not neutral".
   Meanwhile State House has continued to run full page articles in the 
government owned and controlled newspapers accusing M'membe of being 
unpatriotic and of waging an international "anti-Zambia campaign".

Soccer: Zambians Predict 2-1 Victory Against Egypt

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Mildred Mulenga, PANA Staff Correspondent 

   LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambian soccer fans on Friday predicted their team 
will beat Egypt 2-1 in the quarter-finals of the 1996 Africa Cup of 
Nations to be played Saturday at Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein, 
South Africa. 
   Some 80 percent of Zambian soccer fans who called into a programme on 
national radio Friday morning said Zambia, runners-up in the 1994 Africa 
Cup of Nations played in Tunsia would the tough Egyptian side 2-1. Only 
one caller said Zambia would be beaten by Egypt. He predicted a 0-1 
margin. 
   Zambia who qualified for the quarter-finals on Wednesday after 
beating Sierra Leone 4-0. The Zambian coach Roald Poulsen said Zambia's 
quarter final match against Egypt would be "tough". A local analyst 
Ponga Liwewe said Thursday evening that Zambia has to play a more 
attacking game because the Egyptians are good at holding the ball and 
are "solid" at the back. "We need other players to get to the scoring 
point to put in goals in the first half," Ponga said. 
   Another analyst Anthony Kasolo said Zambia has to cut the Egyptians 
wings were they are known to run the ball well. He said the Zambians 
should also avoid lettting the Egyptians to break their defense in 
counter attacks. The two also expressed concern at what was Zambia's 
relaxed style after scoring five goals and two goals against Burkina 
Faso and Sierra Leone in the first half. 
   Zambia, who during the opening match against Algeria drew 0-0 have so 
far scored nine goals in two games after beating Burkina Faso 5-1 and 
Sierra Leone 4-0 to qualify for the quarter-finals. With five golas to 
his credit, Zambia's skipper Kalusha Bwalya is currently the top scorer 
at the ongoing tournament.

Mozambique
Outrage Grows Over Interior Minister's Remarks

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   MAPUTO, Mozambique - In spite of growing public outrage at his 
remarks, Mozambican interior minister Manuel Antonio has defended his 
position that prisoners have only themselves to blame if they die of 
hunger in police cells. 
   Asked by the daily paper "Noticias" to clarify his position, Antonio 
simply repeated that his ministry does not have the money to buy food 
for prisoners, and that they are in jail because of the crimes they 
committed. 
   "I repeat my statements," said Antonio. "Who asked them to commit 
crimes ?" 
   Many of those incarcerated in prisons run by the police are in fact 
not convicted criminals but detainees awaiting trial. The minister did 
not seem to make a distinction between the two. 
   In an interview published on Monday, Antonio is reported to have 
said: "These men who die, it's really because there's no food to give 
them. They're not maltreated." But the minister added: "A man has to 
die, he has his limits. When his time's up, it's over. He goes. It's not 
because they've been maltreated by the police." 
   The Mozambican Human Rights League has sent a strong protest to 
President Joaquim Chissano, suggesting that Antonio be sacked. The 
minister told "Noticias" he did not care about the league's stance. 
   One of the country's leading lawyers, Carlos Cauio, head of the 
Mozambican Bar Association, described the minister's words as "an 
assault on human dignity". 
   The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Maputo, Cardinal Alexandre dos 
Santos, told the independent news sheet Mediafax, "I intend to speak 
with the minister of the interior. I think that by talking we can 
resolve a lot of things." He described the fate of prisoners as 
"worrying", and added "perhaps it's not just a food shortage -- it's 
because the food is being stolen."

by Olu Sarr, PANA Staff Correspondent

   DAKAR, Senegal - War and soccer were the issues attracting the 
attention of the Africa Press this week. 
   Newspapers in Addis Ababa and Dakar commented on the ongoing Africa 
Cup of Nations. 
   The Monitor of Addis Ababa focused on Nigeria's absence from the 20th 
tournament. "Almost everyone is affected by the absence of the Super 
Eagles," it said. It wondered if this was not fatal: "To Mandela? To 
Nigerian strongman Sani Abacha and to African football? "The only losers 
are African soccer and the football crazy African fans who put soccer 
before politics," it said. 
   Nigeria, it continued, was "by all account" the best football nation 
in Africa. The country, it added, was "big in many ways": population, 
economy, oil and politics but for the average African, all these factors 
matter little. "Soccer comes first and here lies the big 
disappointment," it said. Recounting how Nigerian fans travelled 
worldwide to support the Super Eagles it concluded: "
   The ultimate losers...will definitely be ordinary Nigerian fans who 
had nothing to do with Abacha's decision. "When elephants fight, it is 
the grass that suffers most. What a fitting African adage," it said. 
   As the event moves closer to the final, Dakar's Le Soleil noted that 
after the initial surprise in the tournament "the entire tournament had 
become an affair for the favourites": Algeria, Egypt and Zambia. These 
countries, it said, "have logically bulldozed their way to the 
quarterfinal." 
   From soccer politics to real politik, several Nigerian papers 
condemned the coup d'etat in Sierra Leone which overthrew Capt. 
Valentine Strasser. This condemnation coincided with the visit to 
Nigeria of the new military leader in Freetown, Brig. Julius Bio. 
   The Daily Sketch, of Ibadan, noted wearily that coups used to be the 
business of colonels and their superiors in fairly backward countries. 
They struck in Greece in 1967, in Portugal in 1974 and Spain in 1981. 
"They were then the sick men of Europe, economically and politically. 
Though their economies are yet to become ruddy pink, their politics has 
firmly stablised, a democracy that works, that the military readily 
surbodinates itself to," it noted. 
   "In West Africa, young officers appear to see coup-making as a bit of 
mess fun," it said. The semi-official paper noted that Strasser had set 
general elections for Feb. 26. "Many important Sierra Leoneans took him 
seriously enough to put themselves forward as presidential candidates. 
The new rulers, former lieutenants of the deposed one, have said that 
they are all for a return to democratic rule. But they have not been as 
illuminating with regard to when this will be," it said. 
   But Kenya's largest circulation daily newspaper, the Daily Nation, 
noted that Bio had, in fact, been quick to assure the world he would not 
derail the elections. "How times have changed. A time was when those 
staging coups across Africa did not feel compelled to justify their 
action as swiftly as Brigadier Bio is trying to do," it said. 
   It wondered whether Bio's junta would follow through with elections 
as scheduled "or will they borrow a leaf from another West African 
nation to stay just within reach of another coup, another day?" it said 
in implicit reference to Nigeria's situation. 
   While Strasser alleged that he was ousted because he wanted to 
maintain the election schedule, Bio said that he overthrew Strasser 
precisely because the captain did not really want to hand over to a 
democratically elected civilian government. "
   At the root of the confusion is the fact that members of the 
country's ruling military were not convinced that the military has had 
its fill of political leadership," the Nigerian Tribune, published in 
Ibadan, said. "The division within the hierarchy of the Sierra Leonean 
military epitomises the crisis and perhaps helplessness of African 
states which have been under military rule," it added. 
   For its part, The Vanguard of Lagos, noted that Africa had 
demonstrated its commitment to democracy but Sierra Leone was among the 
uneviable trio [the others being Gambia and Nigeria] still under 
military dictatorships. "We expect the new leaders to meet the people's 
quest for democracy so that the country's name could be deleted from the 
bad list. "
   To this end, Brigadier-General Bio and his clique should do nothing 
that would lead to the postponement of the elections already slated for 
February 26 this year," it said. 
   The press in Burundi, Kenya and Zaire commented on the suggestion by 
United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali that UN troops be 
sent to neighbouring Zaire in readiness to intervene in Burundi to stem 
the genocide shaping up, it seems, in degree and fashion as had happened 
in neighbouring Rwanda. 
   Nairobi's "Daily Nation" castigated the U.N for dilly-dallying on 
whether or not to send the peacekeeping. However, it exonerated Boutros-
Boutros Ghali and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, 
of blame. Despite its nasty experiences at peacekeeping, it said, "it 
would be an ironic tragedy" if, unwilling to preempt a tragedy now, "it 
later spends millions in a tribunal to investigate and indict murderers 
in what may well become the Burundi genocide." 
   The Burundi government-owned newspaper, Le Renouveau, said "foreign 
intervention will never solve Burundi's problems." Instead of a "foreign 
occupation force", it said, there should be "massive aid" to the 
country's millions of orphans. 
   Le Compatriote of Kinshasa said that the "international community and 
African countries should threaten the Burundi government with sanctions 
so as to force it to end the violance against civilians." 
   La Manchette, also a Kinshasa paper, said given the gravity of the 
situation, the United Nations seretary-general should again plea for the 
dispatch of UN troops to Zaire. 
   But La Nation, a Bujumbura privately-owned weekly, said that only 
Zaire's Mobuto Sese Seko would gain by this. "It would allow him to 
emerge from his world political isolation and gain centre stage." Rather 
than sending troops, it said, the U.N "should give the regular [Burundi] 
army the money it would have to spend maintaining the Blue Helmets, or 
help the Burundian judiciary arrest the putschists and masterminds of 
the October 1993 massacres." 
   Another tragedy discussed by Ibadan's Daily Sketch, was Liberia. It 
attacked ULIMO faction leader Roosevelt Johnson for acquiring weapons, 
ambushing West African peacekeeping troops and killing and capturing 
scores of them. It noted that many of the dead were Nigerians and that 
the peacekeeping commander, a Nigerian, said he would not send his men 
to incapacitate Johnson. 
   To add insult to injury, it said Johnson "sounded unrepentant, even 
exultant," during a radio interview. "An ant has painfully tweaked the 
tusk of an elephant and he appeared to be getting away with it," it 
said. This, it said, was "all very well" if one was dealing with an 
opponent that did not suffer from a superiority complex. "Mr. Johnson 
appears to," it said. "He should be given the Prince Johnson treatment. 
He should be made to beg to be taken out of Liberia," it said. 
   The World Bank representative in Nairobi, Steve O'Brien, last week 
warned that it was unlikely that donor countries would give funds to 
poor nations come July 1996 because no pledges had been forthcoming. 
   Against this forecast, the Kenya Times, the ruling party newspaper, 
said: "The bottom line is that African nations, which have hitherto 
heavily relied on donor assistance, must contrive ways of pulling 
themselves out of the economic hardships by their own bootstraps." 
Pinpointing one of Africa's problems as the lack of a sound 
technological base it advised thus: "All Africa ought to do is to learn 
how to benefit from international patents like they have done in Japan, 
South Korea and Taiwan and other countries who survived on borrowed 
technology. This will make Africa self-reliant."

Kenya
Shilling Hits Record Low

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   NAIROBI, Kenya - The Kenyan shilling hit its sharpest fall in almost 
a year Thursday when it plummeted to 59.1 from 55.50 to the US dollar. 
   The fall came as the World Bank announced it had suspended further 
disbursement of loans to the East African state after government over-
expenditure and corruption in high places. The bank said it would review 
disbursement of funds to Kenya in a joint mission with the International 
Monetary Fund. 
   Kenya was to have presented two loan applications for USD 165 million 
to the bank's board in Washington Thursday. The loans were to finance to 
major road projects. Most of Kenya's bilateral donors are withholding 
funds until the country and the World Bank and the IMF sort out their 
differences.

Benin
Soglo Threatens To Rule By Edict

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Ali Idrissou Toure, PANA Correspondent


   COTONOU, Benin - Benin president Nicephore Soglo threatened Thursday 
evening on national television to use edicts to implement the state's 
general budget and the Third Structural Adjustment Programme (PAS-III), 
which has been postponed three times by parliament. 
   Speaking at the end of a meeting with employees at the National Oil 
Products Marketing Company (SONACOP), Soglo said he would be "obliged to 
use the mechanisms provided for by the institutions" if there was a 
"block" or "hindrance to the normal operation of the State". 
   Benin's parliament has demanded that the government renegotiate the 
terms of the structural adjustment programme with the World Bank. But 
Soglo has said this is "a rejection" of the programme which has already 
been approved by the bank's board. 
   A decision taken by the bank cannot be put into question, he added. 
"Our country needs foreign resources and a budget to meet the challenges 
of 1996," the president said. This programme has stirred differences 
between the government, on the one hand, and the unions and parliament 
on the other.

Burundi
Bujumbura Police Arrest Union Leaders, Journalists

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   BUJUMBURA, Burundi - Police in Bujumbura have arrested several trade 
unionists, politicians and journalists suspected of being ringleaders in 
a recent one-week strike. 
   The strike, from Jan. 15 to 21, was called to force the resignation 
of the government of President Sylivestre Ntibantunya, on allegations 
that he has been secretly been backing Hutu guerrillas in their fight 
against the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army. 
   The latest arrests came a few days after that of Deo Niyonzima, who 
heads a Tutsi group known as "The Youth Solidarity for the Defence of 
Minorities", which spearheaded the work-stoppage. Niyomzima was arrested 
by the police after a James Bond-type chase in the streets of the 
Burundian capital. 
   A trade unionist at the National Institute of Public Security, 
Innocent Massunzu, was arrested Thursday evening for his alleged role in 
the strike. As part of a crackdown against the strike's leaders, the 
government has placed Hitimana Mathias and Cyrille Sigejeje under house 
arrest for the past 20 days. 
   Hitimana is Chairmen (People's Reconciliation Party while Sigejeje 
heads the Rally for Democracy and Social Development. The government has 
also detained two independent journalists, 
   Doweri Dismas of the weekly "La Balance" and Jean-Marie Bizimana of 
"La Nation", another weekly. Doweri allegedly wrote articles that 
insulted cabinet ministers while Bizimana is accused of trying to divide 
and demoralise the army during the strike. 
   The Tutsi-dominated army did not back the strike. Reliable sources in 
the justice ministry said arrest warrants had also been issued for 
secondary school teachers and university lecturers suspected of being 
behind the anti-government work stoppage. 
   At the beginning of the strike, the Tutsi Burundian Prime Minister 
Antoine Nduwayo cautioned the organisers the government would take stern 
action. Burundi has been rocked by political instability and ethnic 
violence since October 1993, after the Hutu democratically elected 
President Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated in a failed coup d'etat by 
elements of the Tutsi-dominated army.

Nigeria
Prisons Full of People Awaiting Trial

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Some 35,750 inmates are awaiting trial in Nigerian 
prisons, some for the past 10 years, according Internal Affairs Minister 
Baba Gana Kingibe. 
   These suspects represent about 65 percent of the total 55,000 inmates 
in the country's jail houses. At a briefing Thursday in Abuja, the 
nation's capital, the minister said "even convicts are human beings and 
are entitled to basic rights." 
   He said "it is hard enough being behind bars and harder still not to 
be accorded proper care and treatment whilst in prison." To decongest 
the prisons, Kingibe, Nigeria's Foreign Minister until early 1995, urged 
the police and courts to speed the judicial processes. He said the 
"principle of modern-day incarceration emphasises correction in 
preferecne to punishment. 
   Part of this principle is the entitlement of the prisoner to decent 
environment and decent feeding." To this end, the minister said 
government recently increased the inmates' feeding allowance by 100 
percent from 30 to 60 Naira per head. ( 85 Naira exchanges for one 
U.S.dollar in the populous West African country where the minimum wage 
is below 25 dollars a month).

Nigeria and Sierra Leone
Freetown Denies Nigerian Involvement in Coup

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - The secretary to Sierra Leone's new military 
government, John Benjamin, has dismissed speculation that Nigeria had 
anything to do with the recent coup in his country. 
   He told journalists in Freetown Thursday it was baseless to accuse 
Nigeria of involvement in the January 16 bloodless coup that toppled 
Capt. Valentine Strasser and swept his former deputy, Brig. Julius Maada 
Bio, to power. 
   Nigerian defence minister Brig.Gen. Fred Chijuka was the first to 
deny any nigerian involvement in the palace coup, which he described as 
an internal issue for Sierra Leone. Benjamin, who also served as 
secretary to the deposed Strasser regime, however, confirmed that 
Strasser's decision to vote against Nigeria in the last Commonwealth 
Summit in Aukland, New Zealand, had caused a big rift in Sierra Leone's 
former cabinet. 
   He was quoted as saying "Nigeria has done so much for us and there 
was no justification for antagonising her." The Commonwealth Summit 
suspended Nigeria over the November 10 execution of nine of its citizens 
convicted for murder. They included the author Ken Saro-Wiwa. 
   The Gambia was said to be the only African country that voted against 
the Commonwealth action on Nigeria. 
   Nigeria has troops in Sierra Leone, helping the government fight the 
four-year-old war against the rebel Revolutionary Front. Bio has visited 
Nigerian military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha to condole him on the recent 
death of eldest son, Ibrahim. He died whenthe presidential jet in which 
he was travelling crashed.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - Sierra Leonean soccer lovers have expressed 
disappointment at their country's elimination from the ongoing 20th 
Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa. 
   Freetown residents wore long faces Thursday after Zambia trounced the 
Leone Stars 4-0 Wednesday in their last group match to send the Sierra 
Leoneans on an early exit from the tournament that had provided a 
welcome diversion from the political crisis at home. Sierra Leone saw 
yet another military coup on January 16. The Stars had beaten Burkina 
Faso 2-1 in their opeining match, with 16-year-old Mohammed Kallon 
showing a lot of promise. Their 2-1 loss to Algeria in the second match 
had still left fans with some hope until the Zambians nailed the Stars' 
coffin.

Nigeria Alert Over Reported Hazardous Waste Import

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria has put its customs and immigration units on 
a red alert over impending delivery of a consignment of hazardous waste 
ordered by an unnamed firm. 
   Officials said here Friday the warning had been received by the 
Transport Ministry, which in turn directed the customs services to take 
action. All the area comptrollers have been instructed "to beef up 
surveillance and put officers on red alert" to foil the attempt to 
smuggle the waste into the country, the officials said. 
   The port health division is also said to be taking precautionary 
measures. Details of the alleged waste and the importer have not been 
given, for what officials called "diplomatic and security reasons." 
   Nigeria was a victim of toxic waste dump by an Italian firm in 1988. 
The dump in Koko, midwestern Nigeria, sensitised the country and put her 
in the forefront of international anti-dump campaign. Nigeria set up the 
Federal Environmental Protection Agency following the incident.
   A year later, Abuja promulgated a tough decree, prescribing life jail 
for any person convicted of importing hazardous waste into the country. 
Collectively, African coutries also adopted the Bamako Convention 
forbidding the trans-boundary transportation of toxic wastes.

   LAGOS, Nigeria - President Bill Clinton and Sadam Hussein of Iraq are 
among world leaders that have condoled Nigeria's military ruler Gen. 
Sani Abacha, over last week's death of his eledest son in a presidential 
jet crash, officials said Friday.

"great sorrow the news of the death of Ibrahim and those accompanying 
him in a tragic and unfortunate air accident. Please accept our 
heartfelt condolences"

along with 14 others on board the British-made Hawker Siddeley 125 jet, 
which crashed near the Kano airport in Northern Nigeria. Aviation and

Hundreds Of Bank Debtors To Face Trial

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   LAGOS, Ngieria - At least 337 major debtors of 12 failed Nigerian 
banks are to face trial under a new government decree, officials said 
Friday. 
   Prominent politicians, businessmen and traditional rulers are said to 
be on the debtors' list kept by the Nigerian National Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, charged with debt recovery. 
   More than six billion naira are said to be involved in the 12 
insolvent banks (85 naira =1 USD). Details and names of the affected 
people or commencement of trial were not available, but prosecution 
lawyers are said to have been provided with the list. A new decree to 
stem a spate of bank failures in the West African country, prescribes up 
to 21 years inprisonment for a convict, in addition to hefty fines. 
   Five special tribunals are currently trying the chief executives of 
the failed banks. Bank sources say more than 120 of the bank chiefs are 
in detention awaiting trial. 
   Many of the banks floated during the heady days of "easy money," have 
fallen foul of government's new strict regulation to sanitise the 
banking and finance industry.

Zimbabwe and Ethiopia
Case Involving Mengistu Put Off

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - A Harare regional magistrate said Friday that the 
man charged with trying to kill former Ethiopian strongman Mengistu 
Haile Mariam would have to stand in court, even without a defence lawyer 
because his trial had been repeatedly postponed. 
   Regional Magistrate William Cutler told Abraham Kinfe, 35, that his 
case was dragging for too long. Kinfe was charged in November 1995 on 
two counts of conspiracy to attempted murder and of illegal possession 
of arms of war, Kinfe, who is still looking for a lawyer to defend him, 
was remanded in custody to February 2. 
   Kinfe, an Ethiopian, wanted to assassinate Col Mengistu to revenge 
the alleged killing hundreds of people during his rule. There was tight 
security within and outside the court, with an armed policeman sitting 
inside. 
   Kinfe said his interpreter was not translating accurately what the 
magistrate was saying. 
   The trial was postponed for seven days in November 1995 after an 
application by Kinfe's lawyer, Tinofara Hove of T.K. Hove and Partners, 
that his client needed medical examination. 
   The trial was again postponed after another application in which Hove 
said there were outstanding issues which needed redress. In both cases 
the regional magistrate granted the applications with some reluctance.

86 Foreigners Deported Over Alleged Fraud

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigerian immigration authorities deported at least 
86 foreigners suspected of financial fraud in 1995, officials said 
Friday. 
   Immigration Spokesman Bayo Afolabi said 112 Nigerians were also 
denied foreign trips during the same period, over alleged dubious 
practices including possession of forged passports. 
   The new director of the immigration service, Sahabi Dange, spoke 
recently of an intensified drive to help curb the advance fee financial 
scam known as locally as "419." Nigerian and foreign businessmen have 
fallen victim of the practice, which has brought international disrepute 
to the already politically troubled West African country. 
   However, Nigerian officials say it normally takes the citizens and 
their foreign collaborators to commit the crime. Officials have urged 
diplomatic missions in Nigeria to advise their nationals to follow 
appropriate procedure when doing business in Nigeria. Immigration 
officials also say some citizens of other African countries of forging 
Nigerian passports for the commission of crimes, for which Nigerians are 
being blamed. It is not clear from which African countries there 
criminals are from.

Zimbabwe
Foreigners To Invest More

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Foreign investors pumped in over 1.1 billion 
Zimdollars (about 122 million USD) between June 1993 and December 1995 
following government decision to open up the Zimbabwe Stock exchange to 
foreign investors. 
   Total foreign purchases since June 23 1993 totalled 2.15 billion ZD 
(239 million USD), while the net inflow was about 1.119 billion ZD (124 
million USD), market analysts said on Friday. Quincor Stockbrokers said 
in their January bulletin the stock market, once dubbed the world's 
worst performer in 1992/93, had recovered during the past three years 
and was last year ranked third best performing stocks in emerging 
markets by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). "Over the past 
12 months, the market has had its ups and downs. 
   In general, the mining index moved in sympathy with the industrial 
index. The first three months of 1995 were bad for Zimbabwean equities, 
but both sectors rallied from intra-year lows in march to reach all-time 
record levels in October," the company said. 
   However, the market was in 1995 affected by a rash of poor results 
released by quoted companies, particularly during the last quarter of 
the year, which showed the negative effects of the 1994/95 drought, 
Quincor said. "The last batch of poor results and announcements 
depressed sentiment, but none were a surprise to the market. 
   Overall, the market is looking fairly valued on the prospect of 
reasonable rains," it said. Quincor predicted the market will this year 
benefit from a good rainy season, which would see the key industrial 
index breaching the 4,800 level for the first time. 
   Meanwhile, the industrial index on Friday reached an all-time high of 
4,257, having gained 24 points on the back of active trading during the 
morning. Minings, however, remained unchanged with reasonable turnover 
in key counters. 
   The index close nine points up at 1,341.43 points.

Lesotho
King Moshoeshoe II Buried

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   MASERU, Lesotho - Several leaders from Southern Africa joined 
thousands of mourners Friday in paying their last respects to King 
Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho who was buried Friday. 
   The King was buried at the national mountaintop shrine of Thava 
Bosiu, outside the capital Maseru, at a ceremony attended by presidents 
Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Frederick 
Chiluba of Zambia and Sir Khetumile Masire of Botswana. 
   Masire, who spoke on behalf of the other leaders, described King 
Moshoeshoe as "an illustrious son of Africa", adding: "The whole of 
Africa, as well as the world at large, have suffered an enormous loss." 
   King Moshoeshoe, 57, and his driver were killed when his car went off 
a Maluti mountain road January 15 early in the morning. The vehicle 
rolled down the mountain for about 500 metres before coming to a halt. 
He had gone to inspect his cattle posts. 
   Pathologists who examined the King said he suffered multiple rib and 
head fractures. A member of the royal family dismissed rumours that the 
King Noshoeshoe had died because of foul play. "The royal family is 
satisfied that his majesty left to join his ancestors because his time 
had come. Any claims and counter-claims and questions are, therefore, 
not true," said Chief Masupha Seeiso, the King's brother. 
   King Moshoeshoe was a constitutional monarch who wielded no legal 
powers. He was enthroned in 1960, succeeding Queen Regent Mansebo 
Seeiso. He was dethroned in 1990 after a coup d'etat by Maj. Gen. 
Justine Lekhanya and replaced by his son, King Letsie III, under the 
orders of the military. 
   In turn, King Letsie staged a royal coup in 1994, ousting the 
government of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle and immediately suspending 
the constitution. However, the action received international 
condemnation and the coup was reversed in less than a month following 
the intervention of the leaders of Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe. 
   Letsie, however, only abdicated after promises that his father would 
be reinstated. 
   King Moshoeshoe returned from exile in Britain in 1993 when the 
military ruler at the time, Maj. Gen. Elias Ramaema surrendered 
government to civilian rulers. King Moshoeshoe regained his throne on 
January 25 1995. 
   Crown Prince David Mohato Bereng Seeiso, 32, [King Letsie III] is 
expected to succeed his father at a date to be announced.

Comoros
President Djohar Returns To Moroni

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - President Siad Mohamed Djohar returned to 
Moroni Friday, accompanied by a delegation of the Organisation of 
African Unity (OAU), according to a statement released by the 
continental body on the same day in Addis Ababa. 
   The return of the Comorian leader after several months in "forced 
exile" in the island of Reunion followed an agreement reached earlier 
this week between the country's political parties at a conference held 
in Madagascar under the auspices of the OAU. 
   He was taken to the island by French troops who put and end to a 
military take over of the Moroni government by mercenaries headed by Bod 
Denard in September 1995. 
   "Djohar and the OAU delegation headed by Assistant Secretary General 
Vijay S. Makhan, were welcomed on arrival in Moroni by Prime Minister 
Caabi El Yachroutu of the national unity government of Comoros and 
members of his government," the release said. 
   The OAU brokered an agreement with the Comorian parties at meetings 
held in Antananarivo on January 21 and 22, which provides for the 
holding of free and fair elections on March 6 and 16, under the 
supervision of the OAU and the United Nations. The OAU delegation 
currently in Moroni will hold a preliminary meeting of the follow-up 
committee with participants of the Antananarivo conference. 
   It will also be attended by observers from the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and France who are currently in Moroni. 
"This Committee which is provided for in the Antananarivo agreement is 
responsible for the implementation of the clauses of the agreement", the 
OAU statement said.

Nigeria and Gambia
Bilateral Pact To Set Up Youth Scheme

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria is helping Gambia set up its youth service 
scheme under a new bilateral pact, officials said Friday in Abuja. 
   Six senior officials of Nigeria's National Youth Service Corps, set 
up in 1973, have been seconded to Banjul on the programme based on a 
1994 request by the Gambia, the officials said. A director of Nigeria's 
corps, Grey Anegwea, now assumes that position of the Gambian Youth 
Service Scheme, which started last week. 
   Nigeria's corps, under which fresh university graduates serve one 
year in parts of the country other than their own, is designed to 
promote national unity and integration in the country of 100 million 
people with diverse ethnic groups. About 500,000 people have passed 
through the programme, launched under by former military ruler Gen. 
Yakubu Gowon, after Nigeria's civil war that ended in 1970. 
   Nigerian Youth Service Corps officials say the first intake of the 
Gambian service is expected to be mobilised at the end of the 1995/96 
academic year. The director-general of Nigeria's service, Col. Soyemi 
Sofolufe, says Nigeria is prepared to assist other African countries 
that have an interest in setting up a similar programme.

Liberia and United States
U.S. Envoy Commends African Peace Force

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent

   UNITED NATIONS - United States Ambassador to the United Nations 
Madeleine Albright has called on the international community to support 
the African Peace Monitoring Group in Liberia, or ECOMOG, in its efforts 
to end years of civil war. 
   Speaking at a U.N. Security Council meeting on Liberia Thursday, 
Albright commended the force and its field commander, Brig. Gen. John 
Inienger of Nigeria, for his determination to carry out its mandate. 
   "Overall, at least for now, I found Ecomog performing well," she 
said. "They seem to be playing a neutral and constructive role now, as 
opposed to various times in the past." 
   ECOMOG was sent to Monrovia in 1990 by the 16-nation Economic 
Community of West African States (Ecowas). The peacekeepers were shelled 
on their ships in their first attempt to come ashore. The force was 
enlarged at one stage to include troops from the East African states of 
Tanzania and Uganda. They withdrew due to a delay in the peace process. 
   Albright said, "despite Ecomog's losses in recent weeks, I was 
impressed by Gen. Inienger's resolve to move forward in the face of 
adversity." 
   She added, "We [the U.S.] believe Ecomog deserves our support." 
However, she said that Ecomog's force structure should be more 
diversified among member states of the region if it is to constitute an 
authentic regional peacekeeping operation worthy of international 
support. "We also believe that Ecomog must enter into a status of forces 
agreement with the Liberian National Transitional Government so that 
Ecomog's operations in Liberia are appropriately regulated," she said. 
The deployment of Ecomog across Liberia in December 1995 was made 
possible by the 10-million-dollar pledge by the U.S. to assist the force 
logistically. "
   The vehicles Ecomog desperately needs to facilitate disarmament and 
demobilisation have begun to arrive under the 10-million-dollar pledge," 
she said, and said other countries should help. Nigeria has the largest 
contingent in Ecomog. The force, along with the U.N. Observer Mission in 
Liberia is expected to monitor the implementation of the Abuja 
Agreement, signed by the Liberian warring factions in August. 
   The agreement is widely seen as a last-ditch effort to end the six-
year civil war, which has claimed 150,000 lives and sent half of the 
country's 2.5 million people to seek refuge in other countries.

Zambia and Rwanda
Trial Preparations for Genocide Suspects

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent
 
   LUSAKA, Zambia -  The Rwandese government has trained more than 300 
magistrates, prosecutors and other court staff to help try suspected 
perpetrators of the 1994 genocide in that country.
   Rwanda Foreign Minister Anastase Gazana said in Lusaka Wednesday that 
his government will try some of the genocide suspects under a United 
Nations mandate which in 1995 set up the Rwanda International Genocide 
Tribunal to bring the culprits to book.
   He said that under the tribunal's terms of reference governments, 
including Rwanda itself, had the powers to try anybody suspected of 
involvement in the genocide in which an estimated 1,000,000 Rwandese 
died and millions of others forced to flee for safety.
   Gazana arrived in Lusaka Tuesday to brief Zambian government 
officials about the identity of some of the suspected authors of the 
genocide who are believed to be hiding in Zambia.
   A team of experts have arrived in Arusha, Tanzania, to prepare for 
the trials by the tribunal chaired by South African Judge Richard 
Goldstone.
   The tribunal is expected to start hearing evidence by March, 
according to Gazana.
   Rwanda has appealed to the international community to turn over to 
the tribunal any suspects who might have taken refuge in foreign 
countries.
   Gazana Wednesday handed the Zambian government a list of some 500 
suspects including former Justice Minister Agnes Ntamabyaliro who is 
suspected to be in Zambia.
   Lusaka said it detained some suspected Rwandese fugitives who would 
be handed over to the tribunal.
   Gazana said his government was not particularly interested in 
securing death sentences for the suspects but that it was necessary that 
"justice" was done.
   "We are not particularly looking for death for the perpetrators (of 
the genocide), we want justice to be done in order to reconcile those 
who had been wronged".
   Victims of the genocide were mainly people of the minority Tutsi 
ethnic group and some liberal majority Hutus.
   Gazana said the Kigali government recommended that foreign 
governments who imprisoned any of the genocide suspects should ensure 
that they were excluded from prerogatives of mercy so that they could 
serve the full terms according to international law on genocide.
   Gazana who was accompanied by Zambian Justice Minister Mukabenzi 
Marthe returns to Kigali Thursday.
   He has undertaken similar missions to several other African countries 
seeking to have suspects repatriated and handed over either to the 
tribunal in Tanzania or to his government.

Rwanda
Government Calls for International Support to Rebuild

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent
  
   LUSAKA, Zambia - Nearly two years after at least one million of its 
people were massacred in an organized genocide, Rwanda is appealing to 
African and other states to support her national reconstruction and 
rehabilitation efforts.
   The appeal is contained in Kigali's foreign ministry memorandum 
entitled "The General Situation in Rwanda" after the genocide.
   The document urges the international community to pledge to take 
joint concrete actions to advance peace, justice, reconciliation, 
stability and development in Rwanda and the rest of the Great Lakes 
Region.
   " All the nations must be determined to prevent future genocide, 
ensure reconciliation with justice relating to the tragic genocide and 
massacres in Rwanda in 1994 and encourage the return of refugees to 
their home-countries," said the memorandum.
   The memorandum was issued to PANA late Wednesday by visiting Rwandan 
Foreign Minister, Anastase Gasana.
   It said that among the specific actions the world community could 
undertake to assist in rebuilding the country included mobilization of 
financial resources for social and economic rehabilitation.
   Rwanda also called for the acceleration of the international 
tribunal's effort to try genocide suspects and urged all concerned 
governments to hand over suspects to the international court. 
Deliberations are expected to start next March in Arusha, northern 
Tanzanian.
   A conference in Kigali last November on the "Genocide, impunity and 
accountability: A dialogue for national and international response" 
recommended that the rehabilitation process in Rwanda should include 
reconstituting the moral, physical, socio-economic and psychological 
values of the survivors of the genocide.
   Kigali has set restoration of education, justice, agriculture, health 
and repatriation of refugees as among the priorities in the national 
reconstruction and rehabilitation process.
   Rwanda also recommended to the international community to set up a 
genocide compensation fund for the genocide victims.
   The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) government estimates that 1.5 
million of the two million refugees who fled to neighboring Burundi, 
Tanzania and Zaire have returned to the country and were currently being 
rehabilitated.
   But reports from the Burundi-Tanzania border indicate an outflow of 
Rwandan Hutu refugees from Burundi to escape attacks from Bujumbura's 
Tutsi-dominated army.
   The Hutu refugees fled into exile fearing reprisals from the mostly 
Tutsi RPF, which took power in Kigali in July 1994.
   The RPF, mainly composed of sons of Uganda-based Tutsi exiles, had 
been fighting the army of the late Rwandan President, Juvenal 
Habyarimana, since Oct. 1, 1990.

Nigeria
Population Hits 100 Million

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Paul Ejime PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - The population of Nigeria, Africa's most populous 
state, has hit the 100 million mark, the country's National Population 
Commission has said.
   A 1991 census by the commission put the country's population at 88.5 
million with annual growth estimate of 2.83 percent.
   Commission's spokesman Ahmed Hameed told journalists in Lagos that 
based on the growth rate Nigeria's population had reached 100 million by 
December 1995.
   The World Bank and several United Nations agencies estimate the 
country's population at more than 100 million.
   The 1991 figure stirred much controversy, with some states claiming 
they had been under-counted.
   The commission has, however, said the protests could not invalidate 
the census, Nigeria's first in almost 20 years.
   Censuses are a sensitive subject in Nigeria, a politically polarised 
federation of diverse ethnic groups.
   Groups said to have larger populations often demand a greater share 
of the national cake.
   Hameed said the population commision plans another head count in 
2001, adding that at least three years of preparation would be needed to 
ensure reliable data is obtained.

Liberia
Boutros-Ghali Urges Extension of UN Mission

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent
 
   UNITED NATIONS, New York - United Nations Secretary-General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali has asked the Security Council to extend the mandate of 
the United Nations mission in Liberia for four months, despite the 
setback in the peace process caused by recent fighting in parts of the 
country.
   In his latest report to the council on the U.N. Observer Mission in 
Liberia (UNOMIL), he recommended that the mandate, which expires at the 
end of this month, be extended until May 31.
   The UN chief said "during this period, I expect the LTG (Liberian 
National Transitional Government) and faction leaders to provide their 
full cooperation to ECOMOG and UNOMIL in stabilizing the situation and 
in vigorously moving ahead with the implementation of the Abuja 
agreement."
   He also called on the international community to reconsider urgently 
its current level of support to the Ecowas Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to 
enable it to carry out its responsibilities under the agreement.
   Boutros-Ghali described as a setback the recent fighting in 
Tubmanburg and the delay in implementing key aspects of the Abuja 
agreement, signed in the Nigerian capital Aug. 19, 1995.
   He said the "peace process suffered a setback when Gen. Roosevelt 
Johnson's wing of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for 
Democracy (ULIMO-J) attacked ECOMOG in Tubmanburg on Dec. 28 1995."
   Under the schedule of implementation of the agreement, the 
disengagement of forces was to have been completed by Sept. 26 while 
disarmament was to have started Dec. 1.
   Boutros-Ghali said "the peace process is now at a critical juncture 
and the full support of all concerned will be required to overcome the 
recent setbacks."
   He warned faction leaders that ECOWAS (Economic community of West 
African States) and the international community could not support the 
Liberian peace process indefinitely.
   Meanwhile, the UN chief has announced his intention to appoint a 
senior electoral officer to follow, on a full-time basis, the 
preparatory phases of the electoral process in Liberia.
   He said he would also send a technical mission to Liberia to consult 
with the LNTG and ECOWAS, among others, in drafting a framework for the 
observation and verification of the electoral process.
   Under the Abuja accord, legislative and presidential elections are 
scheduled for Aug. 20, 1996.
   The agreement is widely regarded as the most-promising effort to end 
the six-year fighting in Liberia, which has claimed 150,000 lives and 
displaced a large percentage of the country's 2.5 million people.

Benin
Airline Has Financial Woes

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Ali Idrissou, PANA Correspondent
   
   COTONOU, Benin - Air Afrique's board of governors holds its 87th 
session Thursday and Friday in Cotonou against a background of financial 
trouble at the airline.
   The company is trying to raise 5.8 billion cfa, out of some 15 
billion cfa (1 U.S. dollar = about 500 cfa), needed in new investment.
   Sources close to the airline said France already had given the 
company, in which it is a major partner, 9.2 billion cfa in new 
financing.
   Air Afrique in December disclosed it was in urgent need of new cash 
to sustain operations. Most of the money will go toward paying for four 
planes bought between 1991 and 1994.
   The company has serious cash flow problems. Member states owe it some 
four billion cfa in unpaid flight tickets. Air Afrique's own debt is 
estimated at at 200 billion cfa.
   According to the same sources, French and American experts have urged 
a radical restructuring of the company, including a "long term 
privatization of the company, with gradual state disengagement."
   The changes are centered on cutting costs and making operations more 
efficient.
   Foreign shareholders -- Air France, the French Development Fund, the 
West African Development Bank and DHL -- have a 49 percent of stake in 
Air Afrique.
   Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Congo, Central African Republic, Ivory 
Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Togo own 51 
percent of the company.

Soccer: Algeria's Desert Warriors In Quarter-Finals

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Randy Zormelo,PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa - Striker Khaled Louncini led Algeria to 
a 2-1 victory over Burkina Faso in a Group 'B' clash in Port Elizabeth 
Wednesday, qualifying his side for the quarter finals of the 20th 
African Cup of Nations in South Africa.
   Louncini rocked Burkina in the second minute with a lethal header off 
a left-footed cross from Sidi Ahmed Zerrouki.
   The 'Stallions'  bounced back five minutes later but missed the 
target as Aboubabcary's close range shot went screaming centimetres over 
the bar. Half time score was 1-0 againt the stallions.
   The Burkinabe's, rejuvinated by changes at the beginning of the 
second half, dominated proceedings, making several assaults towards the 
Algerian goal.
   But Algeria struck again in the 76th minute when Louncini put 
midfielder Moussa Saib through to score the second goal.
   The Stallions of Ouagadougou pulled one back when striker Boureima 
Zonga slotted in a header off a cross from Ibrahima Traore.
   Meanwhile Zambia made mincemeat of Sierra Leone with a 4-0 drabbing 
in a wet Group 'B' match played Wednesday in Bloemfontein.
   The 1994 vice-champions were in great form with skipper Kalusha 
Bwalya scoring a hat-trick (2nd, 9th and 84th minutes). Midfielder Modon 
Malitoli completed the rout in the 88th minute.
   In Durban on the same day Angola held Cameroon to 3-3 draw in the 
Group A match. But the two sides are out of the competition.
   In the earlier Group A match played in Johannesburg Egypt upset 
hosts, South Africa, 1-0. But the victory margin was not enough to 
topple South Africa from its perch in the group. The Pharaohs are 
runner-up.
   Quarter final line-up: South Africa vs Algeria; (Johannesburg) Zambia 
vs Egypt (Bloemfontein). The other four quarter finals pairs will be 
decided after Thursday's matches.

Sierra Leone  
Rebels Declare Unilateral Cease-fire 

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
      
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United 
Front declared a one-week unconditional cease-fire in its four-year war 
in the West African country. 
   RUF spokesman Fayia Musa said in an interview broadcast late Tuesday 
that the move was in response to the peace offer from Sierra Leone's new 
military rulers. 
   He said the group ordered its units to stop "all the ambushes and 
fighting" immediately. 
   This is not the first cease-fire in the civil war, which has defied 
several peace moves including the one initiated by the Organization of 
African Unity. 
   Musa said the latest RUF offer is to allow humanitarian relief reach 
civilians in the rebel-controlled area. 
   Sierra Leone's new military ruler, Brig. Julius Maada Bio, in one of 
his initial gestures since assuming power after the bloodless coup Jan. 
16, invited the RUF to negotiate to end the war and the country's 
polititcal crisis. 
   Bio also promised amnesty for the rebels and renewed his commitment 
to democracy, saying the Feb. 26 national elections will proceed as 
planned by the man he overthrew, Capt. Valentine Strasser. 
   Musa said the group was committed to peace, but he reiterated the 
organization's demand to postpone the national elections. 
   Diplomatic sources in Freetown say both sides were to begin 
reconciliation talks that could signal the return of peace to Sierra 
Leone. 
   The diplomats say the government could agree to the rebels' request 
and postpone the polls, if only to be seen as accommodating all 
interests in the democratic process. 
   Bio heads a 17-member military ruling council. 
   Sierra Leone, with four million people, is rich in diamonds, gold and 
other prized minerals, but the civil was has devastated its economy, 
prompting successive governments in Freetown to seek foreign military 
assistance.

Somalia
Security Council Still Committed to Peace

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent
   
   UNITED NATIONS, New York - The Security Council, which voted in 1995 
to end its mission in Somalia, pledged to remain involved in the peace 
efforts, saying it takes the situation there very seriously. 
   "We do not wish the implication to be given that somehow what is 
going on in Somalia is of no consequence to us, that Somalia has been 
abandoned," Council President John Weston of Britain said after a 
discussion of the secretary-general's latest report on Somalia. 
   He also said the council supported the efforts of the Nairobi-based 
United Nations Political Office for Somalia, which is "keeping a 
watching brief on that country." 
   Weston said the council had noted the "heroic efforts" of 
humanitarian and other agencies whose presence in Somalia was doing much 
to prevent the worst tragedies from happening in the country. 
   Weston expressed the hope the emergence of regional administration in 
various parts of Somalia would lead to "new possibilities for setting up 
a proper centralized government again in that country." 
   In the report, released on Monday, the Secretary-General said the 
current situation in Somalia was characterized by "political 
instability, inter-clan conflict, banditry and general lawlessness." 
   He said "the political situation in Somalia has been dominated by a 
debilitating stalemate for almost two years since the Somali faction 
leaders failed to honor their commitments in the Nairobi declaration of 
March 24, 1994." 
   However, the Secretary-General noted that an all-out civil war, which 
many feared would follow the withdrawal of U.N. forces from the country, 
had been averted despite its lack of progress toward national 
reconciliation. 
   The Security Council, citing lack of progress in efforts to end the 
Somali conflict, withdrew the UN operation in Somalia in March

Africans Among Journalists Killed In 1995

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
   
   DAKAR, Senegal - Twenty-eight Africans were among 50 journalists 
killed in 1995, according to a survey conducted by Paris-based 
'Reporters Sans Frontiers'quoted by French 'Frequence Libre'newspaper 
Wednesday. 
   The paper attributed the high number of African journalists killed 
last year to the Algerian crisis and the conflict in the Great Lakes of 
Central Africa. 
   Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union followed with ten 
victims including five in Russia, two in Tadjikistan, and one each in 
Azerbaidjan, Croatia and the United Kingdom. 
   The American continents lost eight people -- four in Brazil, two in 
Colombia, one in Canada and one in Mexico. 
   The four other victims whose nationalities were not disclosed were 
killed in Asia.

Kenya
Government Urged to Drop Press Legislation

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
   
   NAIROBI, Kenya - The Union of African Journalists (UAJ) has appealed 
to the Kenyan government to drop plans to introduce press legislation. 
   The call was made Tuesday in Cairo by UAJ's President Mahfouz 
Elansary and Secretary-General George Odiko. 
   Speaking during the closure of a three-week seminar attended by 20 
African journalists, the two said the envisaged legislation would only 
help to suppress the media industry "making it less productive." 
   "There  are already enough laws in Kenya to deal with individuals and 
organizations so the union sees no good reason for the country to 
introduce more restrictions on the press," Odiko said. 
   The two union leaders said the proposed laws were intended to create 
fear among individuals wishing to establish independent broadcasting 
stations and media publishing houses. 
   Elansary said if the bills are passed in parliament, Kenya risked 
joining the list of countries that had muzzled the press. 
   Meanwhile, the Association of Free and Independent Press (AFIP) has 
asked Kenya's attorney-general to withdraw the draft bills saying they 
were a betrayal of his commitment to the democratization process. 
   Recently, the attorney-general published the draft 'Kenya Press 
Council Bill'which, if passed, will lead to the creation of a council 
charged with the registration of journalists and the massa media. 
   The government also published the 'Kenya Mass Media Commission' which 
is expected to regulate the operations of the mass media, including 
registration of newspapers and licencing of newspapers and broadcast 
media.

Senegal  
Mosquito Trap Raises Hope in Anti-Malaria Fight

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
by Aly Coulibaly,  PANA Correspondent
   
   DAKAR, Senegal - The French Institute for Research and Development 
Cooperation (ORSTOM) is currently experimenting with a mosquito trap to 
eradicate that malaria carrier. 
   ORSTOM entomologist Robert Vincent said the trap, fitted with a bulb, 
is similar to the one that his organization developed 20 years ago to 
catch tse-tse flies. 
   He said that a Dutch collegue, Bart Knols, has been studying for two 
years the effectiveness of the mosquito trap, which has also been tested 
in Tanzania for five years. 
   Among the study's goals is to find factors that make human blood 
attractive to mosquitoes. 
   So far, the researchers have found that people with smelly feet are 
more likely to attract mosquitoes at night, especially when it is hot. 
   "Heat is a physical attraction for the mosqitoes, especially when the 
human body attains 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The 
mosquitoes particularly like the feet," Vincent said. 
   The mosquito trap has an entrance but no exit. So when the malaria-
carrying insect enters, it can't leave. 
   Scientists hope to eradicate vast areas of mosquitoes, as was the

Nigeria 
More Illegal Health Centres Closed

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - The Nigerian government has closed some 15 more 
illegal private health centres in an effort to rid the country of 
quacks. 
   Last October 40 such clinics were shut in Lagos, Nigeria's business 
capital. 
   The latest closures announced Tuesday were in the midwestern state of 
Edo where, as in Lagos state, a taskforce has been set up to regularize 
private medical practice. 
   Taskforce officials say some of the affected health centres were 
unregistered, while others lacked relevant personnel and equipment. 
   The taskforce in Edo said some of the closed clinics were being run 
by medical personnel in government employment, which is illegal.

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Gold production in Zimbabwe in 1995 exceeded 24 
tons for the first time in more than five decades, the Chamber of Mines 
of Zimbabwe said on Wednesday. 
   An official said figures just released showed output was 53,556 
pounds worth more than 288 million U.S. dollars. 288 million. 
   Gold is Zimbabwe's foreign currency earner after tobacco. 
   The official said production had increased on a monthly basis during 
1995, with notable producers such as Cluff Resources Zimbabwe Ltd and 
Falgold leading the way. 
   Cluff, whose UK-based parent recently agreed to a takeover bid by 
Ghana's Ashanti Goldfields, owns Zimbabwe's largest underground gold 
mine at Bindura, some 50 miles north of Harare, the capital.

South Africa 
New Kwazulu-Natal Peace Initiative Underway 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Lionel Williams, PANA Correspondent
   
   PRETORIA, South Africa - A new large-scale initiative is underway to 
bring peace to South Africa's strife-torn Kwazulu-Natal province. 
   Hopes are running high here that Monday's meeting between President 
Nelson Mandela, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
and African National Congress (ANA) Chairman in Kwazulu-Natal Jacob Zuma 
has set the ball rolling for a new and meaningful initiative. 
   The three leaders agreed to push for an imbizo, a traditional-style 
gathering of the Zulu nation, as the first step in the new peace drive. 
   Mandela announced after the meeting that he would be making immediate 
contact with Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini to ask him to hold a meeting 
of Zulu traditional leaders as soon as possible to arrange for the 
holding of the imbizo. 
   Mandela and Chief Buthelezi would also atttend the meeting. 
   The South African president described the meeting of the Zulu nation 
as "a matter of urgency." He said neither the ANC nor the IFP could 
settle the matter through armed warfare. 
   "Only negotiations between the respective peoples can bring about a 
solution," Mandela added. 
   The imbizo is expected to be the largest meeting ever held as part of 
the peace process in Kwazulu-Natal. 
   Monday's meeting followed another bloody weekend in which at least 40 
people were killed in Kwazulu-Natal.

Zambia 
Donors Tie Aid to Good Governance 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent 
   
   LUSAKA, Zambia - Swedish ambassador to Zambia Anders Johnson Tuesday 
in Lusaka reiterated Western donor demands that the Movement for 
Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government of President Frederick Chiluba 
maintain "good governance" as a condition for development aid. 
   Johnson said that Sweden considered that a succesful implementation 
of Zambia's economic and democratic reforms required "decisive, bold and 
skilful political management" and wide support of the people. 
   "To muster and maintain such support, burdens as well as benefits 
have to be shared among population groups in a reasonably balanced 
manner..." said Johnson when he signed for his country's 27 million 
dollars aid package to help Zambia's socio-economic and democratic 
reform process. 
   In a specific reference to the current wrangle between Chiluba's 
government on the one hand and the opposition and other pressure groups 
on the other on the best mode of adopting the country's draft 
constitution, Johnson said that Zambia deserved a constitution that 
could stand the test of time. 
   He also said Sweden expected the government would undertake orderly 
preparations for and implementation of the scheduled local government 
and general elections this year. 
   Johnson said that there was need to allow a "vibrant" civil society 
and a free press which he said were all vital to ensuring enhancement of 
democratic values. 
   Political analysts understood Johnson's remarks as an indirect and 
polite rebuff to Chiluba's government which has insisted on passing the 
draft constitution by a parliament it dominates. This is contrary to 
popular demands that it be submitted to a national constituent assembly. 
   The government has opposed a proposed march in the capital by civil 
society groups Friday to press for demands that the draft constitution 
be  passed by a constituent assembly. 
   Chiluba said last Friday while opening the 1996 session of his MMD-
dominated parliament that those agitating for a constituent assembly had 
"an axe to grind" with the government and that acceding to their demands 
would be tantamount to resorting to "jungle law" in the managment of 
national affairs. 
   Critics of Chiluba's stand on the adoption of the constitution have 
charged that the president intends to "hijack" the constitution by 
getting MMD members of parliament to pass controversial clauses in his 
favor. 
   The MMD has recommended in the constitution that only second-
generation Zambians should contest the republican presidency. 
   This has been widely condemned as an attempt to bar former president 
Kenneth Kaunda, who had Malawian parents, from the polls. Kaunda plans 
to challenge Chiluba for the presidency. 
   Some sources supporting the government recently accused Kaunda of 
prevailing on the donor community to deny Chiluba aid if he insisted on 
maligning political opponents. 
   The Paris Club donor community which last December granted Zambia 
some 800 million dollars in aid said the funds would be disbursed only 
if the community were satisfied there was a commitment to "good 
governance" on the part of Chiluba's government, among other conditions.

United Nations and Somalia 
Boutros-Ghali Decries Political Stalemate

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent  
   
   UNITED NATIONS - An all-out civil war, which many feared would follow 
the withdrawal of the United Nations forces from Somalia, has so far 
been averted but the country remains volatile, UN secretary-general 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said. 
   He said the situation in the country has been characterized by 
"political instability, inter-clan conflict, banditry and general 
lawlessness." 
   "The political situation in Somalia has been dominated by a 
debilitating stalemate for almost two years since the Somali faction 
leaders failed to honour their commitments in the Nairobi declaration of 
24 March 1994," Boutros-Ghali said in his latest report on the country. 
   He said the stalemate had caused political leaders to focus on the 
development of regional administrative structures and a peaceful climate 
in their regions. 
   "It is unclear at this point whether such regional authorities will 
be formed in most of the regions in Somalia," he said, adding that a 
central governing authority was urgently needed to take charge of the 
country. 
   Boutros-Ghali said some Somali leaders believe serious progress 
toward national reconciliation would only be possible if Gen. Mohammed 
Farah Aidid of the Somali National Alliance withdraws from Baidoa, which 
he captured Sept. 17. 
   The warlord should also to rescind his "unilateral proclamation of 
himself as 'president' of Somalia." 
   "Durable peace cannot be achieved in Somalia without a process of 
sufficiently broad-based consultations among the Somalis themselves," 
Boutros-Ghali said. 
   He said the U.N. security council might wish to reiterate its call 
for Somali parties to adopt this approach. 
   The secretary-general promised he would continue to maintain the 
Nairobi-based U.N. political office for Somalia so that it could 
continue its efforts to maintain and expand contacts with all Somali 
parties. 
   On the humanitarian front, he said the most urgent needs were food 
and essential health systems support, particularly immunization and 
measures to control the spread of epidemic diseases such as cholera. 
   "The low level of food production, continued political instability 
and other factors combine to make international assistance to somalia 
essential," he said. 
   He said U.N. agencies would continue their current programs in the 
country. 
   The U.N. Security Council, citing lack of progress in the Somali 
peace process, pulled its multi-national forces out of the country on 
March 31, 1994.

South Africa
Future Of Government of National Unity Uncertain

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Lionel Williams, PANA Correspondent
   
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa - South African President Nelson Mandela's 
African National Congress (ANC) has said it is opposed to the 
continuation of a government of national unity after 1999. 
   The ANC said Tuesdays such a government would become an obstacle to 
multi-party democracy if it became a permanent feature. 
   The ANC was reacting to the weekend call by National Party leader and 
Deputy President F.W. de Klerk for the continuation of governement of 
national unity after the 1999 general election. 
   The ANC statement said the government of national unity had been 
conceived as a necessary element in  South Africa's transition from 
apartheid to democracy. It had served the country well, paving the way 
for smooth political transition and laying the foundation for 
reconciliation. 
   But, said the ANC, multi-party democracy needed various political 
parties representing different political persuasions. While inter-party 
cooperation was a positive element, a forced coalition denied the 
majority political party the right to decide freely on how to pursue the 
best interests of the majority of the people.

   DAKAR, Senegal - The city of Phoenix, Arizona, in the Southern United 
States will host a major conference on business, trade, investment and 
exposition on Africa in April, organisers said Tuesday. 
   According to a statement released to PANA the event, billed to 
attract prominent Africans and African-Americans, will be held at the 
Phoenix Civic Plazza April 10-13. 
   "This conference will bring together the key private sector players 
that are promoting African development," said Robert Sherman, whose

   "Participants will have the rare opportunity to interact with them on 
a one-on-one basis, share ideas and experiences, explore business 
opportunities and, above all, build alliances. 
   "They will also use the opportunity to exhibit and showcase their 
products, services and technologies to vendors from Africa," he said. 
   There will be workshops on topics such as agriculture and agro-
business, capital markets and banking, education and training, energy 
development, information technology and multimedia, health care, housing 
and construction, mineral exploration and tourism, among others. 
   Panels and roundtable discussions will include Africa's investment 
and business climate, South Africa's role in fostering African 
development, strategies for sustainable development in Africa, trade and 
investment incentives for U.S.-Africa commerce, Western media and 
Africa's business image, and women in African development.

Zimbabwe 
Tall Tales of A Failed Joint Venture 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Tawona Tavengwa. PANA Correspondent
   
   KADOMA, Zimbabwe - A casual visitor to the giant National Glass 
Company plant in the Central Zimbabwean town of Kadoma would think that 
the noise coming from within is that of production machines in full 
swing. 
   That certainly is not the case. The noise is only that of local 
maintenance workers servicing the plant and oiling the wheels while 
awaiting the international chamber of commerce (ICC) in Paris, France, 
to decide the fate of the 70-million-Zimdollar (7.8 million-U.S.dollar) 
plant. 
   The factory is at the centre of a legal wrangle between the 
government of Zimbabwe through its investment arm, the Industrial 
Development Corporation (IDC), and its partner in the failed glass 
production joint venture, Romania's ROMSIT. 
   The company, hailed as the first undertaking of its kind in the 12-
nation Southern African Development Community (SADC), was commissioned 
in 1990 by President Robert Mugabe amid much publicity. 
   Soon after that, it began facing serious financial and operational 
problems which led to its closure in 1993. 
   Most of these handicaps were centred around the production of 
unusable sheet glass which occurred for several months in succession. 
   When the local construction industry rejected the glass, the company 
stopped production and switched over to marketing imported Chinese 
glass. 
   This was meant to be a temporary move aimed at meeting the basic 
overheads while solutions to its problems were being sought. But it was 
a short-lived effort. 
   During the 1992/93 financial year National Glass incurred a loss of 
41.4 million Zimdollars (4.6 million U.S. dollars) up from 19.4 million 
Zimdollars (2.2 million U.S. dollars) the previous year. 
   When the Zimbabwe government asked the Romanians to finance repair 
costs of the plant and to write off some loans, they refused. 
   This refusal sparked a wrangle which was taken to the Paris-based ICC 
in 1994 for arbitration. 
   The manner in which the IDC and ROMSIT now regard each other is a 
direct contrast to the warm and open relationship which characterized 
the early days of the venture. 
   During the early stages, 30 Zimbabweans were sent to Romania for 
specialized training in glass making. 
   Romanian consultants also came to the country in large numbers in an 
effort to transfer their expertise in glass making to locals. 
   All in all, the company employed about 180 locals and it was expected 
to produce 13,000 tons of glass sheet every year when local demand for 
such glass at the time was just between 8,000 and 9,000 tons. 
   This left a reasonable amount for export to SADC states, most of 
which were, like Zimbabwe, very excited about the venture. 
   "This represents typical technology transfer from Romania to 
Zimbabwe. We have many friends around the world who give us fish, but 
they do not want to teach us how to catch the fish. You have taught us 
how to catch the fish. We are very grateful," said Kumbirai Kangai, then 
minister of industry and commerce. 
   Today, government and IDC officials do not want to say much about the 
plant or the impending case for fear that any ill-advised statements may 
get to the ears of the Romanians, who will then use them in court when 
the Paris hearings finally commence. 
   In the meantime, a small staff of six remains at the plant, working 
as facilitators to the IDC's legal team in Paris. 
   Guards at the place confirmed that at one point just after the 
plant's closure, their services were terminated, leaving the place 
vulnerable to thieves. 
   Vital machine components were stolen during this period, prompting 
IDC management to order the re-engangement of the guards. 
   The joint venture's other major investments included a housing estate 
in Kadoma which consisted mainly of garden flats which were meant for 
its workers. 
   The sprawling estate, although now leased to a real estate agent, is 
also rotting like the glass plant, with signs of neglect all over. 
   Until the case is resolved, the houses will likely remain as they 
are, uncared for. 
   Meanwhile, the company, though long closed with very little prospects 
of ever being re-opened, still owes several companies, including the 
local authority about 1.3 million Zimdollars (144,440 U.S.dollars). 
   The authority recently took the matter to its lawyers and another 
legal wrangle might soon be in the local courts, an action that may 
jeopardize efforts to settle the original case in Paris.

Kenya Dominates East African Tea Market 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
   
   NAIROBI, Kenya - The amount of tea offered at the Mombasa auction 
registered a 17-percent increase in 1995 to reach 173.7 million 
kilograms (382.14 million pounds). 
   According to the annual tea purchases report issued by the Africa Tea 
Brokers Limited, the amount was 25.7 million kilograms (56.54 million 
pounds) higher than the 148 million kilograms (325.6 million pounds) 
kilograms sold by the action in 1994. 
   The report shows that Lipton Limited topped the list of buyers with 
purchases of 27.8 million kilograms (61.16 million pounds) followed 
closely by Vanrees limited with 20.9 million kilograms (45.98 million 
pounds). 
   Kenya continued to dominate the Mombasa auction with 155.3 million 
kilograms (341.66 million pounds) of tea sold last year. Uganda folowed 
with 8.6 million kilograms (18.92 million pounds) and Tanzania with 6.52 
million kilograms (143.44 million pounds). 
   For Uganda, this represented a two-percent drop from the 1994 figures 
and seven percent for Tanzania. Brokers were not able to establish 
reasons for the drop for both countries. 
   War-torn Rwanda which performed poorly in the 1994 season 
surprisingly recorded a 566-per-cent increase with 733,084 kilograms 
(1612.88 pounds) offered, an indication that farmers in the country were 
back to work after the bloody ethnic violence rocked the country in 1993 
and 1994. 
   Neighboring Burundi also afflicted with ethnic violence, recorded a 
37-per-cent increase with 1.7 million kilograms (3.74 million pounds) up 
from 624,000 kilograms (1,372,800 pounds) in 1994. 
   The sharpest drop of 94 percent was recorded by Malawi. 
   During last week's tea auction in Mombasa, Egypt and Pakistan 
registered strong interest in Kenyan tea joining traditional buyers such 
as United Kingdom. Sudan, Yemen and the Middle East nations are also 
showing interest in the auction. 
   But the prices of tea in the international market have been low due 
to a glut. 
   Tea is also facing stiff competition from soft drinks and other 
beverages forcing products to seek new strategies for promoting tea 
drinking.

Nigeria 
Highway Toll Commercialized

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Paul Ejime PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's military government has raised fees 
payable by motorists using federal highways and contracted 25 companies 
to handle the toll collection as part of privatization of inefficient 
government agencies. 
   Works and housing minister Brig.Gen. Abdulkarim Adisa said in Lagos 
Monday the 100 percent increase covering the nation's 28 toll plazas 
comes into effect Feb. 1. 
   Trucks and luxury buses pay 50 naira as against 25 naira previously, 
while smaller vehicles have had their fee reduced from 10 to five naira 
(85 naira = 1 U.S. dollar). 
   The minister said the privatization was aimed at stemming "the high 
level" fraud that had characterized toll collection since 1978. 
   The ministry also hopes to draw on the efficiency of the private 
sector in toll collection, he added. 
   Only vehicles belonging to the armed forces, the police, road safety 
corps and other force services are exempt from paying toll. 
   However, Adisa stressed "it must be borne in mind that govenment 
remains the owner of all toll plazas and will continue to regulate and 
control their operation in order to maintain a healthy balance between 
the interest of the contractor operators and the public. 
   Until now, some govenrment workers regarded deployment to tollgates 
as a source of self-enrichment.

Soccer: Tunisian Barred For Vulgar Language 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Randy Zormelo, PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa - Tunisian Football Association Chairman 
Nasser Benhassine was barred Monday from the touchline and changing 
rooms for using foul language as a referee at the African Cup of Nations 
games taking place in South Africa. 
   Benhassine will therefore match the final Groupe D match between 
Tunisia and Ivory Coast Thursday from the enclosed private suite of the 
Boet Erasmus Stadium in Port Elizabeth. 
   He is accusecd of directing "vulgar and offensive" remarks at both 
the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and South African referee 
Petros Mathabela. 
   The incident occurred during the Ghana-Tunisia clash last Thursday 
when Benhassine lost his temper because of some decision taken by 
Mathabela in the match won 2-1 by Ghana. 
   Benhassine, who heads the Tunisian delegation to the tournament, 
later apologized for his outburt but insisted he was right in objecting. 
   "I am sure the referee's mistakes were unintentional and I am sorry 
about the comments. But at least on two occasions, he should have given 
us a penalty for foul play and he didn't", Benhassine told journalists. 
   He denied having sworn at Mathaebla or CAF officials. 
   "I did not swear at any stage. I told the referee that it was a shame 
he had officiated the game so badly," Benhassine said. 
   "And I told CAF officials that I thought they had a duty to respect 
nations and appoint referees who are capable of handling important 
matches such as these. I still can't understand why they appointed him," 
he said. 
   Journalists covering the matches in Port Elizabeth have criticized 
the poor officiating by referees. 
   Benhassine is the first official to be barred from the touchline 
since the tournament kicked of Jan. 13.

Soccer: Burkina Faso Fires Coach 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Victor Tsuai, PANA Correspondent
   
   JOHANNESBURG - Burkina Faso has fired its coach for being 
outmaneuvered at the current African Cup of Nations soccer finals being 
played in South Africa. 
   Idrissa Traore's sacking came shortly before Burkina Faso's all-
important game against Algeria Wednesday. 
   Traore, axed for what the Burkinabe administration termed "poor 
results the team has achieved and bad placement of the players", was 
immediately replaced by his assistant, Calixte Zagre. 
   Burkina Faso made the announcement shortly before their departure 
from Bloemfontein for Port Elizabeth where they take on Algeria in a do 
or die battle at the Boet Erasumus Stadium on Wednesday. 
   The suspension was announced by Burkina Faso's Football Association 
General-Secretary Ferdinand Nikiema. 
   Sources within the Burkinabe team disclosed Traore and Kikiema had 
not seen eye to eye since their team arrived in South Africa on Jan. 9. 
   The relationship between the two soured more when Burkina Faso lost 
their opening game 2-1 against Sierra Leone and went on to receive a 
deflating 5-1 drubbing at the hands of Zambia. 
   Burkina Faso, however, are expected to pack their bags and leave the 
country after their game against Algeria, whether they win or lose.

Delay In Releasing Nigerian Budget Weighs Down Stock Exchange

Panafrican News Agency
January 16, 1996 (19960116)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - The delay in releasing the 1996 budget and the 
attendant suspense is affecting activities on the Nigerian Stock 
Exchange(NSE), officials said Tuesday.
   In two weeks of trading in the new year, a total of four million 
sharesworth 15.6 million Naira were traded in 509 deals in Lagos, Ibadan 
and Kano floors of the Exchange. This marginally raised the all-shares 
index by 7.94 points to close at 5103.33 by last weekend. (85 naira = 1 
USD and 100 kobo = one naira).
   A breakdown showed that 413 deals were traded in Lagos for 3.2 
million shares valued at 14.2 million Naira compared with 299 deals for 
1.2 million shares worth 10.7 million Naira recorded on the floor the 
previous week.
   Turnover in Ibadan stood at 400,000 shares valued at 7.8 million 
Naira in 76 deals, as against 23 deals for 21,511 shares worth 300,000 
Naira recorded in the previous week.
   The Kano floor traded 400,000 shares worth 6.4 million Naira in 20 
deals compared with a previous 96,094 shares worth 1.2 million Naira in 
22 deals.
   On the Lagos floor, the second-tier securities market with a market 
capitalisation of 900,000 Naira from 1.2 million shares in 3 deals 
recorded the highest trading in volume terms.
   The banking sub-sector followed with a turnover of 800,000 shares 
worth 2.4 million Naira in 48 deals.
   In the over-all equity price movement, the bullish trading in the 
petroleum products marketing sector culminated in a "landmark price" 
recorded byFrench oil conglomerate, TOTAL. Its unit share, which opened 
at 29.78 Naira closed at 30 Naira, a historic high in the 33 years of 
the Nigerian Stock Exchange.
   Brokers hailed the development as a measure of confidence in the 
official deregulation policy.
   Some 34 other securities in the equities sector also recorded gains 
at th estock market ranging between 1 kobo and 23 kobo, while John Holt 
lost 30 kobo due to price adjustment for dividend payment.
   In Nigeria, the government usually announced the national budget on 
January 1. This was delayed in 1995 and officials say the 1996 estimates 
are not ready.
   Industrialists are not happy with the delay saying it slows down 
economic activity

Zimbabwe Expects Boom In Tobacco Prices

Panafrican News Agency
January 16, 1996 (19960116)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Tobacco prices at this year's auctions are 
expected to be higher compared to those paid in 1995 amid indications 
the Zimbabwean crop is in demand from both local and overseas buyers, 
growers said.
   In an interview last week, Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) Vice-
President Rob Webb said prices had been on the upward trend since 
1992/93, when theyfell drastically due to over-production in the major 
growing countries.
   "The ZTA's position is that we should see an increase in prices 
compared with those achieved in the 1994/95 season considering that 
world stocks hav ebalanced and demand for our crop is high," Webb said.
   Tobacco auctions are expected to open in April and run for over 20 
weeks.
   Last year, an average price of 13.80 Zimdollars per kg (then 1.73 
USD) was paid, realising 2.336 billion ZD (then 292 million USD).
   Webb said market intelligence showed demand would come from China, a 
huge producer and buyer of tobacco, where 1.7 billion kg had just been 
produced, down from the original forecast of 2.3 billion kg.
   "So there is a shortage and we can confirm that the Chinese have come 
here in the last two months and placed firm orders with all the 
merchants," hesaid.
   This year, Zimbabwe was expected to produce about 210 million kg of 
flue-cured tobacco, slightly up from the 198 million kg sold last 
season.
   Webb said the tobacco crop was looking good and growers were headed 
for a bumper season provided the current wet weather persists for 
another eight weeks.
   Meanwhile, Webb said Brazil and Zimbabwe - the world's leading 
producers of flue-cured tobacco - were calling for a fair price for 
their crop,particularly from leading manufacturers.
   He said although the two countries were the two most expensive 
producers, they nevertheless grew a quality crop without subsidies, 
unlike farmers in the United States and Europe.
   "We are trying to talk to each other about the price we should be 
receiving from manufacturers and merchants. Our basic message to 
Brazilian growers is that we should not expect to be paid third world 
prices," Webb, who recentlY returned from a marketing trip to Brazil, 
said.

Germany Agrees To Destroy Zambia's Toxic Waste

Panafrican News Agency
January 15, 1996 (19960115)
by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia and Germany have signed a one-million-U.S.-
dollar contract for Germany to destroy 300 tonnes of expired pesticides 
that have been accumulating in an agricultural depot inthe Zambian 
capital, Lusaka, since 1984.
   Environmental Council of Zambia Director James Phiri said Sunday that 
the agreement had also been sponsored by the local office of the United 
Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, the FAO.
   Zambia lacks the technology to clean up the mess and has sought 
Germany's help.
   Phiri said that the consignment would be shipped through Tanzania. 
Zambia has already sought Tanzanian permission for the transportation of 
thechemicals.
   The United Nations based Convention on Toxic Materials all but bans 
its transportation across borders. However, it allows countries without 
the appropriate technology to contract others to destroy the toxins.
   Special conditions are needed for transport. These include tight 
packaging to avoid leakage. However, completely banded is the dumping of 
the waste by developed countries in undeveloped states.
   Zambia is reported to have substantial amounts of dangerous 
agricultural waste pesticides, particularly in the countryside. The 
government said earlyi n 1996 that it would take an inventory of the 
materials and collect it for destruction outside the country.
   Zambia's deputy agriculture minister, Gibson Nkausu, had estimated 
that thejob could cost some four miliion dollars.
   Nkausu warned then that government would, in future, surcharge 
agricultura lchemical dealers and users, apart from imposing statutory 
fines for flouting environment laws in handling their merchandise.
   The latest "state of the environment report" released last week by 
the Environment Council of Zambia said that commercial farmers in the 
country used more fertilisers, on average, than those in other sub-
Sahara African countries.
   According to the report, Zambian farmers used some 450,000 metric 
tonnes of agricultural chemicals during the 1992/93 farming season 
compared to 150,000 tonnes consumed two decades ago.
   Environment officials attributed the increased consumption rate to 
government's own promotion campaign of the agricultural industry since 
the 1970s to help attain national food self-sufficiency.
   The report noted that the use of chemicals had also contributed to 
soil acidity in areas and poisoning of some water catchments.
   Zambia imports almost 90 percent of the country's chemical 
requirements for agricultural and health purposes and it is estimated 
that 200 different pesticide trade names are currently in use.
   Zambia's environment council has said that lack of legislation on the 
importation of the chemicals had sometimes led banned pesticides coming 
into the country, thereby endangering environment, man and animal.

Donors to Fund Africa's Anti-Onchocercosis Project

Panafrican News Agency
January 17, 1996 (19960117)
by Mbakou, PANA Correspondent

   BRAZZAVILLE, Congo - The Africa Regional Director of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), Dr. Ebrahim Samba says he has convinced donors to 
continue financing the continent's anti-onchocercosis programme until 
theyear 2007.
   Speaking at a news conference at the WHO regional office in 
Brazzaville,Congo, Samba cited the World Bank, the United Nations 
Development Programme and the Food and Agriculture of Organization among 
donors which have shown interest in funding the programme.
   The UN health agency will be the executing body, added Samba, who was 
coordinator of a highly successful river-blindness eradication project 
in 11West African countries before he became WHO regional Director in 
1994.
   He said the new project estimated to cost of 120 million U.S dollars, 
will cover 16 African countries.
   Samba spoke to newsmen after a long tour of Europe, the United States 
and several African countries. He said the donors had also pledged to 
provide drugs, particularly ivermectine, to all the countries involved.
   He commended the emerging new partnership with U.N agencies, 
particularly the Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, the 
Fund fo rPopulation Activities (UNFPA), the International Labour 
Organization and other bilateral cooperation agencies in combating the 
incapcitating disease.
   According to figures released here, river blindness afflicts 18.5 
million people in 27 African countries.
   The debilitating disease, which affects rural dwellers, is spread by 
a small but aggressive black fly which breed on the banks of fast-
flowing rivers.
   The female fly lays its eggs in the eyes of human beings, infecting 
and sometimes disfiguring the skin around the eyes.

Nigerian Authorities Link Bread To Cancer

Panafrican News Agency
Janaury 16, 1996 (19960116)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Bread was never in short supply on the breakfast 
table of many Nigerians until economic recesssion set in several years 
ago.
   But as austerity began to bite harder, loaves have gone thinner, 
although they cost thrice the normal price, and beyond the reach of the 
average Nigerian.
   But there is new twist to the availability of this erswhile staple, 
once regarded as the common man's food.
   Health and Food Administration officials have issued a warning that 
Nigerians risk contracting cancer through eating bread.
   At the centre of the controversy is a chemical known as "potassium 
bromate,"which bakers use in the treatment of flour.
   Nigeria's Food and Drug Administration agency was the first to raise 
an alarm on the chemical. The health warning is now echoed by the 
standard organisation of nigeria.
   Negotiations between the organisation and the Flour Millers 
Association is said to have broken down, with the warning from the 
organisation it might be forced to close down flour mills that fail to 
stop the use of the dangerous chemical.
   The millers are asking for a grace period of between six months and 
one year to phase out the use of the chemical.
   But the Director-General of the association Joseph Abalaka says this 
is too long and unacceptable, adding that an alternative, ascorbic acid, 
is available.
   He says "we cannot afford to risk the lives of Nigerians by allowing 
another six months of grace for the injection of cancer-causing agent."
   PANA has learnt that another round of negotiation has been called to 
end the deadlock.
   Despite being more expensive, some Nigerians say they cannot do 
withoutb read. The mills closure would unleash scarcity and make the 
commodity even more expensive.

Gabon Secures 77 million Dollars Loan from ADB

Panafrican News Agency
January 16, 1996 (19960116)

   DAKAR, Senegal - The Board of Directors of the African Development 
Bank (ADB), has approved a loan amounting to 53 million UA (about 77 
million dollars) for the funding of a major road project in the central 
African state of Gabon.
   The amount, mobilised from the resources of the bank's soft loan 
affiliate, the African Development Fund (ADF), carries a variable 
interest rate and is repayable within 15 years after a 5-year grace 
period, the ADB said in a statement.
   It involves rehabilitation of the Franceville-Laleyou road and the 
upgrading and surfacing of another stretch between Laleyou and 
Lastoursville in the south-eastern part of the country.
   The project forms part of the bank's development strategy in Gabon 
which aims at diversification of the economic sector through promotion 
of agriculture, industry, commerce and tourism.
   The ADB has so far undertaken 25 operations in Gabon at a total cost 
of 528.9 million UA (about 808 million dollars), in 21 projects, two 
structural adjustment schemes and studies.
   Initiated in 1963, the resources of the Abidjan-based bank is 
currently estimated at some 33 million dollars.
   The bank group is owned by 52 African governments and 25 non-African 
countries.

Traditional Medicine Becoming Popular in Zimbabwe

Panafrican News Agency
January 17, 1996 (19960117)


   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - High medical fees and the rising cost of 
drugsare forcing many Zimbabweans to resort to traditional medicine, 
which in the past was regarded as primitive.
   A combined traditional and conventional medical clinic, which started 
as a nexperiment soon after independence in 1980, reported an upsurge in 
the number of people seeking treatment in 1995.
   In an interview here, founder member and co-ordinator of the clinic, 
Barbar aSibanda, said 1995 was a busy year as patients, whose ailments 
modern medicine would have failed to cure, took to the clinic whose 
charges were lower than other health institutions.
   "Though I cannot give figures, the workload was more than what we 
expected.A lot more people are now aware of our services which have 
produced goodr esults," said Sibanda.
   The clinic, which pioneered the use of traditional herbs and modern 
medicine under one roof, has since opened a 20-bed maternity wing and a 
rural clinic in Chief Sigola's area in Matebeleland, South Western 
Zimbabwe.
   Patients have the choice of being treated by a medical doctor or 
traditional healers.
   Sibanda said the experiment had over the years proved that the two 
systems could be integrated to treat difficult diseases like mental 
illness, cancer, infertility and reversal of symptoms of the deadly 
AIDS.
   "Since we opened, we have never recorded any deaths of patients 
during the course of treatment. Our success rate rate is almost 100 
percent," she said.
   Dumezweni Sidambe, who heads the traditional section, which includes 
mid-wives, said infertility was a growing problem among young couples.
   He attributed it to over use of contraceptives at an early age, 
saying by the time they decided to have children, damage would have set 
in.
   "We have assisted hundreds of couples whose marriages were on the 
verge of breakdown to have children. Although we cannot claim to cure 
aids, we can safely reverse the symptoms," said sidambe.
   Sibanda said the clinic also ran a spiritual/faith healing section to 
cater for Christian believers and a free health advisory service.
   "We also have plans to open a herbal pharmacy and add a theatre to 
our maternity wing," said Sibanda.

Weekly Press Review

Panafrican News Agency
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Olu Sarr, PANA Staff Correspondent


   DAKAR, Senegal - Nigeria's withdrawal from Africa Cup and Yemen's 
"war" with Eritrea were among the most important editorials in the 
African press since the New Year started.
   The privately-owned Lagos newspaper, The Guardian, gave several 
reasons for Nigeria's demands for security guarantees for its players 
but also pointed to the path Abuja should take with regards to Nigeria's 
participation in the tournament. 
   "No responsible government would expose its citizens to clear and 
present dangers over which it has been forewarned,"itsaid.
   For example, it said, since the Munich massacre of its athletes in 
1972, Israel "has constantly"asked for such guarantee. 
   No government, it said, could legislate against snippers and going to 
South Africa would amount to taking risks. 
   "But what is wrong with that against the pledge by South Africa? We 
ought to take South Africa for her words for such guarantee would oblige 
her government to bend over backwards to guarantee the safety of 
Nigerians,"it said. 
   By withdrawing from South Africa '96, the government has also shown 
that "it no longer feels safe"in the world.  
   "That this is even happening to us in Africa makes itall the more 
shameful and worrisome. This is why South Africa '96 ought to provide an 
opportunity for some soul-searching,"itsaid.
   It wondered why Nigeria had become so unwanted. Why this nation, 
which used to be touted as "The Giant of Africa,"now felt so unsafe even 
within the continent ?. 
   "The solution to all this is for the government to urgently take 
steps that will bring it back to the internationa lcommunity, it said. 
   "The government should consider rescinding the withdrawal because our 
participation offers opportunities for Nigeria and South Africa to move 
closer to understanding and rapprochement on the diplomatic front. The 
implications of ourwithdrawal are not in our interest."
   This view was shared by another privately-owned Lagos daily, the 
Vanguard. 
   "If the point government wants to make is about the safety of our 
players, we believe it has been made and the South African authorities, 
CAF and FIFA have taken notices of it. 
   "The logical thing now is for us to be in South Africa,so that the 
Super Eagles can fly the nation's banner as the continent's defending 
champions,"it said. 
   In Addis Ababa The Monitor commented on the insecurity in the Horn of 
Africa, the most recent example being the two-day battle between 
Eritrean and Yemeni forces on the Hanish Islands. 
   "Unless urgently settled the recent Asmara-Sanaa controversy has the 
potential to degenerate into a large-scale crisis involving other intra 
as well as extra regional actors,"it said. "And this must not be allowed 
to happen under any circumstance."
   It warned: "Once a minor conflict goes out of control,the price that 
would be paid to restore the equilibrium would be extremely painful. 
Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia should serve as living reminders that there 
is no dividend to be reaped from aconflict."
   Dakar's Sud Quotidien focused its attention on the change of prime 
minister made by Mauritania President Maouya Ould Taya. He got rid of 
the youthful Sidi Mohammed Ould Boubacar for Cheikh Alavia Ould Mohamed 
Khouna. 
   Why? 
   "To prepare better for the next elections,"it said. 
   Another reason, it said, was because of the recent poor relations 
between Libya and Mauritania: Ould Boubacar is considered a Libyan 
sympathiser and an adherent of Kadaffi's Green Book. 
   Ould Boubacar's departure became imminent, it said, when his 
potential rival and former Interior Minister Lemrabott Ould Sidi 
Mahmoud, returned to government. 
   Behind all this, it said, was Taya's wish to balance the power among 
the regions of the country. The appointment of a native of the Eastern 
Region as prime minister replacing one from the Central Region, it said, 
was "a clear demonstration of this."
   The Eastern Regions, the most populated parts of thecountry, voted 
largely for Taya during the 1992 presidential elections. But it noted 
that the electorate here, in part, joine dthe opposition during the 
municipal elections of 1995. This shift and the gains by the opposition 
in the strategic region, it said, explained Taya's choice. 
    Notwithstanding the effort to appease voters in the east, it said 
"few changes are expected in the current cabinet so as not to 
frustrate"other communities. Three months after being unbanned by 
Nigerian military rulers, the National Concord newspaper of detained 
millionaire-politician, Moshood Abiola, returned to the newsstands 
Tuesday. 
   In a front page editorial entitled "A New Start, A New Resolve,"the 
Concord said it was returning to the newsstands as a "beneficiary of an 
official reprieve of sorts." The daily said that it had been banned for 
18 months along with other titles of the Concord Press "without reason 
and without recourse to the due process of law."
   Saying it was glad to rejoin the "front ranks of the Nigerian 
press,"the Concord, however, said it did not "regard the unbanning as a 
special favour to be reciprocated with a show of remorse and 
contriction, but as belated undoing of what should not have been done in 
the first place."
   In its 15 years of existence, the paper said, it had"consistently 
championed the ideals of a free and responsible press". 
   Nigeria, it said, needed to make rapid progress toward democracy. 
   "The fundamental truth,"it said "is that without democracy, there can 
be no self-actualisation of the citizens, no public accountability, no 
good government and, ultimately no meaningful development."

Institute Prepares Code for Zimbabwean Companies

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - To improve corporate governance of Zimbabwean 
companies, the country's Institute of Directors (IOD) plans to introduce 
and enforce an acceptable code of conduct.  
   The IOD is a non-profit, voluntary body established to promote 
excellence, enterprise and integrity in directors of companies.   IOD's 
Executive Director, John Dittrich said Tuesday his group would work with 
such organisations as the Zimbabwe stock exchange to promote good 
business ethics in line with international trends.   "We want to promote 
the establishment of audit committees to ensure that management is 
cultivating good ethics," Dittrich told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News 
Agency.  
   He said the IOD would study far-reaching recommendations made in the 
United Kingdom by the Cadbury report, which called for more transparency 
in the running of publicly quoted companies.  
   "As we progress, there is going to be greater awareness of the real 
responsibilities of a director: to make them understand that it's not 
just a question of sitting on a board of a company," Dittrich said.  
   Executive or non-executive directors, he said, had to appreciate the 
problems and future plans of the companies on whose boards they sat, and 
be seen to be making meaningful contributions.  
   Dittrich said among other strategies to improve corporate governance, 
the iod would hold a series of seminars and conferences where a wide 
range of issues about running a company would be discussed.  
   "We are not an examining body, but one of the features of our 
activities during 1996 will be in the area of training and seminars to 
inform people in business about their responsibilities." 
   He said the IOD would also during the year broaden its membership 
base so as to achieve a large and diversified membership of the 
institute and try to achieve effective representation of directors' 
views to government and other regulatory bodies as well as the business 
community.  
   "We want to demonstrate that we are providing members with the 
services that they need and, in that regard, developing our relationship 
with government ministries will encourage people to join the iod because 
they can derive some benefit from such membership,"Dittrich said.  
   The institute would also consult and make representations to 
government on matters affecting the Zimbabwean business companies 
particularly during annual pre-budget meetings with the Ministry of 
Finance.

Biya Expresses Hope

Panafrican News Agency

   YAOUNDE, Cameroon - The Cameroonian President Paul Biya has expressed 
satisfaction over economic progress made by his country during the year 
1995.  
   "After several years of recession, Cameroon is back on the road to 
growth"with a 3.3 per cent rate, Biya said in an address to the 
Cameroonian nation on national radio and television.  
   Cameroon, like the other countries in Africa's Franc Zone, had a 50 
per cent devaluation of its currency in Januray 1994.  
   Biya said the devaluation had led to some recovery and state revenues 
had risen to 45 billion f cfa in 1995 as against 17 billion cfa the 
previous year (1$ US =480 cfa).  
   The liberalisation of the economy, he said, had made it possible for 
a positive trade balance.  Biya said there had also been a a 13 per cent 
increase in foreign investments in the country.  
   He reiterated his willingness to continue +the ruthless war"initiated 
in June 1995 against customs fraud and sabotage of the national economy.  
   "If recovery efforts proceed normally, the year 1996 will enable 
Cameroonians to see, at last, the end of the economic crisis,"Biya said.

Lesotho Banker to Represent the World Bank at UN

   DAKAR, Senegal - Lesotho's Timothy Thahane, a loser in the bid to 
succeed Babacar Ndiaye at the the African Development Bank (ADB) in Cote 
d'Ivoire, started work Monday as vice-president for the World Bank's 
relations with the United Nations.  
   Thahane, who was the bank's secretary at the time he run for the ADB 
presidency from May to September, lost the race to the Moroccan Omar 
Mohamed Kabbaj, the Word Bank said in a communique. He will in his new 
post be charged with strengthening, coordinating and developing 
relations between the financial institution and the United Nations. The 
bank's president James Wolfenson said Thahane had been appointed "on the 
strength of his broad understanding of the of the functioning of 
international organisations.
   "Thahane is going to strengthen and increase our partnership with the 
United Nations,"he added.  
   Thahane was since April 1980 vice-president and secretary of the

Zambia
Foreign Reserves Dwindle

by Muengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LUSAKA, Zambia - Government expenditure on importation of famine 
relief food and debt servicing commitments have contributed to the 
depletion of Zambia's foreign reserves said by central bank officials to 
have been around only USD 220 million dollars by last November.  
   According to Zambia's central bank statistics published Tuesday, 
Zambia had USD 257 million last October but this fell to USD 219.296 the 
following month.  
   Central bank officials said in Lusaka Tuesday that December figures 
were not yet computed.  
   Debt serving over the same period increased to USD 34.million for 
November from USD 16 million the previous month.  
   Zambia is to import an estimated 1,000,000 tonnes of famine relief 
maize to meet the shortfall caused by several dry seasons.  
   The country has an external debt of USD 6 billion dollars and the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) last December granted it some USD 850 
million as balance of payments support, debt servicing and project and 
goods and services financing for 1996.   The Paris Club donors have said 
however that disbursement of the funds is dependent on Zambia's "good-
governance"record and continued adherence to a harsh structural 
adjustment programme.   Most Zambians, whose standard of living has been 
adversely affected by a general economic decline, blame the programme 
for their current economic hardships.

Zimbabwe
Industrialists Express Economic Worries

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)

   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - Industrialists in western Zimbabwe on Tuesday 
said business confidence was at its lowest level in years and warned of 
job losses as companies struggle to survive the country's harsh economic 
climate.
   "From an employment view point, its sheer gloom and despondency. 
There is so much de-industrialisation and I see more retrenchmenzs,"said 
Mr. Harding, a member of the Matabeleland Chamber of Industries (MCI's) 
labour committee. He said in an interview all of Zimbabwe's economic 
indicators were negative with many companies holding huge stocks because 
of depressed domestic demand and less competitive exports.  
   Several companies in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, were 
liquidated or forced to retrench staff last year due to a lack of export 
incentives, high interest rates and a decline in profitability.
   At least 10 companies in the region had either closed down, downsized 
or relocated to other places, according to the MCI. Most companies which 
had seen their competitiveness eroded by high wage costs would continue 
retrenching, cutting part time jobs and overtime pay, compelling 
consumers to tighten their purse strings further to cope with negative 
growth in real incomes, Harding said. 
  He said it was unlikely retrenched workers would be rehired since 
companies would be trying to produce cost-effectively.  
   "The low corporate productivity thus reduces the government's revenue 
base," he said. He predicted a trend, by cash-strapped workers, to press 
demands for better wages and salaries commensurate with the high cost of 
living.  
   The problem was that current high rates of inflation were built into 
production costs, putting basic products beyond the reach of many 
people.
   Harding said although Zimbabwe's rainfall pattern had been 
favourable, there was uncertainty on whether more rains would last for 
some time to sustain fragile recovery underway. "Besides, even if we 
have good rains, the economic effect would be felt around october or 
November,"he said.
   The MCI warned that unless measures were undertaken to encourage both 
domestic and foreign investment, the country could be "turned into a 
nation of shopkeepers rather than manufacturers".

Mozambique
More State Firms to be Privatised

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)

   MAPUTO, Mozambique - As part of the privatisation process in 
Mozambique, the government is selling 80 per cent of the share capital 
of a state company specialising in cold storage and air conditioning 
systems.  
   The company, Enafrio, has been valued at USD 1.6 million. It 
currently employs 144 workers and is the only company of its kind in 
Mozambique.  
   Among other state companies coming up for privatisation soon are the 
tea-processing company (Emocha), and the farm implement factory (Agro-
Alfa).   The shipyard at the central port city of Beira and Hidraulica 
de Maputo, a company specialising in irrigation systems and civil 
construction, will also be sold in the near future.  
   However, the most important privatisation this year will be the sale 
of 51 per cent of the share capital of the national commercial bank. 
This will be the first privatisation of a state-owned bank in Mozambique 
and could happen in June.   Since 1992, the Mozambican state has sold 
nealy 550 companies. Forty-five of these were large companies and 
included the country's cement factory and brewerries. Their sale earned 
the state USD 5 million.

Angola
Luanda's Tall War-Induced Environment Agenda

Panafrican News Agency
Janaury 1, 1996 (19960101)
by Peter Masebu, PANA Staff Correspondent

   DAKAR, Senegal - The guns might completely go silent in Angola in 
1996 but they will leave behind gigantic ecological and environmental 
problems. 
   Three decades of civil war, starting with the anti-colonial struggle, 
caused so much environmental degradation that no Angolan can claim to 
have escaped from its effects. 
   Angola's Director of Environment, Joao Da Costa Vintem, said in an 
interview with PANA recently that although the country is vast with a 
small population of about 10 million, many people have moved to urban 
centers, mostly located in fragile coastal lands. 
   "Most of the war-displaced people moved to Luanda, Benguela or 
Lobito, slashing trees in the surrounding areas for fuel or to create 
plots for cultivation," he added. 
   Vintem said these activities have further helped the northward 
advance of the Namib desert, which occupies a large portion of 
neighboring Namibia's territory. 
   The rural-urban exodus, Vintem said, has more than trippled the 
populations of Angolan towns including Luanda, the capital, which was 
originally meant to host 500,000 people. 
   "The huge population inflow has led to the destruction of most public 
amenities, especially urban water supply and sanitation systems. Solid 
and liquid wastes abound everywhere causing endemic diseases like 
diarrhea and cholera as well as malaria," he said. 
   Vintem hopes that the Nov. 20, 1994 Lusaka peace accord between the 
government and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola, UNITA, will soon be fully implemented "so that people can return 
to their natural sites after the removal of mines, the greatest 
environmental hazard in rural areas." 
   Enormous environmental degradation has also occured in diamond mining 
areas which are now full of pits. 
   "Mining companies also diverted water from rivers leaving the 
population without water, especially in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sud," he 
said. 
   The Angolan Environment director said discussions were underway to 
ensure that the mining companies involved take part in efforts to 
restore the environment. 
   "The government has to find a way of ending the anarchy reigning in 
the mining area since the removal of restrictions on people to enter the 
area which existed under the former one party rule," added the director. 
   As a major off-shore oil producer, Angola also suffers from oil 
spills in its coastal waters, endangering the once abundant fish there. 
   The shores off the oil-rich Cabinda enclave has been so polluted that 
government had to ask the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company to help in cleaning 
up operations. The oil company has appointed a Swiss firm, which has 
taken water samples from the polluted sea coast. 
   To reverse these dangerous trends, the Department of Environment has 
asked the government to include an environment national plan of action 
among its priorities when negotiating with aid donors, the first of 
whose meeting took place in Brussels last September. 
   Vintem said approaches had also been made to the World Bank to 
finance feasibilities for an environment protection code and the 
creation of an environment information center. 
   "I know that government's priority will be the reconstruction of 
destroyed cities like Huambo, Kuito and others. But locally sourcing 
environment funds is important because the environment forms the basis 
for sustainable development," he concluded. -0-

Cameroon
Ecological War Between Humans and Elephants

Panafrican News Agency
January 1, 1996 (19960101)

   DAKAR, Senegal - Living together is more and more difficult for 
villagers and elephants in northern Cameroon as the animals pose a 
continuing menance to farms and even local housing.  
   The Conservation News Service from the World Wildlife Fund has said 
"about 350 elephants destroyed 285 hectares of crops belonging to 516 
families" in Cameroon in 1995.  
   Quoting Dourga Albert, a wildlife chief forest warden in Cameroon, 
the journal said the damage affected not less than 3 127 people, 
directly.  
   In a report for the WWF, John Nchami Tafor, said there were some 20 
000 elephants in Cameroon.  
   About 2 000 elephants (Loxondonia Africana Africana) live in northern 
Cameroon's dry savannah. They are essentialy gathered in the Waza and 
Kalamaloue national parks. The others (Loxondonia Africana Cyclotis) 
spread into southern Cameroon's thick tropical forests.  
   Relations between human beings and elephants are particularly 
strained in the dry savannah, where the situation has worsened in the 
last five years, says the WWF.  
   In July 1992, said WWf, 320 marauding elephants destroyed 5 000 
hectares of crops. This was at a time of drought and poor food security.  
   Some 22 000 people suffered from the starvation that followed.  
   Between May and November 1993, a large herd of some 850 elephants 
destroyed 1 700 hectares of millet and cotton in Mayor Kani and Mayor 
Louti districts in the north, leading to further harm to peasant 
incoomes.  
   Between May and September 1994, 400 to 500 elephants destroyed millet 
and cotton throughout the country.  
   A lack of food and water is the main source of the conflict between 
human settlements and the elephants, the WWF says. 
   It says a full grown elephant needs some 140 kgs of food (grasses, 
leaves, fruits, roots, bark) daily. It also drinks 100 litres of water 
daily and can move up to 30 kms just for a cold bath.  
   As farms and tourist camps take over their places, Cameroon's 
elephants are turning to crops to feed themselves.      
   Experts say the number of elephants in Cameroon has increased due to 
the country's adoption, reluctantly, of a global ban on trade in ivory 
in 1989.  
   "When they migrate, elephants follow a precise direction. If they 
find crops on their way they destroy them" says Hillaire Manga, a 
wildlife department head in northern Cameroon.

Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire)
Collaborative Study Launched on Ebola

Panafrican News Agency
January 3, 1996 (19960103)

   DAKAR, Senegal - After the discovery of an Ebola patient in Cote 
d'Ivoire recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a 
two-year study aimed at identifying the natural host reservoir of the 
deadly virus in that country.
   The study will involve representatives of virtually every laboratory 
facility in the world "that is capable to safely handling the Ebola 
virus for study," says the U.N health agency in a news release. 
   A team of researchers will concentrate their efforts on Tai forest 
where a new sub-type of the Ebola virus was isolated from a Swiss 
primate researcher thought to have been infected in late 1994 while 
performing an autopsy on a dead chimpanzee from which the same Ebola 
sub-type was isolated.
   "The Tai forest of Cote d'Ivoire is considered to be a more conducive 
site for such investigation, as it is a well defined ecosystem that has 
been extensively studied and one where the disease is known to be 
present," the WHO release said. 
   The new study group will base their initial investigation on the 
research by the Swiss-Ivorian ethology team of which the infected 
researcher was a member. 
   "The focus of investigation is the relationship among primates, other 
vertebrates, anthropods and perhaps human beings in the region of the 
Tai forest," said the WHO press release.  Among the closest contacts of 
the chimpanzees are Colobus monkeys, which serve as a major food source 
for the chimpanzees, it added. 
   The 12-member informal working group involved in the study held its 
first meeting Dec. 15, 1995.The meeting was also attended by seven WHO 
professionals, including four from headquarters and three from the 
African region.
   Among the Africans in the research team are Dr Deogratias 
Barakamfitiye and Dr Kadri Tankari from the Brazzaville-based Africa 
Regional Office. These were involved in another study on the Ebola 
virus, which killed at least 250 people in Kikwit, Zaire between April 
and June 1995.The findings are not yet out. 
   The Ebola virus is one of the most pathogenic viral agents known to 
man, causing death in 80 percent or more of infected cases. 
   The World Health Organization said last year that it wilL hold an 
international symposium in Kinshasa, Zaire in March on the Ebola virus 
and the haemorrhagic fever it causes.

Zimbabwe
Over 150 People Regain Sight

Panafrican News Agency
January 3, 1996 (19960103)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Over 150 residents of Gokwe in Zimbabwe's Midlands 
Province suffering from various eye disorders had their eye sight 
restored during a Raleigh International expedition between October and 
December 1995.
   In a report on Tuesday chronicling its 10-week programme of projects 
throughout Zimbabwe, Raleigh said one of the highlights of the 
expedition was organising an eye camp in the Gokwe area in which 156 
patients with cataracts and other eye disorders had their eye sight 
restored, often after years of blindness.
   A further 6,137 people in the area underwent tests to determine the 
degree of eye sight loss. 
   The free eye operations and tests were conducted in conjunction with 
the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, Council For The Blind and the 
American-based Charity See International. 
   The expedition, which was Raleigh International's 13th to Zimbabwe 
comprised 10 projects and 108 participants from Britain, Hong Kong, New 
Zealand, Singapore and Zimbabwe.
   Other projects undertaken included the building of a fire tower at 
the Chilojo cliffs, Gonarezhou national park, to provide early warning 
of damaging bush fires.
   With funding from the British High Commission, Raleigh International 
started the construction of an accommodation block for 28 elderly 
residents of the Zimbabwe New Hope Home at Gatsi in the Honde valley. 
   The participants also built two new pans and repaired seven bore hole 
pump houses providing water supplies to wildlife in the Hwange National 
Park in Western Zimbabwe.

Nigeria
Doctor Researching a Male Contraceptive

Panafrican News Agency
January 3, 1996 (19960103)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - A Nigerian doctor Nnaemeka Amobi and his British 
counterpart Christopher Smith, both of the London King's College, are on 
the threshold of a scientific breakthrough in the development of male 
contraceptive.
   According to a recent issue of the "new scientist' magazine, the 
research of the two physiologists on the unusual side-effects associated 
with two drugs --phenoxybenzamine used in the treatment of high blood 
pressure and thioridazine for schizophrenia -- has proved beneficial.
   It is common knowledge in medical circles that both drugs prevent 
ejaculation, although men who take them still experience orgasms. 
   But their side-effects such as drowsiness had made the drugs 
unsuitable for prescription as contraceptives for men. 
   The research by Amobi and Smith showed that the drugs prevent 
ejaculation by "temporarily paralysing the sperm duct muscles" 
responsible for transporting sperm from the testes to the penis," the 
magazine said. 
   The two doctors were quoted as saying the research finding could 
result in a safe male contraceptive pill. 
   They say unlike the female version, the male pill could be taken as 
and when required. 
   Smith believes the "discovery opens up a new category of 
contraceptive. It gives rise to the first chemical vasectomy because the 
drugs can control the duct using a pincer movement." 
   Amobi agrees, saying the discovery would be of great benefit to 
developing countries in their quest for effective population control 
measures. 
   Above all, he said, "vasectomies are regarded with great suspicion," 
in the this part of the world.

 PERU: PERUVIANS DISAPPOINTED BY THEIR LIMITED STAKE IN TELEFONICA SHARES 
placement

 The Peruvian government had no hesitation in acclaiming the placement of 
Telefonica del Peru shares on the New York stock exchange at the beginning 
of the month as an unqualified success. The domestic sale of shares was also 
over-subscribed, though as an exercise in 'popular capitalism', it was a bit 
of a let-down.

 The 23.5% holding that the government put up for sale raised a total of US 
Dollars 1.1bn, US Dollars 918m of it in New York, snapped up by around 500 
institutional investors. It was, as the Financial Times noted, the first big 
test for Latin American equities since the Mexican devaluation crisis at the 
end of 1994, and Peru came through it with flying colours.

 The international offering was oversubscribed by five times, even though 
the Peruvian economy had been faltering recently -presumably because 
prospects for second-half growth are generally reckoned to be good.

 The domestic offering was equally successful, with about 263,000 people 
applying for US Dollars 323m worth of shares, payable in instalments, under 
the much-hyped 'citizen's participation' scheme.

 But the international demand was so great that many small Peruvian 
applicants were cut out at the last minute, when it was decided to halve  
their allocation, to only US Dollars 148m. So much for the aim of broadly-
based, share-owning democracy.

 The ombudsman (defensor del pueblo), Jorge Santisteban, called for 'greater 
transparency' with future 'citizen's participation' offers. In an attempt to 
repair some of the damage, President Alberto Fujimori announced on 11 July 
the sale of 3% of the shares still in state hands on the domestic market. 
That will leave the government with only 2%.

 Like CANTV in Venezuela (see Page 6, inside), Telefonica has a monopoly of 
conventional telephony until the end of the century, and it has big 
expansion programmes under way, with investments totalling US Dollars 1.6bn 
by 1998. But, unlike its Venezuelan counterpart, Telefonica is the country's 
biggest company, and is likely to remain so until the Camisea natural gas 
project comes on stream.

 The Peruvian government hopes the Telefonica exercise, coming hard on the 
heels of the letter of intent accord with the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), will usher in a run of international successes for Peru. This should 
culminate in a Brady debt-rescheduling deal before the end of the year, 
which could reduce Peru's US Dollars 10bn commercial bank debt by about 
half.

 First come talks with the Paris Club on Peru's US Dollars 9.65bn bilateral 
debt, beginning in mid-July. The team led by economy minister Jorge Camet 
hopes that Peru will secure as favourable treatment as Russia earlier this 
year, including rescheduling of payments over 20-25 years.

 ECUADOR: POLITICS: BALANCING BANKERS AND INDIANS: BUCARAM WILL HAVE TO 
DEVELOP  SKILFUL POLITICAL JUGGLING ACT

 President-elect Abdala Bucaram announced a few days after his election on 7 
July that he would be flying to New York before his inauguration (10 August) 
to reassure bankers and business leaders about his intentions. This was 
probably a wise move, as his pre-election rhetoric about smashing the 
oligarchy and governing for the poor had caused a certain amount of unease 
in those spheres.

 The presence of a trio of bankers in his economic team (see WR-96-28) was 
expected to reassure his US audiences. And Bucaram adviser Jose Miguel Salem 
promised laws to encourage foreign capital to stay in the country and to 
attract new investors.

 But all this courting of the private sector raises the problem of balancing 
reassurance, on the one hand, with the expectations of Bucaram's other 
supporters, and particularly the increasingly assertive Indian movement, on 
the other.

 Decisive factor. All observers agree that the active or tacit support of 
the Indian organisations that backed Freddy Ehlers' candidacy in the first 
round (see WR-96-19 & RA-96-04) was a decisive factor in Bucaram's run-off 
victory. Indian leaders such as Luis Macas, president of the Confederacion 
de Nacionalidades Indigenas del Ecuador (Conaie) and deputy-elect for Nuevo 
Pais-Pachakutik, have made clear their view that they have earned a voice in 
the new administration commensurate with their growing political importance.

 Both Bucaram and Jaime Nebot had seemed to favour the idea of Macas being 
elected chairman of the 82-seat congress, but that prospect appeared to 
recede in the wake of the second-round voting. 'We have decided not to make 
a pact with any party, but to wait and see what those parties will do and 
what their relations with the government will be, as we intend to maintain 
Nuevo Pais's independence,' said another Indian leader, Jose Maria 
Cabascango, on 11 July.

 Macas said just before the second round: 'Nebot and Bucaram represent two 
economic power groups disputing political power, to consolidate their 
hegemony. They have never identified with our struggles or our proposals in 
the past; on the contrary, they dismissed and suppressed them.'

 New political style. Conaie and other Indian organisations, such as the 
Organizacion de Pueblos Indigenas del Pastaza (Opip), have developed a 
distinctive political style, combining mainstream left-wing causes, such as 
state-ownership of 'strategic' sectors of the economy, with cultural and 
social aspirations, such as the preservation of local self-government and 
resistance to the impact of economic development in the Oriente jungles.

 This complex political articulation of highland and jungle interests adds 
to the instability of Ecuador's party structure, as it creates new 
possibilities for circumstantial alliances and splits with other 
organisations, and greatly increases the fragmentation of the centre-left 
segment of the Ecuadorean political spectrum, which accounts for about a 
third of the seats in the new congress (see box).

 Environmental issues. These factors were reflected in Ehlers' insistence on 
the importance of traditional Indian values in his election campaign, and 
particularly on environmental issues, which coincided with the viewpoints of 
middle-class ecological organisations. And the concepts of multi-culturalism 
and multi-ethnicity have become the common currency of political debate in 
Ecuador, with even the right-wing Nebot paying lip-service to such ideas.

 Two new oil-related projects have already met with fierce Indian 
resistance. Opip complained in late June that a contract with the US company 
Arco to build a 165km feeder pipeline through Indian lands had been signed 
behind their backs; and the Huaorani ethnic group protested in mid-July that 
the drilling by a three-company consortium of a well with potential 
production of 2,200 barrels per day in their territory would exacerbate the 
inflow of settlers on to their lands.

 The Huaoranis threatened to take the law into their own hands unless the 
government acted to remove the 5,000 colonos already there.

 SPECIAL REPORT ON INDIANS

 We predicted as long ago as 1994 that Ecuador's increasingly assertive 
Indian organisations would soon assume a more important political role, and 
would become a factor to reckon with in decisions on the Oriente oil 
industry. See our Special Report, Indians: New Factor on the Latin American 
Scene, June 1994.

 COSTING THE PLEDGES

 Economist Jaime Zeas has attempted to cost the various spending promises 
made by Bucaram during the election campaign. He concluded that they would 
imply expenditure of US Dollars 2.35bn, or almost two-thirds of the 1996 
budget of US Dollars 3.7bn.

 The most expensive items would be:

 Construction of 6,000km of local roads (US Dollars 450m);

 Increases in teachers' salaries and in the health and police budgets (US 
Dollars 422m each);

 Extension of social security coverage to family members (US Dollars 407m);

 Creation of banks for coffee, cacao, handicrafts, small industries and 
foreign trade, plus a ministry for Indian affairs (US Dollars 170m);

 Subsidies for rice, milk, meat and petrol, and 50% reduction in 
agricultural products (US Dollars 55m);

 Cheap medicines and free maternity service (US Dollars 35m)

 Soft credits for house building (US Dollars 20m);

 School breakfasts (US Dollars 13m);

 COLOMBIA: PRIVATISATION: FURTHER DELAYS FUEL DOUBTS: 'LACK OF POLITICAL 
WILL' HALTS US Dollars 731M ASSET SELL-OFF

 Two more failed attempts to bring the private sector into the running of 
Colombia's public assets have added to the growing scepticism with which 
analysts regard the Samper administration's commitment to its privatisation 
programme. As neither Bogota's communications company (ETB) nor Medellin's 
public companies (EPM) are national, the government has not been blamed 
explicitly, but given its past record - in 1995 only US Dollars 6.5m of a 
planned US Dollars 333m was actually sold off - critics are hardly surprised 
at the latest setback.

 It was Samper's predecessor, Cesar Gaviria, who began the 'apertura' of 
Colombia's economy back in 1989. The ensuing programme of economic 
liberalisation relied partly on extensive privatisation to boost foreign 
investment, which has increased steadily since then to a record US Dollars 
1.6bn last year, excluding petroleum. And even despite the recent political 
crisis, Colombia remains a 'stable economy' for investment, with steady 
growth and controlled inflation.

 So when Jose Antonio Ocampo, the current Director of National Planning, 
recently stated that US Dollars 30.2bn of investment was needed in 
Colombia's infrastructure between 1995 and 1998, and that 40% would come 
from the private sector, it seemed likely that privatisation or at least the 
selling of concessions in the transport, energy and telecommunications 
sectors was on the horizon.

 Reforms subsequently began in the Civil Aviation Authority, the electricity 
generators, parts of Ecopetrol and its gas subsidiaries,  and Telecom, as 
well as various financial institutions including the Banco Popular, to 
prepare them for privatisation.

 The government then scheduled for the end of 1996 the completed sell-offs 
of 4 airports, 5 companies created to transport and manage gas pipelines, a 
nickel production plant, the Banco Popular and two other financial 
corporations. In addition, the bidding processes for between 51% and 60% of 
3 hydro-electric and 5 thermoelectric power stations, as well as for two 
telecommunications' licenses worth US Dollars 150m, were all to be 
completed.

 According to Confis calculations (see graphs), this impressive list of 
envisaged privatisations will net the government US Dollars 725m in 1996. So 
with over half the year gone, critics are becoming increasingly concerned as 
to why not a single peso has to date entered the government coffers.

 While officials put the endless delays down to technical hitches, some 
critics are more blunt. As one observer commented, 'this government has no 
intention of selling because the idea of promoting private participation is 
not in their philosophy.' Clemente del Valle from the Ministry of Finance 
denied this charge, arguing that irrespective of ideology, it was reality 
that would ultimately convince the doubters of the benefits of 
privatisation.

 And to be fair to the government, there have been many setbacks. Not least 
was a constitutional court ruling last year which halted the key Banco 
Popular privatisation until the 'sector solidario' -unions, active or 
pensioned workers, employees' funds- had been guaranteed a stake. The ruling 
stemmed from a law introduced as part of Samper's own social programme which 
sought to 'democratize' state sell-offs, effectively giving first refusal on 
share offers to the 'sector solidario' and thus delaying the whole process 
by up to three months.

 Having received the final go-ahead from the council of Ministers, the Banco 
Popular privatisation is now back on track. But as one hurdle is cleared, 
another appears on the horizon, for now investors are complaining that the 
asking price of US Dollars 318m is grossly inflated.

 Similar variations of to-ing and fro-ing dog most of the government's 
privatisation plans, feeding criticism that the required political will to 
find a way through the upsets is just not there.

 Only 15% of the US Dollars 1.5bn electricity sector sell-off is to go ahead 
this year, Rodrigo Villamizar, the Minister of mines, recently announced, 
because further 'sweeteners' are needed to make it an attractive offer for 
private investors.

 But why had this not been thought of before? One analyst told Semana that 
the government treated privatisation like a simple case of placing a 
classified ad in a newspaper to sell a house, and that it was therefore 
inevitable that all these 'technical hitches' kept arising.

 Whatever the reasons for the delays, the bottom line is that the government 
has no choice but to privatise as it desperately needs the proceeds to 
finance part of its social programme. And having staked his political future 
on this programme throughout his corruption trial, Samper would be well 
advised to succeed.

 REGION: FOCUS: HOW GOOD A GUIDE ARE 'THE MARKETS'?: HEADLINES CROWD OUT 
DEEPER ANDEAN TRENDS

 To judge from the performance of the stockmarkets, investors are having no 
easy task figuring out which way the Andean economies are heading. Colombia, 
which at first had seemed impervious to the 'Tequila Effect', began to slide 
last year, and by mid-1996 was the only country in Latin America to register 
a dollar-term decline. Peru, which last year was the only country to 
approximate the high yields of the 'pre-Tequila' years, was in 1996 showing 
a first-half gain of only 16%. Venezuela, whose three-year recession has 
only just bottomed out, was by end-June showing the best results in the 
hemisphere: a dollar-term gain of 56.5%.

 The Colombian decline can be attributed largely to the political 
uncertainty, now somewhat dispelled, about the threat to President Ernesto 
Samper's tenure of office. The other reactions seem linked to 'headline' 
developments: the big privatisation deals in Peru, the imminence of a deal 
between Venezuela and the IMF.

 Despite the proliferation of sources of information about the region, and 
the acceleration of its delivery, investment decisions continue to be 
affected by headlines and news flashes: the grasp of underlying trends 
appears to be weak --indeed a recent survey of 'market operators' conducted 
by our sister service, the on-line Latin American Network, showed an 
alarming number uninterested in anything but last-minute, deal-related news.

 The problem is compounded by the slow emergence of properly analysed 
information on the underlying trends --which in the case of the Andean 
countries continue to show Colombia in the most solid position.

 From a series of recently-published studies (some of them up to two years 
in the making), the following valuable insights emerge.

 The 1980s saw the rising relative cost of capital appear as a strong 
constraint on investment: Colombia is among the few Latin American countries 
where this did not discernibly affect investment.

 In common with most of Latin America, the Andean countries have seen the 
rewards taken by capital rise far more than those of labour. In Venezuela, 
labour's share fell by 10% in 1980-90 while that of capital increased 48%. 
In Bolivia both fell, but labour's fell 1.7 times more than that of capital. 
In Colombia both rose (as also happened in Ecuador).

 Another shared Latin American trend is the declining efficiency of the use 
of capital, as measured by capital-output ratios. But over the past decade 
Colombia's decline has been only half the average for six of the largest 
Latin American economies. Since its best period, in the mid-1970s, the fall 
in efficiency has been almost four times greater in Venezuela than in 
Colombia.

 Over the past decade, Colombia was the Andean country which most increased 
the share of its GDP devoted to research and development: a fivefold rise, 
compared with only 1.2 to 1.4 times in Ecuador, Bolivia and Venezuela, and a 
decline in Peru.

 One area where Colombia compares badly with its neighbours is that of the 
technological upgrading of its exports. Its ITS, an index which measures the 
share of medium- and high-technology products in exports to OECD countries, 
has fallen markedly since 1980, while those of Peru and Venezuela have 
increased.

 This, however, must be seen against the fact that Colombia's export trade 
has the highest share of manufactured goods in the Andean region (indeed, 
the fourth-highest in the whole of Latin America): almost twice as much as 
Peru, two-and-a-half times more than Bolivia, almost three times as much as 
Venezuela, and eight times more than Ecuador.

 Similarly, Colombia's exports are the most diversified in the Andean 
region. Seen from the opposite end of the scale, its 'concentration index' 
has more than halved over the past decade, while those of Bolivia, Ecuador 
and Venezuela have diminished only slightly, and Peru's has remained 
unchanged.

 NOTE ON SOURCES

 The list of the top 100 publicly traded companies in Latin America, ranked 
by sales, has been published by Latin Trade, a Miami-based magazine devoted 
mainly to company news.
Other data for this article came from the following studies:

 Strengthening Development: The interplay of macro- and microeconomics 
(Eclac, 1996).

 The Manufacturing Sector in Latin America and the New Economic Model, by 
Professor John Weeks, in The New Economic Model in Latin America and its 
Impact on Income Distribution and Poverty, edited by Victor Bulmer-Thomas 
(institute of Latin American Studies, London, 1966).

 Sistemas de Innovacion y Especializacion Tecnologica en America Latina y el 
Caribe, by Ludovico Alcorta and Wilson Peres (Eclac, 1996).

 DO COMPANY RANKINGS HELP?

 Which Andean countries have publicly traded companies which rank among 
Latin America's top 100? The question was asked at a recent private meeting 
in London attended by a number of 'operators' in Latin American investments.

 No-one produced the correct answer --only one: Peru [Telefonica del Peru 
ranks 65th, Southern Peru Copper Corporation 72nd].
This position in the overall ranking can be misleading as to the relative 
sizes of big concerns in the Andean region: apart from those two companies, 
no Peruvian firm is big enough to rank among Colombia's top five, and only 
three (La fabril/Pacifico, Peruano Suiza and Gloria) would make Colombia's 
top ten.

 By comparison, two Venezuelan companies (Sivensa and Elecar) are in the 
same range as Colombia's top five, and two more (Vencemos and Mavesa) are 
within the range of Colombia's top ten.

 Colombia's top tier, with sales of US Dollars 246m to US Dollars 665m, is 
roughly comparable to the second tier of big firms in Argentina.

 The inability to pick Peru as the correct answer is unsurprising, but not 
only because that country's top two are in a category of their own: when the 
list of top firms in all three countries was checked against a well-known 
guide to Latin American companies, the 'finds' included only two of 
Colombia's top ten, two of Peru's top 15, and three of Venezuela's top five.

 VENEZUELA: PRIVATISATION: PETKOFF PLEDGES POLITICAL WILL: AFTER SEVERAL 
FALSE STARTS, SELL-OFF SHOULD SPEED UP

 When the proposed sale of the state-owned Aeropostal airline was postponed 
for the sixth time at the end of June, it did not augur well for Venezuela's 
supposedly rejuvenated privatisation programme. Sell-offs peaked in 1992, 
when 10 companies were disposed of; since then the programme has been 
languishing, with only five, six and two sales in the past three years, 
respectively.

 Confidence growing. But the Caldera government is adamant that it is 
serious about giving a boost to the undertaking, now that a deal has been 
successfully struck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and prospects 
for the Venezuelan economy look more promising than for some time (see WR-
96-292).

 It is ironic that this new departure should take place under the auspices 
of a former left-wing guerrilla. But Teodoro Petkoff, the planning minister, 
has left no doubt that privatisation is a fundamental element of the 
government's economic policies (see RA-96-04), and the political will is now 
there. 

 New York presentation. The privatisation minister, Alberto Poletto (whose 
formal title is president of the Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela), set out 
his stall in a presentation for potential investors in New York on 26 June. 
The biggest industrial conglomerate still in state hands is the 17-unit 
Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG); by the time the sell-off is 
completed, only three companies will still be run by CVG.

 The aluminium industry is the jewel in CVG's crown, and pre-qualification 
of bidders was to begin in July. Venezuela's is the world's seventh-largest 
aluminium producer, with an annual output of 630,000 tonnes and exports of 
425,000 tonnes. The government hopes to raise at least US Dollars 2.5bn from 
the industry's sale. Aluminium export revenues average around US Dollars 
800m.

 CVG owns four companies that take part in all stages of bauxite, alumina 
and aluminium production: Bauxilum, Carbonorca, Venalum (415,000 tonnes of 
aluminium a year) and Alcasa (210,000 tonnes). Carlos Ernesto Sanchez, 
president of Alcasa, said at the end of June that he expected the auctioning 
of all four to be completed by the first half of December.

 One of the biggest problems facing the government is to come up with an 
attractive formula for potential buyers, as the four companies have 
accumulated internal and foreign debts totalling more than US Dollars 1.2bn, 
about half of which is owed to the government itself in unpaid taxes. 
Merrill Lynch is advising on possible approaches to this conundrum.

 Sanchez noted that the four companies are now making an operating profit, 
and recent debts have been mainly the result of exchange losses. Reynolds of 
the US has an 8% stake in Alcasa, and a Japanese consortium led by Kobe 
Steel has 20% of Venalum.

 Iron and steel, too. The other CVG units that are being put up for sale, 
notably the Sidor integrated steel operation and the Fesilven iron plant, 
are expected to raise a further US Dollars 1bn, perhaps next year.

 The CVG units that will not be sold are Electrificacion del Caroni 
(Edelca), the power generating company that runs the massive (10,000MW, 
second largest in Latin America) Guri dam; the Ferrominera del Orinoco iron 
ore mine at Cerro Bolivar; and the Minerven gold-mining operation.

 Telephone auction. The government also has high hopes for the sale of the 
49% of shares it still holds in the CANTV telephone company. Petkoff 
announced in mid-July that the auction would take place in November on both 
the Caracas and international stock exchanges -assuming that both the US 
authorities and the Venezuelan congress approve the arrangements.

 He said he expected the sale, which is being organised by the Lehman 
Brothers and S G Warburg investment banks, to bring in between US Dollars 
1bn and US Dollars 1.5bn. Other government sources have put the estimate as 
high as US Dollars 2bn.

 The first 40% tranche of CANTV shares were sold during the administration 
of President Carlos Andres Perez in 1991. A consortium led by GTE of the 
United States bid US Dollars 1.88bn. The remaining 11% were reserved for 
CANTV's employees.

 CANTV has a number of attractive features, not the least of which is a 
monopoly on conventional telephony until the year 2000. The company's 
concession runs for 35 years, renewable for a further 20. It has 2.8m lines 
installed.

 Banks sale. Poletto was accompanied in New York by Ester de Margulis, head 
of the Fondo de Garantia de Depositos Bancarios (Fogade), the state agency 
that has been give the job of reorganising and selling-off the banks 
nationalised in the wake of the 1994 financial crisis.

 Margulis told her audience that the Banco de Venezuela would be the first 
bank to be reprivatised, probably in August. The book value of Venezuela's 
oldest bank is thought to be about US Dollars 60m. Banco Tequendama is to 
follow in September, Banco Consolidado in October, Banco Latino at the end 
of 1996 and Banco de la Republica early next year. Poletto said he hoped 
their sales would fetch between US Dollars 6bn and US Dollars 7bn.

 Among a long list of other assorted enterprises that the government 
proposes to sell off are three regional power companies (Nueva Esparta, 
Enelbar and Enelven-Enelco); the Dianca and Puerto Central shipyards; the 
Monay cement works, and a string of hotels (which includes the cable car 
from Caracas to the coast).

 The big exception to the privatisation rule is the state oil company, 
PDVSA, one of the biggest and most successful in the world, with annual 
sales in excess of US Dollars 26bn. The symbolic importance of PDVSA, 
created after the nationalisation of the oil industry in 1976, is so great 
that no government would dare to suggest it should be sold.

 PDVSA off the agenda. 'The privatisation of PDVSA is not on this 
government's agenda, and those who propose such a move are fundamentalists 
who think that its would solve all the country's problems,' said Petkoff on 
12 July.

 PDVSA president Luis Giusti is among those who have suggested a half-way 
house, selling say 15% of the company's shares to help pay off the US 
Dollars 27bn foreign debt and give a boost to the non-oil sectors of the 
economy. But energy minister Erwin Arrieta made clear that even such a 
compromise was politically inconceivable.

 Over the past few years, however, PDVSA has entered into a number of 
contractual arrangements with foreign oil and gas companies, to attract 
much-needed capital into the industry. Earlier exercises included 
concessions to reactivate marginal fields and to help extract the extra-
heavy oil of the Faja del Orinoco.

 The latest modality of the 'opening' of the oil industry was the signing of 
eight risk contracts with international consortia at the beginning of the 
year (see RA-96-01). The association agreements were finally signed on 10 
July, giving the new PDVSA subsidiary Corporacion Venezolana de Petroleo 
(CPV) and the eight consortia 30 days to set up the operating companies.

 Petrochemicals opening. Petkoff also announced that foreign capital would 
soon be invited to invest directly in the petrochemicals industry, dominated 
by the PDVSA subsidiary Petroquimica de Venezuela (Pequiven). The state 
company turns out 3.2m tonnes of products a year, and a further 2m tonnes in 
a number of joint ventures with domestic and foreign private companies.

 Petrochemical exports are expected to total US Dollars 760m this year. 
Information minister Fernando Egana said on 10 July that up to 200 new 
companies could be created in this sector by the year 2005 -by which time 
exports could reach US Dollars 2.5bn.

 AEROPOSTAL SAGA GOES ON

 As for Aeropostal, a number of airlines, including Avianca of Colombia and 
Delta of the US, showed an interest, but when it came to the crunch none of 
them could put down the US Dollars 2m deposit by 2 July required to enable 
them to proceed to the next stage: an auction with a reserve price of US 
Dollars 28m.

 The airline, founded in 1929, ceased operations in 1994, after a strike, 
with losses of US Dollars 38m. At its peak it had 16 planes and 40% of the 
domestic market -as well as services to Atlanta, Orlando and the Caribbean. 
Its assets were valued at more than US Dollars 60m in 1994.

 COLOMBIA: VIOLENCE: POLICE ACCUSED OF EXECUTING SUSPECTS: AND CONTRACT 
KILLING RAISES 'COLOMBIANISATION' FEARS

 Two events in mid-July summed up the alarming institutional breakdown in 
Venezuela. The Policia Tecnica Judicial (PTJ) published figures indicating 
that there had been 821 murders in Caracas in the first six months of the 
year, 747 of them with firearms; 630 of the victims were between the ages of 
18 and 30.

 And President Rafael Caldera publicly rebuked his justice minister, Enrique 
Meier, for criticising his predecessor's running of the ministry, 
particularly the prison service.

 Fewer murders, but ... The murder rate in Caracas was actually down on the 
same period last year, when 936 people died violent deaths in the capital. 
But PTJ chief Jesus Lazo Ricardi noted that insecurity was very widespread 
in the city, largely as a result of the high levels of drug and alcohol 
consumption.

 Most of the killings were at weekends in the hillside barrios surrounding 
the capital, where the police presence is very low and armed gangs hold 
sway. Another consequence of the absence of police is that lynchings (eight 
in the first six months) and vigilante groups have become commonplace.

 The commander of the Policia Metropolitana (PM), General Rafael Damiani, 
estimates that he would need double the number of officers he has at his 
disposal to provide an adequate service to the capital's 4m inhabitants.

 'Extra-judicial executions.' Not that the poorly trained and paid PM's 
reputation is very high. In mid-June the police managed to stop an armed 
robbery at an ice-cream parlour in the city centre, killing one of the 
attackers, and at the cost of the life of a young policewoman -the first to 
die on active service.

 But sympathy turned to outrage when the two surviving criminals were 
subsequently found dead in a hospital morgue, their bodies riddled with 
bullets. They had earlier been filmed by Radio Caracas Television being 
taken away in handcuffs by the police.

 Here was evidence that the PM were carrying out 'extra-judicial executions' 
-an increasingly frequent occurrence according to human rights 
organisations, such as Provea, which counted more than 270 in Venezuela in 
1994-95.

 The PM was forced to hand over the officers involved in the operation to 
the PTJ, public prosecutor Ivan Dario Badell ordered an inquiry and seven 
policemen were later arrested. RCTV complained that it had received 
threatening phone calls and PM patrol cars had been seen passing in front of 
the building.

 Contract killing. Days later public opinion received a further shock when 
the son-in-law of former presidential candidate Jose Vicente Rangel (now a 
prominent TV commentator) was shot dead as he delivered his daughter to a 
Caracas kindergarten, in what appeared to be a contract killing. This, 
together with the growing frequency of kidnappings, is widely seen as a 
further step towards the 'Colombianisation' of Venezuelan society.

 Meier earned Caldera's wrath by accusing his predecessor, Ruben Creixems, 
of permitting human rights abuses in Venezuela's nightmarish prisons. 
Caldera publicly contradicted him, and called Creixems to the presidential 
palace to offer a formal apology.

 REGION: POSTSCRIPT

 BOLIVIA/ Rural poverty. According to a report by the UN Population Fund, 
94% of rural households live below the poverty line, and the rate for cities 
is 51%. The study identified exceptional poverty in the urban areas of El 
Alto, Trinidad, Oruro and Potosi. 

 Chagas clampdown. The government has requested funds from the World Health 
Organisation to help it implement a five-year, US Dollars 70m programme to 
eradicate Chagas disease and malaria, which are present in 60% of the 
country. The authorities currently spend US Dollars 3m annually on 
fumigation projects in the areas affected by Chagas disease, and coordinate 
activities with Argentina, Peru and Brazil to combat the presence of 
malaria-carrying mosquitoes in frontier regions. A larger proportion of the 
population is affected by the two diseases than anywhere else in the 
Americas.

 Forest protection. After two years of debate congress has passed a forestry 
law aimed at protecting remaining woodland areas, which are deforested at a 
rate of 1,400 square kilometres per year, according to conservation group 
estimates. Under the law the state will grant 40-year concessions on forests 
to the private sector at a cost of US Dollars 1 per hectare per year, on the 
condition that the companies replant new forests. The law has been attacked 
by timber companies, who say the price should be only US Dollars 0.30 per 
hectare, and by Indian groups and the opposition, who say the price is too 
low. 

 COLOMBIA/ Fuel reserves. Oil reserves will last for another 20 years, or 
for 30 if used in conjunction with natural gas, at the current rate of 
consumption, according to the state oil company Ecopetrol. It estimates 
reserves at 2.9bn barrels of oil and 7.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 
though this does not include the fields discovered earlier this year in 
Piedemonte Llanero, whose potential has yet to be calculated.  

 Perry gets WB post. Guillermo Eduardo Perry, finance minister from 1994 
until his resignation three months ago, has been appointed Chief Economist 
for the Latin America and Caribbean Region of the World Bank. Perry studied 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is specialised in the 
fields of fiscal and energy policy. He held the post of mines and energy 
minister between 1986 and 1988. 

 ECUADOR/ Energy investment. Over the last four years the energy sector has 
attracted investments worth US Dollars 2bn, according to the ministry for 
energy and mines. The oil sector alone attracted around US Dollars 880m in 
the last six months, with Occidental Petroleum planning a further US Dollars 
600m this year.

 PERU/ Petrolube sale delayed. Labour minister Jorge Gonzalez Izquierdo 
announced that the sale of Petroperu's Petrolube plant, due to take place 
later this month, will be postponed until October. The lubrications branch 
is the second of Petroperu's subsidiaries due to be privatised, following 
the sale of the La Pampilla refinery in mid-June.

 Agricultural export growth. The value of agricultural exports will reach US 
Dollars 820m in 1996, a 37% increase on the US Dollars 600m recorded last 
year, according to the exporters' association, Adex, which also estimates 
that exports from the sector could be worth an annual US Dollars 1bn within 
four years.

 Copper profits down. The mining sector expects to receive US Dollars 250m 
less than its projected total revenue of US Dollars 1.3bn for this year, as 
a result of the fall in international copper prices following the 'Sumitomo 
scandal'. The price of the metal has fallen to US cents 90/lb, compared with 
an average of US Dollars 1.33/lb in 1995. 

 Corruption charges. A Lima judge has begun proceedings against second Vice-
President Cesar Paredes Canto, on extortion charges. Canto allegedly used 
his influence to gain an extended licence for the US airline Export Air, one 
of companies involved in the scandal over the sale of Argentine arms to 
Ecuador during the border war with Peru in 1995.  

 European food aid. The European Union has signed two agreements pledging 
food for 160,000 schoolchildren and 1,365 displaced families in the central 
highlands. Between July and December this year 2,240 tonnes of food will be 
distributed to children in the departments of Junin and Pasco. Families 
resettled in the department of Ayacucho will receive provisions under a 
food-for-community work scheme between now and June 1997.

 VENEZUELA/ Orinoco floods. A state of emergency has been declared in six 
southern states following severe flooding along the course of the Orinoco 
river caused by heavy rains. Worst affected is the state of Amazonas, where 
40,000 Indians, mostly Yanomamis, Yekwanas and Guajibos, have been forced to 
leave their river-side villages and are now dependent on provisions 
airlifted in by military helicopters.
  The authorities are warning that the greatest danger to the local 
population may come after the floods recede, when conditions will be ripe 
for malaria and hepatitis epidemics.

 REGION/Mercosur talks. At a meeting in Caracas the trade ministers of the 
Andean countries agreed to collectively negotiate trade liberalisation with 
the Mercosur countries, following moves by Bolivia to seek closer commercial 
ties with the Mercosur at the end of June.

 Peru, which has already begun talks with Mercosur, confirmed that it will 
remain a member of the Andean Community, and trade and industry minister 
Liliana Canale announced proposals to harmonise the group's tariff 
structure, which at present Peru considers too complicated.

ACTIVITIES AT MEGAWATI"S PDI HQ SUSPENDED 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Activities at Megawati
Sukarnoputri's new party headquarters in East Jakarta were suspended
at 11:20 a.m. Friday.

    A statement posted at the headquarters' gate said activities
will remain suspended until the party obtains permission to use the
office from the mayor of East Jakarta.

    The statement, signed by Tarto Sudiro, an executive of
Megawati's faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), also
said that matters regarding the new headquarters are being handled
by their lawyers.

    Megawati, who was ousted as PDI chairman in a congress in Medan,
North Sumatra, last June, has set up the East Jakarta headquarters
barely two weeks ago.

    Her faction occupied the party headquarters in Central Jakarta
before supporters of the rival faction, led by newly installed PDI
chairman Soerjadi, took over on July 27.

    The violent takeover sparked riots which according to the
National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) left  five dead and
more than a hundred injured.

    On Monday, the mayor of East Jakarta, Lt Col Sudarsono, ordered
Megawati to close down the headquarters by Thursday afternoon,
citing complaints from the local community that it was set up in a
residential area.

    However, Sudarsono on Thursday extended the deadline by 24
hours.

    One of Megawati's lawyers, Pontas Nainggolan, has said that they
were meeting officials of the mayor's office Thursday afternoon to
discuss the deadline's extension.

PRESIDENT ASKS PPP TO GROOM ITS CADRES 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - President Soeharto said on Friday
that the United Development Party (PPP) should concentrate in
consolidating its position by grooming party cadres to address
future challenges.

    Future challenges require the party to groom its cadres, PPP
chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum quoted the head of state as saying.

    Ismail met the president to discuss among others matters related
to the 1997 general elections.

    The president has once asked the National Defence and Security
Council (Wanhankamnas) to draft procedures for organising political
campaigns to ensure that they do not cause any negative impact.

    He also reminded the three political parties --the PPP, the
ruling Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)-- not to use
the campaigns as a "show of force" as this could only lead to
clashes.

    The political parties will contest 425 seats in the 500-seat
Parliament next year.  The remaining 75 seats are reserved for the
Armed Forces (ABRI), whose members do not vote for any of the three
parties.

    Metareum said his party agrees to the holding of dialogue-based
campaigns without leaving out mass-based campaigns.

    The PPP chairman also said that 60 percent of their candidates
for parliament are neophytes.

    Earlier, the president also received ulemas from Jakarta and its
environs grouped in the Ulemas Forum.

    The president expressed gratitude to the ulemas for their
support for his leadership.

    "I only want to devote my life in the interests of the nation
and the state.  May Allah allow this," he said.

    He also reiterated that differences in opinion in a democratic
society are natural and that these differences should be solved
through deliberations to reach an agreement.

    "Go ahead with your arguments at the forum," he said.

INDONESIA"S PUBLIC HEALTH RATES LOWEST AMONG ASEAN COUNTRIES 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sep 27 (ANTARA)-  Health Minister Sujudi  admitted
Friday that public health conditions in Indonesia rate the lowest
among ASEAN member countries.

    The fact should spur the country's medical community to do their
utmost to improve  public health services, he said.

    "The Health Ministry has been striving to improve the conditions
of public health by providing  relevant infrastructure facilities,
medical equipment and
improving health conditions all over the country," said Sujudi after
installing nine senior ministry officials in  new posts.

    He said the country was still facing various challenges in the
health sector, among other things, the task of raising the
life-expectancy of Indonesians from 62.7 years in the Fifth
Five-Year Development Plan to 73 years at  the end of the second
long-term development cycle.

    The government was also encouraging efforts to lower
the infant mortality rate from 58 per one thousand of born babies to
only 25 per one thousand  and the  maternity death rate from 390 per
100,000 deliveries  to only 200, he said.

    Indonesia's present life-expectancy of 62.7 years was also still
the lowest among ASEAN countries such as the Philippines (66.5),
Thailand (71.3), Malaysia (72.6), Brunei (76) and Singapore (77.1),
he noted

    The country's current maternity death  rate of 390 per 100,000
deliveries  was still high compared with the Philippines (250),
Thailand (180), Malaysia (120), Brunei (15) and Singapore (14), the
minister further said.

    Sujudi said that malaria, diarhea, tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS
were among the diseases requiring particular attention to improve
the health conditions of mothers and their babies.

    "But the most important thing is making  all the people
understand that the improvement of public health is the
responsibility of all," he said.

OPERATIONS AGAINST ILLEGAL FIHSING TO BE INCREASED 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Indonesian Armed Forces Commander
General Feisal Tanjung said here on Friday operations to fight
illegal fishing in the country's waters will be increased.

    He said the operations would be stepped up even though the armed
forces had no plan to acquire more ships.

    Tanjung said the endurance, expertise and equipment of the
country's fishermen had to be improved so that they could fish up to
the Exclusive Economic Zone.

    He said the armed forces would take stern actions against any
poacher or individual suspected of protecting illegal fishing.

TELKOM CONCLUDES CONTRACT WITH LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR EQUIPMENT SUPPLY 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

     Bandung, Sept 27 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia's state-owned
international telecommunications operator PT Telkom announed in New
York Friday it concluded a contract worth 22.7 million dollars with
Lucent Technologies for expanding the firm's data communication
network and services for business customers.

     Telkom's public relations chief T Hedi Safina said the state
company also announced details of phase II covering its strategic
partnership with Lucent Technologies to assist the entire plan of
building the world class telecommunications network in Indonesia by
year 2000.

     He said Telkom also announced a data network expansion and plan
for 1997 covering a unique partnership in the form of knowledge
transfer with Lucent Technologies during its financial roadshow by
Telkom's president to New York, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, London
and Boston, for the dissemination of information on the latest
development of Telkom to the international financial community.

     Indonesia with a telephone density rate of about 1.4 for every
100 people, planned to expand the existing telephone network by the
installation of at least another five million lines during the
implementation of its telecommunication development program in the
current Sixth National Development ending in 1999.

     Telkom's president AA Nasution said the telecommunications
industry in Indonesia has been growing very rapidly.

     Therefore, in view of the development and continuation of
deregulations in Indonesia's telecommunications industry and the
mounting competition, one of the most important things Telkom should
do was to promote the management of networks and capacity of the
subscriberes, he said.

     The knowledge transfer program is a combination between formal
training in the classroom, practice and the facilities of Lucent
Technologies and AT & T in the United States, with the support of
training in Indonesia.

     The experts of Lucent Technologies and AT&T will cooperate with
the management and staff of Telkom in sharing knowledge and
experience.

     Meanwhile, vice president of International Services of Lucent
Technologies Greg Hughes said Telkom wished to achieve a world class
operational standard to support the development of its networks.

     The knowledge transfer program was already started in April
1996, and by the end of this year the management and staff of Telkom
will finalize several parts of the program, Hedi Safina said.

INDONESIA"S FRUIT IMPORTS THREE TIMES ITS FRUIT EXPORTS 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Bogor, W Java, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Indonesia imports an average
of 112,000 tons of fruits worth US$7.83 million every year or three
times the value of its fruit exports which totals only US$2.6
million a year, an expert said.

    The wide discrepancy between imports and exports should  prompt
the country to spur and step up  horticultural production, Rector of
the Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB) Prof Dr Soleh Solahuddin
said here Friday.

    The rector made the remarks at the signing of a cooperation
agreement between IPB and PT Mekar Unggul Sari, the company running
the Mekar Sari national horticultural garden at Cileungsi, West
Java.

    According to Solahuddin, the cooperation was also expected to
improve the national agricultural image in  global trade.

    "The declining national agricultural image must be elevated
through  modern agricultural development," he added.

    Solahuddin also pointed out that despite its richness in fruits,
Indonesia was lagging behind other countries in  fruit cultivation
due among other things to its limited capability to produce superior
seeds.

    Meanwhile, President Director of PT Mekar Unggul Sari Siti
Hutami on the occasion expressed the hope that the cooperation could
improve the quality of local fruits so that they could compete with
those produced by other countries.

EMBASSY SUPPORTS IDEA TO FORM FORMER U.S. VISITORS FORUM 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Medan, N Sumatra, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta
supports a proposal to use the U.S. International Visitors Program
(IVP) in Medan as a forum for Indonesian young professionals who
once visited the U.S., a U.S. diplomat said.

    The idea of forming an association of Indonesian young
professionals who once visited the U.S. was very good because it
would re-open contacts among the IVP participants in the region or
between them and members of the U.S. community they used to know,
Second Secretary at the U.S. Embassy Shawn Dorman said here Friday.

    Dorman was here along with U.S. State Department  official for
Indonesian affairs Lucy Abbott for a meeting  with a number of
former Indonesian visitors to the U.S. at the building of the
Indonesia-America Friendship Association (PPIA).

    IVP is a program for the exchange of professionals, which is
managed by the education and cultural affairs agency of the U.S.
Information Center. It invites members of the international
community to come the U.S. every year.

    On the occasion, Dorman also promised to deliver the hope of
Executive Director of PPIA's Medan chapter Jasamin Saragih to
relevant U.S. officials in Jakarta who were expected to attend the
inaugurating ceremony of IVP in Medan in the near future.

    In 1995, the U.S. government invited at least 16 Indonesians
with different educational and professional backgrounds, including
journalists and intellectuals to make a month-long tour of the U.S.

    According to reports from an association of international
visitors to Los Angeles (IVCLA), the 16 Indonesians were among 1000
IVP participants from across the world.

    The IVP participants every year had the opportunity to visit Los
Angeles during their tour of America, IVCLA's honorary chairman
Richard J Riordan said.

    Riordan pointed out that the 16 Indonesians along with other IVP
participants from 140 countries in the U.S. were expected to know
more about the life of U.S. urban people and U.S. urban
environmental innovation programs.

    IVCLA's executive director Janet Elliot said her side expected
that the IVP participants would maintain the good relations of
friendship with the American people they had become acquainted with.

    During their stay in the U.S., the Indonesian IVP participants
discussed various matters with U.S. officials, non-government
organizations and members of local communities.

INDONESIA"S CONSTRUCTION SECTOR TO FACE CHALLENGES ON GLOBAL MART 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Yogyakarta, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Indonesia's construction sector
will  face special challenges in the structural and engineering
aspects on the global market, a researcher said.

    Foreign investment in the construction sector in the country has
also been increasing since the construction industry was opened to
foreign investors in 1992, lecturer and researcher at the Technical
Faculty of the Atma Jaya University in Yogyakarta Peter F Kaming, M
Eng., Ph.D said on Friday.

    Kaming made the remarks in his speech on Indonesia's  human
resource development in the face of construction industry challenges
on the occasion of the 31st anniversary of Atma Jaya University.

    According to Kaming, foreign investors in the construction
sector entered Indonesia due among other things to the presence of
their partners in other sectors, who needed building facilities like
warehouses and factories.

    He further said Indonesia should follow other ASEAN member

countries like Singapore which had no natural resources but  were
aware of the importance of  human resources development in their
economic development.

    He therefore hoped  that Indonesia could take further advantage
of the cooperation with other ASEAN members in  the interest of
national economic development.

    He also pointed out that in macro terms , AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade
Area) would give mutual advantages to its  member countries but in
micro terms , it would be an arena of competition among them.

    Kaming likewise hoped Indonesia would not become an object in
the "zero game" because it would then only be a loser.

PNG AGREES TO SETTING UP OF BORDER CHECKPOINTS 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Manokwari, Sept 27 (ANTARA) - Papua New Guinea (PNG) has agreed
to an Indonesian proposal for either side to set up a checkpoint for
traffic across their common border, according to an Indonesian
official who attended recent Indonesia-PNG border talks.

    The border talks took place aboard a ship, the Ciermai, last
Tuesday,  Indonesia's border liaison official FX Suryanto Sriwardoyo
told ANTARA Friday.

    He said  the two checkpoints would be set up at spots on the
border between Indonesia's Jayapura district  and PNG's province of
Sandau.

    He said Indonesia would build the checkpoint in its region while
the other one in PNG would be built by the PNG government.

    He said it was hoped by the two governments that the two
checkpoints would facilitate across-the-border visits by their
citizens and trade between their peoples.

    During the meeting, Indonesia also asked the PNG to immediately
realize its plan to build a road between Vanimo  and Sandaun.

    Suryanto said Indonesia had already built a 75- kilometer road
from Jayapura to the border.

    Indonesia was expecting the PNG to finish a remaining stretch of
1.5 kilometers of road from Wutung that would l connect the two
countries, he said.

    Regarding the question of around 3,000 Irian Jayan border
crossers in PNG's Is Awin detention camp, Suryanto said their return
would depend on the PNG government.

    Last year it was the UNHCR that handled their return but now
after the UN body had closed its office in PNG, the repatriation was
not running smoothly.

    The Indonesian government in Irian Jaya had already declared its
preparedness to receive the repatriates any time, he said.
     According to Suryanto, the  UNHCR had closed its representative
office in PNG because the cases it dealt with so far were mere

border crosser problems.

    Regarding the extradition or deportation of Irian Jaya security
distrubing gang (GPK) members who are still in PNG, Suryanto said
that the issue would be discussed by the Indonesian ministry of
justice with its PNG counterpart.

Chairman of the Australia-Indonesia Association (AIA) in Canberra in
an election for a new board for the 1996-1997 term in the presence
of Indonesian Ambassador to Australia W. Wiryono on Friday night.

    AIA is one of the seven Australia-Indonesia social organizations
affiliated to the Indonesia - Kindred - Associations (IKA) Forum.

    The non-profit organization was set up in 1965 by Prof Heinnz

    AIA Canberra has a membership of more than 100 families,
individuals and students.

    This non-political social organization held classes about
Indonesia, bahasa Indonesia dialogue groups on a routine basis,
showed Indonesian films, organized recreations and training in
Indonesian traditional arts, including gamelan, followed by the
young people of both countries, in addition to other social

GOVT CONTROL STILL NEEDED IN FOOD, BEVERAGE TRADE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sep 27 (ANTARA)- The food and beverage trade in

Indonesia still needs a measure of governmental control to ensure
smooth and even distribution,  a trade  spokesman said here on
Friday.

    Thomas Darmawan, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Food
and Beverage Traders (GAPMI), said  governmental  intervention was
still needed to overcome  difficulties food and beverage businessmen
were encountering in the marketing of their products all over the
country.

    He also said certain agricultural products should be subject to
a government-controlled collection and distribution system to ensure
their continuous availability and their prices' stability.

    Citing rice as an example, Darmawan said  governmental control
on trade in this commodity was necessary to guarantee sufficient
supply and proper distribution.

    Keeping food available to people throughout the country at
affordable prices was in the interest of the success of national
development , he said.
      According to Darmawan, the application of governmental
controls to the food and beverage trade was common in foreign
countries such as Australia and some  European countries.

    "In  Australia there is an Apple Board and farmers' associations
for other products," said Darmawan who is also chairman of the
Indonesian Communication Forum on Food.

    The main function of farmers' associations was to maintain
balance between supply and demand so that farmers would always have
reasonable selling prices, he said.

    Indonesian food producers should learn a good lesson from the
implementation of trading schemes in other countries, he said.

    In addition to the exhibition, the participants will also have
the opportunities to hold business contacts with their Chinese
counterparts, said Moeffreni.

    He further said that the Indonesian Opportunities '96 is the
realization of the willingness of Indonesian business circles to
promote their products in the Chinese market.

    Following the opening of the exhibition on Thursday, three
memorandums of understanding (MOU's) have been signed by Indonesian
and Chinese businessmen.

    PT Citra Lamtoro Gung and Zhanjiang Expressway Corp. on Thursday

    Another Indonesian company, PT Sucofindo and its Chinese
counterpart also signed an MOU to establish cooperation in control
and monitoring of export goods.

    Data from the Indonesian embassy show that trade balance between
Indonesia and China from January to July this year reached a total
of US$1.86 billion in favour of Indonesia.

    During that period, Indonesia exported various non-oil/gas

MILY COMMANDER: IRIAN JAA GPK LEADER KILLS FOUR HOSTAGES 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jayapura, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Major General Johny Lumintan, the
VIIIth (Trikora) Military Regional commander, has accused Thadius
Yogi, leader of the Irian Jaya touble maker group (GPK Irja) of
killing four people who had been held hostage.

    Maj Gen Lumintang has blamed Yogi for the four deaths in two
separate recent hostage cases in the province.

    The four hostages killed by the GPK leader were Navy Panekenan
and Matheus Lasamahu in Mapnduma, and Tumaji and Maksum, workers of
logging company PT Kamundan Raya.

    In January the GPK Irja took 26 people, including seven
Europeans, hostage in central Irian Jaya.

    They released one foreigner and 14 of the Indonesian hostages.
The remainder escaped in May following a rescue operation launched
by units of the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI), during which two
Indonesian hostages were killed.

    An armed group kidnapped 16 workers of a logging company, also
in central Irian Jaya, on August 14.

    Fourteen of the hostages were either released or escaped their
captors but two of the hostages were found dead in the jungle on
September 16 with ABRI saying their bodies had wounds indicating
torture and slaughter.

    Troops clashed with the armed group last month, during which one
of the captors, identified as Pius Orok Yane Magai Yogi, was shot
dead. The ABRI claimed then that the dead Yogi was the leader of the
group.

    Lumintang said that Yogi was responsible for the four deaths,
although in the first hostage case, the military have said that the
GPK kidnappers were headed by a man identified as Kelly Kwalik.

    He did not elaborate but said that the ABRI units would continue
to hunt down GPK members in Irian Jaya.

    Central Irian Jaya, the site of the hostage dramas, is covered
by mountainous jungles and experiences heavy rainfall and
temperatures as low as ten degrees Celcius.

EAST JAKARTA MAYOR SEALS MEGAWATI"S PARTY HQ 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - The East Jakarta Municipality
authorities here on Friday afternoon sealed the new headquarters of
ousted leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) Megawati
Sukarnoputri at Jalan Raya Tengah No. 1, Condet, Pasar Rebo in East
Jakarta.

    Tens of officials, accompanied by stick-wielding policemen, put
notices on the front gate and door of the building, declaring the
premises sealed by the order of the Mayor of East Jakarta,
Sudarsono.

    "It is now closed down and there should be no activities here
pending negotiations between city authorities and (the Megawati)
side," said Rajak Gogi, the head of East Jakarta's law and order
department, who led the team that closed the building.

    The notices said that the closure was based on a law forbiding
offices in residential areas, and warned of legal action against
anyone attempting to break the seal.

    Sudarsono earlier this week sent a letter to Megawati ordering
her to "immediately close down" the new party headquarters, saying
it breaches a government decree against using "residential homes as
offices for business purposes."

    Megawati, the daughter of the late President Sukarno, opened the
office Sept 9 in the East Jakarta suburb of Pasar Rebo, to replace
the party's main headquarters in downtown Jakarta after it was
seized on July 27. The seizure triggered widespread riots, the worst
in 22 years.

    Meanwhile, Haryanto Taslam, an official of the Megawati faction,
said that the party executives will continue with their task.

    Another Megawati ally, Mangara Siahaan, said they already had an
alternative headquarters but declined to give further details.

FOREIGN NURSING ACADEMIES STILL NOT ALLOWED IN INDONESIA 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Banjarmasin, S Kalimantan, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Foreigners are
still not allowed to establish paramedic academies in the country so
that existing paramedics need for the time being not worry about
foreign competition, a government health official said.

    But Dr Hadisantoso, head of the Health Ministry's Paramedic
Education Center, also said by year 2003 the situation would be
different and Indonesian paramedics should therefore use the interim
period to improve their professional capabilities.

    Hadisantoso was speaking at a workshop organized by
Muhammadiyah Nursing Academy here.

    He said  foreigners would be allowed to set up nursing academies
in Indonesia only after year 2003 when the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) would begin. The country's doors to free trade would be
further opened in 2010 for other countries in Asia and the Pacific
and in 2010 to all other countries in the world, he said.
     In view of the foreign competition due to be encountered in the
not so distant future, all health educational institutions in the
country should create more medical attendants of good quality from
now,  he added.

    According to Hadisantoso, the Health Ministry had also made
efforts to improve the quality of paramedics in the country through
among other things the holding of courses and workshops.

AIR FORCE CHIEF: PURCHASE OF F-16S STILL INDECISIVE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Solo, C Java, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Air Force Chief of Staff Vice
Marshal Sutria Tubagus said the United States government has not
decided whether or not to sell nine of its F-16s to Indonesia,
because the US Congress was still discussing the matter.

    "However, whatever their decision on the sale of the F-16s,

which costs nine million US dollars per plane, it would be no
problem for Indonesia, because Indonesia still have a choice for
other equally powerful aircraft," he said when installing young air
force officers in Solo Saturday.

    Indonesia chose these fourth generation F-16s because of their
technology, he said.

    Indonesia, he added, became more confident in  the F-16s because
some other Asean member countries were also using these aircraft and
appeared to be satisfied with their potentials.  And in case repair
was needed, Indonesia would always be able to ask for assistance
from the other Asean member countries, he said.

    If the government has the money and the purchase of the F-16s
has to be cancelled, Indonesia could always turn to the French
Mirage-2000s jet fighters, he said.

    In the meantime, he added, Indonesia has purchased Adhock 100
and 200 aircraft, which will undergo a trial flight on the occasion
of the 51st anniversary of the Indonesian Armed Forces on October
25.

    The new jet fighters were to replace aging aircraft.  Indonesia
has now two squadrons of Adhock 100 and 200 jet planes and one
squadron of F-16s.

    The purchase of these aircraft was actually under the third
five-year program, while the first five-year program covered the
preparation of all the aircraft of the air force, and the second
five-year program was aimed at increasing the potential of the
existing squadrons according to standard, and in the next five years
new planes would be purchased.

    The newly-installed air force officers, he said, were expected
to become reliable personnel in facing the rapid progress of the
time.

BATAM AUTHORITY ISSUES RULINGS ON HOUSE OWNERSHIP FOR FOREIGN NATIONALS 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Batam, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Research and Technology Minister as
Chairman of the Batam Authority BJ Habibie  has signed a decision on
house ownership for foreign nationals on Batam Island.

    "I have just signed the decision and it goes into effect as of
now," Habibie, who is also head of the Agency for Assessment and
Application of Technology, said in Nongsa Point Marina, Batam,
Saturday.

    The occasion was also attended  by Indonesian Ambassador to
Singapore HBL Mantiri, Tourism Director General Andi Mappisameng,
and business tycoon Ciputra as well as a number of Singapore
businessmen.

    Habibie said foreign nationals, wherever they came from, Asia or

Europe, were allowed to own a home of their own on Batam Island,
providing they worked in Batam according to the regulations, in
possession of a smart card, and were members of a golf club in the
area.

    The property they may own were houses in resort areas,
condominiums, luxury houses in real estates each worth at least Rp
200 million with a 70-year lease.

    Habibie said the decision was not a solution to the gloom in the
property sector on Batam Island, but a follow up of Government
Regulation Number 41 of 1996 on the right of foreigners to own a
house in Indonesia.

    Developers on Batam island would become encouraged and enjoy the
fruits of the regulation.

    Meanwhile, First Assistant to the Batam Authority Chief Gunawan
Hadisoesilo said on a separate occasion that the decision was
applicable on Batam Island only, and the foreign nationals wishing
to have such property did not necessarily have to be actually
staying in Indonesia.

    By owning a house in Batam, he added, a foreigner would come to
Batam much more often, which may encourage growth of other sectors,
while the government would receive one percent of the sale of each
house.

    Habibie also said the Batam Authority would go on with its plan
to build infrastructure projects, including the Asia Port in Kabil.

    Besides YTL from Malaysia, Indoport from the United Kingdom
signed a contract on the building of a US$ 900 million container
terminal in Kabil on the basis of the BOT (build, operate and
transfer) basis for 60 years.

    The British investor will build the terminal in stages with a
capacity for 2.5 million TEUS from 1997 to 1999, and with an
increase of 1.8 million TEUS in 2000.  Along with YTL, the terminal
would have a capacity for 15.4 million TEUS by the year 2000s.

    Habibie said Asia Port has bright prospects, because
containerized goods for export would continue to increase sharply,
not to mention containers coming from other countries.

GOVT TARGETS READYING OF 20,000 HA OF PEATLAND IN 1996/97 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Bogor, West Java, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - The government has targeted
the preparation of  20,000  hectares of peatland in Central
Kalimantan for rice farming in the 1996/1997 budget year, Public
Works Minister Radinal Moochtar said here Saturday.

    The 20,000 hectares would be part of the government's
one-million-hectare peatland conversion project in Central
Kalimantan province, the minister said.

    Speaking to reporters  after attending  a seminar organised by

the Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB) here over the weekend,
Moochtar said since work was begun on the project last February,
2,000 hectares of the peatland had been cleared for rice planting.
     He said  to meet the 20,000-hectare target in 1996/1997, an
average of 70 hectares of the peatland per day had to be cleared,
adding that the work required much manpower and heavy-duty
equipment.
     The minister said the project also included the building of an
irrigation system.  So far, 175 km of secondary and 500 km of
primary irrigation canals had been  created.

    The minister also said removing logs and roots from  the
peatland  was one of the most difficult parts of the clearing work.

    "We want the farmers who will grow the rice to receive the land
in ready-to-use state,"  he said, adding each farming family would
be given two hectares to cultivate.
     The farmers would be people from outside Kalimantan who had
agreed to be resettled under the government's transmigration scheme.

     But before being moved to the peatland project, they would
receive training in peatland farming methods since they had never
worked peatland before. IPB would contribute instructors for the
training.

    The minister said experts from IPB were also involved in the
preparation of a report on the environmental impact of the national
project.

ABILIO: DISCUSSION OF E. TIMOR ISSUE POSTPONED BECAUSE PORTUGAL IS AFRAID 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

     Dili, E Timor, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - East Timor Governor Abilio
Jose Osorio Soares said the postponement of the talks on the East
Timor issue in the 51st General Assembly session of the United
Nations increasingly indicated that Portugal was afraid of solving
the problem of the land that it has dominated for 450 years.
    "It is actually in the interest of Portugal to postpone the
talks on the East Timor issue, otherwise 'he' would certainly lose,"
the governor told the press on the postponement of the talks, after
closing a Golkar working conference in Dili on Saturday.
    "We can draw a conclusion that the postponement of the talks was
because Portugal was afraid it would lose in a voting in the United
Nations," he said.
    A solution to the issue at an international forum could be
reached through other means, such as through a tripartite meeting
between the Indonesian and Portuguese foreign ministers under the
auspices of the United Nations Secretary General.

    However, if some day all countries would force a discussion of
the East Timor issue at the UN General Assembly, that would be the
time when Portugal can no longer refuse.
    The countries which have always abstained, should urge Portugal
to immediately accept the matter to be taken up at the UN General
Assembly for a solution, he said.
    The postponement was announced by a Dutch diplomat, Aryan P
Hamburger, at the General Affairs Committee session on September 18
discussing the agenda of the 51st UN General Assembly.
    The idea on the postponement was supported by the Philippine
Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Felipe H
Mabilangan.  With no other delegates responding, the Committee
decided to postpone the talks on the East Timor issue and entered it
in the interim agenda of next year's UN General Assembly.
    Talks on the issue at the UN General Assembly have been
postponed 14 times since the subject was raised in 1983.
    Meanwhile, East Timor House Speaker Antonio Freitas Parada said
it would be useless to discuss the subject at the UN General
Assembly, because the integration of the former Portuguese colony
into the Republic of Indonesia has become a reality.
    Anti-integrationists abroad were only serving their sweet own
interest by using funds provided by non governmental organisations
in other countries to finance their activities, he said.
    Antonio pointed out that the most important thing for the people
of East Timor was to build the area with their own funds and forces.
    Other countries have become fed up with talking about the East
Timor issue, because in the 20 years of integration vast progress
has been made in the area, and in the welfare of the local
population.
    In the meantime, chairman of the East Timor chapter of the
ruling Golkar political party Armindo Soares Mariano said the party
wanted  an early settlement of the issue.  It would depend on the
Portuguese government, because it was them who made an issue out of
the integration in the first place, he pointed out.

TRADE WIND GROUP OF SAILBOATS EXPECTED IN KUPANG 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Some 40 foreign
sailboats  participating in a round-the-world voyage organized by
the Trade Wind Committee are expected to arrive here on October 3
for a three-day stop,  a spokesman for the local hosting committee
said.
     The group of sailboats with crew members totalling 150 people
began its journey at Gibraltar, south of Spain, last  October 23,
1995, according to Joseph Soenarto, a member of the hosting
committee, here Saturday.

    Most of the participants hailed from European countries and were
using British-registered boats, he said.

    From Gibraltar the group went westward and after   crossing  the
Atlantic Ocean  called at ports along the eastern parts of the
American continent until it sailed around the most southern tip of
South America to reach the Pacific.

    In the Pacific, the group made stops in Fiji, New Zealand and
Australia. It would arrive in Kupang from Darwin, Australia,
Soenarto said.

    The boats were scheduled to leave Darwin on Saturday and head
for Indonesia where after Kupang, they would also stop in Bali and
Jakarta before returning to Gibraltar.

    The journey would end in Gibraltar in October next year.

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Bandung, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Delegates from Asia, Africa and

children's rights to solve problems of children living in poverty
and to support education for peace and development using modern and
traditional media.

    The workshop participants also agreed to set up partnerships
among themselves to further develop programs for the welfare of
their peoples, children in particular.

ABRI CHIEF : "OTB" REFERS TO PKI"S POLITICAL STRATEGY 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 28 (ANTARA) - Armed Forces (ABRI) Chief General
Feisal Tanjung said here on Saturday the term "formless
organisation" (OTB) referred to the political strategy launched by
the outlawed Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) members rather than
to its semantic meaning.

    "It is therefore improper for a handful of people to ask for a
review of the term "OTB" from the standpoint of grammar," he told a
meeting  about the latent danger of communism among the younger
generation.

    If the term "OTB" was considered wrong from the standpoint of
grammar, this would only be logical as PKI members never knew how to
use the Indonesian language (Bahasa Indonesia) correctly and
properly, he said.

    The PKI members only knew how to use force and opportunities as
well as to overthrow colleagues and enemies, he said.

    The term "OTB" originated from the PKI members themselves
instead of government apparatuses or ABRI members, he said.

    "I seems that it is naive if some people have vilely responded
to the statement issued by the ABRI about the term "OTB" some time
ago, by saying that it was the ABRI which is the "OTB" or Omong
Tanpa Bukti (speaking without evidence)," he said.

    Quoting the ABRI's intelligence and socio-political analysis of
finds in several regions, Tanjung said PKI had metamorphosed.

    "To most experts in communist teachings, the metamorphosis is
not new because it is a built-in process. The built-in process and
classical style however have often made us inattentive and less
watchful," he said.

    The ABRI chief said the PKI members also knew well how to win
the public's sympathy through the so-called peaceful and human
propaganda.

    He said the former PKI members had neither permanent friends nor
permanent enemies. They only thought of how to satisfy their
interests.

    "To satisfy their interests, the former PKI members can do
whatsoever by, for instance, adopting attitudes down from
democrat-like attitude to violent, radical, uncivilized and inhuman
actions," he said.

    "Through the peaceful propaganda the PKI members have made a
number of survival attempts or activities in the last 30 years," he
said.

BALI ADM STILL PONDERING FEASIBILTY OF JAA-BALI BRIDGE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Denpasar, Bali, Sept 29 (ANTARA) - Bali's provincial

administration is still pondering the feasibility of  a Java-Bali
bridge and has yet to discuss the matter with the central
govertment, Bali Deputy Governor Ida Bagus Ardhana said here
Saturday.

    Ardhana, who is also chairman of Bali province's Regional
Development Planning Board (Bappeda), said the provincial
administration was considering the proposed Java-Bali bridge from
various aspects, namely  economic, environmental, infrastructural,
and also social and cultural.

    He said Bali's House of Representatives (DPRD) was doing
likewise with the help of inputs from  non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) , informal community leaders and various
concerned agencies.

    According to Ardhana, a preliminary study of the project's
feasibility was already made by a technical agency. "The Bali
administration will discuss the results of the study with its
counterpart in Java," he added.

    He said he believed a Java-Bali bridge would no doubt  smoothen
transportation of people and goods between the two islands.

    However, certain problems  needed to be resolved before the
bridge could actually be constructed.

    Among the problems was the fact that the capacity of Bali's land
transportation facilities were not matched to the normal traffic
flow from Java.

    "Road conditions in Bali should be improved to make them equal
to those in Java," he said.

    In Java, roads had already been made strong enough to
accommodate  containers which was not the case in Bali, he said.

    He also said the flow of people from Java would  become a
problem to the Bali administration if the bridge was realized.

    "Denpasar municipality and Badung district have a  higher
economic growth rate than Java because they have become tourist
destinations. Migration from Java will burden the two regions in
Bali," he added.

    If realised, the project on Bali's side would  be located in
Jembrana district, a region with a growth rate of only six percent,
the lowest among Bali's districts.  Bali's overall economic growth
rate was seven  percent per year during the last three five-year
development plans.

    "The low economic growth rate of Jembrana district has caused
small growth in jobs as well," he said, adding that the provincial
administration had had to enforce special  policies to help the
district's economic development.
     For instance, the provincial administration decided to stop
construction of new star-rated hotels in Badung district and
Denpasar in an effort to divert investors in the hotel industry to
Jembrana district.

    He said  the Bali administration had also developed five tourism
destinations in Jembrana. Jembrana, according Ardhana, had now
become a location for development of medium-scale industries.

MINISTER: TALKS ON ENVIRONMENTAL TAX ALREADY DONE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Denpasar, Sept 29 (ANTARA) - State Minister of Environment
Sarwono Kusumaatamadja has said there have already been talks
between his office and the directorate general of tax and excises
about the proposed environmental tax for motor vehicles.

    "We have discussed about the issue with that directorate
general," he said here over the weeken.

    Sarwono made the statement in response to the wish for the
imposition of environmental tax for motor vehicle as expressed by
Bali Governor Ida Bagus Oka at the inaugural ceremony of the first
liquified petroleum gas station in the attendance of Mines and
Energy Minister IB Sidjana on the resort island Saturday.

    According to him, his side was waiting for the proposal
currently being processed at the ministry of mines and energy.

    Prior to the imposition of the tax, people should first get
information on alternatives of fuel oil which is not difficult to
get in the country which is rich in energy, he said.

    By providing the people with various energy alternatives, the
government could then impose a progressive tax which on the other
hand  also provides incentive for users of environmentally-friendly
energy resources.

    In Jakarta around 700 taxi cabs have been using LPG fuel.

    The minister said by the end of the year around 20 new LPG
stations would be set up in the capital.

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Medan, Sept 29 (ANTARA) -- The Martabel dreamland in North
Sumatera currently under construction may become Indonesia's proud
in the international world.

    The mega project, the development of which was started in May
1996 in hilly and forested land near the Medan-Brastagi highway,
will have various sports facilities, including an international
standard 36-hole gold course, a dreamland, animal farm, water park,
cultural centre and 3,000 villas.

    This was said by head of the project Irawan Tjandra when

on Sunday, in the presence of operational director Antona Dihardjo,
financial director Wahi Kartono and marketing director Gavin J.
Rostron.

    They said the project was being built with funds provided by the
business community in North Sumatera under the coordination of North
Sumatera Governor Raja Inal Siregar and Irawan Tjandra.

    The investment in the project built in stages on 1,000 ha of
land and scheduled for completion in eight years, amounted to Rp 250
billion.

    In the first stage of the realisation of the project, according
to the operational and marketing directors, an 18-hole golf course
was being built under the supervision of Grantham Golf Construction
of the united States.

    The gold course, built on green hills with a number of man-made
lakes, is slated for completion in May 1997, but only with nine
holes.

    The building would then be continued with 18 holes designed by
world gold legend Greg Norman, which could be used for international
tournaments.

    The construction of the golf course to be named Martabe
Sejahtera Golf Club (MSGC) will be funded by the 250 founding
members each of whom with a shareholding of Rp 60 million.

    The next stage will be the building of a dreamland like the one
in Ancol, Jakarta, on 30 ha of land, an animal breeding farm on 100
ha, and a water park.

    Very specific buiildings in the Martabe dreamland include a park
for people of advance age and a cultural park with traditional
miniature houses of all parts of Indonesia.

    Also to be built in the complex are 3000 villas of standard
type, and 50 exclusive ones respectively on 5000 and 10,000 square
meters of land.

    Upon completion, Martabe may become the largest of its kind in
Indonesia encompassing sport and recreational facilities, a
dreamland and animal farm.

    "The dreamland will become one of the most comprehensive tourist
destination for foreign tourists visiting North Sumatera, and
another pride for Indonesia besides the one in Jakarta," Antona
Dihardja said.

    Meanwhile, the Malaysian businessmen, led by Datuk Lim Liong
Sek, they were very keen in becoming members of the Martabe
Sejahtera Gold Club as one of the concrete realisations of the
northern growth triangle involving Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.

     In the course of the seminar, businessmen from Tianjin, an

important seaport for exports and imports, said they wish to
establish cooperation in the building of roads and ports.

relationship between their city and a seaport city in Indonesia,

services displayed on the occasion by the private company PT Narofel

businessmen were interested included fruits, textile (polyester),
rattan and wooden furniture, and even dried cassava represented in
the fair by the Hasanuddin cooperative society from South Sulawesi.

     Meanwhile, chief organizer Budi Moeffreni of PT Indo Asean
Persada said on a separate occasion that Indonesia Opportunities 96
has really become a national pride.

were reflected in the numerous wreaths expressing congratulations
from local leading business people.

     At least five memoranda of understanding have been signed
during the occasion, including two on big business deals between PT
Citra Lamtoro Gung and Guangdong on the construction of a 166-km
toll road with an investment of Rp 913 billion, and between the

Import and Export Commodities Inspection Corp. (CCIC).

of cement factories, both in China and in Indonesia (two plants).

     The Chinese, Budi said, wished Indonesia to hold such trade
fairs on a regular basis to introduce Indonesia's trade potentials
to the Chinese business community.

     For promotional purposes, PT Indo Asean Persada signed a
cooperation agreement for the dissemination of information about the
Indonesian business world by a local media in 25 million copies of
its publication.

17 RESCUED AFTER INDONESIAN VESSEL SINKS OFF MALAYSIA 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Penang, Malaysia, Sept 29 (ANTARA) - Seventeen Indonesian crew
were rescued  by local fishermen Sunday after their cargo vessel
sank during a storm off  Malaysia's northern island of Penang late
Friday.

    Police said a trawler found the Indonesians clinging to two
rafts made  from lifebuoys, plastic water bottles and life jackets,
at 2 a.m. Sunday  (1800 GMT Saturday), several miles off Penang
island.

    On reaching the island, the crew, aged 17 to 42 years, were
taken to the  police district headquarters to alert the authorities
who had already resumed their search at daybreak Sunday.

    District police chief superintendent Tan Seng Eng said all the
crew had  been accounted for after earlier reports said there were
18 on board.

    More than 60 rescuers and five marine police patrol boats were
engaged in the search for the crew and the 300-tonne ship, the KM
Kurnia Abadi. The ship has yet to be located.

    The vessel, which was transporting timber, left northern Sumatra
in Indonesia Thursday and was scheduled to dock at Penang port
Friday night.

    A distress signal was sent late Friday to the shipping agent in
Penang.

    Search efforts were hampered by rough seas and lack of
information on the  exact location of the vessel.

MEGAWATI TO SUE E JAKARTA ADMI FOR CLOSING NEW HQ 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Ousted chairwoman of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) Megawati Sukarnoputri on Monday said she will
file a lawsuit to protest the sealing off of her new headquarters by
the East Jakarta mayor.

    A lawyer representing Megawati said the suit could be filed at
the State Administrative Court (PTUN) as early as Monday.

    "The lawsuit could hopefully be filed at the PTUN by Monday,"
said Pantas Nainggolan, one of Megawati's lawyers.

    East Jakarta Mayor Sudarsono on Friday closed the new
headquarters of Megawati's faction of the PDI, citing violations on
residential zoning laws.

    Meanwhile, Haryanto Taslam, a member of the party executive
board, said they will continue with their daily activities in
another place.

    "We will start looking for a new headquarters and we will
announce it as soon as we find one," he said.

    The closure of the headquarters came exactly two months after
supporters of new PDI chairman Soerjadi forcibly took over the main
party headquarters in Central Jakarta on July 27.

    Nainggolan also disclosed plans to demand the closure of the

office of Soerjadi's faction in his residence.

    "We will urge the government to be consistent and close down
Soerjadi's office in his residence," Nainggolan said.

    Megawati's lawyers and supporters argued that the closure was
discriminatory because many homes in the Indonesian capital have
been converted into offices.

    Megawati was ousted from the PDI leadership in June by a party
congress held by the rival faction which elected Soerjadi as new
chairman.

    Her ouster triggered widespread protests which led to the July
27 riots after the raid on the PDI headquarters.

INDONESIA WILL OPPOSE NEW ISSUES AT WTO MEETING 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

     Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia will reject new issues
raised by industrial countries at the WTO ministerial meeting in
Singapore in December, Trade and Industry Minister Tunky Ariwibowo
said today.

     "We will reject discussion on new issues which might be brougt
by industrial nations, including multilateral agreement on
investment, labour standard, government purchases and the problem of
competition," Tunky told reporters after a meeting with President
Suharto.

     He said Indonesia will take a firm stand against discussing
these new issues, particularly when they are disfavouring the
country's national interest.

     Indonesia already has its own regulations on investment and
labour law which would not be sacrificed for the interest of the
planned multilateral agreement, he added.

     But Indonesia will participate in the discussion of all issues
already agreed upon at the Uruguay Round meeting in Marakesh two
years ago, Tunky said.

     He said Indonesian officials have been preparing necessary
materials to be brought to the Singapore meeting scheduled for mid
December.

     It would be the first WTO Ministerial meeting among trade and
economic minsters to be held, he said.

     He also reported to the President about his recent trip to
Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil and Mexico to
promote Indonesia's industrial products to the region.

     Tunky said Indonesia has been suffering a large trade deficit
against Latin American countries over the years.

     Last year Indonesia exported some US$525 million worth of
commodities to 12 Latin American countries while its imports from
that region reached about US$1 billion, he said.

     Indonesia needs to intensify its trade promotion to Latin

American countries to win more direct trading because many
Indonesian goods and products have entered their market via a third
countries, he said.

    He added that the great sale not only targets foreign visitors

since our products are just as competitive (as those found abroad),"
he said while observing the preparations for the great sale.

Surakarta and Mangkunegaran sultanate palaces and other public
places.

HAMID TURNS OVER TAPES OF PRD ACTIVISTS" SPEECHES TO ISLAMIC SCHOOL 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jombang, E Java, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Armed Forces (ABRI) chief of
social and political affairs, Lt Gen Syarwan Hamid, on Sunday turned
over to the Tebuireng Islamic boarding school cassette recordings of
speeches made by activists of the People's Democratic Party (PRD).

    The cassette tapes, received by school caretaker KH Yusuf
Hasyim, were meant to serve as a reminder of the atrocities of the
Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in their 1948 and 1965 revolts.

    Hamid said the speeches, delivered by PRD chairman Budiman
Sudjatmiko and Dita Indah Sari who are both under detention, reflect
the group's communist ideology.

    He called on the younger generations not to follow their
examples and instead increase their awareness of communist
activities to protect the country from the latent dangers of
communism.

    He noted that PKI remnants and the wide social gap in the
country could still lead to the revival of communism.

    Religious Affairs Minister Tarmizi Taher, who was also present,
urged Indonesian moslems to be vigilant of communist elements who
try to infiltrate religious groups.

    The government has blamed the PRD for inciting the July 27 riots
which rocked Jakarta, killing at least five and injuring scores of
others.

MPS CALLS FOR HALT TO OPENING OF TUNNEL NEAR AL AQSA MOSQUE 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - The House of Representatives (DPR)
on Monday urged Israel to halt the opening of a new archaeological
tunnel near Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, saying the move is hurting
the world Moslem community.

    "I am very concerned about the Israeli move because the Al Aqsa
Mosque is sacred to Moslems.  That is why I call on Israel to scrap
the move to open the new tunnel," Abu Hasan Sazili of the Functional
Group (Golkar) at the DPR said.

    He said Israel should be consistent with its previous commitment
to creating peace in the Middle East.

    "The world community will respect Israel, if the Benjamin
Netanyahu government refrains from such an arrogant and one-sided
action," he said.

    He also appealed to Arab countries to remain united in the face
of the Israeli move to open the new tunnel.

    Meanwhile, chief of the House Commission on foreign affairs,
information, defence and security, Aisyah Aminy, said the Israeli
move is inseparable from Netanyahu's policy.

    She said the Israeli prime minister has given priority to his
personal and group interests, while ignoring the peace agreement
reached by his predecessor and the Palestinian leadership.

    If the Netanyahu government is serious in creating peace, it
must halt the opening of the new tunnel, she said.

    She urged Israel to immediately take concrete steps to create
peace in the Middle East.

    "Peace should become the goal, otherwise there will never be
peace between Palestine and Israel and in the Middle East," she
said.

    Abu Hasan Sazili also appealed to the United States not to
defend Israeli interests.

    "The United States should not adopt double standards, where on
one hand it longs for peace in the Middle East, but on the other
hand continues to assist Israel in every international forum, such
as the United Nations," he said.

    Meanwhile, H Imam Churmen said the opening of the new tunnel is
not only the problem of Palestinians but also the global Moslem
community.

    "The Israeli government must know that the building is a sacred
place of worship for Moslems, Christians and other religious
followers.  It is only logical if the world community has seriously
responded to the opening of the tunnel and pressed for its halt,"
Churmen said.

    Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry on Friday issued a statement
strongly condemning the opening of the tunnel and the shooting of
Palestinians by Israeli troops.

    At least 53 Palestinians and 11 Israelis were killed in the
worst riots since the West Bank and Gaza came under Israeli
occupation in 1967.

    The statement calls for restraint from all sides in the conflict
and respect for existing peace agreements.

RIAU"S COAL RESOURCES ABLE TO GENERATE 1000 MW OF POWER 

from ANTARA The Indonesian National News Agency

    Pekanbaru, Riau, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - Riau has not only oil but
also coal resources which can generate thousand megawatts of
electricity, a Riau official has said.

    The head of the provincial mines office, Gaffar Siddik, said
here on Monday that survey results had revealed the presence of two
million tonnes of coal reserves in the Cerent area, Indragiri Hulu
district, which so far had not been exploited.

    "PT Tambang Batu Bara Bukit Asem (coal mining company) is at
present conducting surveys in this area and according to an original
plan a powerplant will be set up with a total capacity of 2 x 600
MW," Gaffar said.

    But there is also a possibility that the coal will be processed
for marketing abroad and that depends on the processor's calculation
whether it is more profitable to use the coal for power generating

or for marketing abroad, he added.

    According to the mines office chief, apart from PT Batu Bara
Bukit Asam, a Malaysian investor is also interested in utilizing the
coal in Cerenti for power generating.

    If the Malaysian side as well as PT Tambang Batu Bara Bukit Asem
are interested in conducting similar activities they can cooperate,
because according to plan the projected power plant will have a
total capacity of 2 x 600 Mw, and part of its production can be
exported to Malaysia, Gaffar said.

    Jakarta, Sept 30 (ANTARA) - President Soeharto called on the
management board of the 74-year old Taman Siswa educational
institution not to hesitate to set up cooperations with other bodies
to boost its development.

    The Ki Hajar Dewantara Foundation was formed to obtain financial
assistance for Taman Siswa.

    Soesilo, an alumnus of Taman Siswa who is now the coordinating
minister for political and security affairs, expressed concern that
the absence of significant improvement will make it difficult for
the institution to attract more students.

1996 Will Be A Good Year For Business In The Middle East

NICOSIA - The year ahead will be good for business as regional
economies, especially those of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC),
begin to re-emerge from under heavy burdens imposed by the Gulf
crisis. More Arab states will implement market-oriented
liberalisation measures.

Politically, 1996 will carry mixed blessings for the region, with
good and bad landmarks. Elections scheduled in the self-rule areas
of Palestine, Israel and Iran bear various elements of uncertainty.
Each of these polls will generate a different momentum, whether
positive or negative will depend on the outcome. With talks moving
forward on the Syrian-Israeli track, 1996 could mark the beginning
of a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace. The six GCC states will
continue to experience internal difficulties and tensions between
fellow-members. The situation in Saudi Arabia has improved. External
security for the GCC is guaranteed by the US. The possibility of the
UN lifting the embargo on Iraq - now in its fifth year - is remote
as US presidential electioneering gets into full swing in the autumn
(see Oil Market & Downstream Trends in this week's APS Review).

In North Africa, the struggle by governments against Islamic
militancy will continue, but the intensity will be less than in
recent years. The militants do not have the financial, military or
popular support required to overthrow regimes. Turmoil in the Red
Sea region and East Africa will also continue, amid military
hostilities between Yemen and Eritrea, while Sudan and Somalia sink
deeper into internal chaos - with Ethiopia not far behind.

Regional politics will become more complex. Questions such as border
disputes, water-sharing and trade imbalances will lead to a new set
of dynamics, some of which will be negative. The role of the US as
the main influence in the Middle East will remain unchanged, but not
unchallenged. The European Union (EU) will expand its linkages with
North Africa and the Mediterranean rim. Russia will be an
unpredictable factor, as the Communist Party has re-established
itself in that country; together with its leftist allies the party
is set to control 217 out of the 450 seats in the Duma following the
December elections.

The Turning Point

1996 will be decisive for the peace process, mainly because of what
it holds in store for Israel. General elections in the Jewish state
are scheduled for October, but with the government led by the Labour
Party having a majority of one in the Knesset, the polls may be
brought forward as early as May. A victory for the right-wing Likud
would mean disaster, with the party having pledged not to return the
Golan Heights to Syria. On the other hand, Premier Shimon Peres has
said he would not hold a referendum on returning the Golan, saying
the people can show their opinion in the general elections. Peres,
with strong US backing, wants to have a Declaration of Principles
with Syria before the elections. As an added incentive to the Arab
side, Peres on Dec. 22 said: "Give us peace and we will give up the
nuclear (option). If there is peace we would denuclearise the Middle
East". Rewards for what has been achieved have begun pouring into
Israel, which has seen a huge rise in foreign investment in 1995.
Yet Israeli society remains deeply divided about peace and its
implications as shown by the assassination of Premier Rabin in Nov.
1995.

Jordan now is a "most favoured" country in the Middle East for the
US and Israel. It is moving quickly to reap the rewards of peace.
The economic aspects of peace will bear fruit as from 1996. Jordan's
geo-strategic importance will increase as its shift away from the
regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq becomes clearer. Ties with Iran are
strained as well, with a recent tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats.

Lebanon will be ready to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1996, if
the latter is able to reach an agreement with Syria (see below).
Beirut is prepared to ensure calm in South Lebanon, with Syrian
help, and has said it is ready to deploy 25,000 soldiers there if
Israel withdraws from the "security zone". Its businessmen are the
ones best poised to take on the opportunities and competition that
would result from a peace treaty. Syria will continue to have a
guiding role over all affairs of importance in the country, taking
into account concerns about Lebanon's sovereignty expressed by
French Defence Minister Herve de Charette during a meeting with
Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam in Paris on Dec. 19, 1995.

Palestine, as a state, will not materialise in 1996 but key aspects
of statehood will be put in place. As self-rule spreads from the
Gaza Strip and Jericho to cover Tulkarem, Nablus, Qalqilya,
Bethlehem, Ramallah and other towns, a legislative council will be
elected on Jan. 20, 1996. Differences among Palestinian factions
will get narrower as the benefits of peace become more obvious (Vol.
43, 187-188). However, Arafat has denounced donor nations for
failing to keep aid promises; on Dec.18, he said that of $720m
promised only $120m was delivered. He was speaking on a tour of the
GCC states, which will boost funding to the Palestine National
Authority (PNA) in 1996, but not on the scale of the pre-Gulf crisis
era.

Syria holds the winning cards for 1996. With the latest initiative
for peace under a 10-point programme proposed by Peres, the US and
Israel have recognised Syrian control over Lebanon and Assad's
status as the key leader in the Arab World. In the small window of
opportunity available before Israeli elections, Assad would move to
ensure that Peres is re-elected premier in Israel. This could mean
an Israeli-Syrian Declaration of Principles in 1996, if Israel
agrees to pull out from the Golan in a limited time-frame. An Assad-
Peres summit, which "could take place in three to four months"
according to Israeli Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir,
would mark the start of a definitive peace between Syria and Israel.
Assad cannot afford to risk the alternative of peace in 1996, as
that would guarantee a Likud victory and isolation of Damascus by
Washington - perhaps by expanding the "dual containment" of Iran and
Iraq into a "triple containment" to include Syria. The peace process
will not survive such a scenario. An important goal for Assad is
"economic parity" with Israel.

Iran, which opposes the peace process, will be squeezed tighter by
the US in 1996. Prospects for an improvement in its economic
situation are slim. Parliamentary elections set for April-May 1996
appear likely to result in favour of hardline traditionalists who
are preparing a strong challenge against the pragmatists of
President Rafsanjani. The outcome of those elections will decide the
fate of the presidential polls in 1997, when Rafsanjani's final term
is to end. Tehran's regional ties are likely to get worse before
they get better, as countries neighbouring Iran build stronger ties
with the US. But Tehran is betting on a strategic alliance with
Moscow.

Iraq has no chance of getting the UN embargo lifted in 1996.
President Clinton will have no motivation to take such a risk in an
election year, and signs that Iraq has been trying to rebuild its
arsenal of long-range ballistic missiles will deter even those who
want sanctions lifted - like Russia, France, China and other
countries. The UN Special Commission's recent semi-annual report
took the US and British position that the embargo must remain in
force, because Iraq had not revealed all its secrets. On Dec. 21, UN
investigators found guidance systems for missiles of 3,000 km range
dumped in the Tigris River. US Ambassador to the UN Madeleine
Albright affirmed later that sanctions would be in place for a long
time to come. Yet chances of President Saddam Hussein being
overthrown are slim, despite regular reports of defections by army
officers. One way for Baghdad to get the embargo lifted would be to
indicate readiness to make peace with Israel, but Saddam is yet to
take this bait.

Turkey, having reached a customs union agreement with the EU in
December 1995, now faces a tough year ahead. The Islamic Refah Party
(RP) of Necmettin Erbakan won 21.32% of the votes in general
elections on Dec. 24, 1995, getting 158 of parliament's 550 seats.
Tansu Ciller, whose True Path Party came second with 135 seats,
resigned as prime minister and was soon talking of a coalition with
Mesut Yilmaz's Motherland Party (ANAP), which won 132 seats, and
other secular parties. Such a coalition would come under strong
pressure from RP, which is opposed to the EU agreement and many
other things. The elements of uncertainty were underlined on Dec. 22
when Chief of the General Staff, Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi warned
the Islamists: "The Turkish armed forces has adopted a contemporary,
democratic and secular outlook and is opposed to all kinds of
dogmatism and reactionary attitudes." In 1996, the next government
would have to deal with an estimated 100% inflation rate and strike
threats by public sector workers. Externally, such a government
would be less effective in dealing with Turkey's growing geo-
strategic worries arising from its role as a bridge between "oil-
rich" states in the Caspian Sea region and Europe. It will also have
to deal with the Arab League's Dec. 17 threat to take action against
Ankara if it refuses to discuss Euphrates water sharing with Syria.

GCC Complexities

That internal security is a big problem for the GCC was recognised
at their 16th annual summit in Muscat on Dec. 4-6, 1995. The summit
was marked by a rift between Qatar and other members which may widen
in 1996. Bahrain, affected by unrest since December 1994, would have
to move fast to adjust to the implications of the peace process. Its
role as an offshore banking centre is no longer secure, and an
underlying cause of the unrest was economic hardship faced by
Shiites in the emirate. Employment of locals is now a top priority.
Alternative sources of income to boost the economy are being
pursued, such as tourism. Spending cuts slashed its budget defict by
some 40% in 1995 and a similar trend is expected for 1996.

Kuwait, which has the most democratic system in the GCC, has so far
been free of violent internal opposition. But on Dec. 15, 1995,
Defence Minister Shaikh Ahmad Hammud Al Sabah revealed that an arms
cache was seized at a farm in the emirate, hidden by a group that
"sought evil for Kuwait". Yet Kuwait has managed to overcome worst-
case scenarios forecast after its parliamentary elections in October
1992 gave Islamic parties a big number of seats in the National
Assembly. The ruling Al Sabah family will find ways to co-exist with
the vocal National Assembly, despite more embarrassments likely in
1996 as a result of corruption allegations against former oil
minister Shaikh Ali Khalifa Al Sabah.

Oman, having celebrated 25 years under Sultan Qaboos in 1995, will
continue to function as a positive force in the region. Its moderate
yet unique approach could become especially useful as subtle power
games within the GCC intensify. At the same time, it will boost
links with Israel, further consolidating its importance as a key US
ally in the region. The sultanate is moving ahead fast in terms of
economic liberalisation, with priorities in 1996 to include
privatisation and diversification away from oil.

Qatar would find itself in an uncomfortable position in 1996, having
alienated the other GCC members at the Muscat summit. The young
Qatari emir, Shaikh Hamad, and his delegation walked out in protest
at the appointment of a Saudi, Jamil Hujailan, as GCC secretary
general. Shaikh Hamad also said he would boycott all GCC meetings
attended by Hujailan. But his position changed immediately as
Hamad's father Shaikh Khalifa, whom he had ousted on June 27, 1995,
appeared in Abu Dhabi at the start of a GCC tour and vowed he will
regain power in Doha.

Saudi Arabia, for the first time in many years, recently experienced
a combination of uncertainties related to the Riyadh bomb explosion
in November and to the subsequent hospitalisation of King Fahd. But
the issue of succession to the throne had been resolved prior to
President Clinton's visit to the kingdom in October 1994. Now Crown
Prince Abdullah is the acting head of state and, according to the
1994 deal, he will be the next king. The more difficult power
sharing arrangement between Abdullah's conservative camp and the
progressive camp of Fahd's "Sudairi Seven" is yet to materialise and
could prove to be a difficult objective. At the same time, the
kingdom will have to deal with new external dynamics generated by
the peace process, the conflict between Eritrea and Yemen, strained
relations with Iran, etc. On the positive side, "good results" were
announced on Dec. 17 after talks between Riyadh and Sanaa on
settling their border dispute. Despite some inherent problems, the
Saudi economy will fare better than it did in the past three years,
marking a break with the difficulties faced from bearing the biggest
burden of costs related to the Gulf crisis.

The UAE will remain the most stable and relatively the wealthiest
among GCC states, unless its territorial dispute with Iran over the
islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa escalates into
war. This is not likely in 1996, but some fiery rhetoric can be
expected from hardliners during the parliamentary elections in Iran.
Both sides want a peaceful solution but there are few prospects for
this as neither side would back down from its position. Iran has
said it is ready to fight an 80-year war for the islands.

North Africa

The level of violence in Algeria has subsided somewhat, amid the
victory of President Liamine Zeroual in the November elections.
Having strengthened his position by gaining legitimacy inside and
outside the country, in 1996 Zeroual will try to further isolate and
divide the violent Islamic groups, while trying to strike political
deals with those willing to renounce violence. These could include
FIS leader Abassi Madani, now living in a villa in suburban Algiers
as a "detainee", as well as the FIS Executive Bureau's provisional
head Abdelkader Hachani and FIS leader overseas Rabah Kebir.

Egypt managed to crush Islamic militancy more effectively in 1995.
Crackdowns will continue in 1996 both inside and outside the
country. Cairo's insecurity about its regional leadership role will
reflect on the way in which it relates to Israel and other states on
issues such as (a) the hostilities between Yemen and Eritrea, in
which it has charged Israel of playing a role; (b) the nuclear
question, now that it is bound indefinitely by the NPT while Israel
is not; and (c) Islamic militancy, having accused Sudan of fomenting
instability in Egypt and warned it of retaliation.

Libya will remain isolated under limited UN sanctions, unless it
surrenders the two men wanted by Britain and the US for their role
in the Lockerbie bombing. That is not likely to happen. Added
external pressure may be applied in 1996, at the most perhaps
through a limited embargo on Libyan oil. A full embargo like the one
on Iraq would not get support from Europe or the Arab World. Qadhafi
will come under stronger internal pressure, as the pain from the
sanctions gets harder to bear.

Morocco and Tunisia will move closer to the EU in 1996. Tunisia in
particular is a test case for European economic integration with
countries of the Mediterranean rim. But inherent political problems
remain - lack of real democracy and human rights - in EU relations
with both Morocco and Tunisia. But both have implemented rigourous
economic reforms in recent years. The Arab Maghreb Union will sink
further into obscurity in 1996, as member states from Libya to
Mauritania follow their own course in diplomacy, including ties with
Israel.

Red Sea Trouble

The flare up of military hostilities between Eritrea and Yemen on
Dec. 15, 1995, over the strategic but disputed islands, has sparked
off a new set of negative dynamics. The Arab League accused Eritrea,
which has close relations with Israel, of a premeditated attack.
Eritrean forces used Israeli-supplied boats and telecommunications
equipment, which according to Sanaa were provided in return for a
pledge by Eritrea to hand over one of the disputed islands to become
an Israeli military base. Asmara suggested arbitration by the
International Court of Justice at The Hague while Sanaa warned it
will regain the Hanish Al Kabir island by force. Egypt has warned of
the geo-strategic implications of the conflict - whoever has the
islands controls the Bab El Mandeb straits and access to the Red Sea
- while the Cairo newspaper 'Al Akhbar' accused Israel of backing
Eritrea. This was denied by Israel.

Sudan, a pariah among most Arab countries and the West, will
continue to deteriorate economically, while the political situation
would get worse. The military/Islamic regime has been unable to
deliver victory against the rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA), or any real improvements in the economic situation. As
relations with Egypt and other neighbours continue to worsen,
support to the SPLA from external sources such as Uganda and Eritrea
would rise. The regime will come under pressure from opposition
groups based in Cairo. In addition, tensions between the central
establishment and the various region are increasing as southern
politicians seek constitutional guarantees of more power, including
the reservation of the second highest post in the country - that of
first vice president - for a southern Christian.

Somalia has sunk back into chaos and civil war that existed before
the US-led UN intervention in December 1992. Things would get worse
in 1996; but this time the UN and the US would not step in to help.

Yemen, while engaged in a military conflict with Eritrea, is
beginning to face internal problems which would get worse in 1996.
Relations between the ruling General People's Congress (GPC) and the
Islamic Al Islah movement have been deteriorating steadily. Islah
efforts to impose strict Islamic practices in the south have turned
violent, including arson attacks against cinema houses and other
aspects of Western culture. A split between the GPC and Al Islah may
not mean a repeat of the May-June 1994 situation, when the country
was torn by civil war, but it could lead to further violence in
Yemen.

WINDS OF EDUCATION: English requires 'professionals'

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By MINORU WADA
Special to Asahi Evening News

Are Japanese teachers seen as professionals? This question has
been vexing me since the Central Council for Education, an
advisory panel to the education minister, submitted the summary
of its discussions on education reforms of the 21st century in
Japan.

Profession is defined in my dictionary as "any type of work
which needs a special training or a particular skill, often one
which is respected because it involves a high level of
education."

Many dictionaries offer "teaching" as a typical example of a
profession. However, I wonder if this definition is taken
seriously by those who advocate the introduction of English at
the elementary school level in Japan.

With respect to the reforms in English education in Japan, the
council has proposed that English should be taught at elementary
schools throughout the country. Naturally, this proposal should
be accompanied by concrete administrative measures to implement
it. The quality of teachers who teach English to elementary
school children is the key to the success of the new proposal.

When you read the education reform summary carefully to know
what the council thinks about this important issue, you will find
a passage which goes like this: "For the purpose of providing
primary school children with the activities that will allow them
get used to English and the life and culture in foreign
countries, it is hoped that the potential of native speakers of
English and that of Japanese people who have had wide experience
living in foreign countries are utilized."

I think this is a great idea. However, it is surprising that
you can find no mention of the roles of Japanese elementary
school teachers who are "professionals" in elementary school
education. I wonder if the council does not expect Japanese
teachers to play an important role in the teaching of English in
elementary school.

A debate arose as to "professionalism" versus "amateurism"
when the Japan Exchange and Teaching Program (JET) was
established about 10 years ago.

In the debate, opponents of JET claimed that only
professionals were qualified to instruct Japanese students, but
those people involved in the debate--from Japanese educators to
assistant English teachers (AET) themselves--agreed that team
teaching of Japanese teachers of English and AETs would be the
best way to make the most of Japanese teachers of English.

What interested me much in the debate was the point that no
amount of theory or experience in an AET's native country was
necessarily effective in a Japanese setting because of the
sometimes conflicting teaching styles between Japanese teachers
and AETs, but what interested me even more was the fact that no
serious discussions were made about "professionalism" of the
Japanese teachers.

When it comes to the teaching at the elementary education
level, you need to pay much more attention to the psychology of
your students, and the psychology is often ingrained in Japanese
culture. I believe that Japanese teachers' role is essential to
the teaching of English in elementary school because they know
their children's behavior, values and so on much better than
people from foreign countries and people who have lived in
foreign countries for a long time.

But the problem with Japanese teachers in elementary school is
that they are not necessarily speakers of English, and because of
that they often have difficulties in communicating with native
speakers of English to whom they should explain the psychology of
Japanese school children.

I strongly believe that those people who advocate the teaching
of English at the elementary level should propose the ways to
solve this problem.

In team-taught English lessons in junior high schools it is
possible for Japanese teachers to give input about their students
to AETs because they are specialized English teachers and can
communicate in English. In team teaching, Japanese teachers can
use their knowledge and ability as "professional" teachers of
English.

Of course, I know quite well that there are communication
problems between Japanese teachers of English and AETs. But
theoretically, Japanese teachers can have the role of designing
and managing their classes by using their professionalism.

Bullying and violent behavior are now raging in schools in
Japan, and it is essential that teachers of any subject as well
as teachers of English learn more about their students' minds.
They should know more about how their students think, feel and
behave in their school life. They need to have more training as
"professionals" who can read the psychology of their children
more than any other people.

I wonder why advocates of the introduction of the teaching of
English do not say anything about this important aspect of
education. Their endeavors to improve English education in Japan
is epoch making. But that makes me wonder all the more why they
want to count so much on native speakers of English and Japanese
who have had the chance to live abroad. I want to know how they
think about Japanese teachers' professional expertise.

University.

EDUCATION: Sankhon grateful for strict upbringing

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

Ousmane Sankhon, the public-relations manager of the
Japan-Guinea Association, has become a popular figure on TV talk
shows. A former official with the foreign ministry of Guinea,
Sankhon, 47, worked at the Guinean Embassy in Japan for eight
years beginning in 1972 before becoming a celebrity.

Sankhon said his father, who ran a farm while serving as a
local official, kept strict discipline in his very large family,
discipline he is grateful for.

I was born to a very large family. Altogether it had about 45
members--my father, three mothers, 22 brothers and sisters, and
relatives. In Guinea, such an extended family is not uncommon.

Dad worked on the farm while doing a stint as a local public
servant. He knew everything about his family. He knew how many
chickens we had, when the children got new shoes, how many dishes
there were in the kitchen, and so on.

He was tough with his children, so I feared him very much.
When he was angry he would thrust out his right forefinger. I was
very scared.

I got punished many times because I used to pick fights with
some of my brothers. I was also whipped on the leg or the hips.
It hurt me awfully. Dad had 22 belt whips on the rack at the
front door--one for each of his children

But he was also kind to us. How sweet he looked when he
smiled. Every time I got a good grade report I showed it to him.
"Good boy," he said, and he always bought me a shirt and a pair
of shoes. Dad and I went shopping together, walking hand in hand.
I was very happy.

My father taught me the importance of responsibility. Once,
when I was taking care of the sheep, one of them went astray. I
couldn't have my supper until I found the animal and brought it
home. It was already dark, but I looked for it with the help of
my brothers. I was desperate.

I also worked on the farm. Dad told me to plow a plot of land,
but he left me to do it my way. Sometimes I worked until 8 at
night. I remember the happy moments when I walked home, carrying
a hoe on my shoulder

In Guinea, adults severely scold children for making mischief
even if they are neighbors' children. When a kid has done
something wrong, you take him to his parents, and they always
thank you.

People in Guinea respect families that strictly discipline
their children. Parents with a spoiled child often take him to
such a family so he can live there for a while and change his bad
habits.

My father died when I was in the third grade of middle school.
I like the saying that goes something like this, "Parental advice
and cold sake have a slow effect." I am grateful that Dad was
tough with me. I respected him. I still do.

During a Japanese TV talk show I was on, the MC asked a senior
high school girl what she disliked most about her father. "He
stinks," she said. I was surprised.

I like Japan very much, so let me offer a bit of advice. The
most important thing for children is their families. Working
fathers should go home early. And they should be in good shape
when they get home.

Imagine a father who gets home late every night, drunk and his
tie loose. I wonder what his children would think of him.

EDUCATION: In language-school battle for students, a gentler success

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By KAZUNAGA FUKUSHIMA
Asahi Evening News

As large language schools successfully win more students
through expensive advertising and by opening accessible branches
in expensive locations, more smaller schools are feeling the
squeeze. Some are even being pushed out of business.

But one small English language school is finding a way to
survive in this highly competitive environment by offering
something many of the larger, profit-oriented schools
don't--quality of education.

Quest 21, which provides language courses designed to suit
individual needs, was opened near JR Kichijoji Station in April
by some former teachers of Sony Language Laboratory (SLL) after
that school became one of the casualties of the fierce battle for
students.

SLL, which was a pioneer among language schools in this
country after it was started in 1962 by Sony Corp.'s subsidiary
Sony Enterprise, was sold to other schools in March. A Sony
Enterprise spokesman said SLL faced ballooning deficits in recent
years as more students were wooed by new schools with big
advertising campaigns.

Teachers became concerned that the takeover of SLL by other
schools, which was announced in February, would mean a departure
from the school's original teaching methods and materials.

After unsuccessfully petitioning Sony Enterprise to continue
running SLL, a group of the teachers decided to open Quest 21 to
maintain an education policy of placing priority on individual
needs.

Quest 21 produces courses of study for individual students who
have specific purposes in mind when they want to learn English,
said Duane Sturm, a former SLL teacher and now president of Quest
21.

For example, when a housewife said she wanted to master
English in a short period of time in accordance with her specific
needs and ability, the school prepared lessons to meet her
schedule.

In another case, responding to a request by a mother who has a
disabled son and who wants to attend international conferences
for the disabled, the school held a lecture on words and
expressions that are often encountered in such occasions.

Unlike most language schools, Quest 21 hasn't adopted a
flex-time system, in which schools sell students a large number
of lessons in a package deal. As such deals usually require
advanced payment, schools can secure longer-term financial
stability. However, the advance payment system is often cause for
conflicts when students want to quit the school and demand
refund.

Quest 21 collects tuition fees based only on three-month
semester. Kunitsugu Noritake, a former SLL student and one of the
founders of Quest 21, said financial stability is attainable even
without advance payments.

"If the human relationship between students and teachers is
solid, students won't quit the school," he said.

He said the school expects students who appreciate the school
to bring in other students. Some come to take advantage of the
excellent teachers.

For example, one student returned to the school because of the
enthusiasm of her teacher, Patricia Sturm, wife of Duane and
another founding member of Quest 21.

"The reason why I come to Quest 21 is to want to be taught by
Mrs. Patricia," she said. "She has a technique which induces the
attendants to spontaneously speak their opinion in English."

The student said she likes the teacher's interest in using
newspapers and magazines as teaching material.

The students at Quest 21 have an opportunity to freely
exchange opinions with teachers during discussion class, for
which students get to choose the theme.

Then the teachers at Quest 21 clip the articles relating to
the themes from magazines and newspapers to encourage attendants
to aggressively discuss issues.

For instance, in a recent class, eight housewives who are
students selected euthanasia as the topic for discussion.

Quest 21 is also well-known because its teaching method works
well for students who have returned from abroad. Returning
students tend to lose their positive attitude toward speaking and
discussing in English because of cultural conflicts, said

Patricia Sturm.

She encourages returnees to maintain and improve their
positive attitude through discussion with other students who have
the same experience of having lived overseas.

But questions about whether such a cost-inefficient school can
sustain itself remain.

Noritake says Quest 21 needs 60 more students than the 90 it
currently has for a stable operation.

"But," he said, "we don't insist on profits. Rather, we expect
Quest 21 to be recognized as a non-profit educational foundation
in the future."

Duane Sturm agrees.

"Although it isn't easy to keep running Quest 21, we want to
keep providing student-oriented education," he said.

Fake budget report wastes \13 million

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

A statistics office in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries submitted a false explanation in seeking a 13
million yen budget allocation for a new machine, well-placed
sources said.

A funding request based on the false explanation has already
been incorporated into the ministry's fiscal 1997 budget request.

The office in the ministry's Economic Affairs Bureau's
Statistics and Information Department wants the new device to
replace one it now uses to enhance work efficiency in its
troublesome task of calculating the rice harvest index.

But the 13 million yen request was made in the name of other
products, since the device sought by the statistics office has
not yet been developed and thus the funding item was not likely
to pass muster. The office was planning to ask a manufacturer to
develop a pilot model after obtaining the 13 million yen.

Officials in the office now admit that the request is a
violation of procurement rules, and said that they will use the
funds in the budget request to purchase the products specified.

But those products are, in fact, not needed, representing a
waste of public money. "We wanted to promote a plan as fast as
possible," said an official.

in the office. "Because it came to light, we decided to buy
the products that we requested, although taxpayers' money will be
wasted."

BUSINESS: INTERVIEW: TAIKI SAITO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, YAMAICHI: RESEARCH
INSTITUTE

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

Domestic economic ripples from the U.S. election

By AMY SHIRATORI
Asahi Evening News

Q: Do you think U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposed
economic policies would be effective?

A: If the Republicans retain control of Congress, Clinton's
efforts would be blocked, and no policy change would come about.

The budget deficit would inch down, but not disappear in 2002
as Clinton says. The financial markets have already taken this
scenario into account.

Q: How effective do you think Republican candidate Bob Dole's
economic policies would be?

A: Dole's proposed policies would work only if the Republicans
have full control of Congress. If the Democrats control Congress,
Dole might compromise with them in a detrimental way, agreeing to
accept spending to protect low-income people because his proposed
tax cuts would benefit the middle to upper class.

I don't think Dole will get elected for proposing an income
tax cut.

Ordinary citizens did not look favorably on the debate to
balance the budget earlier this year, because they knew that
Republican-proposed tax cuts benefit the rich mostly.

Republicans and the supply-side economists always exaggerate
the scope of economic growth resulting from a tax cut, and the
cut would not bring about a balanced budget by 2002.

The capital gains tax cut proposed by both Clinton and Dole is
not looked on favorably either because people realize it needs to
be balanced by cuts in medical welfare.

Q: Which candidate's becoming president will benefit Japan?

A: It would be best if the status quo is maintained. It is
uncertain what a Republican president would do. Republicans are
proponents of free trade, but past Republican presidents have
taken a tough trade stance.

Democrats espouse protectionist policies and press Japan to
open up its market, but Japan's trade balance is dropping, and it
can hardly be said anymore that the U.S. trade deficit is caused
solely by Japan.

I think the trade surplus will continue to drop although the
rate of decline will slow down. The yen will average 105 yen to
113 yen in six months.

Q: Would the adoption of Clinton's proposals lead to slow U.S.
growth?

A: I estimate the economic growth between July and September
to be between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. But I project economic
growth between October and December will dip below 2 percent, and
that for the first half of next year it will be under 1 percent.

The U.S. economy shows both strength and underlying weakness.
The strength is that corporations have completed their inventory
adjustments, so they can easily increase production.

But consumption, particularly for durable goods and housing,
will not increase further. This is because the long-term interest
rate increased 1 percent from the beginning of the year, and
expansion has already lasted for 5! years.

Another point is that past consumption was made by borrowing
money, and households need to adjust their balance sheets.

Finally, the layoff of people hired in conjunction with the
Atlanta Olympics and the end of Olympic-related construction will
squeeze down on private demand. But I don't think the United
States will enter a recession.

The Fed can easily loosen its monetary policy because unlike
in the past recovery phase, prices have not been rising.
Expansion will pick up again in the latter half of next year.

Q: Is it unlikely that the Fed will raise interest rates?

A: That's not clear, because mixed indicators showing both a
strong and weak economy will be reported. I think there is a 70
percent chance that the Fed will not raise the federal funds rate
this year.

But the Fed might raise the rate as a preventive measure
against inflation at the next Federal Open Market Committee
meeting Sept. 24 if a strong index is reported. Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan is a Republican, so he does not have to feel reluctant
to raise rates before the election.

But Greenspan will not raise the federal fund rate in October
or November because that would be seen as a political move.

Q: What will be the effect on the economy if the Democrats
take charge of Congress?

A: The Democrats are now becoming favorites to win in the
House.

The current economic growth has been brought about because of
corporate restructuring. Corporations have been reinvigorated,
but private individuals have not, and their dissatisfaction has
worked to the advantage of the Democratic Party, which has
patronized the middle and lower class.

Democrats controlling Congress would tend to increase welfare
spending for these people, and blunt efforts to reduce the budget
deficit. The market has a deep distrust of a Democratic Congress.
There will be a triple downward spiral of falling stocks, bonds
and the dollar.

Q: Should Japan raise interest rates or compile a
supplementary budget for more fiscal stimulus?

A: Japan will not raise interest rates in September or October
even if the U.S. Fed raises the rate, because of the weak Tankan
report on business confidence in an economic recovery last week.

Japan should do no more than to increase the call rate late in
the year, if necessary, and provide another 2 trillion yen
construction spending boost in a supplementary budget, which I
think the government will do.

This is necessary to offset a 5 trillion yen tax increase from
the consumption tax hike next April.

Taiki Saito became senior economist and deputy general manager
of the economic research division at Yamaichi Research Institute
of Securities & Economics, Inc., in December 1994. He joined
Yamaichi Securities Co. in 1978 after graduating from
Hitotsubashi University. He specializes in the U.S. economy.

National Briefs

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

Music star falsely declared taxes

Tetsuya Komuro, a musical impresario living in Tokyo's Minato
Ward, filed a modified income tax return after the Tokyo Regional
Taxation Bureau found he had failed to correctly report income of
about 110 million yen earned in fiscal 1994, tax officials said.

The 37-year-old producer and composer had reported the 110
million yen income, including royalties on compact discs he had
produced, as business income of his company, Tetsuya Komuro
State, instead of personal income.

The tax officials ruled the amount as Komuro's taxable
personal income because he had not transferred the copyrights of
the CDs to the company.

Komuro composed and produced some popular songs, for singer
Ryoko Shinohara and other musicians, which became million sellers
in 1994. He declared the royalties on the songs as his company's
income.

Girl dies while crossing tracks

A 12-year-old girl who went out Sunday night to find her
missing cat was killed when she entered a level crossing and was
hit by a train, police said.

Ayako Kume, a student at Higashi Elementary school in
Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture, had left home saying, "I'll look
for my cat," according to her father Seiichi, 47.

The area is serviced by the JR Minobu Line.

Climbers tumble to their deaths

A rock climber died after falling Sunday from the
Ichinokura-sawa cliff face on Tanigawa-dake mountain in Minakami,
Gunma Prefecture, police said.

The dead climber was identified by police as Kozo Murotani,
43, a designer living in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo. Murotani was
climbing the cliff with a friend Sunday morning when he
apparently slipped and fell about 100 meters, police said.

Ichinokura-sawa is one of the most popular rock-climbing
cliffs in the nation and was crowded throughout the weekend,
police said.

In a separate accident, another cliff scaler died Saturday
evening on Machihodo-sawa of Koidemata-yama, a mountain in the
Tanigawa Range, in Niiharu, Gunma Prefecture, police said.

The dead man was identified by police Masanori Ito, 36, a
Kawasaki city official living in Aoba Ward, Yokohama.

Company officials found dead

The president and the director of an Osaka-based company were
found dead in the company's reception room Sunday evening, police
said.

Yasuo Hiyane, 60, president of Oyasu-Yosetsu Kogyo-sho, a
welding shop of Toyonaka City, Osaka, killed himself by taking
poison after bludgeoning to death Hideharu Matsumoto, 52, the
firm's director, police said. Their bodies were found by the
president's wife.

According to police, Matsumoto was found lying face down. He
apparently had been hit by a blunt weapon that left a bruise on
his head, police said. Hiyane's body was leaning on a chair with
a bottle of medicine beside him. Hiyane's body showed no sign of
being hit, police said.

Hashimoto hesitant on ekection date

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Sunday that he will
decide in the middle of this month the dates for convening an
extraordinary Diet session and for dissolving the Lower House for
an election.

The main issue before the extraordinary Diet session will be a
supplementary budget.

Hashimoto said he will decide the political schedules after
learning the results of Okinawa Prefecture's Sunday referendum on
a reduction of U.S. military bases and for a report on the
April-June gross domestic product (GDP) to be released in
mid-September.

Hashimoto revealed his plans during separate talks with Koichi
Kato, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
and Finance Minister Wataru Kubo.

Kato told Hashimoto that the LDP is divided over whether there
should be an early dissolution of the Lower House.

Hashimoto and Kubo agreed to cautiously consider the need for
a supplementary budget after they learn the result of the GDP
report.

Hashimoto had said earlier that he would call an extraordinary
Diet session in October to discuss a supplementary budget and
other issues. But he seems to have changed his mind for fear that
an extra session would lead to an immediate dissolution of the
Lower House.

If the extraordinary session is called, the ruling coalition
will face fierce attacks from opposition parties on next April's
hike in the consumption tax from 3 percent to 5 percent, and
allegations that Kato recieved a questionable donation from
now-defunct steel maker Kyowa Co.

The main opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) says
it will submit a bill in the extraordinary session to keep the
consumption tax rate at its current 3 percent.

Shinshinto members also say that unless Kato resigns his post
as LDP secretary-general they will boycott all deliberations in
the extraordinary Diet session.

Sasebo dockyard row flares again

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

A six-month-old agreement that ended a heated dockyard dispute
between a Japanese shipbuilder and the U.S. Navy at the port of
Sasebo in Nagasaki Prefecture is threatening to unravel because
of ship repair regulations.

SSK (Sasebo Heavy Industries Co.) agreed in February to end
its opposition to the U.S. Navy's plan to use free-of-charge the
company's No. 3 drydock to repair a warship after the navy hired
the company to do the work.

But negotiations over the terms of the contract for the work
on Bellow Wood, an amphibious assault ship, broke down when the
navy insisted that the company follow American
regulations--including those governing working conditions--when
doing the repairs.

"The U.S. forces have the mentality of the post-war Occupation
Forces," said SKK President Ryutaro Hasegawa. "No. 3 Dock will be
taken away (from our control) little by little."

On Thursday, hundreds of company union members held a rally at
the dockyard, surrounding the 900-meter circumference No. 3 dock
in a human chain to protest the planned repair work on the Bellow
Wood at the dock.

A 1968 agreement between SSK, the Japanese government and the
United States gives U.S. forces priority in using the drydock at
no charge, on just seven days' notice. SKK assumed control of the
dock from the Japanese government in the same year.

Tension erupted between the company and the U.S. forces in
mid-January when the navy requested the use of the drydock to do
seven months' of repair work on the Bellow Wood.

The company argued that it would lose about 36 billion yen of
its income if the dock was occupied for such a long period.

"I have always been pro-American. In emergencies, we will help
U.S. forces. But in normal times, we don't welcome something that
will send the company into bankruptcy," said Hasegawa.

The issue was considered settled when the U.S. Navy agreed to
contract the repair work on Bellow Wood to SSK, with the terms of
the work to be decided by the company, Hasegawa said.

Bacteria facilities barely coping

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

The nation's two storage facilities for bacilli samples are so
ancient and understaffed that future epidemics of bacterial
infection will be hard to contain, bacteriologists say.

Bacteria samples are necessary for determining the cause of
infection and studying methods of treatment, as well as for
understanding their genetic composition.

But they are stored at only two places in Japan--Tokyo
University and Osaka University.

Directors of these facilities complain that little has been
done over the years to improve these storage areas.

"There's been no progress so far," said professor Takeshi
Honda, the director of the Osaka University facility. "If the
present situation is allowed to continue, I must say that the
next time there is an outbreak, researchers may not be able to
come up with timely solutions to contain it."

The two facilities are run on an Education Ministry budget
that can hardly be called generous--a very lean 1.2 million yen a
year for Tokyo and slightly over 800,000 yen for Osaka, the
bacteriologists say.

And the ministry recognizes only one full-time researcher
each.

The Tokyo University storage facility occupies a corner of a
research wing dating back to the late 1920s. The tiny,
16.5-square-meter space holds refrigerators and freezers that are
crammed with test tubes containing 500 kinds of germs, including
O-157, salmonella, cholera, tuberculosis and dysentery bacteria.

Following the massive O-157 food poisoning epidemic, the
facility provided about 10 research institutes of food makers in
the Kanto area with samples of this E. coli bacillus.

But with its meager operating budget, inadequate equipment and
the barest skeleton staff, the outfit is a far cry from its much
more developed British, German and American counterparts, the
bacteriologists say.

For this reason, many Japanese researchers send for samples
from overseas institutes.

"Unlike the American facility at Maryland, which publishes a
catalogue of several thousand strains of bacteria and supplies
samples to researchers around the world, we are unable to even
meet all domestic requests for samples," lamented professor Shiro
Kanegasaki, director of the Tokyo University facility.

"And our freezers are ancient, `vintage' affairs," he said.
"We have to haul in tons of dry ice whenever there is a power
outage."

The situation is no better at the Osaka University facility
which mainly stores E. coli bacilli.

"We've had to discard some samples for lack of storage space,"
Honda said.

Some researchers have appealed to the Health and Welfare
Ministry to create bacteria sample storage facilities and
pertinent information services of the European and American
caliber, but the ministry has "no immediate plans for action," a
ministry official said.

In addition, Honda of Osaka University has been trying to
persuade the Education Ministry to upgrade the existing
facilities.

In recent years, bacteriology has been steadily overtaken by
virology, according to Kanegasaki. In 1977, 56 of 80 medical
schools around the nation taught bacteriology. Today, the course
is offered at less than half of those schools.

"The declining status of bacteriology as a branch of medical
science has definitely to do with the present plight of our
facility and Osaka University's," Kanegasaki said.

COMMENTARY: Politics lost for weords

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By YOICHI FUNABASHI
Asahi Shimbun

CHICAGO--After covering the Republican National Convention in
San Diego and the Democratic National Convention here, I am sick
and tired of speeches. I feel as though I made the trips to cover
speech contests.

The conventions were held to nominate the presidential
candidates of the two parties but a succession of speakers
preceded the nominees, Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton, to
the rostrum. Most of their speeches were partisan, just battering
the opposition. Could they really be called speeches?

The speakers' words were packaged with audio-visual effects.
During a speech on crime, a rape victim stepped onto the podium
and talked about the horrors she had experienced, interrupting
the speech like a television commercial.

Other speakers waded into the audience like talk-show hosts.
Giant screens made hilarious exchanges between speaker and
audience possible.

At a time when music and videos are packaged to sell products
and people, it may not be strange that speeches are "packaged"
like music videos. Does this mean that the karaoke machine is now
an essential part of giving a speech?

These gimmicks, I suspect, are causing a qualitative
deterioration in speeches, weakening the power of words.

In the interest of playing up the appearance of party unity,
both parties scheduled speeches that deviated from the "scripted"
party line only at times when the major national networks would
not air them.

While shortened speeches were a welcome phenomenon, there was
a quid pro quo: a preponderance of slogans like bumper stickers.
And there were too many tear-jerking stories.

Yet some speeches were moving. Colin Powell, former chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urged Republicans to be magnanimous
to those with whom they disagree. Based on his own experience,
Senator John McCain portrayed Dole as a "quiet hero" who went
about his work silently. Despite his disagreement with Clinton on
welfare, the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave a sermon on why he should be
supported in his reelection bid.

My overall impression is still that too many words were used
at the conventions. But I attribute the torrential verbiage to
the conviction that "politics are a matter of persuasion," and
persuasion primarily depends on words.

Exactly the opposite is true of Japanese politics. But this is
neither laudable nor tasteful. The Japanese machismo along the
lines of the well-known TV commercial catchphrase--"A man
silently drinks such-and-such beer"--is nothing but an expression
of distrust in words and reason.

During the Morihiro Hosokawa administration, Teiichi Tanigaki,
a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, attacked the prime
minister for his flip-flops over his proposal to replace the
consumption tax with a national welfare tax.

Speaking in a Lower House plenary session, Tanigaki said,
"When politicians are lost for words, power of speech, they have
no choice but to rely on muscles and money. Don't you think a
fascistic `muscle power' mode of politics is holding sway?"

The accusation was to the point. But the same thing can be
said of the present coalition government of Liberal Democrats,
Social Democrats, and Sakigake.

Remarks made by government and coalition officials over the
planned 2-percent increase in the consumption tax to 5 percent
next April are so divergent that they make one wonder which of
them is true. What strikes me is that the government and the
coalition are lost for words.

It seems that in Japan, words lack even the frail lifespan of
ice cream.

The approach of the next Lower House election under the
single-seat constituency system makes the political aphasia--the
loss of ability to use or understand words-- all the more
worrying for party politics in Japan.

The single-seat system has been adopted on the premise that it
will force voters to choose between parties, which will have to
spell out their differences in policies and in the leadership
capacity of their presidents. It is a system that works only when
parties vie with words.

Japanese politicians should give more speeches. I do not care
whether they act like talk-show hosts or employ a karaoke
machine.

In fact, under the present circumstances, I cannot afford to
care for the quality of speeches. I call for--no, I plead for--a
speech contest among the parties in Japan.

Matsumoto told to pay \790 million for gassing

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

The Tokyo District Court this morning ordered Aum Shinrikyo
founder Chizuo Matsumoto and other two cult leaders to pay 790
million yen in damage compensation to victims of the cult's Tokyo
subway sarin attack last year and to their families.

Presiding judge Hisashi Yamazaki said the three should be
regarded as having tacitly admitted to their involvement in the
gassing, because they failed to challenge the plaintiffs' claim
that they ordered and conducted the attack.

Although Matsumoto, 41, known as Shoko Asahara, had refused to
answer whether he admitted the same allegation in a criminal
trial, the civil court today said that he was the mastermind of
the subway attack.

The sarin nerve gas attack on March 20, 1995, killed 12 and
sickened 5,500.

Those ordered to pay compensation along with Matsumoto were
Ikuo Hayashi, 49, the former head of the sect's self-designed
"Treatment Ministry," and Masami Tsuchiya, 31, the former head of
the "Chemical Division."

Hayashi has admitted his involvement in the gassing, while
Tsuchiya opted to remain silent when accused.

Twenty-two people who were sickened in the gassing and 16
bereaved family members of seven who died filed the suit to seek
790 million yen in damages from the three and 12 others.

Matsumoto, Hayashi and Tsuchiya and 12 other Aum members.

Three of the other 12 named in the suit are still fugitives.

The civil suit will be considered settled when any of the 15
accused pay the money.

Matsumoto had already been ordered to pay over 360 million yen
in compensation in other damage suits related to crimes allegedly
caused by the sect, and in refund of donations the sect had
accepted from followers.

Matsumoto is believed to have little private assets, and has
so far paid only 650,000 yen out of 10 million yen demanded by
one group of plaintiffs in refund of their donations to Aum.

Hurt Akebono at a crossroads

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By JOHN De BELLIS
Asahi Evening News

If you consider Akebono's 12-3 record at the Nagoya tournament
in July after six months of crippling injuries, you begin to
understand that this is a man who is capable of beating the odds.

The 27-year-old Hawaiian-born yokozuna defied probability by
blazing through the ranks of Japan's most traditional sport. But
becoming the first non-Japanese to reach the sport's pinnacle was
arduous, and now he suffers the pain to substantiate it.

Injuries have put his longevity in doubt. His knees, on which
he had surgery in 1993, are the main problem. Too often, they
have given way beneath his 204-centimeter, 224-kilogram frame.

"When I was on the rise, I thought I was invincible," Akebono
said, flashing a smile that seemed to fade with the realization
that his career could be cut short. "I am also at the point that
if I get over this wall, it will decide my future, how long I do
sumo," he said quietly. "I want to be yokozuna for 10 years."

But as Akebono--formerly Chad Rowan and now a naturalized
Japanese citizen--prepares for the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament,
which begins next Sunday, there are doubts as to whether his body
can continue to endure the punishment it has absorbed during his
eight years in sumo.

His Hawaiian-born stable master, Azumazeki--formerly Jesse
Kuhaulua--has some concerns about his protege's training methods.

"He struggles because he doesn't work on his shiko (sumo-style
leg stomps for developing the lower body) more," Azumazeki said.
"If he does that, I think he can stay on top another four or five
years.

"You need shiko to succeed. It gives you balance and helps you
dig. Look at Konishiki. His size is tremendous (274 kilograms),
but he still does his shiko practice. That's why he's lasted so
long."

When Akebono pulled out of the January tournament on the
fourth day, he began to realize his mortality. The explosiveness
was gone from his tachiai (charge), so he was unable to attain
proper balance.

"When you get hurt in one place, you tend to favor that spot,
and then other things begin to be affected," Akebono said.

In March, he decided to skip the spring tournament because of
lingering pain in his knees and ankles. And it was painful--both
figuratively and literally--for him to watch his career slowing
to a halt.

"Many athletes who are at the top of their sport go through
trials," Akebono said, admitting that he has entertained
self-doubts and considered a world in which he could not wake up
each day and know he was the best. "I was doing so well after I
became yokozuna; I thought that nothing could stop me."

But that perception was shattered. Now, questions swirl around
his mind. Is retirement near? "Sometimes I think about it, but
not every day," he said. "I'd get stressed out."

If it weren't for the bad knees, it could be like it was
before--massive arms pumping and thrusting, opponents landing in
the third row.

"It frustrates me," Akebono said. "You think about things that
you would never consider if you weren't hurt."

But he said he believes he will overcome the injuries. And
even get better. "When I was hurt, I studied my sumo on video. I
still watch videos. I watch them to improve my techniques."

An avid Internet surfer, Akebono occasionally comes across
sumo interviews and analyses, or reads them in newspapers. Some
of them question his future.

"I don't really pay attention to that," Akebono said. "What
people see, and the person doing it, are two different things. I
haven't been shining like before, but I think, deep down inside,
that if I keep pushing, it will come back."

By the time Akebono entered the dohyo for the Tokyo summer
tournament in May, he was learning how to wrestle with pain. He
racked up a respectable 10-5 record and began to feel that
returning to top form was truly possible.

By Nagoya, Akebono was again dominating opponents. He went
12-3. "I thought I was going to take the whole thing," he said.
"But on the 14th day I hurt my shoulder."

He regards that injury as nothing more than a bump on the road
to recovery. "Right now my timing is off and I still feel pain in
my shoulder," Akebono said, "but if I keep practicing hard, I
should be ready."

MY FAVORITE HOME PAGE: Motor Link Page

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

"Just like many other freelance writers, I use this home page
when I need to check some detailed facts about automobiles when I
face a deadline," said magazine columnist Kazuhisa Kimura.

The Motor Link Page is divided into sections representing 18
major car makers from all over the world--five Japanese and 13
foreign.

If you click, for example, on the Nissan section, you can see
not only the home page of the firm but also the home pages of its
overseas subsidiaries.

In the site for Mercedes Benz, visitors can see
personally-produced pages on the manufacturer's vehicles as well
as its official Web site.

Kimura, a great lover of cars, accesses the Motor Link Page
quite often to update his knowledge about Italian, German and
other countries' cars. He came across the home page, while
surfing on the Internet.

"The home page is useful to get new information about foreign
cars, as well as their specifications--especially when I don't
have much time to check my facts before deadline," the writer
said, adding that the site is also fun visually.

However, Kimura said the quality and quantity of information
provided by the home page needs some improvement in some fields
in order to become on a par with popular Western auto magazines.

It's been about a year since he started to use the Internet
for professional and hobby-related purposes. His first encounter
with the Internet came at an Internet cafe, he said.

BOOKS: A marriage of religions

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By AKIO OGAWA
Asahi Evening News

While many Japanese still bow and pray in front of their
shrines and temples, many take the origins of these rituals for
granted--as if the mystery of religion is timeless.

Before Buddhism arrived in 538 A.D. via China and Korea, Japan
was a land of kami (a variety of indigenous, almost-animistic
Shinto deities), and school textbooks tell us what happened since
then--coexistence of Shintoism and Buddhism.

But these same texts largely fail to explain how and why this
remarkable merger took place in the first place.

Akio Yoshie, a history professor at the University of Tokyo,
tries to fill in the void using language understandable to laymen
in his latest book, "Shinbutsu Shugo (Merger of Shintoism and
Buddhism, Iwanami Shoten, 650 yen).

The history starts with what is called the Yamato Court,
Japan's first central authority, which consolidated its rule in
the mid-seventh century, and, in the early eighth century, its
rulers had two of Japan's first historical books compiled. The
books depicted the ruling family as the descendants of
mythological Shinto kami from heaven.

In those days, the court's rulers doubled as the highest
Shinto priests. As such, they ruled over various clan leaders,
village chieftains and grassroots villagers who believed in the
variety of kami. Clan leaders and village chieftains also had
similar double roles in their communities.

In other words, the original Shinto was the backbone of the
Yamato Court's rule.

But Yoshie points out in his book that a strange thing
happened from the eighth to ninth century--the mushrooming of
jingu-ji, or Buddhist temples in and around Shinto shrine
precincts.

Why, according to Yoshie, has to do with the production of
rice.

During the Nara era (710-794), the rice production increased
by leaps and bounds, thanks to fast expanding irrigation networks
and newly reclaimed paddy fields.

The change produced a wide economic gap between the local
government officials and country rulers and the villagers and
farm hands. The wealthy feared reprisals from the poor, and at
the same time they felt a strong sense of guilt.

Against this backdrop, Yoshie says, the uneasy rich sought
comfort and salvation from Buddhism, a religion of tolerance, by
building the jingu-ji.

The central rulers, who were also the highest kami priests,
had no choice but to leave Buddhism and the jingu-ji since their
own local heads were among the newly converted.

According to Yoshie, this was the first stage in the curious
mixing of Shintoism and Buddhism.

The second stage began with tales of ghosts and disasters that
struck the imperial palace, killing noblemen and terrifying
emperors to death. These events during the early part of the
Heian era (794-1195) were recorded in various documents in the
ninth and early 10th centuries.

The most famous ghost was that of Sugawara-no-Michizane
(845-903), a top nobleman-politician who lost in a power struggle
and died in exile in Kyushu.

Social unrest characterized this period as Emperor Uda
(867-931) and Emperor Daigo (885-930) in particular tried to
consolidate the imperial dynasty again by reasserting imperial
ownership of the nation's land that had been mainly privatized a
century earlier.

Bloody power struggles

This and other maneuvers by the emperors triggered power
struggles, sometimes bloody ones, in Kyoto. The social unrest
coincided with the burgeoning of the samurai who opposed to the
imperial rule.

That was where the Buddhist monks--especially, the esoteric
ones who were steadily building up their influence--hopped in.

They presided over one prayer session after another in many
parts of the country on the pretext of ridding the nation of the
ghosts and evils they blamed for the disasters. In reality,
however, they were fanning the social unrest.

At the peak of the disorder, Yoshie argues, Taira-no-Masakado
(?-940), a samurai leader, seized power in the Kanto region and
proclaimed himself an emperor in 939.

The emperors reacted by trying to soothe and overcome the
ghost of Sugawara-no-Michizana, which they saw as the symbol and
cause of the social unrest.

They hosted their own prayer sessions. For almost 30 years,
they also paid repeated tributes and contributions to the
Anraku-ji Temple that took care of the exiled nobleman's tomb in
Kyushu and to Kyoto's Kitano Shrine which was dedicated to his
soul.

During that time, samurai and Buddhist monks gradually changed
their strategy, realizing that it was easier to expand their
influence by joining hands with the imperial palace rather than
rebelling against it. This concluded the second stage.

In the third stage in the development of the religious
coexistence, the imperial rulers and noblemen along with their
courtiers and ladies-in-waiting began to practice their own
religion more vigorously, "sharpening their sense of purity"
which is the overriding concern in Shinto.

Ironically, however, the sharpened sense of purity paved the
way for the ruling class to ardently subscribe to the Buddhist
belief in Jodo, or the utopian "Pure Land beyond the Western
Ocean," by the end of the 10th century.

The development, writes Yoshie, was a new stage of coexistence
or rather integration between Shintoism and Buddhism.

In the further evolution of the integration or the fourth
stage, Buddhist theologians tried to absorb Shintoism beginning
in the late Heian era (the late 12th century) with a new theory.
Under this theory, all Shinto deities were interpreted as
incarnations of a variety of Buddhist deities, including Bosatsu
(bodhisattva).

Yoshie points out that the new theory turned out to be a great
success. Most shrines throughout the country had accepted it by
the middle of the Kamakura era (1185-1333). Even the deities at
the Ise Shrine at the top of the imperial Shinto hierarchy
followed suit.

Why the success? Yoshie explains that the emerging samurai
class (the Kamakura government was the first samurai regime)
sought Buddhist theories that pardoned killing--the job of the
samurai--over the Shinto's emphasis on purity. The newly emerging
merchant class also preferred Buddhist theories that preached
equality for all since the controlling samurai class at the time
began establishing a strictly hierarchical society.

The book ends with what Yoshie calls the fourth stage of the
integration during which Buddhism gained the upper hand.

But from where Yoshie's book leaves off, the relationship
continued to go through further twists, some violent.

Nationalistic Shinto theories developed during the Edo era and
ultimately culminated during the Meiji Restoration in the
establishment of the State Shinto where the religion again
centered around the imperial family.

Consequently, the Japanese today bow in front of many shrines
dedicated to original kami and not incarnations of the Buddhist
deities.

Many questions remain about what happened to the complicated
marriage of Shinto and Buddhism after Yoshie's so-called fourth
stage.

The author would do well to provide some answers with a sequel
to this well-researched and informative book.

FEATURE: Lack of water-safety education taking its toll

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By LILY MATSUBARA
Asahi Evening News

Every year, July first marks the beginning of the National
Police Agency's (NPA) annual ritual of tallying up the casualties
of summer leisure.

And every year, the Japanese newspapers' faithful devotion to
a three-inch column on the death toll hardly raises an eyebrow.
They pass for mere statistics. Nothing more, nothing less. And
tragically, nothing learned.

Most of these leisure-activity accidents occur at sea, about
twice as many as in the mountains. An average of 2,000 cases of
water-related accidents are annually filed with the NPA (compared
to 1600 mountaineering accidents). Of these, 1300 result in
deaths. And approximately 200 children die each summer.

But despite these grim statistics, the Ministry of Education's
guidelines on physical education classes do not include practical
lessons in water safety.

While children are all taught to swim freestyle and
breaststroke for at least 25 meters by the time they reach junior
high school, they are not instructed on the fundamental
principles of water safety or told of the many dangers of
swimming in the sea.

"In elementary school, teachers brought us outside to the
(public) roads to teach us about road safety," said Masahiko
Kobayashi, Secretary-General of the Japan Life-Saving
Association. "There are no similar practical lessons in water
safety when it comes to swimming lessons in schools."

According to the NPA, 45 percent of water related accidents
occur in the sea while only 2.3 percent occur in swimming pools.
Another 31 percent of the accidents occur in rivers.

"Those involved in accidents at sea are either swept away by
the tide and undercurrents or get caught in the wave and drown,"
said Kobayashi. "There are even cases of people being swept away
by their floaters because of high winds."

The NPA says most, if not all, accidents are avoidable.

"Even when bad weather causes an accident at sea, it is still
an avoidable problem," said a spokesman for the NPA. "There are
always announcements on weather conditions, and it is up to you
to heed them or not."

Carelessness

Both Kobayashi and the NPA point out that ultimately, personal
indiscretion is the cause of death. The rules are simple --if you
drink or feel unwell, don't swim; look out for coming waves; be
aware of tides and undercurrents; don't use floaters at sea in
high winds.

But, as simple as they seem, the rules still need to be
taught.

"Schools in close vicinity to the sea might have practical
lessons in water safety. But for now, we do not have plans to
include compulsory personal survival skills in our curricula
guideline," said Nobuyuki Ikeda at the Education Ministry's
Physical Education Department.

According to Kobayashi, this problem is compounded by the fact
that there are only 2,500 accredited lifeguards--officially
certified by the Japan Life-Saving Association--spread over just
50 of Japan's 1,400 beaches. The rest of the lifeguards are made
up of uncertified high school students and local residents
working at summer jobs.

In Australia, where life-saving is well established, the ratio
of lifeguards to the population is about 1:170; in Japan, the
ratio is 1:48,000.

"There are insufficient life-saving clubs in Japan," Kobayashi
said. "Only 40 clubs are registered with our association. And
although life-saving clubs at the local level and in universities
have been increasing in the last five years, it is a sad fact
that we have very few officially qualified life-savers in
beaches."

Simply learning how to swim is not enough. Children must learn
that swimming in pools is drastically different from swimming in
the sea.

Life-saving skills

Although 18 years is the minimum age required to learn actual
life-saving skills in Japan, Kobayashi attests that anybody of
any age can be taught how to read tides, currents and wave
movements--vital knowledge necessary for protection from the
seemingly unpredictable sea.

"In Australia, children as young as 6 years old have the
opportunity to learn about practical water safety," said
Kobayashi. "Under the guidance of life-savers, children are
actually made to feel the pull of tides and undercurrents. And
they are taught ways to brace against them."

But as yet, no system for ensuring water safety skills and
knowledge exist in Japan, he said, blaming the dearth of
certified life-saving trainers .

Private swimming lessons available to the public normally do
not offer such courses unless they belong to one of the 40
registered life-saving clubs. And despite the Education
Ministry's keenness to have children learn how to swim, teaching
techniques on personal survival are absent from school curriculum
guidelines.

The NPA makes a yearly effort to give school children lectures
on water safety and it increases its patrol around accident prone
areas. But, even so, since the beginning of July, 382 deaths have
already occurred (some 21 others are still unaccounted for).
Sixty of the victims were children.

"I personally wish that schools would someday include personal
survival skills as part of their swimming lessons," said
Kobayashi.

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Swimming is no
exception.

LIFE: How stressed are you?

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By TOSHIO JO
Asahi Evening News

Which would be more devastating, your wife's death or your
company's bankruptcy?

A ridiculous question? Not for Japanese men in their 40s and
50s, who are committing suicide in increasing numbers because of
rising work-related stress, experts say.

Middle-aged men actually suffer the same amount of stress when
faced with their company's failure as they do when a spouse dies,
according to a survey by a group of Osaka-based psychotherapists.

The survey recorded the results of a stress test designed and
conducted by Makoto Natsume, director at the Mental Health
Promotion Division at the Osaka Prefectural Mental Health Center,
and his colleagues.

The 1988 test asked some 480 men between the ages of 40 and 59
to rate the intensity of shock they would feel in the above
scenarios on a scale of zero to 100. Men in their 50s gave both
crises the same average score 78. Men in their 40s scored their
wives' deaths at 80 and failure by their companies at 78.

The survey's startling revelation of an all-consuming
corporate culture was clear when it was conducted during the peak
of the economic boom in 1988.

It has become tragically clearer in the last eight years.

Restructuring blues

As Japanese companies reel from the effects the deep economic
recession that began in 1991, middle-aged employees are facing
stress from overwork, bullying and the once-unthinkable
possibility of losing their jobs.

The result: More of them are killing themselves.

According to the National Police Agency, 3,626 men in their
50s committed suicide last year, up from 3,080 before the
recession in 1991. Among these, 898 killed themselves because of
"economic and livelihood related problems," leading all of the
age groups in the number of suicides committed for similar
reasons.

While many say the economy is on the rebound--many pointing to
rising corporate earnings--companies are continuing unprecedented
restructuring programs that are putting many long-time employees
out of work and generating more stress for those who watch their
job security erode around them.

In May, the nation's unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, its
highest since 1953 when the government first began providing
jobless data.

"The number of patients being treated for stress-related
problems here at the Osaka center has increased over the past few
years," said Natsume, a work stress specialist. "The number of
female patients has increased, too, as a logical consequence of
the increase in working women.

Suicidal tendencies

"I estimate that about 60 percent of these patients have
expressed a desire to die, and about 30 percent actually try to
commit suicide."

In terms of personality, people who are diligent at work and
feel strong work responsibility are most prone to work-related
depression, Natsume and other mental experts say.

Toru Sekiya, head of the Sekiya Neuro-Psychiatric Clinic in
Tokyo's Shibuya Ward, agrees.

"I cannot help predicting that the number of suicides by
people in these age groups (40 to 60) will further increase,"
said Sekiya.

In addition to the threat of job losses, corporate
restructuring has several other stressful effects, Sekiya said.
One is that as companies reduce their employees, the remaining
workers have to work hard to take up the slack.

Another effect is bullying.

"In some cases, computer workers or clerical workers are
reassigned to become salesmen, which is a typical case of
bullying," Sekiya said.

Sekiya described one patient who came to his clinic because of
the stress he felt after an unfair transfer.

"He could not kill himself. He could not go to work. And he
could not tell his wife about what happened, feeling that she
could never understand his situation. In the end, he had nowhere
else to go but the clinic," he said.

Natsume of the Osaka center shared a similar story about a
48-year-old man who tried to commit suicide after a successful
26-year career with a general trading house.

Natsume said the man, who had a wife and son, was transferred
to Europe to be vice president in charge of the company's
branches in there. He was forced to live alone. As sales faltered
and the company headquarters pressured him to improve them, the
man became stressed.

He started to have trouble sleeping at night and began feeling
lonely without having anyone to talk to. Six months after he was
transferred to Europe, he tried to commit suicide by taking
sleeping pills.

Natsume said the man was found by a neighbor in a coma, but
his life was saved.

The man and his wife turned to Natsume for professional help.
After six months of resting and counseling, he got over his
depression, and returned to work.

"He was lucky because his wife was very understanding and
never said anything negative even though he had to take months
off work," Natsume said, adding that good family relations and
hobbies for relaxation purposes are two key elements in leading a
healthy life and helping deeply stressed people who have become
depressed.

Work-related suicides or karoshi (death caused by overwork)
has drawn the attention of lawyers.

In March, a landmark ruling was handed down when the Tokyo
District Court ordered Dentsu Inc. to pay about 120 million yen
in damages to the parents of an employee who killed himself in
August 1991. The court attributed the suicide to depression
caused by overwork and lack of sleep.

Since the start of 1996, a Karoshi Hot Line Service, a legal
advice and counseling service provided by a nationwide group of
lawyers, has received many calls from the relatives of men who
have killed themselves because of work-related depression.

Feeling responsibility

One of them was a 40-something middle manager for a
manufacturing company. He committed suicide because of depression
brought on by his sense of heavy responsibility at work, his
relatives said. Before he died, he would come home around 11 p.m.
and leave home 4:30 a.m.

Another man in his 40s threw himself into the path of an
oncoming train. He had to work long hours on weekdays and work
even on weekends. Before he took his own life, he often
complained to his family members that he could not sleep at
night.

"Japanese salaried men in their 40s and 50s should learn more
from younger people, who do not see work as being everything in
life," said the Osaka center's Natsume.

"I believe that one of the darkest sides to the ongoing
restructuring within the Japanese business community is the fact
that many of the people who have been let go contributed to
better workplace human relations. Their departure has made the
Japanese workplace atmosphere and environment cold and less human
at the expense of productivity."

Sex shop slaying investigated

Tokyo police began questioning four employees of a chain of
sex-related businesses, arrested on suspicion of fraud, violation
of the Stimulants Control Law and the Swords and Firearms Law,
over the disappearance late last year of the owner of the
business and a manager, police said Friday.

Police said they suspected the owner and the manager, both 33,
were murdered for money and their bodies were dumped somewhere.
Last Thursday, investigators raided four clubs belonging to the
sex chain, police said.

The four were arrested in separate cases.

In January, the owner's father reported to police that his son
had been missing from his condominium in Shibuya Ward since
December last year, police said. Police say gangsters, as well,
may have had a role in the disappearance.

Foreign residents left out of disaster drills

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By MASAYOSHI SUGA and TARO KARASAKI
Asahi Evening News

While acknowledging that many foreign residents were left out
in the cold in the Jan. 17, 1995, Great Hanshin Earthquake, many
local governments say they have not included programs to help
non-Japanese residents during the annual disaster prevention
drills that will be held this week throughout the country.

Tokyo, home to more than 260,000 registered foreigners from
160 countries, and the location of hundreds of embassies and
consulates, conducts a disaster prevention drill today.

The drill by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government will be carried
out on the assumption that an earthquake of the same magnitude as
the Hanshin quake had hit Adachi Ward. One of the key
responsibilities of the metropolitan government during such a
crisis would be to communicate with foreign victims and relevant
organizations, such as foreign embassies and consulates.

However, while a disaster headquarters will be operated by
senior officials to rehearse command and communications
procedures, no member of the metropolitan government's
International Affairs Division will be included in the
headquarters team.

This is despite the fact that the office's main task in the
event of an earthquake would be to coordinate programs to help
foreigners and communicate with organizations, embassies and
consulates.

"No specific programs involving foreigners have been included
in this year's drill," said Tetsuo Imasu, head of the division.
"But we hope we will be able to incorporate some measures next
year."

The division last week announced a program to hire 200
language volunteers, both Japanese and non-Japanese, who can help
in the event of disasters. Their jobs will cover a wide range of
activities, including providing information for foreigners and
printing foreign-language materials, helping foreigners at
shelters and assisting foreign rescue teams.

The division plans to train the volunteers and hopefully
include them in next year's drill.

The Kobe Municipal Government says that it has not included
any special programs involving foreigners in its disaster
prevention drills scheduled for Tuesday.

"We are still trying to put together a manual for foreign
residents on what to do in a disaster. Any plan to hold a special
drill for foreign residents will have to come after that," said
Takashi Yokotani of the Kobe Citizen's Service Bureau.

Yokotani said the manual should be completed by the end of
this fiscal year and the bureau would possibly study plans on how
to incorporate foreigners in drills in fiscal 1997.

"We have invited representatives of various community groups
(to the drill), and if they have any contact with foreign
residents, I would assume that they would convey whatever knowhow
is needed," said Yokotani.

However, the head of a volunteer group in the Kansai region
questions whether the city-run disaster drills are the best way
to help foreigners prepare for disasters.

"I don't think that it is such a good idea to have the
government set up everything," said Taro Tamura, head of the
Center for Multicultural Information and Assistance.

"What local governments should do is to nurture and answer the
needs of non-profit groups that are close to the foreign
residents. In the end, that should help foreign residents in a
disaster situation," said Tamura.

Tamura's group will today provide advice on how to prepare for
disasters in a special radio program to be aired on the
Kobe-based FM station Cocolo.

The program will provide advice on where foreigners can go to
get relief supplies and how to apply for gift money.

The Kanagawa Prefectural Government also said it does not plan
any special programs for foreigners in its drill today, but will
hold a joint communication exercise with the U.S. military forces
in the prefecture.

The city government of Nagoya does not have any plans to
include foreign residents in its drill, but the city office for
international exchange will hold a lecture on Sept. 9 on how to
prepare for an earthquake.

"We are aware that it is important to involve foreign
residents. But as many foreign residents are located in scattered
communities, it is difficult to get them all together," said
Fumitaka Kito of the Nagoya International Center.

Conventions show chameleon side of U.S. politics

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By YOICHI FUNABASHI
Asahi Shimbun

CHICAGO--Both Republicans and Democrats blurred their
traditional party lines at presidential conventions last month to
woo crucial floating voters for their candidates, Bob Dole and
Bill Clinton.

In past presidential elections, Republicans made it a rule to
underscore patriotism, while Democrats used to give top priority
to standard of living.

In an attempt to disguise their hawkish and dovish feathers,
however, Republicans and Democrats presented strikingly similar
stances in San Diego and Chicago on key policy issues such as the
role of government, family ties and crime.

It seems that Republicans and Democrats had better trade their
mascots, the elephant and the donkey, for the chameleon.

Republicans and Democrats have also shed their traditional
images as the stern father and the affectionate mother.

Republicans selected Susan Molinari, a representative from New
York, as the convention's keynote speaker to project a soft image
to win support from women--the lack of which is viewed as Dole's
Achilles' heel.

The party election machine tactically focused TV cameras on
her five-month-old daughter, held in the arms of Molinari's
father.

The Clinton administration, meanwhile, has taken a harder line
since Democrats suffered a devastating defeat in elections two
years ago largely because male white voters expressed discontent
with the party's generous welfare spending, lax crime control,
and liberal affirmative action programs.

Democrats have recently attacked big government, even scaling
down welfare programs which had long been the core of their
platform.

In point of fact, huge fiscal deficits afford little policy
leeway to either Republicans or Democrats other than to propose
small government.

While the two parties try to transform their images,
traditionalists are shaking both camps.

Jesse Jackson galvanized his Democrat audience by criticizing
"fundamentalist" Republican elements seeking to minimize welfare
support, restrict foreign imports, oust immigrants, and oppose
abortion.

But the Democratic Party, too, has been a patchwork of many
interest groups. The disappearance of the old threat from the
former Soviet bloc has made this more evident, as it cast loose
divergent voices within both party folds.

As rhetorical strategy, Republicans and Democrats have
similarly labeled themselves as progressives, shunning such
Right-Left stereotypes as conservatives and liberals.

Clinton is particularly adept at this, and he is often derided
as a "Republican Lite," like the beer, or in this sense a
pseudo-Republican.

That is why Molinari pleased Republican audiences when she
made fun of the president's opportunism. She said her speech
--like Clinton's campaign promises--will not last long and will
sound just like a Republican's.

At the same time, her words revealed the frustrations within
the Grand Old Party, whose traditional policy strengths have been
successfully mimicked by the Democratic Party.

In his showdown with the

73-year-old Dole, Clinton, 50, portrays himself as the man who
represents the interests of 77 million U.S. baby boomers.

In his nomination acceptance speech, Dole said he wants to
serve as a bridge to regain the U.S. values in the good old days
--the values he himself represents.

The patriotism voiced by someone like Dole, whose right hand
is handicapped from World War II injuries, exerts tremendous
pressure on Democrats, particularly on Clinton, who has been
accused of shirking military service during the Vietnam War.

To fight back, Democrats mobilized young children--among them
Clinton's daughter Chelsea--at the convention, to symbolize their
contrary argument that the next president must serve as a bridge
to the future, not to the past.

When he celebrated the 50th anniversary of his birthday
shortly before the convention, Clinton said yesterdays will
outnumber tomorrows from now on.

His reference to yesterdays seems to suggest the huge
political clout that the U.S. baby boomer generations have
acquired to protect their interests.

Clinton intentionally did not invite Jimmy Carter to the
convention. Carter ignominiously lost reelection in 1980, and
Clinton did not want his own nomination tarnished by association
with the former Democratic president. The snub may also reflect
Clinton's own ego, his belief that he belongs to a generation
completely different to Carter's.

At the conventions, Dole and Clinton were evenly matched.

If outward show is all that matters in politics, the
Republican Party might have taken a slight lead.

In their speeches, Dole dwelt on his past and Clinton listed
policy challenges. Dole may have better impressed voters with
sincerity, whereas Clinton may have displayed greater political
dexterity.

But the booming economy and comfortable leads in opinion polls
are firmly supporting the Democrat incumbent. Clinton is content
to draw on his track record in office, and evades direct
engagement with Dole that might narrow the gap and lend more
credibility to the challenger.

It is often a mistake, however, to judge the entire trend of
U.S. politics from the speakers and delegates at presidential
conventions.

The consciousness of floating, middle-of-the-road voters
--once described as the country's silent majority--is quite
different from those people who have recently occupied the TV
screens.

Bankruptcy considered a last, but viable, resort

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 4

by Matthew Miller

China has abandoned its historic reluctance to let its most
unprofitable state-owned companies go bust, but economists are not
predicting a wave of bankruptcies in the immediate future.

A record number of bankruptcy petitions was filed this year and
Beijing recently issued provisional regulations on the dissolution
of state companies.

But experts said fundamental questions on resettlement of state
employees who once enjoyed cradle-to-grave welfare benefits, as
well as resolution of outstanding bank loans, continued to make
bankruptcy the choice of last resort.

The state would keep trying to save its state-owned enterprises
whenever and however it could, a Beijing-based economist said.

Li Shan, executive director of Goldman Sachs (Asia), agreed. "There
will not be massive bankruptcy," Li said. "There are issues of
social unrest [to consider] but more importantly effects on the
banking system need to be resolved."

During the first nine months of this year more than 3,400 companies
petitioned for termination and the number could rise to 5,000 by
year-end. That would be about the same number of companies that
have filed for bankruptcy in the 10 years since the National
People's Congress passed the first bankruptcy law in 1986.

Ministry of Finance provisional regulations on the settlement of
financial issues call for further merging and bankruptcy of China's
most indebted state enterprises. The regulations apply to 58 large
and medium-sized pilot cities selected by the State Council
(cabinet) earlier this year.

Most importantly, the regulations for the first time identify
concepts of senior and junior debt in Chinese bankruptcy
proceedings. Wages owed, social security payments and other welfare
provisions will take priority over repayment of debt. Workers'
housing, schools and hospitals cannot be liquidated to pay off
debts.

Giving the welfare and resettlement of workers priority has been
the practice in Chinese bankruptcy proceedings but there have been
no such regulations in the past.

Even if state planners could resolve problems of employee
resettlement, the massive debts of state companies make bankers
wary of any spate of bankruptcies.

Earlier this month the State Statistics Bureau revealed that in
1995 total debt in the state sector amounted to 3.36 trillion
renminbi (US$405 billion), outstripping total private bank deposits
of Rmb2.97 billion. The bureau reported the asset-liability ratio
for the 148,000 state enterprises at 85 percent.

Historically, debt owed to state banks is the last to be paid in
any bankruptcy proceeding. Moreover, local officials have never
shied away from bankrupting enterprises so the companies can avoid
repaying large creditors, typically state banks.

Even when state banks have been allowed to foreclose on factories
holding mortgage-backed loans, the results often have been
disastrous.

The Sichuan provincial city of Mianyang is one of the pilot
locations for the new bankruptcy regulations. When the city's
Miaoting Paper Mill declared bankruptcy in April 1995, the local
court ruled that an Rmb11.22 million mortgage-backed debt owed to
the local branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC) would be settled through foreclosure of the factory's walls,
roads, toilets and sewers.

The local courts also ordered five more factories bankrupt,
creating total losses for ICBC's Mianyang branch of Rmb70 million.
Total assets at the branch amounted to only Rmb110 million. Branch
general manager Li Yichun said it would take the bank 15 years to
write off the foreclosures.

State bankers pointed out that overvaluation of state assets also
made bankruptcy an unacceptable practice. Last week's unsuccessful
auction of land use rights at the bankrupt Shanghai No 4 Plastic
Products Factory is indicative of the problem.

The land auction, which would have been Shanghai's first for a
bankrupt enterprise, was organized to raise funds to relocate and
re-employ factory workers, as well as repay a company debt of
Rmb11.26 million, much of which is owed to ICBC's Shanghai branch.

But the Shanghai municipal land planning bureau attached a minimum
value to the real estate of Rmb2,600 per square meter, well above
the Rmb2,000 per square meter that developers were prepared to pay.
When bids for the minimum price failed to materialize, the auction
was canceled.

A spokesman for Shanghai Light Industry Holding, the parent company
of Shanghai No 4 Plastic Products Factory, said the failure would
certainly influence the future auction of property rights for other
bankrupt state companies.

Despite such setbacks, observers remain hopeful that recent
developments signal a new willingness to tackle the difficulties
facing the state sector.

"It's significant that they're speaking about the process," said
Goldman Sach's Li. "If the austerity program should continue it
will create conditions for deterioration of state-owned enterprise
performance. These new bankruptcy

provisions will give them an outlet to make better use of their
assets."

Membership to OECD gives Seoul host of labor headaches

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 3

by Elizabeth Pisani

Only a few days before South Korea is due to sign on the dotted
line for membership of the OECD, the club for rich nations,
international trade unionists are once again waving the flag of
workers' rights, demanding that labor law reforms promised by Seoul
be speeded up.

International activists tell tales of abuses in South Korean-owned
factories around the world. "Anti-unionism and worker exploitation
has become another Korean export," said a forthcoming article in
the trade union magazine Free Labour World.

Their voices form an unlikely chorus with those of the very
companies they criticize. South Korea's giant conglomerates, too,
want to see labor laws changed, but for very different reasons.
While trade unionists complain that present law makes it too hard
for workers to organize, employers complain laws make it too hard
to fire staff.

The Brussels-based International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
(ICFTU) had been lobbying hard for labor laws to be changed before
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development formally
invited South Korea to join the body, which now groups 28 of the
world's leading economies.

Unionists feared that once the invitation was issued, as it was on
October 15, Seoul would have no incentive to change restrictive
labor laws. European Union Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan recently
reminded South Korean legislators that OECD nations would continue
to press for labor reforms. But when Seoul finally signs an
agreement to join the largely Western group in Paris on Friday, the
impetus may well be lost.

"We have written again today to the labor minister to remind him of
the commitments he has made," an ICFTU official said on Monday. The
trade union grouping, working with two South Korean affiliates, is
concerned above all with a law which forbids unionists who do not
work in a given company to support or mediate in that company's
labor disputes.

Ironically, this law is something of a headache for employers, too.

While it does cut out the possibility of activists working across
a whole industry, the present system puffs up wage bills. Employers
find they are picking up the paychecks for dozens of workers who
spend all their time on union activities.

Unionists would like, too, to see workers permitted to join any one
of a range of labor organizations - at present the law limits
workers to one union per company. "Our third bone of contention is
the prohibition on public sector workers' union membership," the
ICFTU official said.

None of the international trade union body's demands go beyond
conventions promoted by the United Nations' International Labor
Organization (ILO) agency. As Asian governments fight to keep
workers rights off the agenda at world trade talks scheduled for
December in Singapore, they are touting the ILO as the proper forum
for labor issues.

Asian nations reason that elaborate social security systems that
protect workers are inappropriate to their level of development.
Labor activists counter that they are asking for the ILO minimum.
They have also said that the "developing economy" argument did not
hold water coming from South Korea, the OECD's second Asian member
after Japan. South Korea exported US$3 billion in investments in
1995 and half that amount again in only the first three months of
1996.

Every day the European media has stories of a new South Korean
triumph. Investment is promised in televisions, in semiconductors,
in cars. Even European aircraft are on the block to South Korean
bidders.

And yet, pointed out Free Labour World, papers around the world
were also heaving with reports of labor unrest at Korean-owned
factories. From Argentina to Vietnam, workers are reported to be
humiliated or mistreated by their South Korean bosses. "Korean
multinationals make very bad ambassadors in most countries," said
an article due to appear in the November issue of the magazine.

Its bad reputation notwithstanding, Korea appears keen to pass
skills on to others. Several groups, finding they have lost senior
staff in overseas companies after a takeover, have called for more
training of foreign managers in Korea. And Seoul has promised to
pump US$10 million into a job training center in Beijing.

Opening floodgates of goodwill

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Francesco Lao Xi Sisci

Sino-German relations are back on track after several months of
friction, according to both sides, and China has welcomed Bonn's
important backing for its Three Gorges dam project.

Four months after Beijing angrily canceled his original visit,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has been given a high-profile
reception in Beijing. The welcome did not cool even when Kinkel
raised the thorny issue of human rights.

"There had been bumps in Sino-German relations... but things are
now resolved," Kinkel said on Monday after meeting his Chinese
counterpart Qian Qichen. Qian also said relations were back to
normal.

China has welcomed plans for a visit by German President Roman
Herzog next month but was even more pleased by German support for
Three Gorges.

Bonn in recent weeks has agreed to guarantee German investment in
the project, the German side announced. It was a groundbreaking
result for China after the United States and Japan had refused to
do likewise and the World Bank withheld support. The dam across the
Yangtze River, brainchild of late chairman Mao Zedong, and
personally encouraged by Premier Li Peng, will cost US$30 billion.

Opponents fear it will cause serious environmental damage for
questionable benefits.

The Chinese believe the dam, which when completed would be the
world's largest, will end periodic floods along the Yangtze and
increase China's power capacity by 18,000 megawatts.

German support is politically and economically very important
following China's recent announcement of a US$1 billion bond issue
to finance the project.

The Chinese Financial Daily reported on Monday that 17 billion
renminbi (US$2 billion) had already been invested. On Tuesday the
Guangming Daily reported that Li Peng had visited the site and
spoke to people who will be forced to move.

A total of 1.07 million people must be relocated from the area to
be flooded. The dam will be completed in the year 2009.

Kinkel's July visit was postponed after the German parliament
passed a resolution on Tibet critical of Beijing.

Kinkel, who met Communist Party leader and State President Jiang
Zemin and Li Peng on Tuesday, raised the cases of dissidents Wei
Jingsheng and Wang Dan during his meeting with Qian on Monday.

Wang Dan, 27, a veteran of the Tiananmen Square protests, has been
charged with subversion and could receive a sentence ranging from
10 years to life.

Wei, sentenced in 1994 to a 14-year jail term for subversion, has
already spent nearly 15 years in prison.

Kinkel described his meeting with Qian, at which he raised the
plight of the dissidents, as very cordial.

Other foreign visitors who raised human rights issues, and
specifically individual cases, customarily received a frosty
response.

The German government has been accused by opposition parties in
Bonn of going soft on China over human rights for the sake of
lucrative contracts. Engineering giant Siemens is bidding to supply
generators to Three Gorges.

Kinkel said on Tuesday Germany was considering opening an
industrial park in the central city of Wuxi. He said China was keen
to use German technology in the fields of transport,
telecommunications and infrastructure.

"China and Germany complement each other in many ways, they ideally
dovetail," he said.

Germany is China's largest European trading partner and its fourth
largest global trading partner. Two-way trade last year was worth
DM21 billion (US$13.6 billion).

Police put their feet down on no-hands truck drivers

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Shu-Ching Jean Chen

Police are about to get tough with Taiwan's notorious truckers - by
ordering them not to steer with their feet.

The Ministry of Transportation and Communications will soon
announce a rule making it compulsory for drivers to keep their
hands constantly on the wheel.

"Our policemen have seen truck drivers relying on their feet to
steer at speeds of 70 or 80km per hour," said an official at the
Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau. "That has greatly increased
the risks of driving on the highway.

"Some were even spotted eating from lunch boxes or playing with
their mobile phones while letting go of the wheel."

Such maverick driving often occurs at night, when traffic is light
or drivers are tired after long hours on the road, or in traffic
jams.

But without a new rule police have no legal power to crack down.
The rule will clearly specify that steering with one's feet or
taking both hands off the wheel is an offense.

Offenders will face a fine of NT$3,000 (US$109) to NT$6,000.

Enforcing the rule may, however, prove difficult. "Even the camera
might not be able to catch a clear picture of what's going on
inside a truck," said Lin Wein-hsien, secretary-general of the
Truck Cargo Transportation Association. "The police will have
technical problems in coming up with solid evidence."

But Lin said the passage of the rule could in itself serve as a
warning to delinquent drivers.

Truckers are currently among the most dangerous drivers on Taiwan's
crowded highways. According to the Taiwan Area National Freeway
Bureau, trucks and other large cargo vehicles made up only 22
percent of the traffic flow on highways in 1995 but accounted for
31 percent of accidents.

The figure is alarming but still a distinct improvement on 1994
when trucks accounted for 44 percent of accidents.

Taiwan truckers are also notorious for forcing other vehicles out
of their way by flashing their headlights immediately behind them.

Thailand pins down airwave bandits

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Jaruwan Ngamman

In Bangkok's bustling Mahboonkrong shopping center, if you want to
make an international phone call the price charged is usually a
steal - literally. Illegal cellular phone operators there let you
call using "stolen numbers" and the final bill winds up in the
hands of some unsuspecting subscriber.

After five years of rapid growth Thailand's cellular phone
companies, who claim to provide first world technology in a
developing economy, are now confronting what once used to be a
first world problem - air time theft.

Worried by the way it is wreaking havoc on customers' bills and
siphoning away millions of baht in revenue each year, two of the
country's biggest cellular phone operators, Advanced Info Service
(AIS) and Total Access Communication (TAC), are teaming up to curb
the illegal business.

The companies, which until recently held a duopoly over the
country's lucrative cellular phone market, have launched a campaign
aimed at alerting customers and warning off air time thieves.

Last week Thai police arrested three illegal mobile phone operators
who allegedly coordinated their business with employees of AIS.

"We are determined to send illegal air time operators to jail,"
said AIS vice-president Vuthiporn Chaipayom.

AIS plans to spend more than 200 million baht (US$7.8 million) to
install the Subscriber Identity Security system at its 29 telecom
base stations by year end. The SIS International Gateway Office, an
international air time theft agency based in the Netherlands, will
monitor the system for an annual fee of 12 million baht.

The key to preventing air time theft, said industry executives, was
to safeguard the passwords encrypted in signals emanating from
mobile phones which enable access to the telecom network for making
domestic and international calls.

One way in which thieves - usually cellular phone repair shop
owners - get their hands on the passwords is through handling
handsets given to them for maintenance.

Industry executives also blame the problem on those subscribers who
employ repair shops to tune inexpensive handsets for other family
members who want to use the same mobile phone number. In the
process, they unwittingly give the repair shop access to their
passwords.

Passwords can also be deciphered through the use of special
devices, such as those manufactured by one California-based
company, which intercepts and decodes signals between cellular
phones and base stations.

Each "stolen number" is usually used for only a couple of months
before the original subscribers get wise to the fact that their
bills are being inflated by illicit calls.

The price charged for such pirated cellular phones is often as low
as 10,000 baht, whereas normal subscribers pay twice as much for
the handset, a one-time registration fee of 4,000 baht and a
monthly subscription fee of 500 baht.

"We will need the cooperation of our customers in preventing air
time theft," said TAC vice-president Somyot Woraprechapanich. TAC
executives said the company had set up shop at Mahboonkrong to keep
an eye on illegal phone operators in coordination with the police.

According to Somyot, the company has already spent more than 100
million baht on the installation of a new security system for its
network. TAC also has plans to impose a ceiling on the amount of
international calls next year, after consultations with its
clients.

The crackdown stems in part from the prospect of growing
competition in the sector, which makes maximizing revenues a
priority for cellular operators.

In July this year, a legal advisory body did away with the
monopolies granted to AIS and TAC by state-owned telecom companies
in 1990.

Another theory is that the present campaign is part of the
companies' efforts to push sales of their digital mobile phone
services, said to be less prone to air time theft than analog
systems.

Both companies, after starting out with cellular phones using
analog systems five years ago, have in recent years invested
heavily in digital telecom networks and are finding it difficult to
attract new subscribers, due to a number of reasons including their
higher cost.

It's extortion, claims News Corp

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Yaroslav Trofimov

Rupert Murdoch, probably the most powerful man in the global media
business, would be ill-advised to come to Israel. If he does,
Israeli tax authorities warn, he will be certainly "invited for
questioning" and maybe even arrested.

According to accusations put forward by Israel's Income Tax
Authority (ITA), Murdoch's main concern in the Jewish state, News
Datacom Research, a fully-owned subsidiary of Sydney-based News
Corp, has "swindled" Israel's Treasury out of tens of millions of
dollars.

In what is being described by the Israeli media as "the biggest tax
fraud in Israeli history", the ITA claims that News Datacom did not
report as much as US$150 million of income between 1989 and 1996.
The company's executives, accountants and attorneys have already
been interrogated by ITA investigators.

Murdoch has vehemently denied the accusations, blaming disgruntled
former employees for instigating the scandal.

"The company has filed all required tax returns and paid all
applicable taxes... statements to the media appear to be a result
of a continued extortion campaign by former employees who have been
sued in the United Kingdom by News Datacom for defrauding it of
millions of dollars," News Datacom said.

The company employs 250 people at its research laboratory in
Jerusalem and manufacturing facility in Haifa. It produces the
so-called "smart cards" used by Murdoch-owned satellite ventures
such as Hong Kong-based StarTV and London-based British Sky
Broadcasting, which ensure that only paid-up subscribers can access
the encrypted programming.

The technology for the cards is based on an invention by Israeli
mathematician Adi Shamir, who until recently served as a News
Datacom director. Shamir has already been questioned by the ITA.
News Datacom allegedly reported only a fraction of payments
received for the technology and software that it developed in
Israel and "smuggled" abroad.

The bulk of the income it had earned was allegedly paid to
Murdoch-owned companies in Hong Kong, where the tax rate is much
lower.

Daewoo scoffs at white knight talk

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Claude Albert and Philip Golub, Asia Times

The chairman of South Korea's Daewoo Electronics on Tuesday
dismissed reports of a counter-offer for France's Thomson
Multimedia as a "joke", but sought to mollify French critics of the
deal with his firm.

"We have been working very seriously on the bid for the past six
months and I don't see any new global offer being presented at this
late stage," Bae Soon-hoon told a news conference.

Thomson Multimedia is the consumer electronics arm of Thomson,
which is due to be privatized by the end of the year. The French
government announced last week it had selected an offer from
France's Lagardere and Daewoo for Thomson over a competing bid by
Alcatel Alsthom.

Daewoo Electronics is to take over 85 percent or more of Thomson
Multimedia, a world leader in digital technologies and the world's
fourth largest television maker. The partnership will create the
world's largest television producer.

The French business press suggested this week that a rival French
bidder for Thomson Multimedia was about to be found. The Liberation
daily on Tuesday said Sagem, which fell out of the race earlier,
was preparing such a bid. Sagem denied any bid and Bae dismissed
the idea.

Daewoo's purchase has provoked intense criticism from an array of
business interests, trade unions and political parties, all of whom
denounced the sell off of one of France's leading high-tech
companies to a foreign group.

Discord spread within the government, with senior officials close
to National Assembly President Philippe Seguin voicing strong
opposition to the deal.

"The government failed for years to recapitalize Thomson
Multimedia, forcing the company to pay exorbitant interest on its
outstanding debt," said Elie Cohen of the French National Center
for Scientific Research, one of the more articulate critics of the
sale.

As a result, said Cohen, it is being sold just when it is heading
towards profitability. "France would not sell Thomson Multimedia to
a foreign company at this time if it still had an industrial
ambition of its own," he said.

The critics are unlikely to deter the French government from its
chosen course. La Tribune on Tuesday quoted sources close to the
finance minister as saying that even if the government received a
new bid it could not consider it since Thomson as a whole and not
any particular part was being privatized.

Asked about one of the more contentious issues of the takeover -
the amount of debt which Daewoo will assume - Bae said "we are not
allowed to make it public". Out of a total debt of FF14 billion
(US$2.69 billion), Daewoo Electronics is thought to have agreed to
pay FF4.8 billion. But, when asked whether his group would be
willing or able to take on the total debt, Bae said: "I think so,
yes."

Bae reiterated that Daewoo Electronics would stick to its
commitment to create 5,000 jobs at Thomson Multimedia in five
years. He said the firm's independence would be maintained by
keeping its headquarters in Paris.

The statement is unlikely to mollify critics who have expressed
concern that Daewoo could radically revamp the management
structure.

Bae did not allay this concern but did say that most of the top
management would remain French, adding: "It is hard to imagine that
Koreans would come to live in Paris though they love to visit it as
tourists."

Though it is unlikely to upset the deal, the political pressure has
already pushed Lagardere and Daewoo to alter some prior agreements.
Last week Jean-Luc Lagardere said the two groups would create a
common subsidiary for next-generation consumer electronic products,
rather than simply ceding Thomson Multimedia's high-tech digital
activities to Daewoo.

French interests will thus retain a say in the more sensitive
high-tech sectors.

Hyundai defends plant in Poland

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Andrea Thalemann, Asia TImes

The Polish government is expected to announce on Wednesday whether
South Korea's largest chaebol, Hyundai, had illegally established
a car assembly plant in Poland only days before a new decree on
import duty waivers took effect.

The Polish Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Cooperation have questioned the legality of an official
licence which permitted Hyundai and its Polish partner Universal in
August to import car parts without paying 35 percent import duty.
The licence was issued by the Ministry for Foreign Economic
Cooperation and then suspended after a sudden change in import
regulations for car parts.

Hyundai and Universal said they were victims of intentionally
untransparent government regulations.

Last July, the companies agreed to assemble 15,000 models in the
first year, taking into account Polish law which grants companies
that assemble more than 1,000 cars a year in Poland, duty-free
imports of parts.

The two companies received official permission for their venture on
August 8, when Universal heard of an imminent change to the
existing regulations whereby duty waivers would be granted only to
car manufacturers already in operation.

That sent the infant venture scrambling for proof of its existence.
In a matter of days, Hyundai brought in assembly kits and a Korean
technician to an unused factory north of Warsaw. By August 24, they
had assembled the first batch of cars.

Two days later, the new regulation was published in the Legal
Gazette. It required every foreign car maker to apply for new
import permits effective on August 24 - the day Hyundai had
invoiced its first cars.

There was, however, no official announcement before or on the day
the decree went into effect.

Hyundai said without a duty waiver, its cars would be effectively
priced out of the Polish car market.

Copper trader faces long, slow procedure

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Richard Hanson

Yasuo Hamanaka, the 48-year-old former Sumitomo Corp copper trader
at the heart of one of history's most spectacular financial losses,
was sent through the gates of the cream-colored Tokyo Detention
House on Tuesday, a journey made by some of Japan's most famous
politicians and criminals.

Prosecutors arrested the mild-mannered Hamanaka, after criminal
charges were filed by his former employer alleging that he had,
over the past three years, forged hundreds of order forms and other
documents to cover up huge losses while he was in charge of
Sumitomo's multibillion dollar global copper trading operations.

Breach of trust charges are being prepared.

In June, Hamanaka was fired when the company revealed copper trade
losses of US$1.8 billion. Last month, Sumitomo said the loss was as
large as US$2.6 billion.

In size, the loss eclipses that of Baring's US$1.3 billion stock
index futures debacle in Singapore two years ago, and Daiwa Bank's
US$1.1 billion New York bond trading loss in September 1995.

In all three cases, the seemingly loyal, profit-making employee was
given freedom to operate with loose management controls and each
one had hidden his losses for extended periods from both management
and the regulatory authorities.

Sumitomo said Hamanaka's first losses in copper trading occurred
about 10 years ago on the London Metal Exchange. He had extensive
dealings with companies in the United States and was able to borrow
large amounts of funds from many of the top banks in the world,
based on the supposed backing of the giant Sumitomo trading house.

At the height of his fame, Hamanaka was dubbed within the market as
Mr Copper or Mr Five Percent - the share of the world copper market
that Sumitomo controlled at one time.

It was said that he accounted for half of the copper trades on the
London Metal Exchange at one point.

The Sumitomo copper scandal has prompted what is now described as
close cooperation among criminal-justice authorities in Britain,
the US and Japan.

In the US, where Sumitomo has closed its metals trading business,
six lawsuits have been filed against the trading house by
customers. A lawyer in Tokyo is preparing to file a suit on behalf
of a group of Japanese shareholders against Sumitomo's management.

Hamanaka has the distinction of being the first and, so far, the
only person to be charged in the copper scandal by the Tokyo
Prosecutors Office.

The office raided his house in a suburb of Tokyo on early Tuesday
morning. Neither Sumitomo nor the prosecutors disclosed exactly
where Hamanaka was arrested, although he was seen being taken by
car into the Tokyo Detention House at around 3.30pm.

The wheels of criminal justice grind slowly and deliberately in
Japan, as prosecutors build their case. Initially, suspects can be
detained for questioning in the sparsely-furnished cells of the
detention house for up to a month, and even longer if further
charges are filed.

The late former prime minister Kakuei Tanaka was so detained over
two decades, and later convicted, in the famous Lockheed aircraft
bribery scandal of the mid-1970s. A more recent example was Shoko
Asahara, leader of the now-disbanded Aum Supreme Truth religious
group, who is on trial for masterminding a deadly 1995 poison gas
attack on the Tokyo subway system.

Hamanaka's alleged crimes involved no claims of personal gain, and
were certainly not heinous, but they were still surrounded by
riddles over who else might have been involved and the role of
Sumitomo's own management.

At a news conference on Tuesday, a Sumitomo executive would not
comment on either the names of the clients that Hamanaka had traded
with outside of Japan, or even the names of the countries in which
they lived.

Sakuo Nanba, general manager of Sumitomo's legal department, was
also reported to have said that the company's internal
investigation so far had not found evidence that Hamanaka was
manipulating the world copper market - a key point in the
investigation.

Hamanaka's alleged forgery involved two types of documents, which
were drawn up in the hundreds over the past three years while
trying to conceal losses from management. One used falsified
signatures of two senior Sumitomo officials between January and
March 1994 to place orders with customers. Another used in
September that year said Hamanaka had sole authority over the use
of funds obtained overseas.

The details over how Hamanaka managed to run up US$2.6 billion in
losses have not been disclosed. The scam was only unraveled earlier
this year when Hamanaka was about to be promoted and posted to
Indonesia.

Caught in a minefield

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 11

by Karen Back, for Asia Times

Lieutenant-Colonel Garth Barrett used to plant land mines as a
soldier. Now he makes a living destroying them. An expert in mine
detection and destruction, he has worked for the past several years
as a consultant to defense contractors. He has also helped United
Nations forces carry out peace-keeping operations in Mozambi que
and Bosnia where he's helmed "nonmilitary operations to
rehabilitate countries" - clearing land mines, restoring power
lines and reopening roads.

"After a war is over, the mines are still in the ground and don't
care who the enemy is," said Barrett. "They detonate whenever
somebody stands on them or runs over them with a vehicle. There's
no limitation on who they maim."

If you step on a land mine, what should you do? "Once you step on
them, they go bang. You're going to lose part of a limb," he said.
"The Western mines don't do as much damage as the old Soviet-bloc
mines. The Western anti-personnel mines have far less explosives in
them - they will quite often take a foot off only up to your ankle.
But with a Soviet anti-personnel mine, you'll quite often lose your
leg below the knee." He has seen colleagues die after stepping on
mines because "you can't get medical aid to them quick enough. They
lose blood too quickly to be saved."

Barrett works on contracts for companies such as Science
Applications International Corporation. A mine clearance job could
run from three weeks to three years. His longest stint so far was
two-and-a-half years in Mozambique, where he and his crew de-mined
approximately 4,000km of road. Mine clearance is not cheap. A
project can cost from US$2 million to US$50 million. A typical
2,000km of road costs from US$5 million to US$10 million to clear,
takes from four to six months and utilizes four mine-protected
vehicles. The mine-clearing contingent of 50 people live in either
tents or caravans using mobile showers, eating cooked breakfasts,
cold lunch and a barbecued dinner. Nightly recreation on-site
includes Rambo-type videos and books. Barrett likes to read authors
John Clancy and Darryl Brown.

The mine detection system he uses, Checkmate, is unique, he said,
because it only looked for the explosive vapor which every mine
has. Other systems use metal detection and ground-penetrating
radar. Samples of air are taken either manually or by
remote-controlled miniature aircraft, about the size of model
planes, which fly over suspected mine fields. The air vapor, a kind
of a fingerprint, is captured on to an absorbent compound in a
small tube which is presented to a trained dog kept in a sterile
environment who determines from the scent whether there's evidence
of a mine there. If the dog makes a positive ID, a specific area is
searched.

Born in Rhodesia, Barrett, who moved to southern California in the
United States in 1994, learned his trade "purely by accident". He
said: "In Africa we had a land mine war engaged by the guerrillas,
freedom fighters, whatever you want to call them, over the past
25-odd years, so we developed a lot of techniques to protect
vehicles transporting soldiers. After taking an advanced
demolitions course, I started to learn about mines."

Explosives training was a requirement for Special Forces troops in
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Barrett commanded a Special Forces
regiment, leading counter-terrorist/ counter-insurgency oper
ations. "We killed guerrillas, terrorists outside our country," he
said. He twice received Rhodesia's Legion of Merit for combating
terrorism. At the conclusion of the war in Rhodesia and "after
consultation with Robert Mugabe, the new leader of Zimbabwe",
Barrett and his contingent of the Special Air Service immigrated en
masse to South Africa and were inducted into the South African
defense forces in 1980.

He led that unit for a year, retired from the military in 1981 and
began working in "bomb inhibition", eventually running Suppression
Technology Systems in Johannesburg, South Africa. Described by a
colleague as a "steely-eyed man with a hair-trigger temper", for
the past several years he has also specialized in explosive
detection and land mine clearance.

"If there are anti-personnel mines, we tramp them out using a 10
tonne mine-protected armored vehicle which has a long bomb arm with
a special steel wheel with disc rollers on it which digs the mine
out of the ground," said Barrett. "We just drive over the mines,
which explodes them."

Driving over an exploding land mine sounds dangerous. "It's just a
cloud of dust," said Barrett. "You just carry on driving." It
doesn't inflict damage on the vehicle because it can withstand 30
pounds of explosives, and the mine only has a couple of ounces of
explosives in it. Does he feel like Rambo driving over a mine in a
10 tonne tank? "It's not fun," said Barrett. "Too much dirt and
dust coming in."

Barrett also told a story about men collecting mines in Kuwait. "As
they extracted the mines, the men kept throwing them in their
truck. They threw one too many in there and detonated the whole
truck. About 19 men were killed. But I've been very lucky. I've had
friends blown up behind me and in front of me. But I've never hit
one myself."

Sometimes he puts mines in a holding place until he decides how to
deal with them. "You don't want to blow a mine next to a road
otherwise you'll cause even more damage," he said. "Often, you'll
move it out of a vulnerable place, put it somewhere nearby and
possibly burn it up using thermit. But you have to be careful you
don't start a fire because thermit burns extremely hot." If there
are anti-tank mines that aren't blast-protected, they blow up.
"Modern mines have blast protection built into them which means a
time-pressure impulse is required on the mine's detonation system,"
he explained. "That doesn't exist on an older mine, so you put a
light plastic bag inflated with special gas over it which then
sends a blast of pressure into the mine and detonates it. With
blast-protected mines, you've got to put an explosive charge
directly over the mine and blow it."

There are two different kinds of mines: Anti-personnel and
anti-vehicle. Each has 20 different derivatives. The mines causing
most of the world's problems today are anti-personnel mines,
according to Barrett. "When undergrowth regrows it makes it
extremely difficult to get to them and deal with them," he said.
"The biggest problem with anti-personnel mines is because they were
indiscriminately laid on unmarked mine fields. They were designed
to affect the population as well as the forces that were fighting."

Barrett doesn't wear any protective gear when doing land mine
clearance - just khakis and a button-down shirt - and doesn't
consider himself a risk-taker. "I'm a bit adventurous is about
all," he said. As a colonel in both the Rhodesian and South African
armies, Barrett always regarded mines "as a double-edged sword...
In Rhodesia, we were forced to put up a cordon sanitaire [a
screened off area] which included mines. We used mines sparingly
elsewhere but we did use them against our enemy [the guerrilla
army]." Does Barrett feel differently about mines today? "Land
mines will always be a double-edged sword," he said. "They're as
bad for the user as they are for the enemy they're supposed to
deter."

The US government has led the way in trying to get modern mines to
have mechanical or electronic means of being deactivated, or to
destroy themselves after a limited period of time to prevent this
debacle in the future. A large portion of NATO has joined a
moratorium on the sale and export of mines, but it is not worldwide
yet. Indeed, the US has not agreed to completely cease mine use,
citing its involvement on the Korean peninsula.

Over the past 20 years land mines have killed more civilians than
military personnel, and at one point in Cambodia they were killing
600 people a month.

The high toll mines take on civilians was one of the reasons
Barrett moved into mine clearance. "It was an area I knew
intimately and it gave me enormous satisfaction to be able to try
to remove a serious menace. To be able to help civilian populations
was something I thought should be done. I believe sincerely that
unless countries, and they're mainly in the Third World, rid
themselves of mines, they will never get off financial aid. The
wealthy countries in the world cannot continue feeding them
financial aid and it's an essential element for those countries to
get back on their feet, get their own economy, their own
agriculture re-established. Without clearing mines, you're not
going to do that."

Unless he steps on a land mine himself, Barrett will not be out of
a job any time soon. The US State Department estimates that there
are 85 million mines in the ground in 68 countries and that nearly
3,000 people are killed by unexploded land mines each year.

While he enjoys cleaning mines, what he really likes, he said, is
"playing golf".

Isn't golf a little tame compared to the rest of his life? "You're
playing against yourself, so it's not tame," he said. "And you've
got to control your own temper and frustration." He laughed.
"That's why golf is so good. It teaches you to do that."

US, Taiwan take stock of the future

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Gene Koprowski

The United States and Taiwan may be nearing a futures market war as
officials in both countries approach a point-of-no-return in a
long-running dispute.

Taiwanese stock market officials have rejected an offer from the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) that would have ended the growing
controversy over the CME's proposed futures contract based on the
Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) index.

Accordingly, trading of the instrument may commence "before the end
of the year", executives at the CME said in a document obtained by
Asia Times.

Industry insiders said Taiex and Taiwan's Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) would prefer to pass a futures regulation law for
the country, and have their own futures market up and running,
before they started working with the CME - the world's largest
financial futures exchange.

The rejection of the offer to share market data and delay the
launch of the contract came in a letter from Taiex dated October 11
and delivered to CME chairman Jack Sander and president Bill
Brodsky only last week.

Shau-Dai Lin, who heads Taiex, expressed "continued concerns" about
the CME's plans to begin offering the futures, fearing they would
increase the volatility of the Taipei market, the sixth largest
stock market in the world. Taiex also sent the letter about CME to
the US futures regulatory authority, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC), headed by Brooksley Born. CME officials said
they expected a similar letter to be delivered by the Taiwan SEC
very shortly.

The letter followed a visit in late September by Daung-Yen Lu,
chairman of the Taiwan SEC, H W Chien, chairman of the Taipei
Securities Dealers Association, and officials from Taiex who flew
to Chicago to ask the CME to postpone the launch of the futures
contract for a year.

Sander and Brodsky tried to address the concerns one week later in
a memorandum to all the parties, which indicated that futures would
not increase volatility on the Taipei market. Sander and Brodsky
also said that they were quite willing to delay the launch of the
contract until the middle of January 1997 - not until next October,
as the Taiwanese wished - but only if Taipei would share data on
trends in the market on demand with CME.

"The only written response we've gotten is from the Taiwan Stock
Exchange, and it doesn't look like they're going to cooperate with
an information-sharing agreement," said Ellen Resnick, a
spokeswoman for the Chicago bourse.

"They expressed continued concerns. They did say that they
recognized the importance of an information-sharing agreement, but
it was worded in such a way that it did not seem like it was
something they wanted to do. We expect to receive a letter from the
[Taiwan] SEC as well. That's where things stand," she said.

Sander and Brodsky last Friday sent a reply to the Taiwanese
indicating that if the proposal to share information was not
accepted by the government, the CME would launch the contract as
early as the end of the year.

"If our latest proposal is not accepted by the Taiwan SEC, we are
prepared to launch these contracts upon approval of US
authorities," Sander and Brodsky wrote in a letter dated October
18, obtained by Asia Times. "As far as the CME's application for
the contracts is concerned, the CFTC public comment period ended on
October 10. The comment letters were overwhelmingly in favor of the
CME's application. We expect the US authorities to make a decision
regarding our application within the next two months."

Late last week, another bourse in the US, the Pacific Stock
Exchange (PSE) - a regional market in San Francisco - announced
that it too was considering launching its own options, based on the
Taiex, with or without Taiwanese partners, officials said.

"When we launched the Mexican Stock Exchange index, we launched
futures and the Chicago Board of Trade launched options. The
Pacific Stock Exchange deal is similar in that way. We see this as
a positive thing," Resnick said. "They did talk to us ahead of
time."

The futures and options contract would be derived from the Dow
Jones Taiwan Stock Index, a capitalization weighted, broad-based
index of 113 Taiwanese stocks, representing more than 80 percent of
Taiwan's market capitalization.

Last year, Taiwan traded 267 billion shares and handled more trades
than the New York Stock Exchange.

CME officials earlier this month held a meeting in Taipei with 300
futures and securities industry representatives who indicated they
were interested in working with the Chicago bourse.

The PSE had also been courting Taiwanese securities industry
representatives, and the PSE "plans to work closely" with Taiex
officials, Robert Greber, chairman and chief executive officer of
the PSE, said. "By trading options on the index now, we'll generate
additional interest and credibility for the Taiwan market," Greber
said. "We'll also offer the Taiwanese financial community the
opportunity to gain invaluable experience before the market opens."

Themes from the heart

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 10

by Priya Tuli, for Asia Times

Take a balmy Jakarta evening, the haunting strains of the sitar,
air fragrance mingling with incense and you have October 10 - the
opening night of an exhibition of paintings by Parvathi Nayar
Narayan at the Koi Gallery. Titled The Art of a Woman, this was the
Indian-born artist's debut show in Jakarta since moving to
Indonesia a year ago.

Represented at the exhibition were three distinctly different
styles, providing an insight into the varied scope and range of
Parvathi's work. The majority contained her experimental trademark
in mixed media - an exuberance of color and technique. These large
expanses of expressive form and color are executed in ink, dye and
acrylic, and employ a combination of techniques - pouring and
texturing to produce visual images that are complex and
multilayered.

Most of these depict Rajasthani women from northwest India. They
walk tall and stand proud; their beauty transcends mere features
and form, and is evident in every step and every gesture. These are
women who brave the fierce desert heat and walk kilometers each day
to the nearest water source. These are women who raise children and
work just as hard as their menfolk. And these are women who dance
with abandon at festival time in a spontaneous celebration of life.

In a defiant response to the brazen desert sun and the drab desert
sands, the clothes they wear are vibrant and blazing yellows,
brilliant reds, dazzling greens and deep blues - sheer inspiration
for an artist. "The colors I've used are vivid, but never primary.
You'll notice they have greater depth and variation than primaries.
That's because I never use a color in its pure form. These are
colors I'm comfortable with right now."

Part of the same group in terms of technique, the series titled
Woman and her Emotions focuses on one dominant color to establish
and enhance the depth of each emotion.

"It's true that color has emotional connections. Woman in Pain just
had to be in blue. I didn't even think about it, it just came so
spontaneously. Amusement is in green - a young, frivolous, bright
green. If I had done one on jealousy, it would have been green too,
but a darker, heavier green.

Lust had to be earthy brown, with hints of yellow and blue... You
know, this series was completed in one continuous, intensely
creative spurt that lasted around three or four months. I didn't
feel that I had come to the end of the series then. But for now, I
do. I might get back to it at a later stage. The strange thing is
that everybody thought they'd be slow to sell, but six of the seven
have gone already. That just tells me to go on painting from the
heart."

The next series contained black-and-white, pen-and-ink drawings,
where the faces of the women are left blank. This is an interesting
device that draws upon the viewer to interpret the women's
personalities subjectively. The last style on view was the more
academic use of oils. One painting was, Noon Watch, in which a
little girl rocks the makeshift crib where her younger sibling
sleeps - a common sight in India.

As an artist who rejoices in exploring and experimenting,
Parvathi's involvement with technique and texture is amply evident
in the content of this exhibition. As she pointed out: "I spend
more time looking at a painting than actually doing it. I look for
the rhythms, identify what I need to pull out and develop - what I
need to suppress. I guess that's where the skill counts, in
deciding.

"The effects I get are sometimes planned, sometimes accidental. But
I use the accidents as part of the process, so that carefully
planned areas combine with the unplanned." That, in a nutshell, is
really what art is all about to Parvathi, a celebration of "being,
exploring and becoming". Well traveled, she has lived and painted
in India, London and Singapore. But while her addresses might
change, Parvathi's distinctive styles simply evolve as this
exhibition clearly demonstrates.

The Art of a Woman exhibition at the the Koi Gallery in Jakarta
runs until November 4, 1996.

In Japan, if you build it they will vote for you

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 9

by Bradley Martin

There is one message Japan's voters sent loud and clear in Sunday's
election: "Rev up the concrete mixers!"

The pork barrel is the heart and soul of the politics that the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Sunday's big winner, practises in
election districts across the land.

Critics may complain the result is the rapid despoliation of what
was once a lovely countryside, as politicians and bureaucrats
devise ever more useless projects with which they can return to
local communities some of the taxpayers' money filtered, of course,
through construction companies, their suppliers and employees.

Or foreign environmentalists may ad-vise that the concrete
embankments being installed on once-scenic riverbanks, for example,
will only have to be removed as the predictably dire effects of
this destruction of nature become evident. Do voters care? App-
arently not. With depressing ease, they are swayed to ignore the
wider public interest and cast their ballots for the force they see
as most likely to keep the public works pipeline full. That usually
is the LDP.

Take Shimane prefecture's first district. More than three decades
ago, the Agriculture Ministry began planning a massive project to
fill in big parts of a large, beautiful lagoon, called Nakaumi,
adjoining the Japan Sea coast. The reason: To provide additional
farmland for the crowded country.

It was not long before the government, to deal with excess rice
production, started paying farmers to stop farming existing
farmland. At that point, naturally the project was dropped, right?
Wrong. The Nakaumi project has proved to have a life of its own.
The prefectural governor ardently supports its continuation, and so
does Hiroyuki Hosoda, a politician who ran on the LDP ticket to
represent the district in the Lower House.

The national and Shimane prefecture governments each year split the
cost of some yen220 billion (US$1.96 billion) worth of public works
projects. That makes the pork barrel a very major element in the
local economy. A construction company owner told Asahi Shimbun
before the election he expected a 40 percent loss in earnings if a
non-LDP government should come to power. Hosoda faced nominees of
the newly-formed Democratic Party and the Communist Party. Both
opposed the Nakaumi project, making it the big local issue in the
race. But all the votes cast for those two other candidates put
together did not equal the tally for the LDP man, who was handily
elected.

The people spoke on Nakaumi, and what they said was: "Fill it in."

To some extent this represents official and popular trust in the
Keynesian notion that a "supplementary budget" of public works
funds - such as the proposed yen5 trillion package the LDP
announced just before election day - can prime the pump and bring
the economy out of a slump. But some economists say this remedy has
proved less effective, to the point where any resulting positive
bounce in the economy is over almost as soon as it has begun.

The ill effects live on - notably an ever larger budget deficit for
succeeding generations to shoulder. Deregulation and cutting
budgets and taxes to leave more money in the hands of consumers
would have far more positive effects.

There are plenty more districts like Shimane's first district,
where the LDP's construction mania carried the day with voters on
Sunday. For example, construction companies squarely backed the
LDP's candidate in Saitama prefecture's 10th, a mixed
bedroom-suburban and rural district that was the focus of an Asia
Times front-page article last Friday. The LDP man squashed the
candidate of the newly-formed Democratic Party.

In Toyama prefecture, the emcee at Tamisuke Watanuki's victory
celebration, before leading three cheers of "Banzai" (long life),
enthused that the victory of the former LDP secretary-general meant
the central government would now give serious thought to building
the Hokuriku bullet train line. The area's pet scheme would be a
dreadfully expensive project whose costs, under the current
share-the-misery policy, would force an increase in fares on
profitable bullet-train routes like Tokyo-Osaka.

Construction's domination of politics could be seen in the raw in
Ibaraki prefecture, where former construction minister Kishiro
Nakamura, awaiting a court ruling on a suspected yen10 million
bribe to put the quietus on a Fair Trade Commission investigation
of construction industry collusion, was re-elected. Nakamura had
formally left the LDP after the allegation came to light, and was
running as an independent. He told voters he had accepted the money
but it had been merely a campaign contribution. He boasted his
presence in office provided an important conduit from the central
government to the district.

At first glance, Kumamoto prefecture's second district may appear
to be an exception to the general rule. There, a loudly
pro-construction LDP candidate - a former Construction Ministry
bureaucrat who vowed to snare central government funds for such
expensive projects as a bullet-train line - went down to defeat at
the hands of a candidate who had attacked that traditional sort of
pork-barrel campaigning. So, were the Kumamoto voters finally
wising up? Guess again. The winning candidate himself had served a
stint as construction minister. And in his brochure, where he
attacked the pork barrel, he also included photos of a bridge, a
train station and other public works projects he took credit for
having landed.

All the parties in the election were talking about "administrative
reform" and about cutting the bureaucracy down to size. Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashi-moto, president of the LDP, even told voters
he knew his place in history would be determined by his success or
failure in carrying out such reforms.

But don't bet the farm that an LDP-led coalition government will
seriously disrupt the comfortable partnership of bureaucrats with
the construction companies and the LDP lawmakers of the
"construction tribe", who protect the ministries' public works
programs in exchange for political funds and get-out-the-vote
backing.

US public responds to Clinton-Riady scandal with a yawn

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 9

by Doug Tsuruoka

With two weeks to go before the United States presidential
election, conservative critics are hoping that a disclosure of
financial donations made to the White House by a prominent
Indonesian family and South Korean business interests will throw a
last-minute glitch into US President Bill Clinton's re-election
campaign.

Yet one puzzling question in the wake of a decision by the
Democratic National Committee (DNC) to suspend a top Asian-American
aide pending a probe of his fund-raising activities with Asian
businessmen is why the issue, so far, has generated only mild
public attention in the 1996 US presidential race. In past
campaigns, the taint of "foreign money" would have been enough to
derail the aspirations of any candidate for the Oval Office.

Many recall the press fallout on then-president Jimmy Carter when
it was divulged in the late 1970s that his brother, Billy, had
close ties with Libyan diplomats and businessmen. But despite the
best efforts of leading US newspapers like the New York Times and
the Los Angeles Times, the Riady scandal is drawing only muted
outrage from a bored US electorate.

The DNC, the national organization of the Democratic Party which is
backing Clinton's re-election bid, announced last week that John
Huang, a vice-chairman of its fund-raising arm, will step aside
following reports that he sought an illegal US$250,000 political
contribution for the Clinton campaign from a South Korean
industrial conglomerate. The contribution - from the South Korean
electronics company, Cheong Am - was returned after it was
uncovered by a local newspaper.

Huang, a former employee of the Riadys and a Democratic fund-raiser
in the key electoral state of California, is also under the
spotlight for his ties to the Riadys - a family of Indonesian
industrialists who control the Lippo Group of companies and who
made a series of apparently legal campaign contributions to Clinton
during his 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns. Huang is also said
to have secured a top appointment to the US Commerce Department
because of his relationship with the Riadys and US Democrats.

The donations by the Riadys and suggestions of favoritism by the
White House emerged against the backdrop of Clinton's efforts to
arrange a billion-dollar sale of US F-16 fighter jets to Indonesia,
a red-carpet reception for Indonesia's President Suharto in
Washington last year and reports the Riadys once tried to enter the
banking industry in Clinton's home state of Arkansas.

But US voters are so apathetic to the issue of foreign money in
this year's election that not one of the "typical" Americans
selected to question Clinton and his Republican opponent Robert
Dole at a presidential debate in California on October 16 bothered
to bring it up.

Participants were so indifferent, in fact, that Dole, frustrated at
the lack of focus on foreign policy matters at the debate last
week, was forced to volunteer a pointed reference to "rich people"
in Indonesia and other foreign countries in a jibe at Clinton's
campaign ethics - though the question posed had nothing to do with
the Riadys or their alleged influence at the White House.

Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to open a
Congressional inquiry into the affair - which is laced with reports
that James Riady, a scion of the Indonesian family, used his
financing clout with the Democrats to arrange a special audience
with Clinton while the president was attending a meeting of top
Southeast Asian leaders in Jakarta in late 1995.

But most Democratic and Republican analysts in Washington have
already concluded the scandal will not do irreparable harm to
Clinton's re-election bid. White House aides, moreover, appear to
have parried the bad publicity by insisting that all contributions
from the Riadys were "legal".

How to explain this absence of interest on the part of the US
electorate? There are three factors which appear to have
contributed to the scandal's non-effect on Clinton.

The first is simply that the flap over the Riadys pales before a
host of other scandals which have hit the White House over the last
four years.

With the president and First Lady Hillary Clinton still under
scrutiny in the so-called Whitewater banking and influence scandal
and its possible link to the still-mysterious suicide of a White
House counsel - the Indonesian-South Korean donations are hardly
the stuff which tabloid headlines are made of.

The Riady affair hardly compares in entertainment value to the
confessions of alleged Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers in the
1992 presidential race and this year's far juicier reports that top
Clinton tactician Dick Morris, the architect of the president's
"family values" campaign pitch, allowed a call girl to listen from
a hotel room to his telephone conversations with the president.

A second factor is the Riady affair is not the first time big Asian
money has been involved in a Washington influence-peddling scheme.

Interestingly, the Riadys appear to have offended far fewer
Americans in the economic growth-obsessed US of the 1990s than was
the case nearly 20 years ago.

In January 1978, a Washington-based South Korean lobbyist, Park
Tong-sun, admitted in Seoul that he had dispensed US$850,000 to a
number of US Congressmen in an affair laced with allegations of
sexual favors which came to be known as the Koreagate scandal.

Former California congressman Rich-ard T Hanna was sentenced to a
prison term for his role in the scandal, while five other house
Democrats were reprimanded in the influence-peddling scheme which
was intended to tilt US politicians in favor of Seoul following an
abrupt US pullout from South Vietnam.

The Koreagate affair stirred anti-foreign sentiment in the US at a
time when the media was rife with reports of Saudi Arabian
businessmen buying up US properties.

But a change seems to have taken place in the US mentality in the
last two decades. A seemingly endless eruption of successor
scandals to the famed Watergate scandal of the early 1970s has
imbued most US voters with a sense of cynical worldliness.

Coupled with the globalization of the US economy since the 1980s
and a renewed search for overseas profits following the recent US
recession, news that a US president cultivated allies and received
legal donations from a Southeast Asian country where the US is
seeking to sell high-tech fighter planes, leaves most Americans
yawning. The Riady affair just does not sound so bad at a time when
the fate of many US firms depends on markets like China and the US
Commerce Department scours the globe searching for contracts for US
companies.

The third factor tempering US political reaction to the Riady
scandal is the rising clout of the Asian-American community.

Whereas two decades ago, Asian-Americans were still viewed as an
invisible minority in US elections, this is no longer the case.
Surging birth rates, disposable incomes, voter registration levels
and improved political organization have made Asian-Americans a
force to be reckoned with on the US political scene - as
illustrated by Huang's elevation to the key Democratic fund-raising
post.

Dole and other Republican critics of the Riady affair have also
meticulously avoided alluding to the scandal in ethnic terms
fearful of alienating potent Asian-American constituencies in
California - a state which Dole must wrest from Clinton if he is to
have any chance of winning the White House in November.

Said Kim Young-kun, a professor of political science at the
Graduate School of the City University of New York: "They cannot
make blanket attacks on Asians anymore with impunity."

Another reason is that the issue of campaign contributions from
foreign sources is a Pandora's box for more than a few Republicans.

"The New York Times pointed out that the Republicans have been
getting money from many foreign companies," Kim noted.

Democratic spokesmen, on the other hand, have played on the
sentiment of minority voters in the US by explaining James Riady's
ties to the Democrats in terms of his interest in civil rights as
a member of Indonesia's ethnic-Chinese minority.

With Asian-Americans assuming a critical role as swing voters in a
fragmented US electorate, it may well be that both Dole and Clinton
want to avoid biting the hand which holds crucial votes in this and
future elections.

According to US analysts, a number of key swing states in the
upcoming presidential election already have sizable numbers of
potential Asian-American voters.

There are 600,000 Asian-Americans in Texas and another 200,000 in
Florida. Asian-Americans also constitute at least one-tenth of the
overall population of California and are growing in numbers in
states like New York, Massachusetts and Illinois.

Julian Weiss, a spokesman for the non-partisan Heritage Foundation
in Washington, said: "In the aftermath of this election, there will
be a far more vigorous attempt by both major parties to mobilize
the Asian-American vote."

Peace prizes and troublemakers

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

On Sunday, Philippine President Fidel Ramos ordered the country's
Bureau of Immigration and Deportation to ban the entry of
individuals suspected of wishing to disrupt the APEC Summit,
scheduled to be held in Manila next month.

Although no direct reference was made, it was believed that the
president's directive included the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize awardee
Jose Ramos Horta. Horta was invited to participate in an
alternative APEC meeting to be held by human rights activists in
the country.

The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has also been ordered
not to issue a visa to anyone who might embarrass the Philippines
as APEC host.

On Monday, Indonesia welcomed Ramos' announcement, saying it would
contribute to the successful outcome of the APEC Summit.

A spokesman said Jakarta did not want any elements of the summit
which might create an embarrassment for the Philippine government.

China hopes to clear the theater

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

In an address to the 51st session of the United Nations General
Assembly last Friday, Chinese Disarmament ambassador Sha Zukang
urged countries concerned to cease immediately the research,
development and deployment of Theater Missile Defense systems
(TMD).

Sha gave two reasons for such an appeal. First, "The so-called TMD
which certain countries are going all-out to develop will in fact
possess the capacity to intercept strategic missiles, thus breaking
the limits imposed by the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and
rendering the treaty virtually meaningless", he said.

The second reason is that the TMD will lead to the proliferation of
advanced missile systems and the related technologies, thus posing
a threat to regional and even global security and stability.

"In a word, there is nothing to gain but everything to lose from
the development of the TMD system," he said.

TMDs in the region are mainly being produced by the United States
for use by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

What if we threw a party?

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

It was supposed to be a gala party. On the occasion of the fifth
anniversary of the Paris Peace Accords, which technically ended the
country's civil war, the Cambodian government hoped to attract
ministers or senior officials from all 19 of the accords'
signatories to a massive celebration outside the royal palace.

The festivities, which were to be held on Wednesday in Phnom Penh,
were likely intended to confirm the legitimacy of the government
that arose from the 1993 United Nations-sponsored elections, head-
ed by royalist First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had led the Vietnamese-backed
Phnom Penh government at the time of the signing.

But alas, it was not to be. For some reason, nobody seems to be all
that interested in Cambodia these days. Of the signatories, only
Malaysia and Laos are sending ministers to the celebration. Six
other countries are offering lower-ranking or retired officials.
The other countries are content to be represented by their
ambassadors to Phnom Penh or not at all.

The United Nations, which presided over the Cambodian elections in
a high-profile mission led by Japan, does not seem particularly
prepared to crow to the world about its success. The organization
will have a presence at the celebrations, but only in the form of
its special representative in Cambodia.

King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia was originally slated to preside
over the festivities, but because of the disappointing turnout, he
has apparently decided to defer that responsibility to the
country's parliamentary chairman, Chea Sim, who usually acts as the
king's regent in his absence from Cambodia.

Japan's father and son acts

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

Rare is the Japanese politician who does not want to build a
dynasty. It has been commonplace for sons of lawmakers to inherit
their fathers' support organizations and as a result, in many
cases, their seats in the parliament. (Where no adult sons are
available, wives are the next choice.)

One dramatic example occurred during the recent campaign in Kobe,
where former health and welfare minister Saburo Toida died just one
week before the election - but five days after he had filed as a
candidate. His son Tooru was chosen as the Liberal Democratic Party
candidate, and went on to win against a strong campaigner from the
opposition Shinshin-to.

But in a macabre twist, the late minister's promotional video,
which he had recorded before his death, was repeatedly broadcast
over NHK Television during the campaign. The reason: Official
campaign regulations prohibit the substitution of a candidate's
film footage after his party has submitted it to the authorities.
All NHK could do was attach an announcement that the senior Toida
had died.

Hard time for ex-bureaucrats

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

Only 14 out of the 41 first-time candidates in this past Sunday's
Japanese parliamentary elections who were formerly bureaucrats
could claim the right to put the much-coveted gold pins on their
jackets when the votes were tallied.

Only one out of eight ex-Finance Ministry officials running for the
first time won in this year's race and no former Health and Welfare
Ministry worker was able to succeed in a maiden campaign.

In a general campaign atmosphere of bureaucrat-bashing, with most
parties pledging to make administrative reform an important
priority, many such candidates were unable to take full advantage
of their illustrious career backgrounds in drumming up support,
even from related private sector organizations, according to Nihon
Keizai Shimbun.

In the past few years, it had become a pattern for at least 60
percent of such ex-bureaucrat candidates to win their debut races.
This year's reversals can be directly traced to the various
recently-unveiled scandals involving a number of previously
sacrosanct government ministries.

The Finance Ministry's solid reputation has been shattered by last
year's financial scandals - specifically the collapse of the seven
jusen housing loan companies and the coverup of US$1.1 billion in
losses resulting from improper bond deals by a Daiwa Bank trader in
New York.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has come under harsh
criticism for allegedly approving the sale of blood products that
ministry officials knew might be contaminated with HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS.

It's time for Britain to rethink its military trade-offs in Asia

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

by Damon Bristow, for Asia Times

Behind the pomp and circumstance of British monarch Queen Elizabeth
II's visit to Thailand at the end of this month is a more
down-to-earth business proposition.

The centerpiece of her stay will be a banquet to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the accession to the throne by His Majesty King
Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. And Prince Philip will also become
the first senior member of the British royal family to go to the
site of the infamous "death railway", where 13,000 prisoners of
war, many of them British and Commonwealth citizens, were interned
by the Japanese during World War II.

Behind the scenes, however, the British royals will also be working
hard to promote British trade relations with Thailand. For a start,
the queen will attend a lunch at the Bank of Thailand. After that
she will visit a major exhibition on commercial links between
Britain and Thailand.

The queen's newfound role as roving ambassador for "United Kingdom
plc" is indicative of the broader change that has occurred in
relations between the United Kingdom and Asia since she last
visited Thailand way back in 1972. At that time, Britain had
effectively withdrawn from the region.

And although the country retained political, economic and military
ties with the region - largely through the Commonwealth - these
were pretty much symbolic.

It's obviously a very different story today. After 25 years of
average economic growth across the region topping six percent a
year, a somewhat previously dormant Europe has finally woken up to
Asia.

In the meantime, many Asian countries are starting to make their
voices heard in the international arena, particularly in the United
Nations and the World Trade Organization.

Add to that the sprouting of regional political and economic
architecture in the years since the end of the Cold War: The ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF), which looks at security matters, and its
trade-related sidekick, the Asia- Pacific Economic Co-operation
(APEC) forum.

Britain has not been able to ignore these developments. In an
acknowledgement of this fact, British Prime Minister John Major
announced in 1994 that every effort would be made to reinvigorate
the country's long-standing relations with the region.

This year a stream of senior British politicians have been doing
the rounds in Asia, talking about trade, politics and security
ties.

British exports to the Asia-Pacific region, as a percentage of
those outside Europe rose from 11.7 percent in 1991 to a little
over 25 percent in 1993. The following year they increased by over
27 percent to a little over &pound;14 billion (US$22.3 billion).
Britain is also the largest European Union investor in the region.
The economic benefits, however, have not only been one way: 41
percent of all Japanese and 47 percent of all South Korean
investments in Europe are in the United Kingdom.

Britain has also moved to underpin this growing economic
relationship by improving political ties. At an institutional
level, for example, every effort is being made to exploit links
with its partners in the Commonwealth and its membership of the EU,
which has had relations with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations since the 1970s.

Bilateral relations, too, have been strengthened. To its credit,
London has been successful in building links with all the most
influential countries in Asia. Group of Seven member Japan has been
the major recipient of Britain's attentions.

The relationship with Tokyo is now so strong that last month,
British Foreign Secretary Malcom Rifkind visited Japan and signed
a groundbreaking Action Agenda for a Special Partnership with his
Japanese counterparts.

The document committed both countries to unprecedented levels of
cooperation in world affairs, economic issues and in fostering
closer links between the UK and Europe.

Relations with South Korea are progressing down a similar track.
And, as the deadline for the handover of Hong Kong approaches, ties
with China have also improved markedly, even though Britain has
made clear its intention to stand up for the territory for a
further 50 years after that.

And although the British government doesn't like to flaunt it,
relations with Indonesia are also pretty close.

With the Hong Kong withdrawal just around the corner, Britain has
stepped up its efforts to convince its partners in the region that
the British armed forces will continue to take an active interest
in Asia's security - unlike its competitors in the EU, Britain has
security links with the region through the Five Power Defense
Arrangement (FPDA), which brings Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand,
Singapore and the United Kingdom together for exercises twice a
year. The country also has historical links due to its
participation in the Korean War.

Recently, British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo announced that
the biggest task force to leave the United Kingdom since the
Falklands War would take part in an upgraded FPDA exercise off the
coast of Malaysia in April next year with the Aircraft carrier
Illustrious at its head. This was followed by a speech in Australia
during which Portillo expressed his belief that

the UK should be made a member of ARF independent of the EU.

Furthermore, when South Korean President Kim Young-sam was in
London, Britain made clear its support of the 1994 October
Declaration between the United States and North Korea, which was
designed to freeze Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. It even
agreed to contribute money to the Korean Peninsula Economic
Development Organization (KEDO) and provided the North with
&pound;150,000 in disaster aid after last year's devastating
floods.

Britain usually justifies its desire to continue playing a security
role in Asia by referring to the fact that the country has large
investments and "long-standing ties" in the region.

In a slightly more roundabout way, it is hoped that showing the
flag might also help the United Kingdom to carve out a larger piece
of Asia's growing markets. The question of whether or not Britain
actually has the ability to deal with a crisis in Asia - say in the
South China Sea or the Korean peninsula - is, however, a moot
point.

According to current British military thinking, after Hong Kong
reverts back to Chinese sovereignty, any military emergency in the
region would be met by the using of the newly-established Joint
Rapid Deployment Force (JRDF), which is specifically designed to
deal with distant regional contingencies. At the core of this force
will be the 3 Commando and 5 Airborne brigades. They, in turn,
would be able to draw on resources from the rest of the armed
forces if required.

The problem is that the British Armed Services are stretched to the
limit at the moment. The total strength of the military has been
reduced steadily from 292,000 in 1992/93, to 250,000 last year. On
top of this, existing commitments mean that Britain has around
17,000 troops in Northern Ireland and just short of 10,500 in
Bosnia. That's not to mention long-standing commitments to security
in the Gulf.

Bearing in mind these constraints, the physical distance between
Asia and the UK and the cost of sending and sustaining a force a
long way from British shores, the chances are that Britain would
not only find it pretty difficult to send a few navy vessels to
patrol the South China Sea, let alone commit ground troops to a
major conflict on the Korean peninsula, but would think twice
before it made such a commitment. Even if they did get there, at
current levels, the chances are any force would be little more than
symbolic.

To the current generation of policy makers in the region that does
not seem to matter: For them, the country's continued security
commitment to the region is essential to justify its position as a
major power with an international reach and global interests as
well as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

That's fine in the short term. In the next few years, however,
Britain will have to decide whether or not it makes sense to retain
its military commitment to the region, even in its current, anemic
form.

To this end, the country might do well to take a leaf out of the
book of its European partners, who have been almost as successful
in securing business in Asia and exercising their influence as
Britain has without making halfhearted commit-ments that they would
be hard pressed to keep. Perhaps the time has finally come for
Britain to follow them down the same route.

Japan: That empty feeling

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

A senior Japanese journalist posted a note to an Internet
discussion group on Monday which constituted the most poignant
commentary on Sunday's election and is worth summarizing.

He was watching the television election programs on Sunday night,
he wrote, and was struck by the historically low voter turnout. It
was beyond his comprehension, given that Japan in the past couple
of years had experienced everything unprecedented, from the near
collapse of its banking system to a major earthquake to a religious
cult's terrorist attack on the Tokyo subway.

The biggest question for him was not how the coalition was going to
be formed, but simply the voters' attitude, which he would not even
call apathy, as that still connoted the existence of individual
decision-making. They just don't care about anything, he suggested,
be it about Ijime in public school systems or about Rodong missiles
that North Korea was reportedly about to launch. How had Japan
gotten this empty, precisely as described in Yukio Mishima's often
cited predictions?

We don't know if the journalist wrote a similar commentary for his
own - one of Japan's biggest - newspapers. If he didn't, he should
have.

It is important not to misunderstand his reference to the novelist
Mishima, the man whose desperate nationalism drove him to publicly
disembowel himself with his samurai sword to rouse his nation. The
reference was surely not intended as an endorsement of Mishima's
eccentric existentialist nationalism. But as C P Snow once wrote,
"Mishima's characters are observed with the sharpest of eyes...
clear, eloquent, visual". His characterization of an "empty Japan"
had that same element of precision.

Just consider some of today's lead news stories out of Tokyo:

l A Japanese finance company filed for liquidation with massive
debt liabilities of more than US$8.8 billion, spurring worries
about the health of other finance companies. The liability figure
makes Nichiei Finance the largest such insolvency case in post-war
Japan.

l United States Central Intelligence Agency director John Deutch
has discussed with Japanese leaders North Korea's reported move to
test-launch the Rodong-1 missile. The missile has a target range of
1,000km, is capable of reaching Japan, and can be fitted with
nuclear or chemical warheads.

l The Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said its
index of economic indicators for August fell below the "boom or
bust" mark for the first time in five months.

l The Liberal Democratic Party said Japan's government would likely
be on hold for at least two weeks until a coalition is stitched
together.

How, in light of such acute and simmering problems, could more than
40 percent of Japanese voters have chosen to spend election day
with such favorite pastimes as autumn leaf viewing or watching a
baseball game, rather than participate in the election of a
political leadership capable of addressing the country's woes.

The unnamed journalist's commentary on his fellow Japanese's state
of mindlessness and his pessimism about the future appear
well-justified.

The Finance Ministry will now roll out the fire brigade and douse
the Nichiei problem, likely at the voters' - or non-voters' -
expense. Japan's Defense Agency chief told reporters he was closely
watching the Rodong test situation, but that none of the
information obtained was "solid". And whatever coalition ends up
being stitched together will likely respond to the bad economic
data with yet another supplementary pork-barrel budget.

On this last issue, one man not re-elected, outgoing EPA
director-general Shusei Tanaka, urged that Japan must press ahead
with economic reform and avoid the easy option of trying to spend
its way out of trouble. But as we said, he was defeated.

One last bit of news: After a year of intense lobbying against
rival India, Japan on Tuesday was given a nonpermanent seat at the
UN Security Council. One wonders what, if anything, the Japanese
representative filling that seat might have to say to the world.

Hyundai wins vote of confidence in Israel

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 7

by Yaroslav Trofimov

South Korea's Hyundai Group is poised to become a major supplier in
the Israeli telecommunications market in the wake of its US$12.5
million deal with the Jewish state's telephone monopoly Bezeq.

Bezeq, whose 1996 annual purchasing budget is roughly US$1 billion,
has ordered from Hyundai 130,000 kilometers of optic fiber for its
cable network modernization program.

The deal was finalized at a meeting between Bezeq's president Isaac
Kaul and Hyundai's manager of planning and electronics departments,
Park Hyeong-sun.

The Korean fiber, which is scheduled to be produced within two
weeks, will be tested on Bezeq's request by the US-based Bellcore
Corporation. Bezeq said that, should these tests be satisfactory,
the company will sign by late 1998 an additional contract for an
undisclosed sum that industry analysts estimated could reach over
US$100 million annually.

Currently, Bezeq buys most of its cable from two Israeli companies,
Cvalim and Kavlei Zion. Only about 15 percent of Bezeq supplies
come from foreign manufacturers, such as Alcatel, Motorola and
Northern Telecom. Hyundai is the first Asian company to make
significant sales to Bezeq.

After opening an office in Tel Aviv in 1994, the Korean giant
racked up more than US$100 million in sales last year to the Jewish
state. The bulk of these exports were Accent and Lantra passenger
cars.

Bezeq's spokesman, Roni Mandelbaum, explained that considerations
of both quality and price prompted his company to turn to Hyundai.
"We have no advantage buying outside of Israel if the product is
not better. Korea is a very long distance away, and if we decided
to go for it, this means that there is an advantage for us there,"
Mandelbaum said.

He added that Hyundai's optic fiber will be used for Bezeq
operations inside Israel and not in its foreign ventures, such as
the troubled Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited
(HFCL)-Bezeq consortium in India.

As Bezeq officials explained, the Hyundai deal is part of the
company's new overall strategy of searching for more cost-effective
suppliers in nontraditional markets, such as Asia.

In accordance with Israel's deregulation program, Bezeq is expected
to lose as early as next year its lucrative monopoly on
long-distance telephone services - which means that it has to
undergo immediate cost-cutting in order to survive the new
competition.

"In the framework of Bezeq's preparation to deal with the
competition, the company must become more efficient in all
sectors," said Kaul.

"One of the central items in company expenses is purchasing costs.
Bezeq will do everything possible to reduce purchasing costs and
tariffs while, of course, preserving the high standard of product
quality," Kaul added.

Several international consortiums, including one led by Korea
Telecom, are bidding for the two licences to run Israel's
alternative long-distance networks.

Asian investors buying into South American bread basket

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 6

by Andrea Mandel-Campbell

After years of neglect, Argentina's agricultural sector is
beginning to grow and Asian countries are among those setting their
sights on the South American country as a potential source of food
for their growing populations.

A handful of Asian countries have quietly begun making tentative
land purchases in Argentina's agriculturally rich interior,
according to Argentine government sources.

Since direct foreign investment is not officially registered in
Argentina it is almost impossible to track the investments, but
sources said Taiwanese investors had acquired farmland near the
capital of Buenos Aires while South Korean interests had chosen the
nearby province of Entre Rios to launch large-scale grain
production.

South Korean conglomerates, including the Daewoo Group and Hyundai
Group, were also taking a serious look at adding farming to their
Argentine investment portfolio, said South Korean sources.

But perhaps the greatest interest is coming from China, where
present direct investment in Argentina is estimated at only US$20
million. About 10 Chinese corporations, including grain
import-export concern Ceroil Foods, were looking at investment
between US$10 million and US$15 million each in farmland, said
Ernesto Fernandez Taboada, executive director of the Argentine
Chamber of Commerce for Southeast Asia.

The Chinese were studying Argentine agricultural regulations and
technology with the aim of harvesting and processing crops in
Argentina for later export to China, said Taboada. To date, they
have acquired "experimental" plots ranging from 300 to 600 hectares
in three provinces to grow grain and cotton Argentina's leading
exports to China along with vegetable and animal-based oils.

"China has decided to make investment in Latin America a priority.
The Chinese know that in the future Latin America is going to be
one of the great food providers while China is going to need a lot
more foodstuffs," said Taboada.

"The living standards of China's growing middle class are rising
every year and with that increase they want to eat more
sophisticated things and a greater variety of them. So the demand
for more and better food is continually increasing and that
obligates China to look outside its borders for reliable providers
of food, among which is Latin America."

The Chinese were also interested in agro-industry, with several
companies looking to establish grain processing plants and
vegetable oil plants, he said.

It is a move the Taiwanese, importers of Argentine grain, soya,
corn and cotton, have already made. Taipei's Winluck Industries,
owned by entrepreneur Sheng Hsiung Ho, is getting set to build a
second processing plant in Argentina for US$35 million that will
process corn, soya and peanuts. And the Chaintech Group recently
said it signed an accord with the Argentine province of Tucuman to
build a US$50 million fruit plant.

"A lot of Taiwanese see the potential of the food industry here and
a lot of people are looking for investment opportunities," said
Alfonso Yio-Yih Tao, director of the economic division of the
Taipei commercial and cultural office.

Grain and other foodstuffs are also high on the list of Argentina's
largest Asian trading partner, Japan. Also, Argentina's most
important Asian investor, the Japanese, who have so far focused on
car plants, are beginning to turn their attention to agriculture.

During the last meeting of the business-based Argentine-Japanese
Mixed Committee, the Japanese concluded that Argentina "was a
reliable provider of high-quality products, had become a
particularly attractive site for agricultural and agro-industry
investment, especially in view of Mercosur [Southern Common
Market]".

Being the largest grain supplier to Mercosur, the customs zone made
up of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Argentina held a
major attraction as well for investment mogul George Soros.

In 1994 Soros' Quantum Industrial Partners bought a 40 percent
share in Cresud, a commodities producer based in Argentina.

Since then, Cresud has increased its holdings from 20,000 to
346,000 hectares of croplands and forests, and more than doubled
its livestock to become the country's leading commodities producer.

The influx of market capital and investment in technology has
helped trigger a rebirth of the long-neglected industry which has
suffered from years of over taxation and hyper-inflation.

"Last year Argentine GDP fell 4.4 percent whereas agriculture grew
more than nine percent - it's a sector in full expansion. We're
seeing 100 percent growth in all areas, from fertilizers and
irrigation systems to tractor sales," said Cresud director
Alejandro Elsztain.

"We had many bad years and for many years we have been behind, but
now we are beginning to see a turnaround. We are rediscovering what
we have."

And what Argentina has is a distinct comparative advantage,
according to Elsztain, when it comes to land. The country still
possesses vast tracts of undeveloped land at cheap prices, selling
for half to one-fifth the price of equivalent quality land in North
America and Europe. And with few countries in a position to
increase production levels as global consumption rises, Elsztain
predicts Argentina will once again become a leading global exporter
of grains and milk.

"Asia, along with Russia, are going to be the markets that will
make us into major exporters and will become very rich markets for
us," said Elsztain.

Innovation the key to sporting goods empire

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 6

by M Shankar

Jagdev Singh was distraught on the day he opened his first shop in
Singapore. By early afternoon, not a single thing had been sold.

"I was a dead man," he said.

Not quite. That store was the first of 218 outlets that, 17 years
later, sprawl across Southeast Asia and are part of a S$300 million
(US$210 million) sporting goods empire.

Singh, or J S Gill as he prefers to be called, introduced a number
of innovations to Singapore retailers, including the concept of
fixed pricing instead of bargaining individually with each
customer.

He reckons half of the sporting goods now sold on the island come
from his Royal Sporting House outlets.

The family-owned business of this 42-year-old, who dreamed as a boy
of owning a pair of Adidas shoes, is the exclusive distributor for
Reebok products in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines
and Brunei, and retails 27 other top-of-the-line brands, ranging
from Wilson and Spalding to Speedo and Lacoste.

The Indian entrepreneur left home at the age of 24, with plans to
become an engineer. His family did not approve.

"My father thought that I would come back," he said.

Indeed, Gill's career plans did not work out, and he fell back on
the only thing he knew well - sporting goods, in which he had
worked for his father.

But rather than return to the family business, he struck out on his
own.

He was aided early on by the reputation of his father, whose
Indonesia-based business bought sporting goods in Singapore.

Gill had no money to stock his first store, but wholesalers and
distributors who knew his father agreed to accept checks post-dated
by 30 days.

So he opened a checking account with S$100 and bought about
S$60,000 in sporting goods to stock his 30 square meter shop at
Lucky Plaza, on Singapore's fashionable Orchard Road.

"I had the best merchandise," said Gill. "The shop was beautifully
done. On November 23, 1979, I opened the business thinking I would
do the sales and deposit the money and the thing would start
rolling."

But by 1.00pm on the first day of business he had not sold a thing.

"I said: 'Bloody hell, I am dead now. What am I going to do? The
checks will not be honored'." He added: "Anyhow, when you are at
that stage, you've got nothing to lose. The guy can't hang you -
basically he would have taken back the goods."

At any rate, it was not a problem, the moribund morning was
followed by a robust afternoon with sales totaling S$3,500.

"That was my first day collection. I said to myself: 'Now, there is
no looking back'."

Over the next nine years he gradually expanded his business into 15
outlets.

"He spearheaded a lot of retail concepts that were new to the
industry [in Singapore], like fixed prices and visually-appealing
in-store merchandising," said Jeffrey Bose, president of Sing-
apore's Sports Goods Dealers Association and managing director of
Hwa Kay Thai, a regional group that licenses the Puma brand in
seven countries.

"That was groundbreaking. Today 75 percent of sports good retailers
sell on fixed price and a lot of people have a lot to thank Gill
for."

But big-time success came in 1988, when Gill was granted the
regional distributorship for Reebok.

Gill was up against such heavyweights as Britain's Inchcape,
Malaysia-based Sime Darby and others. But he was resolute. "I was
chasing them, especially during the big trade shows held every
year," Gill said.

He also had the dream, harking back to his childhood love for their
shoes, of acquiring the Adidas franchise.

Gill drew up a business plan in 1987. He made one copy for Adidas
and another for Reebok. He then went with a member of his staff to
Germany to attend the Ispo trade fair, near Munich.

He saw a long queue of people eager to meet Reebok executives.

"Reebok then was the hottest thing going. Adidas was a 50-year-old
company - stable but sliding down," said Gill.

When his turn came, Gill went into a room with the Reebok export
director.

"He saw my face, he said: 'Okay this is your plan? Fine, put it
here, we will contact you'. He took my plan, there was a big box,
and he just dumped it there," said Gill.

Next he visited Adidas.

Gill, who was already doing some business with the German-based
sporting goods maker, said the company gave him a patient hearing
and told him they were not happy with their franchise arrangements
in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Three months later, Adidas told Gill they would like to talk with
him further, at the upcoming trade fair in Atlanta, about a
proposal to grant him the distributorship for the region.

As about the same time the letter from Adidas arrived in Singapore,
so did Reebok president Joe Foster.

Royal Sporting House was already a key player in Singapore's
upscale sporting goods market. Walking through the city's retail
district, Foster was impressed with the displays and merchandise in
Gill's stores, and telephoned him.

"He was staying at the Raffles Hotel, I still remember. He called
me and I went running to see him," said Gill with a laugh.

Foster had not even seen the plan Gill had submitted at the Ispo
fair, but having seen his stores, he asked if Gill was interested
in becoming Reebok's distributor, and they agreed to discuss it
further in Atlanta.

Arriving in the United States, Gill met an Adidas representative in
Atlanta's Mariott Hotel the day before the trade show was to begin,
and was offered a distributorship.

Walking back across the street to his own room in the Hilton,
Adidas' letter of intent in hand, he ran into Reebok's president.

Foster told Gill he wanted to meet him the following morning. "
'But more or less I have made up my mind. We want to go with you',"
Gill recalled Foster saying.

"When I was putting the two plans [together], my staff member had
warned me: 'Mr Gill... what happens if both of them come back to
you?' I said: 'That will never be possible. We are so small, they
are giants'."

Back in Singapore with two letters of intent, Gill called for a
vote among his staff to decide which franchise to accept. They
voted for the more established company - Adidas.

But Gill's heart was in Reebok: "I said, this is hot, it will grow
and it will help us to grow faster."

Two months later, he was still in a quandary. Finally, he wrote the
names of the companies on two pieces of paper and told his
six-year-old daughter to pick one.

"I told her, whatever is your luck, let it be so. So she picked up;
it was Reebok. I said, okay we go with Reebok. That is a decision
made, and it was destiny."

And the business took off. Spreading across Southeast Asia, Royal
Sporting House now has 153 outlets outside Singapore, as well as
manufacturing facilities making swimwear and other sports apparel
in Banting in the Malaysian state of Selangor.

Two years ago, he launched his own footwear brand, Ogaan, in
Indonesia.

Along the way, Gill won the Singapore Enterprise of the Year Award
in 1993, the International Sports Retailer of the Year Award in
1994 and the Speciality Store of the Year Award in 1995.

Gill still does not have any partners or shareholders. He manages
the business with his wife and a team of professionals and never
involves himself in joint ventures in which he does not have a
controlling stake. Even in a sporting-good distribution joint
venture with Indonesia's multibillion dollar Gajahtunggal group, he
owns a majority stake.

"J S Gill has a general feel and gut instinct about the sporting
goods industry and his entrepreneurial instincts are very strong,"
said Bill Sweeney, vice-president for Reebok Inter- national.

Sweeney explained that there was no conflict in the fact that Gill
sells brands made by Reebok's competitors.

"There is a difference between a retail stockist and a distributor.
It is also a challenge for us [Reebok] to make our brand more
attractive vis-a-vis other brands displayed in a selling
environment.

Gill added: "I cannot distribute any other brand except Reebok, but
I can stock all the other brands, including Nike [Reebok's main
competitor], in my retail stores."

But Gill has also suffered setbacks. About seven years ago he
opened a specialty 12-outlet chain called Big Foot Little Foot,
selling fashionable and trendy footwear for Singaporeans and
Indonesians of all ages. It closed two years later.

"I think you have to take failure in life and move on," said Gill.

Indeed, in the past two years he has begun diversifying into the
fashion industry once again.

Other innovations may not be paying off now, but Gill said he was
taking a long-term view and did not cling to demands for immediate
commercial viability.

One such venture is his Golf House mobile workshop, which will
polish and repair golf clubs right on the golf course.

"One of his strengths is he is not afraid to try something new,"
said Sweeney. "And if a concept does not work, he is also quick to
take corrective action and address his mistakes. Like when he went
on a retail expansion spree in Singapore, he quickly realized that
he was making a mistake and refocused on smaller volumes but better
quality."

Bose of the Sports Goods Dealers Association added: "That he is not
afraid of trying does not go against him."

Gill plans to expand to other markets when the timing is right.

"I will be ready to go into India, when India takes off," he said,
though he said he thought China, with its many shopping malls, had
a better retail setup for the time being, adding that an offer was
on the table for him to start a joint venture there.

Although Gill's father, who died last March, had not approved of
him striking out on his own, he ultimately approved of his son's
undertakings.

"My father was very proud of me," said Gill. As for not supporting
him at first, he said: "I don't blame him... the world is changing
and I don't think my children will necessarily listen to me.

"Maybe the world was changing at that time, and my father was not
ready to accept that. I always wanted to be a free, young man and
independent, and do something on my own. It was not that it was the
reason to break up from the family, but it was the idea to do your
own thing."

He said he had enough of taking direction from others. "I went
through that. So, I told myself - get out!"

Another reason for his leaving home, he said, was that, at that
age, you have nothing to fear because you have nothing to lose.

As for the future, Bose said he saw competition on Gill's home turf
growing stronger.

"The closest competitor to Royal Sporting House would be World of
Sports, belonging to the Ossia Group, which started just four to
five years back but is one of the fastest growing companies," Bose
said.

Gill does not express concern, however. With a growing legion of
people in Asia interested in sports, he hopes his recipe of local
expertise and strong entrepreneurial skills will keep his cash
registers ringing.

US Fed explores scandal avoidance measures

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 5

by Gene Koprowski

United States officials are examining new measures aimed at
averting trading scandals such as the Daiwa Bank losses and the
collapse of Barings.

Failure to comply with the measures would result in institutions
facing censure through public disclosure - and corresponding
implications in credit ratings and raising capital - rather than
straightforward financial penalties.

Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago were finalizing
a study for December release which examined whether the Federal
Reserve should impose public disclosure requirements on banks that
traded derivatives and futures, government officials said.

The study was undertaken because of the Fed's concern that a
trading scandal, similar to the Barings and Daiwa Bank crises or
the Sumitomo copper losses, could undermine US financial markets.

As talks proceed, former copper trading king Yasuo Hamanaka was
arrested on Tuesday on charges that he forged documents to create
secret trading accounts. The arrest came after Sumitomo Corp filed
a legal complaint against Hamanaka, its former chief copper trader,
who it blamed for a US$2.6 billion loss from unauthorized copper
deals.

Douglas Evanoff, a senior economist and assistant vice-president at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said the completed report on
improving public disclosure would be discussed as the basis for
possible regulation with the other member banks of the Federal
Reserve System. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as
well as the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory
Practices - an organization of the world's central bankers - will
also be consulted.

The idea was first floated internally earlier this year at the Fed
by economists Paul Kubiak and Jim O'Brien in Washington. Staff at
the Chicago branch of the Fed, one of 12 regional banks in the
Federal Reserve System, picked up the idea and developed it
further.

By midyear they convinced Michael Moskow, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Chicago, to discuss the idea in a speech about
derivatives, and in subsequent remarks, Evanoff said.

"We think it is something that can influence their behavior when
institutions realize their name has been made public," he said.
"We're trying to develop the optimal penalty structure."

The central bankers, simultaneously, are eyeing a pilot program,
launched last month by the New York Clearing House Association -
the international organization of banks which clear trades in the
US. The program serves as an experiment with the idea of
disclosure.

Evanoff said the pilot program was starting to collect data, which
would be useful in determining the efficacy of the plan. The first
phase of the plan would run through the fourth quarter. "All of
this sounds great conceptually, but we want to see if the idea is
viable in implementation," he said. The pilot program was first
mentioned in June.

Moskow said: "Bank capital, and ultimately the Bank Insurance Fund,
is at risk if the value of a bank's trading book falls rapidly due
to a sudden change in market prices. Fears of a bank collapse
triggered by such changes have been exacerbated by the increased
use of derivatives.

"Consider the collapse of Barings last year, which was the result
of a high-stakes bet on the direction of Japanese stocks using
derivatives traded on the SIMEX [Singapore International Monetary
Exchange] and the Osaka exchange... If improperly used, derivatives
make it easier for an imprudent institution to damage itself, the
Bank Insurance Fund and the safety and soundness of the financial
services sector," he said.

Evanoff said the pilot program was helping the participants several
unnamed financial institutions - examine their present exposure to
risk from derivatives and just how much they should allocate to
cover that risk. Insiders said the first phase ran through this
quarter and it was likely to be extended for more than a year
beyond that.

What are the reporting requirements of the pilot program? According
to David Marshall, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago, banks involved in the New York pilot program pre-commit to
a certain level of risk for each quarter of the year.

For example, if the bank thinks the worst loss it can have in
derivatives trading during the forthcoming quarter is US$10
million, it informs regulators of that risk level. Then, at the end
of the quarter, regulators and bank officials meet to determine how
well the bank met its projections.

During the pilot program, reporting would be done on a quarterly
basis. But reporting requirements had not been finalized, Marshall
said. "The frequency of the reporting has not been worked out yet.
Some regulators want daily reporting requirements. But that may be
too onerous for banks."

The risk-based capital requirements adopted by the Basel Committee
in 1989 did not apply to off-balance sheet items, or trading book
assets. However, off-balance sheet items present a potentially
substantial risk. In the Barings case, market prices of derivatives
moved rapidly and devastated the net worth of that bank. "Clearly
there should be capital charges made to protect the system as a
whole against declines in the value of these securities," Marshall
said.

Banks would use computer programs to determine their level of risk
based upon their outstanding level of securities. "This is known as
the internal models approach," Marshall said. "Basically, the
regulator asks the bank: 'How risky is your portfolio? You tell us,
using the best tools you have.' Basically, they give us a value of
risk number."

The idea is that regulators will let the banks tell them what is
the maximum loss their portfolio will take over a threemonth
period. "What is the worst they can do over three months? That's
what we would want to know," Marshall said. "Then they take that
dollar amount, say US$10 million. They pre-commit not to lose any
more than that amount. Make that their capital charge. They have to
have enough capital set aside so that capital completely absorbs
their loss.

"Then, if the loss from derivatives exceeds that pre-committed
loss, the disclosure penalty is put into place.

"They're simultaneously choosing the risk of their portfolio and
the capital to set aside against that risk. And if we set that
penalty function correctly, then we should get them to do that in
a way which meets safety and stability requirements of regulators
and risks to the bank insurance fund," Marshall said.

US regulators are currently limited in the actions they can take on
derivatives risks and they want to try out measures to mitigate the
risks for the US financial system. Immediately following Sumitomo's
announced loss in September, the Fed took steps to determine the
size and nature of US bank exposures to the trading company and to
the copper market.

Several banks had trading or financing transactions with Sumitomo
relating to its copper trading and were owed payments by Sumitomo
in connection with those transactions. In the future, the
government would like to regulate that kind of credit risk as well.

Evanoff said although the proposed disclosure requirements were not
going to be placed on trading companies themselves, public
disclosure of risks at banks which lend to them hopefully would
continue to strengthen their internal auditing and information
systems.

"The well-publicized losses at Barings, Daiwa, Sumitomo and others
have all derived from violations of fundamental, managerial
principles of control, such as those dealing with the recording of
all positions and the adequate separation of duties. Managements
must build and maintain adequate systems for controlling risks,
whether they operate bank or non-bank institutions," said Fed board
member Susan Phillips, in Congressional testimony three weeks ago.

Dmitrius Papadimitriou, executive director of the Jerome Levy
Economics Institute, a regulatory issues think tank in Ithaca, New
York, said the proposal provided a level of "transparency" that had
been sorely lacking in the derivatives world. "It actually
encourages banks to improve their risk-assessment and
risk-management technologies," he said.

"What's more, there is no need for the regulators to impose a model
of portfolio risk in setting regulatory capital." Regulators need
only to verify initially that the bank has an adequate
risk-management structure in place, to review the bank's
profit-and-loss information.

Another benefit was that the proposal did not impose a "top-down"
regulatory structure from the federal govern- ment, but a
market-oriented approach, he said.

Financing of commodity and derivatives deals is not a new activity
for US banks. They have been involved in financing commodity
activities through their agriculture lending programs directed at
the production and sale of agricultural products, both domestically
and abroad.

More than one-quarter of all US banks have farm loans in excess of
25 percent of their total loans.

Unlike the banks' more traditional functions, their trading of
commodity derivatives, such as copper, gold and silver, has
increased in recent years, largely for the same reasons trading
activities, in general, have grown - expanded international trade,
increased demand for hedging instruments and improved methods for
managing and controlling risk and advances in computerization and
communications technology.

What impact will the study on derivatives regulation likely have
when it is released in six weeks?

Evanoff believes "this is the best way to regulate, on an
incentive-compatible basis." Marshall said: "This is a radical
departure from the command-and-control regulation structure where
we say: Hold this amount of capital and that's it. Banks tell us
how much of a capital loss they can pre-commit to."

US$8.8 billion bubble bursts

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Richard Hanson

More than half a decade after Japan's property market began to
collapse, the bubbles are still bursting.

But the latest collapse - that of Nichiei Finance under the weight
of yen1 trillion (US$8.8 billion) in debt - serves to illustrate a
huge gap in how Japan reacts to an ordinary bursting bubble and a
bubble with strong political interest involved.

Just about everyone in Japan knows the story of the liquidation
earlier this year of a group of seven jusen housing loan companies.
They collapsed with trillions of yen in bad loans, a messy process
that ended up requiring an infusion of taxpayer money by elected
politicians.

Then there is the story of Nichiei Finance. Nichiei Finance, a
subsidiary of Nichiei Co, was established in 1972 and listed its
stock on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1991.

On Tuesday, Nichiei Finance, a long-troubled medium-sized financing
company, earned its place in the record books of bankruptcy by
declaring itself broke with the largest bubble of potential bad
debt in Japan's history, showing how long it is taking for Japan to
shake off its bubbled past.

The possible bad debt is larger than the previous biggest
bankruptcy - yen590 billion left by Muramoto Construction in 1993
- and even larger than the yen685 billion ponied up by parliament
earlier this year to help liquidate the jusen, although
collectively the jusen debts were larger.

Nichiei Finance was bad news for its main creditors and
shareholders, including three of Japan's largest bank's and its
well-known (solvent) parent company, Nichiei Co, which is also in
the loan business.

They had tried to rescue the company since 1993, but the continued
fall in Japan's property prices thwarted their efforts. The debts
were just too large.

Financial institutions have loaned yen170.9 billion - about half by
Dai-Ichi Kangyo (DKB), Asahi Bank and the Bank of Yokohama - to
Nichiei Finance, which has applied for court protection under the
bankruptcy laws. The parent company will post a loss of yen12.3
billion as a result.

Dai-Ichi had yen56.9 billion in loans to Nichiei Finance, while
Asahi had yen32.2 billion and the Bank of Yokohama yen20.3 billion,
bank officials said.

"DKB, Asahi and Bank of Yokohama have manageable exposures as their
write-offs in conjunction with this fiasco will only reach about 20
percent of their expected total asset disposal amount this year,"
ING Barings Securities said.

The real "bubbles" in Nichiei Finance are the yen820 billion in
loan guarantees it extended mostly to real estate customers, the
value of whose collateral has also crashed. About yen100 billion is
a total loss, while much of the rest is dubious.

So where is the political angle?

There is none. Bar a few knock-on bankruptcies in what is known as
the non-banking sector of financing firms, there is little chance
that Nichiei Finance, the biggest financial bankruptcy in Japan's
history, will produce more than a loud drop in the black hole of
Japan's property market. There are no depositors at risk.

So why were the jusen such a big deal?

They too were just housing loan companies gone wild in the era of
property speculation, with no depositors.

The difference was that the biggest lenders to the jusen, it turned
out, were a large number of agricultural cooperatives, who blithely
lent trillions of yen to the jusen, most of which was going to be
lost, threatening their solvency.

Agricultural cooperatives did have depositors, mostly farmers, who
had the political clout to mobilize the support of the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), which depends heavily on the farm vote.

The LDP fixed it so that the agricultural cooperatives would not
lose any of the money that they loaned to the jusen, and would get
off with a token payment to help with the liquidation of those
companies.

The farmers were grateful, of course. In Japan's general election
on Sunday, they helped return the LDP to a more secure position as
the largest party in the Lower House of parliament.

Nichiei Finance should have such friends as friends of its lenders.

Nissho Iwai to develop coal mines in Australia+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Nissho Iwai Corp., a major trading house, said Monday it will
develop a group of coal mines in Australia's New South Wales state,
with total output estimated to reach 10 million tons after the year
2000.
     Nissho Iwai has established a joint venture company with South
Korea's state-run electric power corporation, its largest steelmaker
Pohang Iron and Steel Co., and nine other South Korean firms as well
as with Coal Operations Australia Ltd. (COAL), a Sydney-based mining
company.
     The joint firm is 48% owned by the South Korean group, 42% by
COAL and 10% by Nissho Iwai.
     The joint company has obtained from the state government of New
South Wales the right to explore coal deposits at the Wyong coal
mine -- made up of a 190-square-kilometer northwestern area and a
60-sq.-km eastern area, Nissho Iwai said.  Total deposits are
estimated at 1.6 billion tons.
     It will also double annual coal production capacity at a group
of mines in Wallarah adjacent to the Wyong mine to 3 million tons by
1998 at a cost of 67 million Australian dollars, or about 5.1 billion
yen, it said.
     The joint firm will conduct a feasibility study for the Wyong
mine next year at a cost of 18 million Australian dollars, or about
1.4 billion yen, and intends to launch commercial production as early
as 1999, Nissho Iwai said.  Output is expected to top 6 million tons
after the year 2000.

Casio Computer to jointly make pagers in India+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Casio Computer Co. will set up a joint venture in India next
February with Japanese trading firm Mitsui and Co. and India's
Bharti Telecom Ltd. to manufacture and sell pagers in the country, a
Casio official said Monday.
     Casio Bharti Mobile Communications Ltd. will be established in
New Delhi with capital of 200 million rupees (about 630 million yen),
the official said.
     Casio will own a 51% stake in the company, while Bharti Telecom
will hold a 40% share and Mitsui the remaining 9%, he said.
     In fiscal 1996, the company hopes to sell around 26,000 pagers
valued at some 3 billion yen.  By fiscal 1996, production is targeted
at around 600,000 pagers a year, the official said.
     The paging service that began in India in May this year has
proved highly popular and the market there is expected to grow to
about 1.5 million pagers a year by fiscal 1996, he said.
     Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands and Motorola Inc. of
the United States have already begun local production in India, he
added.

Mitsubishi to boost transmission output in Philippines+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Mitsubishi Motors Corp. will increase transmission production
in the Philippines by 50% starting in 1997, a company official said
Monday.
     The major Japanese automaker's Philippine affiliate, Asian
Transmission Corp., will begin building a new factory early next year
with an assembly capacity of 234,000 units a year, the official said.
     A factory which currently makes 156,000 transmissions and 36,000
engines mainly for the Philippine and Japanese markets will be shut
down after the new one starts operations in 1997, the official said.
     The new factory will also continue to make 36,000 engines, he
said.
     Mitsubishi will spend 2 billion yen on construction of the new
factory, he said.
     The transmissions to be made at the new factory will be exported
to Thailand and Taiwan as well as to Japan, the official said.

Lion to begin feasibility study on Vietnamese market+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Dentifrice and synthetic detergent maker Lion Corp. will launch
a feasibility study in the Vietnamese market early next year, a
company official said Monday.
     The decision was made to catch up with rival maker Kao Corp.,
which recently announced establishment of a company in Vietnam to
prepare for production of such products as shampoos starting in 1997,
the official said.
     Lion has already signed a deal with a major Japanese trading
house to jointly launch the study on the household products market in
the country and search for a Vietnamese business partner, the
official said.
     Lion will make a decision whether to enter the Vietnamese market
within one or two years, he said.
     Lion entered the Thai market in 1958, its first foothold on the
Asian mainland, and currently makes detergents and other products in
six Asian countries, including China, the official said.

Japan to provide food aid to N. Korea+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan plans to provide food aid to North Korea after consulting
with the United Nations and South Korea, a top government spokesman
said Monday.
     ''We cannot overlook a neighboring country's trouble,'' Chief
Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press conference.
     He referred to a prediction recently released by a South Korean
government think tank that says North Korea will face its worst food
crisis ever around June or July next year.
     North Korea will see a grain supply shortfall of some 3.5
million tons, and there even is a possibility of people being
displaced and fleeing to neighboring countries, according to the
report.
     A U.N. report recently said that people in many parts of North

     Shin Dai-Ichi Vinyl Corp. is planning to offer technology on
the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to Indonesia-based P.T.
Siam Maspion Polymers, a company official said Monday.
     The Japanese company was chosen from eight polyvinyl chloride
makers which bid to give technology to the firm, set up jointly by

     The company was established in July from the integration of the
polyvinyl chloride departments of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Nippon Zeon
Co. and Tokuyama Corp.
     The Indonesian polyvivyl chloride market is predicted to expand
to 282,000 tons in 1995 and 422,000 tons in 2000 from 260,000 tons in

Star TV plans to enter the Japanese market+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Hong Kong's Satellite Television Asian Region Ltd. (Star TV)
plans to enter the Japanese market in April, industry sources said
Monday.
     The move comes after Japan's Posts and Telecommunications
Ministry earlier decided to allow international broadcasting via
satellite beginning in April.  Currently, foreign broadcasting firms
must enter the Japanese market through tie-ups with Japanese firms.
     The major Hong Kong satellite company will offer services to
hotels, schools and cable TV stations in Japan, the sources said.
     Star TV will begin broadcasting a program specially produced for
the market using the Japanese language, they said.
     Star TV began offering international broadcasting services via
satellite in 1991 to the Asian and Middle East countries, and
currently provides 24-hour news, sports and entertainment broadcasts
in English and other languages on five channels reaching more than 50
countries.
     The Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) is broadcasting its programs
via satellite to other countries in the region as well.

Marubeni signs multimillion dlr power deal in Vietnam+

HANOI, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     An international consortium including Japan's Marubeni Corp.
has entered into a contract with the Vietnam Power Corp. to build a
286-megawatt gas turbine power plant in a southern province,
official media reported Monday.
     The daily Vietnam News said the contract for the 101 million
dollar turnkey project, to be funded by the World Bank, was signed on
Saturday.
     The consortium formed between Marubeni and the Swedish power
company ABB Generation beat eight other competitors, including
Mitsubishi Corp. with Itochu Corp., Mitsui and Co. with the Britain's
John Brown and Sumitomo Corp. with General Electric of the United
States.
     The project calls for construction of the Phu My 2 power plant
in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province, 60 kilometers southeast of Ho Chi Minh
City.
     The plant, to be powered by natural gas tapped and transported
from fields off the Ba Ria-Vung Tau coast, will have two gas turbine
generators in the first phase, which are scheduled to become
operational by early 1997.
     In the second stage of the project, generating capacity will be
increased to 600 megawatts.
     The report said electricity demand in Vietnam is projected to
rise around 15% a year from now through the next 10 or 20 years.  It
said Vietnam plans to meet this demand by boosting generation to as
much as 26-29 billion kilowatt hours by 2010.

summer to respond to strong demand in Southeast Asia, a company
spokesman said Tuesday.
     The company's subsidiary in Thailand, Seikosha (Thailand) Co.,

Seikosha is planning to transfer production of all of these to its
Thailand subsidiary by the end of fiscal 1998, the spokesman said.
     In the future, it will be boosting production in Japan of
''intelligent'' time clocks that can be connected to personal
computers and hold information such as on workers' salaries, he said.

Chiyoda to offer plan to develop Myanmar's 2nd city+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Chiyoda Corp. will propose a development plan for the city of
Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, a company official said
Tuesday.
     Under the plan, the plant engineering company will propose
about 60 projects with priority orders as well as infrastructure
improvement projects in a 150-page report submitted to city
authorities, the official said.
     The plan aims to develop Mandalay into a larger city with a
population of 3.5 million by 2020, almost three times its current
population, he said.
     The proposal includes construction of oil pipelines from the
Bay of Bengal to the central Myanmar city and improvement in the
network of roads between Mandalay and the neighboring Yunnan
Province of China, the official said.
     Chiyoda sent three experts to Mandalay for a preparatory study
in September and began to make the plan voluntarily, the official
said.
     Since then, Chiyoda has submitted to the city authorities
several interim reports on how to develop Mandalay according to the
authorities' requests, the official said.
     Chiyoda hopes to receive orders from the city government for the
pipeline and other related projects proposed in the plan, he said.

Foreign investment in Vietnam tops 18 bil. dlr mark+

HANOI, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Cumulative foreign direct investment in Vietnam up to 1995 has
exceeded the 18 billion dollar mark, a Vietnamese business daily
reported Tuesday.
     The Saigon Times Daily attributed the information to Ministry of
Planning and Investment sources.
     It said the 18 billion dollar mark was surpassed after a record
6.08 billion dollars was invested in Vietnam from the beginning of
the year up to Dec. 20.
     That 1995 figure is almost double the 3.5 billion dollars
invested in 1994.
     The report said the cumulative total, which includes a legal
capital of 9 billion dollars, has been invested since Jan. 1988, when
Vietnam first opened its economy to foreign investors.
     The report said Taiwan retained its lead with 3.01 billion
dollars worth of investments, while Japan rose up the ladder to
secure second place with 1.78 billion dollars.
     Closely trailing Japan were Hong Kong with 1.74 billion dollars
and Singapore with 1.73 billion dollars.
     Filling out the top 10 list were South Korea (1.48 billion
dollars), the British Virgin Islands (1.14 billion dollars), Malaysia
(840 million dollars), Australia (760 million dollars), the United
States (690 million dollars) and France (600 million dollars).

Suntory to expand beer, soft drink sales in China+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japan's top whiskey maker Suntory Ltd. said Tuesday it will
expand beer and soft drink sales in China through new joint ventures
with Chinese partners.
     The Osaka-based company said it has signed an agreement with
Shanghai Sugar Cigarette and Wine (Group) Co. to launch a joint
venture, Shanghai Suntory Brewery Co., in January to produce and
market beer in Shanghai.
     The Chinese partner is a leading state-run enterprise
established in 1950 to distribute alcoholic beverages and food
products, the company said.
     Under the agreement, the partner's subsidiary, Shanghai Jiangnan
Brewery, will expand its existing plant and equipment for the
production of new beer for sale under a local brand name, the company
said.
     The plant's annual capacity will be raised to 100,000 kiloliters
by 1998 and to 200,000 kl by 2005 from the present 30,000 kl, the
company said.
     The agreement also calls for the joint venture to upgrade
production technology to produce beer for sale under the Suntory
label in the future, the company said.
     Total investment is estimated at 5 billion yen, it said.
     Suntory entered China's beer market in 1984 by setting up a
joint venture in Jiangsu Province.  The project, China Jiangsu
Suntory Food Co., has already emerged as the top beer company in the
province, the company said.
     The company said Shanghai Suntory Brewery will give Suntory an
overwhelming share of the beer market in the Shanghai area.
     The company said it has also agreed with Shanghai Maling Food
Co. to establish a joint soft drink venture.
     The new firm, Shanghai Suntory-Maling Foods Co., will start
producing Suntory-brand soft drinks in the fall of 1996.
     Initially, the new company will produce oolong tea and an orange
drink both in cans and heat-resistant PET bottles.
     It will mark the first appearance of heat-resistant PET bottled
soft drinks in the city, the company said.
     Annual sales are forecast at one million cases in fiscal 1997,
rising to 3.8 million cases by 2001, it said.

Japan unlikely to resume Iran yen loans by end of '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japan is unlikely to lift a freeze on official loans to Iran
before the U.S. presidential election is over in November next year,
a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday.
     The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Japan
cannot resume extension of its low-interest official credits unless
Iran tries more seriously to improve its relations with other
countries, especially the United States.
     The Japanese stance is apparently intended to ward off possible
criticism from abroad of its policy on Iran, which the U.S. and many
other countries view as a major backer of international terrorism.
     It is feared that Japan's resumption of yen-denominated lending
to Iran now would make U.S. policy toward Japan a major issue in the
presidential campaign and strain ties between Tokyo and Washington.
     At stake is the second installment of 48.5 billion yen in
Japan's yen credit package for the construction of a hydroelectric
power plant on the River Karun in southern Iran.
     Tokyo has suspended its provision of yen loans to Tehran since
May 1993, when it supplied 38.6 billion yen in the first installment
of finance for the project.

Philippines to cut tariffs on 155 products in '96+

MANILA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Philippines will lower import tariffs on some 155 products
next year as part of an accelerated program to create a free trade
market in Southeast Asia by 2003, Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) documents said Tuesday.
     According to the documents, the 155 items are among 717 products
in Manila's temporary exclusion list to be included in the Common
Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme over the next five years.
     The CEPT is the vehicle for creating a free trade area within
the ASEAN region, home of the world's fastest growing economies.
     ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
     Throughout ASEAN, about 687 tariff lines will be lowered in
1996 and 2,496 others in the next four years.  Average tariff rates
will subsequently be brought down from 7.73% in 1996 to 4.03% by
2000 and 2.90% by 2003.
     ASEAN member economies vowed at the end of the fifth leaders'
summit in Bangkok on Dec. 15 to speed up the realization of an ASEAN
Free Trade Area even before the target date year of 2003 by
maximizing the number of items whose tariffs can be reduced to 0-5%
by the year 2000, as well as expanding the number of products whose
tariffs can be reduced to zero percent by the same year.

Beijing public transport facing 300% fare hike+

BEIJING, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Beijing subway riders will see a 300% rise in ticket prices
Jan. 1 as the municipal government aims to reduce rising public
transport subsidies and a heavily overburdened subway system, state
press reported Tuesday.
     Ticket prices will rise to 2 yuan (0.24 dollars) from the
present 0.5 yuan (0.06 dollars), while monthly passes will rise 120%
from the present 18 yuan (2.16 dollars) to 40 yuan (4.80 dollars),
the China Economic Times reported.
     The fare hikes are expected to help offset growing government
subsidies which amounted to 250 million yuan (30 million dollars) in
1994 and are expected to top 400 million yuan (48 million dollars)
for the current year, the paper said.
     Beijing's two-line 42-kilometer subway system has become
increasingly overcrowded as rapid urbanization has increased the
number of commuters and the growth in automobile traffic has snarled
the streets of the capital and rendered the once dependable public
bus system increasingly hit-and-miss.
     Bus tickets are expected to rise from an average 0.2 yuan to 0.5
yuan, it said.
     Last year, Beijing commuters made 530 million subway trips, and
the system's 180-people subway carriages were strained to as much as
50% beyond nominal capacity during peak hours, making travel
uncomfortable and dangerous.
     The Beijing government, fearful of worsening inflation, has
previously refused to approve the subway price hikes, leaving subway
managers no choice but to limit monthly passes and control ticket
sales during peak hours.

NAGOYA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Two major affiliates of Toyota Motor Corp. announced Tuesday
the establishment of joint ventures with the affiliates of a major
Chinese carmaker to manufacture auto parts in Tianjin, southeast of
Beijing.
     The Chinese carmaker is Tianjin Automotive Industrial (Group)
Co., with which Toyota Motor is now negotiating to set up a joint
venture to produce passenger cars.
     Nippondenso Co., a major maker of electronic car parts, said it
has set up Tianjin Denso Engine Electrical Products Co., in
conjunction with Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Generator and
Starter Factory.
     The joint venture, capitalized at 1.66 billion yen, will be
owned 55% by Tianjin Internal Combustion and the remainder by
Nippondenso and the Toyota group's trading house, Toyota Tsusho
Corp., the company said.
     The new joint venture will produce starters and alternators for
use in automobiles to be made by Tianjin Automotive Industrial, it
said.
     In a related development, Toyoda Gosei Co. established Tianjin
Toyoda Gosei Automobile Hose Co. in conjunction with a Chinese
business partner that also belongs to the group of companies led by
Tianjin Automotive Industrial, the company said.
     The joint venture, capitalized at 384 million yen, is owned
64.4% by Toyoda Gosei, 5% by Toyota Tsusho and the remainder by the
Chinese partner.
     The joint venture will produce brake hoses for use in
automobiles to be built by Tianjin Automotive Industrial.
     If the Chinese government approves a Toyota application to set
up a joint venture with Tianjing Automotive Industrial, the two
Toyota affiliates want to supply parts to be made by their new joint
ventures to Toyota's own joint venture with Tianjin Automotive too,
the pair said.
     Toyota is offering to produce passenger car engines with Tianjin
Automotive Industrial in view of the possible Chinese partner's plan
to introduce a new car model, Toyota officials said.

Indonesian chemical maker belonging to the Salim group, the largest

     Nissan Motor Co. plans to exand its strategical ties with
Samsung Motor Inc. of South Korea to cover business cooperation in
the Asian market, officials of Japan's No. 2 automaker said Thursday.
     The proposed expansion calls for the partners to produce and
market passenger cars in each other's country, they said.
     Details of the business cooperation will be ironed out by the two
companies, they said.
     ''Cooperative relations will be strengthened to help Samsung
develop into a powerful friend,'' an executive of Nissan said.
     Possible capital cooperation is under study, said the
high-ranking official, who declined to be named.
     Under plans reviewed by Nissan, Pusan-headquartered Samsung will
market Nissan cars in South Korea under its own brand names while
Nissan will sell Samsung cars under the Nissan brand.
     Both partners will strengthen cooperation to produce cars
competitive in the respective countries, the officials said.
     The two companies will produce cars in Southeast Asia under a
burden-sharing scheme and cooperate in developing vehicles to boost
their productivity, they said.
     They also plan to standardize components and parts to be used
in their vehicles.
     Nissan has been providing technological assistance to Samsung
Motor in plant construction and production of components since April
last year.
     More than 100 Nissan officials now are assigned to assist the
South Korean automaker, which plans to start producing passenger cars
at a newly completed assembly plant in Pusan in January 1998, the
officials said.

     The development came amid reports that competition among
foreign automakers has intensified in the fast-growing auto markets
in Southeast Asian countries.
     ''South Korean cars have great growth potential in Southeast
Asia as they are sold at prices nearly 20% below those of
their Japanese counterparts,'' an industry official said.
     Japanese automakers have taken a dominant share of the Asian
auto market but their hegemony has shown signs of declining in recent
years in the face of the strong yen and a powerful sales drive by
South Korean competitors, industry sources said.
     For instance, they said, the market share held by Japanese
makers in Thailand dropped from 90% to 68% in 1994 in
the face of rising competition from U.S., European and South Korean
rivals.
     Nissan lagged behind the forerunners there because the company
focused on expanding its markets in North America and Europe, they
said.
     Nissan will strengthen its partnership with Samsung in Southeast
Asia to catch up with its rivals there, a company official said.

4.3 mil. tourists visit Indonesia in '95+

JAKARTA, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     About 4.3 million foreign tourists visited Indonesia in 1995,
bringing in estimated revenues of 5.21 billion dollars, local
newspapers reported Thursday.
     ''The total number of foreign tourists entering Indonesia
through seven main gates as of December 1995 is estimated to have
reached 4.3 million,'' Tourism, Post and Telecommunications Minister
Joop Ave was quoted as saying Wednesday.
     Joop said the projected revenues represent an increase of 10.8%
from 4.7 billion dollars in 1994, though the number of tourist
arrivals rose only 7.3% from last year's level of slightly above
four million.
     According to a five-year development plan, the government
expected 4.5 million foreign tourists to visit Indonesia this year,
bringing revenues of at least 6 billion dollars.
     The number of tourist arrivals is projected to rise to between
five million and 5.4 million in 1996, bringing revenues of 6.91
billion dollars.
     Indonesia is targeting the tourist industry as a major foreign
exchange earner by 2005, when it expects to attract 11.1 million
visitors who will spend a total of 15 billion dollars in the country.
     The promotion of the country's tourist industry was hampered
early this year when the Japanese press reported that dozens of
Japanese tourists had become ill with cholera after returning from
the resort island of Bali.
     Japan, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Germany are major
sources of tourists for Indonesia.  In 1994 more than half of all
tourists, 56.83%, came from these five countries.

China aims to attract foreign investment in real estate+

BEIJING, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     China is trying to make its real estate sector more attractive
to foreigners, mainly in the area of low-cost, mass-market housing.
     There has been a boom in construction of office blocks, luxury
condominiums, villas and hotels in the past few years, mainly funded
by foreign investors seeking high profits through leasing or selling.
     But the government has now applied the brakes with a mixture of
the carrot and the stick to force foreign funds into sectors of
perceived greater need.
     It has issued new regulations lifting the previous exemption on
import duties and other taxes for materials and equipment brought in
from overseas for the construction of virtually any type of real
estate project.
     Currently, there are restrictions on the approval of land
available for such projects as well as a value-added tax for real
estate.
     A Circular on Strict Control of the Development of Luxury Real
Estate Projects was also introduced in late 1995 and the regulation
speaks for itself in indicating government determination to control
what it reckoned was the main reason the construction sector
overheated in the early 1990s, leading to runaway inflation.
     At the same time, foreign companies willing to cooperate with
the government in a massive urban renewal plan scheduled for the next
decade -- razing entire low-rise residential districts in many cities
and replacing them with high-rise apartment blocks -- will be given
preferential treatment as well as a guaranteed rate of return on
their investments.
     According to Minister of Construction Hou Jie, the government's
efforts to bring the real estate sector under tighter control are
beginning to pay off.
     In 1992, for example, investment in building construction
projects rose 117% over the previous year.  By 1994, growth had been
reduced to a 41.3%, and Hou anticipated an even lower increase this
year.
     ''There are four million urban families facing severe housing
problems.  The per capita urban housing space in at least half the
country is below the national average and 40 million square meters of
urban housing are dangerous and in urgent need of repair or
replacement,'' he said.
     Hou is trying to persuade potential foreign investors that the
development of low-cost housing, while yielding lower profits,
actually involves less risk and will represent the chief investment
trend in Chinese real estate in the foreseeable future.
     According to the minister, it takes one year to organize a
contract for a major hotel and at least three years to build it.  It
then takes eight or nine years to recover investments and reap
profits.
     On the other hand, the construction of an ordinary housing
project requires only six months for the entire cycle.  Two cycles
per year can be completed in south China but only one in north China
due to the inclement weather.
     ''The great demand for housing continues to offer foreign
investors excellent prospects for earning good returns.  Foreign
businesses investing in real estate can earn higher profits than the
current international level in developed countries,'' Hou said.
     ''Internationally, average profits for real estate range from 6
to 8%, with the rate in some countries dropping to 2%. In China,
average profit seldom falls below 30%,'' he said.
     Taking the lead in this area is the Shanghai municipal
government, which is counting on new preferential policies to help
overcome the resistance of foreign construction companies to becoming
involved in the city's ambitious urban housing redevelopment program.
     Guaranteed after-tax returns on investment will be limited to
15%, but the main sweetener is new policies designed to reduce the
risks and red tape involved in building cheap apartments for
residents forced out by urban projects.
     According to Huang Yuejing, deputy general secretary of the
Shanghai municipal government, regulations allowing foreign
investment in domestic housing projects were actually issued at the
end of 1993 but did not find any takers.
     ''Potential investors were discouraged by the huge outlays for
demolition of old buildings, relocation of residents and the
provision of utilities, all of which took a huge bite out of
prospective profits,'' he said.
     Foreign developers also had to team up with local parties to buy
a plot of land for redevelopment, and also pay a transfer fee for the
rights to the land, adding to the costs and risks.
     To overcome resistance, Huang said, ''We have come up with new
policies which we estimate will save overseas investors much of their
expense if they put their money into housing projects for domestic
sale rather than for overseas buyers.''
     The new approach, which applies to all foreign-invested projects
in areas with high concentrations of shabby or dangerous houses,
calls for the local authority to allocate the land to the Chinese
partner in a joint venture, with the foreign side providing the
financing.
     The Shanghai municipal government has pledged to buy the entire
housing project when completed and be responsible for its eventual
sale.  The profits reaped by the foreign investor can be remitted
overseas free of the normal restrictions on foreign exchange.
     The Shanghai approach is likely to be copied by other municipal
authorities.  Beijing, for example, is reported to be considering a
similar package of financial incentives with a guaranteed return of
18%.

Cambodia counts on foreign funds for 45% of revenue+

PHNOM PENH, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Cambodia still depends on foreign aid and borrowings from
multilateral aid institutions for 45.1% of its budgeted revenue for
fiscal 1996 which begins April, according to the state budget
approved Thursday by the National Assembly.
     The parliament endorsed the government's overall budget proposal
totaling 1.45 trillion riels (5.66 million dollars) for fiscal 1996.
     The budget size represented an increase of 13.2% over a year
earlier.
     Although the budgetary dependency on foreign money declined
from the preceding year's 45.9%, the rate is still alarmingly high,
analysts say.
     In breaking down the budgeted expenditures in percentage terms,
defense accounted for the biggest chunk at 34.9%, down from the
preceding year's 38.9%.
     The budget for the Interior Ministry ranked second at 15.2%,
down from the preceding year's 16.8%.
     These defense and security expenditures shrank somewhat as the
security threat from the Khmer Rouge guerrillas eased.
     The Cambodian government budgeted a 111% increase in
tourism-related expenditures, a 65% increase in welfare outlays and
a 36% raise for royal family-related outlays.

Daiichi Pharmaceutical opens development unit in China+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. has established a wholly owned
clinical drug development subsidiary in Beijing, a Daiichi spokesman
said Friday.
     The subsidiary will conduct clinical tests of new, promising
drugs concurrently in both Japan and China.
     The subsidiary will enable Daiichi to move quickly in new areas,
giving it an advantage over its competitors, the spokesman said.
     He said the new subsidiary, Daiichi Pharmaceutical (China) Co.,
is capitalized at 5 million dollars.
     It will start clinical tests of the synthetic antibacterial drug
Cravit and the cerebral neurotransmission improvement drug Translon
at a Beijing hospital from March, the spokesman said.  Tests of other
drugs will begin gradually.
     Daiichi expects to obtain Chinese government approval for Cravit
and Translon in 1998, he said.
     The subsidiary will then establish a joint production and sales
company for the drugs with a local pharmaceutical firm, and Daiichi
will invest some 3 billion yen on facility construction, the
spokesman said.
     Daiichi aims to raise its annual sales in China to 10 billion
yen by 2000, he said.

Japan moves on economic sea zone could spark rows: paper+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The government is moving toward ratifying the international
ocean treaty and creating a 200-mile exclusive economic zone that
will likely inflame territorial disputes with China and South Korea,
the Tokyo Shimbun reported Friday.
     The daily said in a front-page article that the government hopes
to ratify the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea during the
upcoming regular Diet session and establish the exclusive economic
zone.
     The convention, which went into force in November last year,
obliges all signatories to recognize an exclusive 200-mile economic
zone off a nation's coasts.
     Within their zones, states have the exclusive right to fish or
to exploit natural resources such as oil, reclaim land or construct
artificial islands.
     In question will be Japan's dispute with China over the Senkaku
Islands, known in Chinese as the Diaoyutai Islands, in the East China
Sea.
     Tokyo also disputes South Korea's claim to Takeshima Island,
known as Tokto in Korea, in the Sea of Japan.
     The Senkaku Islands, located some 150 kilometers northeast of
the northern tip of Taiwan, are also claimed by Taipei.
     China has said it plans to ratify the sea convention next
summer.  South Korea has already ratified the treaty.
     Some Foreign Ministry officials said earlier this month Japan
should delineate a 200-mile zone with the Senkaku Islands as a
base of reference, arguing that refraining from doing so could be
interpreted by the Chinese as a lack of interest in the territory.

Japanese help Indonesian village improve iron casting+

URAWA, Japan, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The Japanese city of Kawaguchi in Saitama Prefecture, bordering
Tokyo, famous for its cast-iron pots and pans, is helping an
Indonesian village bring its metal-casting technology up to date by
introducing modern cupola furnaces.
     Six makers of cast-iron products in Kawaguchi have founded the
Kasia metal-casting technology exchange cooperative hoping to help
realize a model factory in Ceper, a village on Java, by the middle of
next year, said Kenichi Masuda, head of the cooperative.
     Because of the strong yen, the Kawaguchi makers have suffered
from sluggish demand, even for products made from new materials such
as ceramics.  They have embarked on the project in a bid to overcome
the mood of the recession, he said.
     The name ''Kasia'' is a contraction of Kawaguchi and Asia.
Ceper has some 300 metal casters who make their products in
hand-shaped sand molds.
     ''Their technological level equals that of Japan in the Edo
period (1615-1868), with rejects sometimes amounting to almost 80%
of production,'' Masuda said.
     The idea for the project was born when the head of a
metal-casting cooperative from Ceper requested technological
assistance after inspecting Masuda's factory during a visit to Japan
in 1991.
     The village is providing the site and the factory free of
charge.  Kawaguchi workers skilled in the latest metal-casting
techniques will serve as instructors at the Ceber model factory and
bring the know-how of some 20 local metalworkers up to date.
     Also planned are a library and a metal-casting contest.
     Indonesia relies heavily on imports for cast-iron products,
particularly machine parts.
     Japanese makers producing in Indonesia are not able to keep up
with demand.  Masuda, though, said he does not expect the model
factory to make profits right from the start.
     ''We are ready to live with a deficit in the first few years.
For us, the project is significant in giving new impetus to Japan's
metal-casting industry which is in a fix.''

Steelmakers face price-cut pressure for exports to Asia+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Japanese steelmakers are under growing pressure to cut prices
of Asia-bound steel products due to a glut in the market, steel
companies officials said Friday.
     They said China's restraint on economic expansion, including a
switch to a tight credit policy, is primarily responsible for the
glut.
     The Chinese government has ordered domestic steelmakers to limit
their production to reduce large inventories resulting from
overproduction in 1994, they said.
     China's crude steel output was estimated at 90 million tons in
1994.
     Japanese steel producers recently bowed to a Chinese demand for
a price cut of about 8.0% for their steel shipments in the
February-July period.
     The officials said Japanese steel companies already face growing
calls for price cuts from Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia.
     Prices of steel products bound for India and the Middle East
have also declined by about 10% from the July-September level of
this year.
     Trading houses said some Japanese steelmakers have offered
price cuts of up to 15% to secure export volume.

China to cut tariffs, spell out new rules+

BEIJING, Dec 29 Kyodo

     China will cut import tariffs on 4,000 items by an average 35%
beginning April 1, 1996, while preferential policies for foreign
investment projects already approved will enjoy a transition period,
state press reported Friday.
     In a bid to level the playing field among China's backward
inland regions and its booming special economic zones, and to offer
foreign enterprises the same treatment as domestic one, the State
Council has issued a circular calling for the reduction of the
general tariff rate to 23%.
     It also called for an end to the duty-free benefits enjoyed by
the special economic zones, the Economic Daily said.
     The circular conforms with the tariff cuts promised by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin at the Osaka informal summit meeting of
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in October and is seen
as a significant step toward China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
     No information was provided on the precise size of reductions or
which products would have their import duties cut.
     However, regulations were set out regarding a transition period
for preferential tax policies and duty-free benefits for foreign
investment projects legally approved before the publication of the
circular.
     Foreign investment projects worth more than 30 million dollars
and approved before Dec. 28 would continue to enjoy their reduced and
duty-free tariffs and preferential import taxes on imported equipment
and raw materials until Dec. 31, 1997, it said, while such projects
valued under 30 million dollars could extend the previous policy
until Dec. 31, 1996.
     Equipment for technological transformation approved for import
before the issuance of the circular would also continue to enjoy
previous preferential import policies during the transition period,
it said.
     If equipment and resources are not imported within the specified
transition periods, enterprises could ask the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation or the State Economic and Trade
Commission for an extension from the State Council, it said.

China breaks another grain output record in '95+

BEIJING, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Chinese farmers harvested a record 466 million tons of grain in
1995, up 21 million tons over last year and nearly 10 million tons
over the previous record harvest in 1993, Xinhua News Agency
reported Friday.
     The record output came, though several grain growing areas were
plagued by natural disaster during the year and rising costs for
fertilizer and pesticides threatened to keep farmers off the land.
     ''With the rise in grain prices mainly blamed for last year's
high inflation rate, the 1995 increase in output is a great help in
the nation's efforts at curbing inflation and easing the strained
grain market,'' analysts said, according to Xinhua.
     Government officials have set a grain production target of 500
million tons for the year 2000, as China's rising living standard is
expected to increase grain consumption, especially of feed grains.
     According to the Hong Kong-based China Agribusiness Review 1995,
following trends in the first half of the year, China is expected to
become a net grain importer this year after being a significant
exporter over the last two years.

Ramos signs 394.8 bil. peso budget for '96+

MANILA, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     President Fidel Ramos signed into law Friday a 394.8 billion
peso (about 15 billion U.S. dollar) budget for 1996, with education
getting the biggest chunk of the funds, presidential palace and
Congress officials announced.
     The budget also earmarked large outlays to public works,
defense and assistance to local governments, House Speaker Jose de
Venecia said.
     It also reflects a doubled budget for agriculture to help the
sector cope with the immediate effects of tariff and subsidy cuts
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and includes a 4
billion peso (about 15 million dollar) fund for poverty alleviation,
de Venecia said.
     The budget department said that while general appropriations
come to 394.8 billion pesos, the total obligatory budget approved by
Congress was 415.6 billion pesos (about 16 billion dollars),
including 25.3 billion pesos (97 million dollars) for automatic debt
service payments.
     Congress initially wanted to include debt-service funds in the
general appropriations, but Ramos vetoed the move, noting that the
Supreme Court has already ruled that funds for debt servicing are
automatically appropriated and need not be included in the yearly
budget.

Remitted funds from Asian contract workers top ODA+

MANILA, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The aggregate sum of remittances to home countries from
overseas contract workers from nine Asian countries has shot up to
dwarf the annual total of official development assistance (ODA) to
the nine, an Asian Development Bank investigation shows.
     Remittances from such workers to the nine countries totaled 75
billion dollars in 1993, exceeding their aggregate ODA of 54 billion
dollars from industrialized countries, including Japan, the survey
shows.
     The survey covered the Philippines, Thailand, India, Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, China and South Korea.
     In the Philippines and Indonesia, the ratio of contract workers'
annual remittances to the nations' gross domestic product (GDP) is on
the rise, according to figures collated by the Manila-based regional
lending institution.
     In a period from 1987 to 1993, the aggregate of remittances home
from Indonesian contract workers abroad quadrupled from 86 million
dollars to 346 million dollars, while that of Filipino workers showed
a 2.4-fold jump from 1.02 billion dollars to 2.54 million dollars,
the survey showed.
     In contrast, the aggregate home remittances from Thai and South
Korean workers saw much slower growth ratios over similar periods.
     Aggregate remittances from South Korean workers increased
nearly 50% from 418 million dollars to 605 million dollars from 1987
to 1993, while those from Thai workers grew 40% from 784 million
dollars to 1.13 billion dollars in a period from 1987 to 1992,
according to the bank figures.
     This could imply that a nation's dependence on such remittance
eases as its economy prospers, alleviating the need for contract
workers to go abroad and send money home, analysts said.

ASIA CHASES THE 1996 'INFRABUCK'

China faces, 'strong competition from the rest of Asia in attracting
development capital,' Trevor Bush, NatWest Markets managing director
for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, told a conference in Beijing recently.
He explained that China risks losing out to other Asian countries which
are introducing legal and regulatory reforms at a faster rate to
attract international financing for infrastructure projects.

The statement reflects comments made recently by Ted Rule, executive
director of Asian Infrastructure Fund Advisors. Talking about build-
operate-transfer projects in China, and in particular road schemes, he
said international banks are not usually prepared to finance building
highways where the return comes only from the project itself. He says
that to attract the money, China must allow substantially higher road
tolls, like Indonesia where tolls are 50 to 75 per cent higher.

It is true that China has its problems attracting the infrabuck. Its
system of law routinely causes clashes between the central and state
governments. It has no binding BOT legislation, local governments have
no right to sell land to foreigners (although in plenty of cases they
do), and, at times it seems that the central government is trying to
put the brakes on the process of attracting the international
infrabuck. In an attempt to harness its foreign debt it has banned
provincial governments from proceeding on projects without central
government approval, and has cut the sectors which are open to foreign
investment. Against this background, competition from other Asian
nations should be rife, each one offering the international infrabuck a
substantially better deal than it gets in China.

But where exactly is the 'strong competition'? Which countries are
winning the infrabucks?

Ted Rule cites Indonesian toll roads, but all the road contracts have
gone to the state-run toll road operator Jasa Marga, or consortia made
up of Indonesian companies, including Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada,
controlled by president Suharto's eldest daughter. There has been
interest from international companies in Indonesia's road projects but
so far no private projects have been awarded to these companies - and
thus no international infrabucks.

Indonesia has been persistently criticised for its lack of transparent
bidding for projects, particularly by the World Bank, and its group of
donor countries. Politically Indonesia is 'stable', even if it lacks a
common democracy, and certainly foreign investment through the stock
market is strong. But analysts' judgements on stocks tend to be based
on how they view the political clout of the companies, not on the
companies' efficiency or management. Indonesia seems no better than
China at attracting the infrabuck.

Earlier this year the Philippines seemed the ideal place for the
international infrabuck. President Ramos had privatised electricity
generation with tremendous success, and private generating companies
were guaranteed minimum sales through the state grid. The country has a
sophisticated BOT law, a dedicated department to deal with BOT projects
which reports directly to Ramos, and transparent bidding procedures.
Now the president has pushed through executive powers to be able to
handle the water supply crisis in the same way as the power shortages,
and has invited the IFC to advise on the best means of privatising
water.

But cracks are beginning to appear that will worry international
investors. There has been a huge upsurge of the 'Filipino-First'
attitude. In October the Supreme Court placed a temporary ban on the
government sale of the Manila Hotel to Malaysia's Renong when the
losing Philippine-based Manila Prince Hotel lodged a petition citing
'Filipino-First'. This will deter international investors if a losing
national firm insists on preferential treatment on the basis of
nationality.

Fuelling the Filipino-First sentiments is Representative Ramon
Bagatsing, who has introduced a House Bill which stipulates that the
hiring of consultants for infrastructure projects should be limited to
Filipinos. The only exceptions are where the hiring of foreign
consultants is a condition of a loan, where the local consultants do
not have the necessary experience or where bilateral agreements exist.
Cost is not cited as a reason to appoint foreign consultants.

President Ramos has given two airport contracts to a group of six
Chinese-Filipinos who have formed the Asian Emerging Dragon Consortium.
Despite interest from foreign companies, AEDC has been promised the
contract as long as it matches the lowest tender. Not surprisingly,
there are not many bids to match. International companies who are
interested in the projects would rather tie up with AEDC than present a
bid themselves against such obvious bias.

Another reason that the Philippines may lose out on the infrabuck is
because of new regulations that are being discussed. At present foreign
exchange-denominated profits can be repatriated. The government is now
looking at compelling contractors to accept peso payments and to
require them to make regular remittance reports to the central bank.
The department of finance has also recommended an overhaul of the
government guarantee scheme for BOT projects by imposing fees on such
guarantees, requiring contractors to share the risks of the projects
and reducing any future guarantees. In only six months the Philippines
has lost its edge as a strong competitor for the international
infrabuck.

In the last few years India has pledged itself fully to privately-
funded infrastructure projects. The ministry of surface transport
produced a glossy brochure advertising areas for private port
development, management and operation. International companies have
been invited to do free feasibility studies for sections of a planned
13,000km of national toll roads. The promised pay-off was the contract
to build and operate the roads and to develop the land around the
route, as long as they could match the lowest bidder (which was to be
evaluated according to its proposed toll levy) for each section. The
IFC are advising on water privatisation in some states and plans are
afoot to bring in a dedicated BOT law which bypasses the morass of
central and local laws that currently have to be negotiated.

The prospects looked good, but in reality almost nothing has happened.
Plans have been bogged down by local elections and a central government
that is desperately trying to curry favour for the elections this year
(1996). Privatisation is rarely popular with the electorate.

In November, the finance ministry refused to approve the national toll
road project. It objected to the fact that each contract was almost
guaranteed to go to the company undertaking the feasibility studies,
and the fact that those companies would not have to pre-qualify to
tender. Twenty-two firms had already started studies at their own
expense.

Disputes over Dabhol, the supposedly fast-track private power project
which Enron was awarded in Maharastra, have also concerned
international investors. Local newspapers pounced on the story once the
deal was announced, claiming that Enron's profits and the price of the
electricity were not justifiable. The project has since been dropped
and resurrected like a yo-yo, although there are some signs that a
compromise is likely to be reached soon.

As for the port privatisations, the ministry of surface transport has
just turned down a proposal to privatise the management and operation
of the existing berths at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust near Bombay.
The construction of two new berths at the port are apparently being
offered to the private sector and details are on page 14. The question
remains, though, whether it will always be 'future' projects on the
basis that 'tomorrow never comes'? Despite its much-publicised
welcoming of the private sector into infrastructure, India may not yet
be a serious contender for the international infrabuck.

Thailand is faring no better in nurturing the climate that attracts the
infrabuck. It is host to an array of political scandals, particularly
in the appointment of contractors for infrastructure projects. Its
record for rewarding those that provide the international infrabuck has
been poor. Government pledges to hand over land or to ascertain rights
of way on inner-city route clashes have been ignored. And, to add to
Thailand's problems, the government changes frequently, the leading
party has not had a majority for years, and each new government selects
different projects for its 'infrastructure priority'.

Vietnam, on the other hand, will be desperate to compete with China -
although its estimated $6bn needed by the year 2000 is nothing compared
to China's requirements. But Vietnam is simply too poor to get the
money. 'There aren't that many projects on which you could recoup your
money because the market isn't there,' a lawyer was quoted as saying
(AIM/June issue/p2).

Malaysia is probably the most advanced country in Asia in terms of its
private sector infrastructure facilities. Even here political
requirements conflict with the conditions which attract international
investors. Worried about its inflation rate, the government has stepped
in to dissuade PLUS from raising its toll rates on the North-South
highway. This is despite a contract which guarantees minimum rates of
return and orders the state to pay compensation if it interferes with
the toll rates levied to reach that return.

Malaysia's record is on the whole good for privately-run infrastructure
facilities. It is a tested market, and one that is likely to remain
attractive to the international infrabuck. Analysts are worried,
however, that its high rate of growth makes it unstable, and its own
building projects (such as the new airport and the planned new
administrative capital) will overstretch its resources. Indeed much of
its growth comes from construction projects which are due to be
completed by the Asian Games in 1998, and some observers doubt whether
it can pay for the private services once the boom is over. There is
concern that private companies are going to face both a shrinking
demand and a public outcry over tariff rates once the games are over
and the economy slows down.

Whatever doubts there are about China, it is competing in an arena
where every false move is publicly known and the scale of the projects
causes inevitable problems. The whimsy of its officials certainly
renders China less attractive but all its competitors have a job to do
in wooing 1996's infrabucks. Co-operation between the public and the
private sectors require all parties to be competent, consistent,
flexible, full of integrity and re-elected without problems every time.
However, in the real world, some things will go wrong. What is also
evident is that Asia's need is so great and the region is expanding so
fast that private infrabucks must find sensible employment. Then it is
only a matter of returning to the question 'where?'.

CHINA: RAILWAY MINISTRY IS LOOKING TO 'MAKE CONTACTS'

China plans to widen the opportunities for foreign funding in railway
construction in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000). At the
forthcoming Third International Modern Railway Equipment Exhibition in
Beijing in March, the ministry of railways has said it plans to make
wide contacts with foreign companies for purchasing major technology
and rail equipment, especially in the construction of high-speed
railways which is to be a key focus of the new five-year plan. Between
1980 and 1994, the country used $4bn in foreign loans from governments
and international organisations and $1.15bn from the World Bank in its
key railway projects.

CHINA-INDIA RAIL LINK IS PROPOSED

Discussions are under way between China and India on a potentially huge
rail co-operation scheme which could form the backbone of a more
ambitious project to build a trans-Asia railway. According to a recent
report in the Asia Times, both Chinese and Indian officials are
exploring the idea of building a high-speed freight railway which would
connect India and China through Burma.

It is understood that the railway scheme was conceived by a consortium
led by China-based Upleader International. The consortium is also
believed to include China Railway Engineering and Construction
Corporation, Techrail Engineering (Malaysia), TFA (USA), and Canadian
transport specialists.

Talks between the two countries are said to have started six months
ago. 'China's government is said to support the project, hoping to
develop the country's interior provinces and to take a more dominant
role in global trade,' the newspaper said. It added that a railway
connecting India and China would 'theoretically' tie into China's
national railway in Yunnan province - which faces Burma's north-eastern
border - and run through North Korea and Russia. A southern branch of
the India-China railway could use existing tracks which run from
Singapore to Thailand through Malaysia.

One of the biggest problems if such a project were to go beyond the
feasibility stage would be gauges. China, for example, has no standard
gauge and its national rail system uses many different gauges. Thailand
and Malaysia uses narrow gauges rather than the standard-gauge tracks
that have been adopted by many countries.

SHANGHAI PLANS INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING CENTRE

Shanghai, which houses China's biggest port, has mapped out a three-
stage strategy to develop an international shipping centre over the
next two decades. Vice-mayor, Sha Lin, recently said that between 1996
and the year 2000, the city would start building the centre, initially
with a project to deepen channels at the mouth of the Yangtze River to
8.5m.

When the first stage ends, the first port will be able to handle 220m
tonnes of cargo - up from 170m tonnes last year - and move 2.5m-3m TEU
containers. Mr Sha, speaking at the Marintec China 95 symposium, said
the next stage would see the port capacity enlarged and the channel
deepened to 12.5m to accommodate container ships of over 50,000 tonnes
by 2010.

By 2020, he added, Shanghai would be able to handle super Panamax
container vessels. Shanghai would also develop new shipping and
shipbuilding industries to achieve its objective.

SHANGHAI UNVEILS NEW POLICY FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

The Shanghai municipal government is counting on new preferential
policies to help overcome the resistance of foreign construction
companies to become involved in the city's ambitious urban housing
redevelopment programme. Guaranteed after-tax returns on investment
will be limited to 15 per cent, but the main sweetener is new policies
designed to reduce the risks and red tape involved in building cheap
flats for residents.

According to Huang Yuejing, deputy general secretary of the Shanghai
municipal government, regulations allowing foreign investment in
domestic housing projects were actually issued at the end of 1993, but
did not find any takers. 'Potential investors were discouraged by the
huge outlays for demolition of old buildings, relocation of residents
and the provision of utilities, all of which took a huge bite out of
prospective profits,' he said. Foreign developers also had to team up
with local parties to buy a plot of land for re-development, and pay a
transfer fee for the rights to the land, adding to the costs and risks.

What investment there has been has tended to concentrate on luxury
housing, most of which is being snapped up by overseas buyers. The
central government is now clamping down on this type of construction in
major cities throughout the country and insisting the local authorities
switch the emphasis to low-cost mass housing. To overcome resistance,
Huang said, 'we have come up with new policies which we estimate will
save overseas investors much of their expense if they put their money
into housing projects for domestic sale rather than for overseas
buyers.'

The new approach, which applies to all foreign-investment projects in
areas with high concentrations of shabby or dangerous houses, calls for
the local authority to allocate the land to the Chinese partner in a
Sino-foreign joint venture, with the foreign side providing the
financing. Financial assistance will also be provided for the
demolition of the old homes and rehousing of residents - with the
investors only having to pay a maximum 30 per cent contribution to the
removal costs. Help is also promised for the construction of utilities,
although the exact nature and scope of the assistance has not yet been
spelt out.

The Shanghai municipal government is pledged to buy the entire housing
project when completed, and be responsible for its eventual sale. There
will be a guaranteed 15 per cent after-tax return on the investment,
which, as one developer suggested, 'effectively means the authorities
are borrowing the money from the foreign side and promising to pay 15
per cent interest.' This profit can be remitted overseas free of any of
the normal restrictions on foreign exchange.

Some 3.1m sq m of land in 114 lots has been identified by the
authorities as available for low-cost housing development with foreign
involvement. Huang is convinced there should be plenty of takers
because, 'market demand is very high as the government is determined to
increase per capita living space.' The goal is to raise this from the
present 7.5 to 10 sq m by the end of the century. Some 3.65m sq m of
dilapidated housing has to be renovated in order to meet this target.

But Shanghai does not have the capacity to raise enough financing on
its own, he stressed. Real estate analysts in the city agree the scheme
should be attractive to investors. They point out that the housing
involved will be low rise and low cost, so that companies could develop
a 'supermarket approach' in which units could be quickly assembled from
prefabricated parts. With the authorities paying on completion, the
developers can then have money available for further construction,
making projects basically self-financing once the first has been
completed.

The Shanghai approach is likely to be copied by other municipal
authorities. Beijing, for example, is reported to be considering a
similar package of financial incentives with a reported guaranteed
return of 18 per cent.

STUDY LOOKS AT DIVERTING WATER TO SUPPLY BEIJING

A feasibility study is due to be presented to the Chinese government
this month (January 1996) on a plan to channel water from the Yangtse
River basin to the drought-stricken, heavily-populated northern parts
of the country, including the capital Beijing and adjacent areas of
Hebei Province. Some 200 experts are working on the study which
involves three different channel routes.

Officials in Beijing say construction could start within the next
couple of years depending on the decision of an appraisal committee set
up under the minister of water resources, Niu Maosheng. Although there
are a number of technical problems to be overcome, analysts say the
main concerns are likely to be financial. No figure has yet been
revealed as to the possible cost.

At a recent seminar in Beijing, experts exchanged views on the
project's three different proposed routes for carrying water from the
Yangtse basin over several thousand kilometres to the northern cities
that are chronically short of water for industrial and domestic use. An
estimated 70bn cu m a year is scheduled to be siphoned off from the
Yangtse.

The so-called 'East China' route entails linking the river with the
Grand Canal. This would be the easiest option both technically and
financially, because it would utilise existing facilities. But the main
concern of experts is the environmental risk as all the region's
waterways have pollution levels far in excess of state-set limits. The
project, however, could be tied in with a current programme to persuade
foreign investors to join up with interested Chinese parties to provide
clean water supplies to the key cities of central and east China.

The "Central China" route would use the existing Danjiankou reservoir
on the Hianjiang River, a tributary of the Yangtse to the north, as the
gathering point, and then siphon off the water through a new channel to
be dug as far as Beijing.

The "West China" route is the most complicated, calling for a system of
canals linking up the headwaters of the Yangtse and the Yellow Rivers
which are quite close. This would be the most technically demanding,
calling for the construction of a 300m dam and at least 100km of
tunnels beneath some of the massive mountain ranges which dominate the
neighbouring provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai.

It is not clear how much foreign involvement there might be in the
project. But a spokesman for the ministry of water resources said it
was highly unlikely that China would have the technical or financial
means to go it alone on whichever route was chosen. The main question
to be settled is probably how to make involvement financially
attractive for foreign investors, the spokesman added.

TUMEN RIVER DEVELOPMENT INCHES FORWARD

In early December, representatives of China, the two Koreas, Russia and
Mongolia signed three agreements at the United Nations that paves the
way for the so-called second phase of development of the Tumen River
Economic Development Area (TREDA).

To be sure, the objectives of the second phase are modest. They include
the introduction of a framework for achieving 'sustainable economic and
social development' and call for the creation of a consultative
commission to promote investment, technical co-operation and
environmental protection. A separate co-ordinating committee will be
set up for trade and investment. Moreover, in an attempt to build an
organisational framework for the economic zone, member countries
consented to the establishment of a permanent secretariat.

UNDP chief, James Speth, who presided over the signing ceremony said
the second phase would benefit the poor and jobless of the region and
marked an important step in the development process. 'These initiatives
have changed the situation into a dynamic investment environment,' he
said, adding that until now the area's borders, 'tended to be barriers
rather than doors'.

Announced in 1991, the project involves ambitious plans to unlock the
resource-rich region, long cut-off from world markets and investors, by
opening up regional borders. The massive project stretches from Yanbian
and Changbaishan Mountains in China, to Nakhodia in Russia in the north
and to Chonjin in North Korea. It is intended to make the region
economically vibrant.

Major infrastructure projects planned for the area include a new port,
11 specialised harbours and a rail hub. The regional zone is to cover
an area of 200 sq km, with a population of some 150 million people. The
estimated project cost is $1bn.

MACAU: STUDY IS FINISHED TO INTEGRATE MACAU'S NEW AIRPORT

Feasibility studies have already been completed to build direct road
and high-speed rail connections costing about $1bn to Guangzhou and
Zhuhai from Macau's airport, officially opened by Portugal's president
Mario Soares at the beginning of December.

Talks are also taking place to develop an integrated transit system to
simplify customs and immigration procedures for passengers and cargo
moving between Macau, China and Hong Kong. Macau Airport company
chairman, Dr Antonio Diogo Pinto, said current plans include a $35m
high-speed ferry pier and a massive expansion of air cargo,
warehousing, office and hotel facilities at the airport.

Dr Pinto said the airport, which has only been operating since early
November, has already exceeded expectations. Twelve airlines were
making regular flights by the end of 1995, compared to the 10 that was
forecast. The Macau government has signed air services agreements with
more than 20 countries including Malaysia, Thailand, China and the US.

MASSIVE RECLAMATION IS PROPOSED FOR MACAU

Macau, Portugal's sleepy enclave on China's Pearl River estuary, will
physically grow by one quarter, if a massive $3bn reclamation project
gets the green light. The scheme, the biggest project in Macau's 500-
year existence, has been proposed by Dr Stanley Ho, a Hong Kong casino
and property magnate.

Dr Ho said the scheme will be jointly developed by his company,
Sociedade de Turismo e Diversoes de Macau and Chyau Fwu Development
Company, a Hong Kong property outfit headed by tycoon George Wong. Dr
Ho also owns Shun Tak, a property company which developed much of
Macau.

Central to Dr Ho's development is the China Macau World Trade Centre
complex of 10 hotels, a 660,000 sq m International Trade Mart and a
multi-theme park covering 700,000 sq m. The development will cover
700ha, formed by infilling the sea between Taipa and Coloane islands,
creating a new 'super-island' dubbed Cotai City by property analysts.
The initial phases of the project are due for completion in 1999 to
coincide with Macau's return to Chinese control.

Blueprints have been lodged with the Sino-Portuguese Land Group and the
Macau government's public works department and their decision is
expected in the next few months.

HONG KONG: IATA PRONOUNCES HK'S NEW AIRPORT A DISASTER

Hong Kong's new $7.7bn airport has been described as a disaster by
Pierre Jeanniot, the director general of the International Air
Transport Association (IATA). At a recent meeting with the Hong Kong
Airport Authority he said it was a 'waste of time' to open the new
airport without a second runway.

The first runway of the new international airport at Chek Lap Kok is
not expected to open for business until 1998. 'We don't see the point
in spending vast sums of money to build an airport which doesn't
increase capacity,' he said, adding that, if anything, the new airport
would constrain capacity while requiring airlines to pay higher landing
fees - landing and parking fees at Kai Tak, already stretched to
capacity, have increased 28 per cent over the last three years making
it one of the most expensive in the world. IATA's views on the second
runway are shared by Hong Kong's main carrier, Cathay Pacific.

Gordon Sui, secretary for economic services, denied the IATA claim.
'The new airport will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, unlike
Kai Tak which is severely restricted by a curfew,' he said recently.
'Even with one runway, existing capacity at the new airport will be
increased from 26 million passengers to 36 million passengers per
year.' Sui also said there had never been any suggestion to build one
runway at Chek Lap Kok. 'The new airport was designed for two runways
and that is exactly what the new airport will have. The opening of a
second runway will be a matter of timing.' He said the government will
be looking at the traffic flow at the new airport before making a final
decision.

Jeanniot said he thought there may be another reason for the
government's reluctance to open the airport with two runways. 'There
seems to be a paralysis in the decision-making process. A feeling that
it is more political than anything else.' The airport project, the
largest single engineering project in the world, has been at the centre
of a fierce political debate between China and Britain since it was
announced in 1989 by the former governor, Sir David Wilson.

That debate has cooled down somewhat and in early December Britain and
China agreed to drop the 'provisional' from the Provisional Airport
Authority. It was seen as a major turning point in the massive project.
Not only is Hong Kong getting a new airport it is also getting the
infrastructure investment that goes with it - a new bridge linking
Kowloon to Lantau Island, massive reclamation to support a highway, and
a rail link to Hong Kong and Kowloon with property developments
springing up around the new stations.

From December 1, 1995 the Airport Authority took over from the
Provisional Airport Authority with pro-China businessman, Wong Po-yan,
at the helm. Recently it went to the market for a massive HK$8.2bn
($1.06bn) syndicated loan and revolving credit. The loan consists of a
HK$6.4bn ($872m) loan and a HK$1.8bn ($233m) revolving facility. The
authority will pay an interest rate of 43 basis points (0.43 percentage
point) above the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate for both tranches of
the loan. The Airport Authority was permitted to borrow an additional
HK$3.4bn ($440m) under Sino-British agreements.

In January the Monetary Authority signed an agreement to act as
arranging agent for the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) for a
HK$10bn ($1.3bn) note-issuance facility. The Airport Authority has said
it would find such a facility attractive if it carried access to the
Monetary Authority's liquidity adjustment facility. The Airport
Authority's issues would be of shorter maturities than the MTRC issues
because it has to pay off the first part of the project by the end of
2001.

Standard Chartered Bank recently described Hong Kong's existing
international airport as 'an indispensable piece of infrastructure
promoting the territory's rapid economic growth.' But Kai Tak has
reached its full capacity. Between now and the opening day of the new
airport, Kai Tak will become more and more congested. 'An efficient
airport is part and parcel of Hong Kong's competitive advantage in
serving as a business centre for the Asia-Pacific region as well as for
China,' the bank said. It has been estimated that any further delays on
the new airport could cost Hong Kong dearly. Failure to meet projected
rising demand for air transport could cost the territory HK$420bn
($54bn) between 1997 and 2010 the bank said.

More than 20 per cent of aircraft movements at Kai Tak either originate
in China or are destined for the mainland. Kai Tak has proved a
lucrative investment for the Hong Kong government, paying after-tax
returns on average net fixed assets in 1991 of 29 percent.

HONG KONG: CONTRACTORS FACE PROBLEMS MEETING CLK'S DEADLINES

Construction of the $1.3bn terminal building at Hong Kong's new airport
at Chek Lap Kok is running more than four months behind schedule even
though the job has been going for just 11 months. The Airport Authority
(AA) said the problems stemmed from earlier delays on the foundations
which were five months late and difficulties faced by the terminal
contractor, BCJ joint venture, mobilising sufficient staff and
equipment. AA corporate development director, Clinton Leeks, said the
Authority is confident the lost time can be clawed back and the airport
'remains on target for substantial completion by mid-1997.' The airport
is due to open in April 1998.

A revised construction schedule has been agreed with BCJ, a consortium
formed by Balfour Beatty and Amec of Britain, Maeda of Japan, Kumagai
Gumi (Hong Kong) and China State Construction Engineering Corporation,
to get the project back on track.

A construction director, Alistair Thomson, said there has also been
mobilisation and ground water problems on the $86m airfield tunnels
contract being undertaken by the UK's Alfred McAlpine, Downer of New
Zealand and Paul Y of Hong Kong. Work was held up for several weeks,
although the contract is back on schedule.

Industry insiders say the difficulties stem from the fast-track nature
of the airport project. 'The AA wants contractors to start as soon as
the contract is agreed on day one. Its just not possible. It takes time
to get staff to Hong Kong and organise the massive amounts of equipment
needed,' commented one construction chief. 'There is also a limit to
how much construction can physically be done. The contract periods are
unrealistic. The foundations are a case in point. Heavy rains probably
held the job up by two months, but the remaining three month delay was
largely caused because the contractor couldn't go any faster,' he
added.

HONG KONG: OPPORTUNITIES ARISE FROM CLK'S PRIVATE FACILITIES

Construction of the privately financed facilities at Chek Lap Kok,
including cargo handling and aircraft maintenance, got off to a flying
start with key awards for design work going mainly to British firms.
One of the biggest schemes is the $1bn construction of the world's
largest air cargo complex by Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals. Work
involves a six-storey main building totalling 274,000 sq m and a 46,000
sq m two-storey express cargo centre.

The lead building consultant is Ove Arup who are working in tandem with
Foster Asia as the architectural sub-consultants. British Steel (Asia)
is to supply 53,550 tonnes of steel piles for foundations specialist
Franki Contractors, owned by Germany's Bilfinger & Berger. The main
construction is being done by Hong Kong's Gammon Construction, which is
jointly owned by Trafalgar House and Jardine Pacific.

Cathay Pacific Catering Services (CPCS) has chosen Scott Wilson
Kirkpatrick as the structural and civil consultants for its $200m in-
flight catering facility, one of three planned at the airport. Other
consultancy awards for the 56,000 sq m three-storey building include US
engineers, Parsons Brinckerhoff Asia who are acting as the mechanical
and electrical consultants and local firms Davis Langdon and Seah who
have been appointed as the quantity surveyors and Wong Tung & Partners
are the architects. The foundations will be undertaken by the local
firm, Shui On.

Six contractors - Dragages (French), Paul Y/Downer, Gammon, Hsin Chong,
Hip Hing and Shui On (all Hong Kong) - are having their bids for the
main building contract evaluated by the CPCS project team which hopes
to award the contract in January.

The facility is one of three in-flight kitchens planned at CLK. Others
will be build by LSG-Lufthansa Sky Chefs and Switzerland's Gate Gourmet
International, although consultants are only just being appointed.

The next key project is a $435m headquarters and hotel development for
Cathay Pacific Airways. The architects are Llewelyn-Davis with Harris
and Sutherland acting as structural consultants and Widnell as the
quantity surveyors. Bids for the foundations will be invited early next
year. The construction work, which has been split into four phases,
includes a 10-storey, 69,000 sq m reinforced concrete frame, glass
curtain wall clad office building and a 25-storey, 23,000 sq m, 500 bed
staff hotel.

Other private facilities include a second air cargo centre which is
planned by Asia Air Freight Terminals - a joint venture comprising
mainly Singaporean companies. The main consultants on the 22,000 sq m
scheme are Jones Lang Wootton Building Consultancy. The Hong Kong firm,
Liang Peddle Thorp are the architects, but the client has refused to
name the other firms involved. Piling contractors have just been asked
to prequalify.

There has been a reluctance by Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering, the
company undertaking aircraft maintenance, to name the professional team
who will advise on a massive hanger capable of handling three jumbo
jets side by side.

Other projects are far less advanced. These include the aviation fuel
system awarded to Aviation Fuel Supply which is led by Cathay Pacific
Airways, aircraft line maintenance which will be undertaken by Pan Asia
Pacific Aviation Services and China Aircraft Services, a 600-bed
airport hotel franchised to Regal Hotels, and a freight forwarding
centre being developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties.

HONG KONG: PLANS SUBMITTED TO EXTEND HK'S RAPID TRANSIT RAIL

Detailed financial and project plans for a $2.5bn extension to the
rapid transit rail system will be submitted to the Hong Kong government
by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation early in 1996. MTRC project
director, Russell Black, said proposals for the first part of the
extension, a 2km tunnel to provide an easier passenger connection
between the Kwun Tong and Island Lines will be lodged in January. Those
for the second section, involving 9km of new track and six stations
from Lam Tin, on the Kwun Tong line, to Tseung Kwan O, will be sent to
the government in March.

The reports will contain construction estimates, projected passenger
revenue and proposed completion dates. Work on both is due to start in
1998. The MTRC has recently invited consultants to prequalify for
design following the completion of the feasibility study by Maunsell
Consultants Asia.

TAIWAN: SMALL PRINT LEADS TO TUNNEL CONTRACT TERMINATION

Accusations between Taiwan Ret-Ser Engineering and France's Spie
Battignolles TP (SB) threaten to further delay the completion of the
31km Taipei-Ilan Expressway. The dispute is a result of the termination
of a tunnelling contract between the two companies.

Touted as the 'key to the success of the project,' by the ministry of
transportation and communication's (MOTC) Taiwan Area National
Expressway Engineering Bureau (TANEEB), the 12.9km Pinglin Tunnel has
yet to be started. In a contract signed in October 1993, Ret-Ser sub-
contracted the building of the tunnel to SB. However, the contract
required Ret-Ser to build a 12.9km pilot tunnel. Although construction
on the pilot tunnel began in July 1991, only 1.5km was completed by the
proposed date of March 25, 1995.

'Poor geological conditions is the reason for the delay,' said Ret-
Ser's department of special projects director, Tsai Hsi-chi. He
explained that the $1m tunnel boring machine (TBM), used by Ret-Ser for
the first time, got stuck on numerous occasions, the most recent
incident halting work for a nine month stretch. In addition, water
inflow to the tunnel was more than triple the maximum safe operating
limit of 35 litres per second which halted work.

TANEEB has already approved a 300-day extension for Ret-Ser to complete
the pilot tunnel, but Ret-Ser is currently preparing more documents to
apply for a further 365 day extension in the near future, said Ret-Ser
executive vice president, Shen Ching-peng.

Despite the non-completion of the pilot tunnel Ret-Ser asked SB to
begin tunnelling on the main tunnel. SB refused claiming the work would
be a safety hazard and could result in unforeseen problems and delays
without all the geological data gleaned from the completion of the
pilot tunnel. SB project manager, Olivier Colin, likened the situation
to the construction of a house - the foundations must be completed
before construction can proceed. 'We proposed a number of alternative
construction methods for the main tunnel without geological data from
the pilot tunnel, but this was rejected by Ret-Ser,' he said.

The French sub-contractor has now filed a civil suit accusing Ret-Ser
of wrongful termination of the $50m contract after failing to re-
negotiate the price on the original contract. SB have asserted that Ret-
Ser's delay on the completion of the pilot tunnel has resulted in
increased cost and time, thus requiring a revised amount in the new
contract. SB claimed that it stated as a pre-condition in the Request
for Proposal three years ago that the quote on the tunnel project was
based on the completion of the pilot tunnel. Ret-Ser maintains that
there were no clauses in the contract that stated the pilot tunnel must
be completed before SB begins boring the main tunnel.

Ret-Ser's Tsai has also asserted that a change in identity of SB is the
main reason for terminating the contract. The original sub-contractor
was the 150-year-old Spie Battignolles that in July became 'Spie
Battignolles TP' after a restructure and recapitalisation in a merger
between Spie Battignolles and its parent company Schneider. 'According
to Taiwan law, the name on the contract cannot be changed. SB is not
the one who entered into the contract,' said Shen.

Ret-Ser further allege that SB provided inadequate documentation on the
'new company.' Ret-Ser says it is unable to ascertain that the new SB
meets the requirements under the Pre-Qualification list, a factor that
first won Spie Battignolles the contract. Further negotiations with
Schneider proved futile as the parent company refused to act as
guarantor for SB, said Shen.

According to Colin, SB is still the same company as the name on the
contract. The 'TP' or 'Civil Works' was added to the name to emphasise
its focus on civil construction, he said. SB's capital was boosted from
about $40m to around $161m after the merger with Schneider. 'SB's
recapitalisation made the company stronger. A change of name was just
an excuse from Ret-Ser to terminate the contract,' he added.

SB's official spokesperson, C. P. Chen, has said that another problem
behind the dispute is that many local companies still operate in the
'Chinese Way'. 'Political and cultural differences stand in the way of
productive co-operation between local and foreign companies,' he said.

An example of the 'Chinese Way' was Ret-Ser's forcible take-over of
SB's construction and office facilities in mid-November. SB
subsequently lodged a criminal complaint to the Ilan district
prosecutor's office which is currently investigating the case. 'It is
true that the three TBMs are the assets of TANEEB and Ret-Ser during
the construction, but checking SB employee's passports and confiscating
the company's accounts, geological data and documents is unreasonable
and illegal according to our lawyer,' said Chen. He agreed that SB was
in for a tough legal battle against the government-owned Ret-Ser,
technically a department under the Executive Yuan (Cabinet)'s
Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen, rather than a
state-owned enterprise. 'But SB is willing to take on that challenge to
protect its own interest,' Chen added.

Colin sees the cause of the dispute as a simple case of shirking
responsibilities. 'The only reason Ret-Ser terminated the contract is
to hide the fact that they cannot finish the project and to escape
their responsibility. They desperately needed a scapegoat, and as it is
around election time, SB became that ideal scapegoat.'

However, Spie Battignolle has previously acted as the sub-contractor to
Ret-Ser for projects in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Bahrain which have
been successful according to Colin. 'SB had a good working relationship
and worked in total confidence with Ret-Ser - that is why we came over
to Taiwan. SB will work again in Taiwan if a new opportunity arises and
conditions are different. We will be more prudent, since we are not the
only company that have problems with government agencies. The
construction business can be bad and risky but not everything can be
100 per cent covered on paper. A lot of working relationship is based
on trust,' he said.

Meanwhile, Ret-Ser is in discussion with Italy's Torno about completing
the Pinglin Tunnel. The Italian construction company has already won a
bid to work on a 4.8km tunnel, also on the Taipei-Ilan Expressway.
Torno was one of the two companies that expressed interest in the
Pinglin Tunnel out of eight companies that put in a Request for
Proposal. Shen said that Ret-Ser will approach the remaining six
companies individually to find a new sub-contractor to finish the
project.

PHILIPPINES: BARRIERS ARE OVERCOME FOR LRT-3

One of Manila's light rail transit schemes has finally cleared
financial, political and legal barriers. It now seems that the project,
known as LRT-3, can go ahead unimpeded.

Senator Franciso Tatad and other opponents had tried to stop the
project, but the Supreme Court has thrown out their petition.

The concessionaires, led by Fil-Estate and Ayala have raised $150m as
initial paid-up capital. They have appointed JP Morgan as their
financial advisor, and are looking to raise a further $100m and to
float $300m worth of debt instruments on the international capital
markets. Domestic banks (local and foreign) have agreed to provide the
remaining $100m of the total $650m that is required.

The last problem was posed by the so-called 'Save Edsa Movement', led
by columnist Antonio Abaya and supported by the Philippine Motor
Association. Edsa is an acronym for the road along which LRT-3 will
run. The movement objected to the traffic chaos that will be created
when the work is undertaken. It initially proposed an alternative route
for LRT-3, along Circumferential Road No. 5, which runs parallel to
Edsa. However, it has softened its stance and is amendable to the route
along Edsa, as long as alternative routes are provided for vehicles
before construction commences.

INDONESIA: ELABORATE LRT PLANS ARE ANNOUNCED FOR JAKARTA

In the middle of December, 1995, PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada (CLGP)
suddenly announced an elaborate extension to its plans for a light rail
system in Jakarta. It has now said it will spend $1.2bn on a three-
level transport artery in Jakarta, comprised of a public road on the
ground, a light rail line above that and a toll road on the top. The
structure is to cover a distance of 16km between Bintaro in south
Jakarta, downtown Kota in north Jakarta, and a further 2km from Bintaro
to Blok M, also in south Jakarta.

Company chief executive, Bambang Soeroso, said that a consortium would
be formed in May 1996 to carry out the project and finance would be
arranged. CLGP spokesman, Fariza Irawadi, said that the light-rail
aspect of the venture was almost certain to require the participation
of one or more foreign partners. 'Up to now we haven't had any
experience in this country with light rail,' he told AIM. He added that
the company's considerable experience in elevated toll road
construction meant that overseas expertise was unlikely to be needed
for the remainder of the project. Fariza would not be drawn on the
composition of the consortium, but confirmed that several foreign
companies have expressed interest.

He said the plan had not yet been completed and that there might still
be further administrative 'input' on the scheme. 'After that the final
engineering design will be prepared. It will be finished in one year,
with construction beginning in 1997,' he said.

Only in November the plan was still known to the public as entailing
the construction of a light-rail simpliciter. At the beginning of
November, director general of highway construction, Soeharsono
Martakim, said that construction of the light rail line, at that time
still known as the Light Rapid Transit (LRT) system, would begin in
April 1996. In mid-November, when the project carried a price tag of
$800m, minister of transportation, Haryanto Dhanutirto, said that the
LRT would be carried out by CLGP in co-operation with Steady Safe, the
owner of a city taxi business.

The project outline has changed extensively, but what has stayed the
same is that it remains in the hands of CLGP which is controlled by the
president's daughter. The company remains the major private-sector
investor in Indonesian toll roads. It has also built tolls roads in
Malaysia and is preparing to undertake two large toll road projects in
the Philippines.

The Jakarta light rail project was awarded to CLGP early this year
without a tender. Commenting on the fact recently, Haryanto said it
followed because the project had been proposed to the government by the
company. In August, Ms Rukmana publicly denied that her company's
success in gaining infrastructure projects was related to her close
relationship with the president. 'My father, who happens to be trusted
by the people to lead the nation, has always reminded me not to use his
name for business purposes,' she told a local newspaper.

On December 16, 1995, CLGP's subsidiary, Citra Bhakti Margatama Persada
(CBMP) broke ground on the Cikunir-Cakung-Cilicing-Tanjung Priok
section of Jakarta's Outer Ring Road. The 1,920km section of toll road
is scheduled to be operational in 1999, at an investment of Rp1,040m
($4.5bn). Company representatives said the project would be financed
with loans from domestic banks. CBMP is a BOT joint venture between
state-owned toll road company Jasa Marga (34.83 per cent) and CLGP,
Tridan Satriaputra Indonesia, Bhaskara Duniajaya and Yayasan Tiara
Indah. Consultants on the project include Pacific Consultant
International and BIEC International.

BATAM AIRPORT IS UPGRADED TO RIVAL SINGAPORE

Indonesia has started construction of an aircraft maintenance facility
and upgraded the international airport on the island of Batam in a bid
to rival Singapore's Changi airport's role as an international flight
hub for the south-east Asian region. Batam island, which lies a few
kilometres south of Singapore, is being developed as an industrial and
tourist centre together with the Singapore government authorities. The
island's airport already serves as a centre for cargo traffic for
industrial estates located there.

Batam's Hang Nadim airport, controlled by the Indonesian government
through the Batam Industrial Development Authority, has had its runway
extended to 4km at a cost of about $217m. It can now accommodate wide-
bodied aircraft such as Boeing 747-400s.

Construction of an aircraft maintenance and services facility has also
started. PT BAM, or Batam Aircraft Maintenance, located adjacent to
Batam's airport, is scheduled to complete a hangar at a cost of Rp18bn
($7.9m) by the end of 1996. It is hoped that BAM's services will help
lure customers away from Singapore's Changi airport. The maintenance
facility is being built to handle different types of aircraft including
Boeing 737 jets, Fokker planes and Indonesian-built CN 235s. BAM is
majority-owned by Indonesian entities including the state-owned
aircraft manufacturing company, IPTN, and Sempati Air, a private
domestic airline controlled by one of President Suharto's sons.

However, Singapore Technologies Aerospace, a unit of the Singapore
government's Singapore Technologies, also has a 25 per cent stake in
BAM. Singapore Technologies Aerospace is originally believed to have
wanted to take a majority stake in the project, a move which was
opposed by Indonesia's minister for research and technology, Mr B.J.
Habibie. As chairman of the Batam Industrial Development Authority, Mr
Habibie is closely involved with the island's progress.

Batam's goal is to become an international aviation hub. Aviation fuel
is about 20 per cent less expensive on Batam than in Singapore.
However, Singapore's Changi airport controls flight information in
parts of Indonesian airspace, including Batam. The latter has been a
point of some friction between Indonesia and Singapore, although the
boundaries of flight information regions were revised in September 1995
when President Suharto made an official visit to Singapore.

Indonesia was given control of air traffic services over an additional
space stretching from south of its islands of Sumatra to the Natuna
islands in the South China Sea but Singapore's Changi airport retains
supervision of aircraft movements from airports in Batam and
neighbouring Bintan.

The Indonesian authorities want Batam's Hang Nadim airport to act as a
transit and connecting point for international flights. However,
Indonesian officials admit this is still a long way off. 'It is still
hard for international air carriers to transit at Hang Nadim, as the
flow of goods and passengers is still low,' the director general of air
transportation, Mr Zainuddin Sikado, was quoted as saying in the
Jakarta Post. 'The most important thing will be how Batam improves the
quality of its services.'

Currently, there are no international flights to Batam, although eleven
domestic flights connect Batam to other airports throughout the
Indonesian archipelago. Local press reports said that by the end of
1999 twelve additional domestic routes are due to be served from Hang
Nadim.

SINGAPORE DECIDES TO LIST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

Singapore's finance minister, Dr Richard Hu, has just announced the
creation of a foreign board for listing regional infrastructure
projects on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES). The listing criteria
of the foreign board are less stringent than those for the main board.
Infrastructure projects do not require a profit record, they need only
show potential for a reasonable rate of return and good cash flow
'vouched by competent and independent experts.'

For analysts the comparisons with Malaysia are unavoidable. In
September, the Securities Commission there issued a set of
comprehensive guidelines that paved the way for infrastructure projects
to be listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Unlike
conventional initial public offerings, the guidelines stated that
infrastructure project companies (IPCs), which have long gestation
periods, can offer their shares based on forecast earnings, even if
they do not have a profit record.

Candidates for a listing on the KLSE are likely to include Ekran
Corporation's M$15bn ($5.9bn) Bakun hydroelectric project in Sarawak
and the five independent producers. More recently, Malaysia's finance
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, said Malaysia may allow foreign infrastructure
companies controlled by Malaysians to list their shares on the KLSE.

The Singapore guidelines state that infrastructure companies wishing to
list on the proposed new foreign board must have secured projects worth
at least S$300m ($212m). These projects must have a remaining lifespan
of at least 15 years from the date of listing, though companies with
concessions of at least 10 years will also be considered.

'Companies engaged in infrastructure projects need not show profits in
the financial year before listing, nor any record of prior profits, but
they must demonstrate strong cash-flow and a good rate of return over
the duration of the concession,' the SES said in a statement last week.
By comparison, Singapore-incorporated non-infrastructure companies must
have a paid-up capital of S$15m ($10.6m) and cumulative pre-tax profit
of at least S$7.5m ($5.3m) for the last two years, of which S$3m must
be chalked up in the latest year prior to listing. Alternatively, these
companies can be considered if they show a pre-tax profit of at least
S$10m ($7.1m) for the latest year.

'As companies listed on the foreign board are expected to have shorter
track records, investment in these securities may entail additional
risk,' the SES said. 'Warning about the risks specific to such
companies will be required and such warning must be prominently
displayed on the front cover of the prospectus.'

The shares of these companies will be quoted in a foreign currency and
traded in minimum board lot sizes of $2000 or the equivalent. The SES
has also introduced a moratorium requiring company owners to hold their
shareholding for a year after listing. Although they can sell some of
their stake in the subsequent two years, they must hold at least 51 per
cent of the total shares that they had at the time of the listing.

'At least one promoter holding at least 20 per cent of the pre-
floatation issued capital must have the relevant technical management
expertise to carry out and operate the project successfully and to
fulfil all requirements of the project,' the SES said. Companies listed
on the foreign board can transfer to the main board after one year.
However, they have to meet the latter's more stringent listing
criteria. Analysts have welcomed the establishment of the new board,
the third on the local bourse. They say the new board will help raise
the stature of Singapore as a leading regional financial centre.

One investment banker said, 'the new board could attract to Singapore
many large regional companies which are currently contemplating raising
capital in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney,' he said. 'However the shares
of companies listing on the foreign board are expected to be targeted
mainly at institutional buyers'.

THAILAND: BTS MASS TRANSIT OWNERSHIP IS RESTRUCTURED

Tanayong, the concessionaire for Bangkok's elevated rail transit, will
issue $160m worth of secured bonds as part of a shareholder
restructuring, as doubts continue to grow over its financial status.
The listed real estate firm reported in a mandatory stock market filing
that details of the issue price, collateral and launch time would be
released at a later date.

Talks have also opened with Thai-based Siam Commercial Bank on a
planned mobilisation of $562m from local capital markets, which will
form the core of financing for the $1.7bn project. It has already
secured a $50m loan from the International Finance Corporation and
hopes to raise a further $424m from KFW of Germany. 'We understand
contracts for the loans will be signed around the end of the year
(1995) and payment will be made in full to contractors shortly
afterwards,' said a banking executive.

Piling work on the 24km Bangkok Transit System railway began a year ago
but Tanayong has yet to come up with a funding package. Primarily a
developer of low-cost housing estates, it has been heavily affected by
a downturn in the property market and is regarded as having virtually a
zero credit rating. Bangkok Bank resigned as financial adviser earlier
this year after declining to guarantee a loans package. Its
replacement, Siam Commercial Bank, is insisting on a shareholder
restructuring that will bring in equipment suppliers and contractors on
an equity basis.

Italian-Thai Development, the sole construction contractor, has not
been paid since work started, and is expected to hold a 10 to 15 per
cent stake. 'The construction cost of the BTS skytrain is around Bt4m-
Bt5m ($160,000-$200,000) a month. We have received only Bt200m ($8m)
from Tanayong, while the value of work completed is around Bt1.86bn
($74.4m),' said company president, Premchai Karnsauta.

Siemens, the main equipment supplier, and Siam Commercial are expected
to be the other shareholders. Tanayong has agreed to reduce its stake
to 60 per cent, after attempts to push it into a minority role were
thwarted by contractual obligations. This will block efforts to raise
cash by listing the project on the stock exchange, as market rules
require a larger public shareholding. However, another attempt will be
made to diminish Tanayong's stake when its four-year concession
expires.

A Siam Commercial spokesman confirmed that 10 financial institutions
had been approached to join the domestic loans deal, which the bank
will guarantee in the absence of security from Tanayong. The local
package replaced earlier plans for an issue of US Yankee bonds that was
scuttled by bank worries over foreign exchange fluctuations.

Any further delays in putting together a loans package will almost
certainly force a halt in work on the mass transit, which depends
heavily upon the patience of Italian-Thai. About 12 per cent of the
piling work has been finished. 'We will continue to do advance work for
BTS in the next year. That is, we will wait until BTS is ready to pay,'
said Premchai, 'obviously Italian-Thai cannot be expected to continue
on the present basis.' The construction firm is issuing Bt4.9bn ($196m)
worth of bonds to pay for its shares acquisition.

GOVERNMENT RECEIVES OECF LOAN FOR MASS TRANSIT

Japan's Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund (OECF) has approved a $200m
low-interest loan for the Bangkok subway project, providing the first
cash injection for the mass transit. Metropolitan Rapid Transit
Authority (MRTA) director, Theerapong Attajarusit, said a contract
would be signed in the second half of next year for the loan, which
will help pay for civil construction work. It will carry interest of
2.7 per cent with a seven-year grace period.

The government is paying for 80 per cent of the cost of the 21km
railway, with the remaining equity coming from equipment suppliers.
Consultants were due to complete a blueprint for the scheme in December
and formal bids for the construction are expected to be called by
February. A shortlist of eligible contractors, chosen from 28 consortia
that sought pre-qualification status in October, will be released
shortly before bidding starts.

HOPEWELL SEEKS OFFSHORE LOANS TO RAISE FINANCE

Hopewell Holdings will try to raise $2.16bn from offshore loans to
finance its stalled elevated mass transit, after receiving government
assurances that the scheme would not be scrapped - yet.

Project co-ordinator, Anusak Intharapuwasak, confirmed that the group
was holding talks with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Citibank and Mitsui
Trust and Banking for two-thirds of the funding needed for the $3.2bn
project. The remaining funds will come from Hopewell itself. 'The
negotiations are expected to be concluded early next year (1996). These
talks are still going on because Hopewell has just received the
construction designs, which have to be presented to the creditors,' he
said.

Transport Minister, Wan Muhammad, earlier granted Hopewell another two
months to show definite progress on the scheme, amid speculation that
it would be scrapped. He said that unspecified action would be taken
against the firm if it failed to meet the deadline, citing a two-year
delay in completion of the first phase. 'We will decide at that time
what steps can be taken, including the possible cancellation. But at
present we hope that won't be necessary,' he said.

The project was approved five years ago as a multi-level combination of
expressways and railways built above an old freight train line, but has
since made little progress. The Hong Kong firm blames the government
agencies' delays in handing over land holdings and ironing out design
problems, while the government charges that the contract was poorly
devised.

Originally intended to extend 60km, the route is likely to be reduced
by at least one-third because of obstructions that cannot be cleared.
Anusak said the first stage, from Don Muang airport to Yommarat in
central Bangkok, was due to be completed in early December, but only 7
per cent of the work had been carried out. Hopewell now plans to finish
a tollway covering all three phases in time for the 1988 Asian Games,
and the remaining work two years later.

But a transport ministry adviser, Gun Nagamati, said this deadline
would be almost impossible to meet because detailed designs for the
route were incomplete. 'There are conflict points with four expressway
routes that have to be resolved and no one has decided who will pay for
the additional construction costs from the necessary design changes.
This will take a further 12 months to sort out,' he said. Hopewell is
reported to be seeking a buyer for 25 per cent of the project (AIM,
December 1995/p14).

INDIA IS UNLIKELY TO USE WORLD BANK LOAN FOR ROADS

A $206m World Bank loan for upgrading sections of the Delhi-Calcutta
highway may not be used by the surface transport ministry. This is
because it is unable to provide 25 to 30 per cent of the loan's annual
release from its own resources. For this fiscal year the budget for
roads is just Rs3.66bn ($105m), which is not even sufficient to repair
the existing roads.

The surface transport ministry feels that unless the finance ministry
gives it an additional grant for these counterpart provisions, it will
not be able to draw on the World Bank loan. Once the ministry commits
itself to drawing the loan it has to pay commitment fees, even if it
does not finally draw on the loan. The proposed loan was the third
tranche of the World Bank loan for Indian highways. It was meant for
widening and building bridges along the 1,100km Delhi-Calcutta national
highway. After feasibility studies and the project reports global
tenders are normally called for.

The second tranche of $200m has been partly used for the national
highways projects in six states - Punjab, Haryana, Orissa, West Bengal,
Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Of the $200m, only half the amount has
so far been used mainly because the ministry of surface transport was
unable to get the counterpart funds.

JNPT INVITES BIDS FOR CONTAINER TERMINAL

The latest privatisation plans of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust
(JNPT), across the harbour from Bombay, began with the port authorities
inviting tenders for two container berths. The new berths are expected
to cost between $150m and $180m, and will be tendered for on a build-
operate-transfer (BOT) basis for 20 years.

The tenders will have a technical bid and a financial bid. The
technical bids will include 'concept plans' as spelled out in the bid
documents. The financial bid will have to specify a one-time down
payment as a license fee, the royalty on each container handled and
guarantee a minimum annual throughput of containers. If this is not met
the contract would be in default. Only if the technical bids are
accepted will the financial bids be opened. After 20 years the two
container berths and ancillary facilities will revert back to the JNPT
at a depreciated value defined in the tender document.

The qualifying criteria for bids are as follows:

- companies must have over three year's experience of operating and
managing marine container terminals with an annual throughput of
500,000 TEU or more, using state-of-the-art equipment. Average
productivity of quayside cranes over three years of continuous actual
operations must be over 20 moves per hour;

- the average annual turnover of the bidders over the past three years
should be over $100m and paid-up capital of the company registered by
the bidders should be over $33m;

- the bidders should have adequate experience in the marketing and
development of international seaborne trade and sufficient expertise
available for efficient operation of a port-related container freight
station;

- the bidders need not have an Indian partner but the party finally
selected will have to be registered in India.

The tenders are to be submitted by April 19, 1996, and will be awarded
by the end of 1996. Work should be completed within three years. Mr
Shukla, port planning and development manager at the JNPT, expects the
bids will interest the 15 to 20 companies world-wide which have the
experience.

JNPT TENDER DETAILS:

The sale of bid documents will be from December 26, 1995 to January 15,
1996 on payment of Rs20,000 by demand draft payable to 'Jawaharlal
Nehru Port Trust'. The documents can be purchased from the Bombay
office of the JNPT at either:

1107, Raheja Centre, FPJ Marg, Nariman Point, Bombay 400 021. Tel: +91
22 2842733/2832458; or

Port Office: Administration Building, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust,
Sheva, New Bombay 400 707. Tel: +91 22 7242623/7242632.

Important dates:                                      1996

Review of bid document by bidders:             13 February
Bidders to seek clarification:               4 March, 1996
Pre-bid visit to JNPT:                         5 & 6 March
Pre-bid meeting:                               5 & 6 March
Further clarifications/queries by bidders:        16 March
Last date for submission for bids:          19 April, noon
Opening of technical bids:                   19 April, 3pm
Earnest money deposits on submission of bids:        Rs10m

The scope of the work involves the construction of two berths with a
total length of 450m to the north of the existing three container
terminals, and the development of container yards on 20ha of land to
store 15,000 to 20,000 containers. The two new berths are expected to
have a throughput of 470,000 TEU in the sixth year of operation. In the
last fiscal year (1994-95) the three existing container terminals of
the JNPT handled 240,000 TEU which is expected to go up to 400,000 TEU
by 1996-97. The berths should take third generation container ships of
12m draft. The minimum equipment required will be four cranes for
berths, each costing around $30m to $32m and capable of 70,000 to
80,000 moves a year, 10 cranes in the yard, and two cranes in the
railway yard. Similarly successful bidders must have operated quayside
cranes for three years with an average productivity of not less than 20
moves an hour, whilst the present highest crane productivity at JNPT
has been 12.2 moves an hour.

At present the turnaround time for container ships at JNPT is under 48
hours and containers lie in their yards for an average of one week. The
operating efficiency of the new container berths will have to be
considerably higher if they are to meet the throughput requirements of
JNPT.

Earlier plans for privatising the existing three container berths met
with political opposition and were dropped by the surface transport
ministry which is responsible for ports in the country.

Shukla says that the environmental clearance for five berths at a new
chemical terminal is expected to be passed within a couple of months.
Tenders for building the chemical berths and supporting facilities on a
BOT basis will follow soon after. When approved, this new terminal,
south of the existing bulk terminal at JNPT will boost the port's
capacity considerably. Shukla expects the chemical terminal to be
handling around 18m tonnes of bulk chemicals in another decade, making
it the largest in the country. For the moment, however, action is
centred on the bids for the container berths.

TENDERS ARE INVITED FOR ENNORE PORT PROJECT

Under an Asian Development Bank (ADB)-aided project, the new Ennore
port project of the Madras Port Trust has invited prequalification
tenders. The tenders are open to contractors from eligible member
countries of the ADB. The Ennore port is being built to handle coal,
and the prequalification tenders are preliminary to the actual bidding
for the works. The major works for which tenders have been invited are:

- dredging of the entrance channel and port basin of Ennore;

- construction of a wharf; and

- the construction of two breakwaters totalling 4km.

For the dredging works, approximately 9.7m cu m of sand and clay will
have to be removed from the port basin to a depth of 15.5m and another
3.2m cu m from the entrance channel. The contractors will have to
supply all the dredging, pumping, and earthmoving equipment and will
have to dispose of the dredged material within 5km of the site.

The construction of the wharf for coal unloading will be 550m by 26m in
water depths ranging from 3m to 7m. There will also be the construction
of three small jetties and the building of three approach bridges, one
to each jetty from the southern breakwater access road.

The two breakwaters will have a total length of 4km and will be of the
rubble mount type. The works involve underwater compaction of sand,
dumping of rocks supplied by the Madras Port Trust at onshore sites,
casting concrete Accropode armour units and placing them on the
breakwaters, and building an access road on the breakwaters. (Further
details are provided in the 'Tenders' section on page 31.)

BIDS CALLED FOR KARACHI'S WORLD TRADE CENTRE

The communications ministry has thrown a spanner in the Karachi Port
Trust's (KPT) ambitious multi-million dollar project to build a World
Trade Centre in the port city of Karachi and has instructed the client,
Karachi Port Foundation (KPF), to invite bids instead of awarding the
$100m contract to Promet Engineering of Singapore. The directive was
issued to KPT and KPF after protests from the US World Trade Centre in
New York, which claimed that it has contractual and legal rights to
construct the centre.

The permanent secretary at the communications ministry, Sher Afghan
Khan, informed the KPT of the government's decision and asked it to
prepare tender documents and have them published in local and
international dailies. He said the lowest bidder who also fulfils the
requisite terms and conditions, and has a solid financial background,
should be given the chance to build the World Trade Centre in a joint
venture with the Karachi Port Foundation. The KPT says that it hopes to
float tenders by the end of December, 1995.

Promet Engineering was so convinced that it had won the contract that a
number of experts from the firm's Singapore office have visited Karachi
on several occasions, inspected the site of the project, and held
numerous meetings with officials of the KPT. A memorandum of agreement
was recently signed between Promet Engineering and the KPT, inter alia
development of a container terminal, entertainment and recreational
facilities, a T-head jetty, transhipment and other port-related
facilities at Karachi port. According to plans prepared by the Karachi
Port Foundation, the trade centre complex will comprise of office
blocks for shipping companies, insurance firms, banks and international
trade institutions.

FINAL AGREEMENT IS DUE TO BE SIGNED FOR MASS TRANSIT

Canada's SNC-Lavalin, in a joint venture with Turkey's STFA and
Pakistan's Adamjee, is to construct the $500m, 15.2km, Corridor I of
the much-delayed Karachi Mass Transit project. They will sign the
agreement with the client, Islamabad-based National Mass Transit
Authority (NMTA), on January 17, 1996, according to sources close to
the joint venture. They said the delay was caused due to the financial
close and minor 'hiccups'.

The consortium was issued with a letter of intent by NMTA in November.
The project will be built on a build-operate-transfer basis and will
take two years to complete. Work is scheduled to start in early 1996.
The NMTA has decided to finance $163m of the scheme from its own
resources after it got 'fed-up' by the World Bank's foot dragging. The
donor agency had promised to provide a loan for the project but found
'too many inconsistencies'. The route alignment has had to be changed
several times in order to avoid densely populated areas along the
route, which runs from Mereweather Tower to Sohrab Goth. Pakistan
Railways has issued a 'no-objection certificate' to NMTA to ward off
criticism from environmentalists.

Meanwhile, bids for Corridor II of the light rail scheme are scheduled
to be opened in January 1996, sources close to the government said. A
number of international companies are reported to have pre-qualified
but were not named.

CONTROVERSIAL WINNER FOR SUKKUR BRIDGE IS ANNOUNCED

Italy's Astaldi has a Rs1.5bn ($60m) contract to build the proposed new
Sukkur Bridge in Sindh province. The contract has upset China National
Overseas Engineering Corporation, a company owned by the Chinese
ministry of foreign trade and co-operation, which submitted the lowest
bid for the project at a bid price of Rs1.134bn ($33.1m).

Moreover, of the nine bids submitted to the National Highways Authority
(NHA), Astaldi's bid was the only one submitted after the deadline of
August 30, 1995. Referring to the late submission of the bid by the
Italian company, the consultants, Denmark's COWI Consult declared that,
'Astaldi's bid was brought to the meeting room (at the NHA head office)
at 11.20 am ... all bidders were asked whether they would accept the
bid from Astaldi. As none of the bidders had any objections, the bid
was accepted as being received in due time'. Industry sources say this
statement appears to be an attempt to obfuscate the real issue, since
it was not the other bidders' responsibility, but NHA's, to reject the
bid because it had been submitted late.

'The "Instructions to Bidders" in this regard were unequivocal and very
clear. But not only was Astaldi's bid opened along with those of the
eight other bidders, NHA has now decided to award the contract to the
Italian company, and that too, at a price that is a staggering Rs366m
($10.7m) more than the price quoted by China National Overseas
Engineering,' it added.

Industry sources say that this suggests that Astaldi must have some
very influential political connections indeed in Islamabad. They say
this perception gains further credence when the NHA comes up with
flimsy excuses to sideline China National's bid. NHA claimed that the
Chinese company did not have enough English-speaking staff and that its
bid was 'too low'.

In a letter to NHA, China National said, 'we are prepared to offer any
guarantees within the realm of internationally accepted construction
norms, and as defined in the contracts documents, to assure the
National Highways Authority of our intention to complete the project in
full compliance with the tender specifications and within the time
period stipulated'.

When the NHA invited pre-qualification applications from interested
firms to bid for the construction of the new Sukkur Bridge earlier in
1995, 35 companies applied. Of these, NHA pre-qualified only 15 to bid
for the project, which is being financed by the Manila-based Asian
Development Bank.

Of the 15 pre-qualified companies, only nine submitted bids. They were:

- China National Overseas Engineering Corporation - Rs1.134bn ($33m);

- Astaldi - Rs1.501bn ($44m);

- China Road and Bridge Corporation - Rs1.744bn ($51m);

- S. Korea's Daewoo Corporation - Rs1.745bn ($51m);

- Dogus Construction and Trading - Rs1.76bn ($51m);

- S. Korea's Daelim Industrial - Rs1.805bn ($53m);

- Turkey's STFA - Rs2.051bn ($60m);

- Chulas Rasool Doojin Nazir of Pakistan and S. Korea - Rs2.1bn ($61m);

- Tekser & Wayss & Freytag of Turkey and Germany - Rs2.491bn ($73m).

COASTAL ROAD CONTRACT GOES TO IRANIAN CONSORTIUM

A consortium of Iranian construction companies led by Mostazafan-o-
Janbazan Foundation (MJF), is poised to win a Rs11.5bn ($440m) contract
to build a 650km coastal road linking Mekran division, Baluchistan
province with Karachi, according to acting communications minister,
Sher Afghan. He said the project will be jointly funded by both Iran
and Pakistan.

Sher Afghan said Islamabad would contribute some 60 per cent of the
money while the rest will be provided by the Iranian government. He
declined to name the donor agency with whom Pakistan was seeking funds
but said negotiations were 'almost complete'. He said the contract with
the Iranian companies will be signed in early January, and the
memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the joint venture project was
signed between the two countries on May 17, 1995. The completion is for
1998-99, he added.

RANGOON PORT DEPOT JV

The Myanmar Port Authority (MPA) and Singapore's Allied Container
Services have agreed to form a company to build and operate a depot in
Rangoon port. MPA will hold a 51 per cent stake in the venture and
Allied will hold the remaining 49 per cent. The new venture, called MPA-
Allied Yangon Inland Container Depot plans to complete the first phase
of building in six months. The depot's final capacity will be 500

CATHAY PACIFIC WITHDRAWS FROM AIRPORT JV

Cathay Pacific Airways has withdrawn from a Yn1.2bn ($144m) joint
venture to expand Xiamen airport in Fujian province. The project was
announced in August 1994 and involved expanding the aircraft apron area
and the airport's runway by 760m to 3.4km. However, Cathay's withdrawal
follows a series of setbacks which it claims have rendered the project
commercially unviable. Cathay, which owned 33 per cent of the project,
has said that it could not agree terms with Xiamen International
Airport, its mainland partner which holds the remaining 67 per cent. In
addition the Chinese authorities refused Cathay permission to run
airport security or ticketing sales, and wanted the time frame to be
less than 30 years. Cathay has invested no money in the project and a
spokesman for the company said that it would keep its options open for
other mainland airport investments.

filed with the Board of Investments. ATI is 33 per cent held by P&O
Australia, which recently issued a statement saying that ATI will issue
150m shares to the public or 20 per cent on 25 December, 1995. They
will be issued at 5.10 peso and will raise about A$40m ($29.6m). All
Asia Capital and Trust, which is underwriting the deal, said the
offering price was pegged at 12.5 times the company's projected
earnings per share. P&O's holding will be diluted to about 26 per cent
following the issue. Asian Terminals is the exclusive handler of
international bulk cargo at the Port of Manila. It also expects to open
a $36m grains terminal in January in Mariveles in Bataan province, west
of Manila, which will be the first commercial grains terminal in the
Philippines. The company plans to expand its container and cargo
handling facilities in South Harbour, Manila's largest port, from
12.5ha to 17.7ha, to accommodate 700,000 containers by 1997, up from
the present 500,000. Containerised and non-containerised cargo passing
through South Harbour rose by 35.6 per cent and 12.3 per cent
respectively in 1994, while total trade in the Philippines rose by 20.2
per cent. The company is also interested in the government's port
development projects in other parts of the Philippines such as General
Santos, Cagayan do Oro and Davao in Mindanao in the south, Cebu in

UNITED COMMUNICATIONS WINS CCTV CONTRACT

United Communication Industry, a Thai-based company, will supply $5.2m
worth of closed circuit TV equipment to Bangkok Metropolitan
Administration for a traffic monitoring system. The national government
is providing 60 per cent of the funding under a transport upgrading
programme for Bangkok, and the BMA - loosely equivalent to a city
council - will cover the rest of the cost. A BMA spokesman said the
contract was for the second stage of a British-installed computer-
activated scheme that has already been installed at 16 key
intersections. Under stage two, a further 44 monitoring points will be
established. United Communication is contracted to finish installing
the TV equipment by early 1997.

TANK TERMINAL FINANCE

A $48m two-tranche, limited-recourse project financing deal for Thai
Tank Terminal is in syndication, said the arranger, ABN AMRO Bank. The
funds will be used to finance the construction of Phases II and III of
the tank terminal facilities at the Mab Ta Phut port. The $23m tranche
A, for Phase II, carries a maturity of eight years with an average life
of 4.8 years. The $25m tranche B, for phase III, carries a maturity of
nine years with an average life of six years. The margin for both is
150 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. Repayment of
the facility will be in 16 semi-annual unequal instalments. Repayment
of tranche A will start in March 1996 and repayment of tranche B in
June 1997. Fees are 20 basis points for lead managers committing to $8m
or more and 15 basis points for managers committing to $4m or more.

VIETNAMESE BRIDGE OPENS

A bridge has been opened linking Hanoi with the major ports of Haiphong
and Quang Ninh in the north-east. It spans the Kinh Thay river and is
333m long. It is also hoped that the bridge will help tourism by
cutting travelling time between Hanoi and the northern resort of Ha
Long Bay from four hours to just two.

CENTRAL ASIA DIGEST: Cashing in on Kazakhstan

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The signs are that Kazakhstan - larger than western Europe, but with a
population smaller than Malaysia's - will be back to economic growth in 1997.
A number of major developments signalling a bright resource-rich future have
taken place this year, most of them involving Eastern companies. So this
crossroads-of-Asia market has to be taken seriously now.

"Potentially one of the richest countries in the world" said the London
"Financial Times" in a special review (11 July 1996).

Oil and gas are the keys to future prosperity - the problem has been getting
them to Western markets. On 27 April financing for the Caspian Pipeline (to
Novorossiisk from the huge Tengiz oilfield) was at last agreed; the dollars
should start coming in from the end of the century. These must eventually
fuel a consumer boom in Almaty near the China border (a new central capital
may be under construction by then). Meanwhile the building teams on the 750km
route will create heavy demand for foodstuffs, engineering supplies and many
commercial services.

On 13 May the missing rail link between Iran (leading to Turkey's
Mediterranean ports) and Almaty was completed. The new Trans-Asiatic Line
carries freight via Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Meanwhile upgrading work
proceeds on the recently-plugged Aktogay-Urumchi line which leads to the
Chinese port of Lyanyungan. Access to the old Trans-Siberian is good, and
Kazakhstan's part-electrified, part-dualled lines have substantial surplus
capacity. So access to this landlocked country is going to be less of a
problem.

On 17 June the German subsidiary of Samsung (Korea) acquired on complicated
lease terms a 40 per cent stake in the huge copper mining/smelting facilities
at Zhezkazkantsvetmet, pledging investment of over US$1bn over a 15-year
period. Production has doubled over the last twelve months, and the chaebol
is expected to acquire a majority share shortly.

And on 18 June Indian mega-investor Lakshmi Mittal purchased no less than 15
coal mines to feed the huge integrated Karmet steel complex at Karaganda
which Ispat had earlier acquired (with debts). With the aid of steelmaking
equipment from Samsung Shipbuilding & Heavy Industries Co production has
nearly tripled already this year, and this promises to be one of Asia's key
basic and structural steel sources. Nearly all output used to be kept within
the former Soviet Union. Following the customs union agreement of 1995 with
Russia, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan this trade is reviving already. But the
Kazakhs want more business in non-CIS Asia.

So Kazakhstan really is on the move, and the dreamers are talking of a
breadbasket cum basic-industries heartland in the centre of Asia. The former
Soviet Cosmodrome is thrown in - but so too are vast areas unsuitable for
anything because of nuclear tests conducted in Stalin's era. Not much can be
done about these, but in the metallurgical-industry zones environmental
clean-up technology is badly needed.

China looks to gain most; five per cent of imports came form here last year
(against two-thirds from the CIS, mostly the Russian Federation itself). The
border is notoriously leaky, both for foodstuffs and consumer goods.
One market that enterprising local businessmen seem to have filled already
is in used cars. Dubai on the Persian Gulf is the centre of a thriving trade
in secondhand road vehicles by enthusiastic Kazakhs who have left their Ladas
behind. But good trucks and buses are in short supply.

For the latest information fax the Almaty Chamber of Trade & Industry on +7
3272 620594. Most trade fairs in Almaty are energy related, but an
international consumer goods event will be held from 15-18 April next year
(fax +1 703 406 8543 for details). The annual INTERKAZAKH general-purpose
fair, open to the public, is held at the beginning of September (fax +90 312
417 5253; Imbat/Ankara).

Your news invited!

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Asian Review plans to cover business developments in Central Asia regularly
in depth. East Europe has taken off - now it's the turn of the member states
of the CIS. These newly-independent countries have enormous resources,and are
eager to do business in East and Southeast Asia.

Has your company started to trade on the Silk Road? Do you have a business
story - good or bad - to tell? The area is poorly covered by the business
news services, and Asian Review would like to hear your reports from this
exciting new frontier. Small-company news will be particularly welcome.

Czech Business & Trade

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The official monthly "Czech Business & Trade" has been promoting the local
electrical engineering industry recently. Two articles have been carried on
the subject this year, revealing that 14 per cent of output comes into the
"heavy" distribution/switching equipment categories. And the March issue
revealed that no less than 13 out of the top 35 Czech companies are
classified within the "power engineering" sector - led by CEZ (number-one
company overall) and Severomoravska Energetika. Details of the "Sdruzeni
Czech Top 100" can be obtained from ING Bank by fax on +42 2 232 0026.
Under onslaughts from suppliers like Halla in Korea power engineering is one
of the last old-era trade bastions to fall; the Czechs want a slice of the
profitable Asian build-operate-transfer market.

CONSTRUCTION DIGEST: A hammer from Singapore

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

NatSteel Engineering Pte Ltd has become one of the major players in the
engineering business in Singapore. Today, it has set its sights on further
diversification. It develops and manufactures its own products, including the
NSE Hydraulic Hammer.

This new product consist of a dropping weight solid ram, rigid hammer
housing, pile helmet with inner cap and cushion, and two lifting cylinders
with hydraulic components.

What makes this NSE product different? The company claims several
characteristics and benefits, including: the short time needed to change
attachments; greater impact and vertical driving capacity; automatic and
manual mode; low noise level; advanced design, and the ability to vary the
energy per blow by varying the height of fall.

Slipform success

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Contractors on the record-breaking Ting Kau Bridge in Hong Kong have opted
to use the specially developed RMD slipform technique for a further four
support piers, in addition to the three main pylons which the company are
currently sliding.

Formwork specialist RMD has already provided purpose-designed forms for the
bridge's three central pylons and will now carry out and deliver slipform
operations for four piers ranging from 46-56m in height.

RMD has developed its basic slipform system to meet the project's specific
requirements for the three main pylons, providing further decks and a
framework to lift and support internal soffits. The adaptations also offer
additional storage space with an extra platform added as required.

The main advantage of RMD equipment is that the heavy duty slipforms produce
greater rigidity leading to more improved accuracy than with conventional
systems. The system also offers tolerances within BS5606, and yet still
allows more weight to be carried with the added attraction of extra storage
space.

Pavseel specified

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

A major new development currently being undertaken for the Port of Singapore
includes extending the container storage area by some 14,000 sq.m. Concrete
block pavers which match existing areas were chosen for the new facilities.
ACM Pavseel was specified for sealing the new installation as well as for
stabilising the existing areas. To date, over 20,000m have been treated with
a further 5,000m of block paving soon to be laid.

The importance of jointing sand stabilisation has gained wide acceptance
amongst experienced paving specifiers in recent years and ACM Pavseel is
acknowledged as a proven system for this purpose.

Trenchless technology

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Tracto-Technik steerable boring systems have been put to good use in Taiwan,
where contractors have been installing gas pipes. In the city of Shin-Chu a
total of 913m of gas HD-PE pipe had to be installed. The contractor decided
to invested in a Grundodrill after initial theoretical training of the new
operators - the first bores were done in March this year.

A total of 20 working days had been allotted for the installation of the
pipes, but due to the skills of the new operators - who had never worked with
Tracto-Technik equipment before - the time required was reduced to less than
12 days.

Using the Grundodrill percussive hammer, up to 1,000 strokes per minute can
be applied onto the drill stems so that steering the bore head even in stony
soils is possible, whether other fluid-assisted boring systems without hammer
would fail.

Compact and powerful, Magnum Diamond's .38 special pavement saw can be used
for joint widening, highway patching and repairing and other tasks. The use
of high quality components in the manufacturing of this well-balanced unit
makes it durable and dependable. The unibody frame, jig-welded reinforced
steel plate, has rolled edges and heavy gauge steel cowling for added
strength.

Civil instrumentation and systems

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Construction of the Estan Dam in China was facilitated by the use of
equipment and services from drilling-parameter recording specialists Jean Lutz
SA of Jurancon (France).

For over ten years this company has been developing and manufacturing
instrumentation for measurement and recording of problems encountered during
drilling, injection, pile construction, tunnelling and specialised work on
foundations. All necessary sensors and software are supplied to client
engineers as part of a package deal.

This company's equipment is intended for use under extreme environmental
conditions, by non-specialised operatives. Training courses are available on
demand, and an in-house data processing service can be used if required.
As an example the CL88/EPF Drilling and Injection Parameter Recorder features
simultaneous graphical and digital recording, the former by means of a
high-definition printer which incorporates headings, scales and ad hoc
observations by operators. The CL88 measures and records from one-ten
parameters, such as depth, instantaneous drilling rate and time,
thrust/restraint/water pressures, vibration by reflected percussion wave,
water/mud/air flow rates, mast inclination etc. Data resulting is stored on
MEMOBLOC and downloaded into a PC using the supplier's EXEPF software.
Instruments such as these have become key tools of foundation construction
specialists worldwide. Their principal areas of application are in soil
investigation, preparation of deep foundations by flight auger piling and
other processes; and jet grouting. These measuring/recording devices
frequently form part of an automatic control process, as in subterranean
pouring of concrete and mast positioning.

Developments in micro-electronics mean that the associated software becomes
more and more a vital part of the package - for a new site a new tailor-made
program is simply slotted in.

The CL88's multi- and compound parameter ability means that programming on
site is possible through the use of scrolling menus, and instantaneous
production of graphs and associated documentation is of great benefit to the
resident engineer. In certain cases the multiple recordings of conditions
immediately ahead of a tunnelling machine (for example) are produced with
simultaneous interpretations available in the field.

Related equipment includes the JTC (recording jet grouting parameters), the
LGH Lugeon tester, and the VIB vibration parameter recorder - all prefixed
CL88 in the Lutz product line-up. Also available are the Taracord CE
continuous flight auger piling recorder, TRANSCARD tunnelling recorder,
MICROPAC automatic controls for mixing plants, and the VOPI and PVCIMENT
systems for measuring grouting conditions.

The company's PPF4 deviated control panel presents at one point all necessary
data for the accurate use of a drilling machine.

By means of Jean Lutz equipment solutions can be found to problems
encountered during drilling, injection, piling and other foundation

CRANES: Lift off for new era

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The takeover by a Malaysian group of an Australian crane builder points to
a new engineering industry for Southeast Asia. Asian Review projects the way
forward.

Just as Asia - especially China - has become the centre of gravity of the
world cement market, so Hong Kong and Singapore have become the hub of the
crane business. For years more cranes of most types have been changing hands
here than anywhere else. Now with the formation of Favelle Favco Cranes
(Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (a subsidiary of Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd, established
by purchase from an Australian principal in 1995) the region is well on its
way to founding its own crane-building industry. FFC is currently advertising
in the world's specialised heavy-lift press, offering a range of tower,
wharfside and dedicated offshore equipment.

Previous attempts to establish a crane building industry locally have focused
on licensing arrangements, such as Grove's with Daewoo and Gru Comedil's with
Guangdong Comedil Construction Machinery.

So an exciting new era has opened. How long will it be before Asia-built
lifting equipment is heading west (and to Japan) - reversing the direction
of a vigorous trade that has been established over the last 40 years? Already
a considerable amount of high-specification structural steelwork, used for
lattice booms and towers, is incorporated in western fabrications. And other
components are sourced locally too; most of the world's key crane builders
having representative offices at least in one of the two cities.

A key strength of this embryo industry is the sheer number of agents and used
equipment suppliers, such as Continental Equipment (Hong Kong) and Lynne Hunt
(Singapore), who have built up a formidable expertise in the field. This now
rivals the globally-active used crane supply business once dominated by
European groups like HOVAGO (Netherlands). The used-plant market is still the
core of the multi-million dollar local trade.

Asian Review predicts that the way the industry is likely to develop is by
renovation and re-manufacturing of tower cranes. Mobile crane technology is
still too sophisticated, with too many of the patents jealously held by
foreign builders. Dockside portal cranes offer good potential, but the market
is too small and well supplied for local competition to start up
successfully. But with so many mega projects like Chek Lap Kok airport taking
shape the demand for these versatile lifters has never been stronger. And
with a re-manufactured unit costing perhaps half the capital outlay of new
equipment - fully updated and with a brand new serial number (and warranty)
attached - concentrating on this segment of the market makes a lot of sense.

Locally rebuilt cranes are already widely available, both from manufacturers'
agents (though not all western crane builders support this activity), and
from independent suppliers. Typically these have all wearing components like
bearings and motors replaced with reconditioned parts, usually sourced in the
original factory. Standard items like cables are replaced with new. Often the
cab is updated with a contemporary range of electronic controls, and the
unit's lifting capacity may be upgraded while still remaining within strict
local rules too. But the basic structure remains unchanged, and the original
serial number applies. An advantage of this sector of the industry is that
local suppliers know their customers' needs very well, and can thus customise
the crane for the precise conditions in which it will be expected to operate.
This is particularly important for offshore operators. Crane rebuilding is
already a well-established local industry, as is the much simpler repair work
undertaken by most distributors.

The attitude of original suppliers to crane re-manufacturing varies widely;
some support it, with their own specialised facilities such as those owned
by Manitowoc in Arkansas. Others, particularly the Japanese builders, are
less keen, and very few mobile manufacturers want to get involved at all. But
for local engineering firms the market for re-manufacturing of tower cranes
appears to be wide open, as long as necessary principals' support is
obtained.

Suitable units have to be very thoroughly inspected so that there are no
nasty surprises when the equipment is taken (literally) to pieces. Boom
damage in particular has to be precisely assessed and rectified. All
structural steelwork has to be sandblasted back to bare metal, all welds and
other fixings examined carefully, and the unit must be finished according to
the original specifications. All working components have to be replaced with
new in order to obtain a new product designation. A brand-new cab and control
system is normally installed. Obviously it would be impossible to undertake
these tasks without the full co-operation of the original manufacturer. Then,
before the crane can be licensed for local use it has to be inspected by
local officials, with all necessary documentation presented. Rules vary
widely within Southeast Asia, so the ultimate destination has to be known
from the outset of the operation.

The re-manufacturing of very heavy lifters - the sort of cranes used to ship
in turbine and process-plant equipment, for example - seems to be a good
starting point for this proto-industry. These cranes command premium hire
rates, and are often completely unavailable. Being so large they are
relatively easy to both inspect and work on. Many widely-available components
common to smaller cranes are incorporated. And there seems no end to the
growth of demand for their services.

The next stage in the development of the local crane industry must be
indigenous R&D. Several local fabricators already specialise in
single-purpose add-ons, usually oriented to the needs of oil and gas
producers. These are tailored uniquely to the requirements of individual
local users. But there is no reason why markets further afield should not be
tackled too. All the requirements of steel geometry fabrication are available
locally, so building these to locally-developed designs is the obvious next
step. And modular components like motors and winding drums can be purchased
off the shelf. So there is little reason why Southeast Asia's own range of
tower cranes should not be seen on worldwide construction site skylines early
in the next century.

If the frenetic pace of local demand development allows room for such
exports, that is.

CRANES: A new generation

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The HS843 HD Litronic heralds a new generation of high technology hydraulic
crawler cranes from Liebherr. The design and construction concepts behind
this model, say the manufacturer, are clear responses to the many criteria
demanded by crawler crane users, incorporating many innovative ideas and
improved qualities.

Increased output and efficiency, excellent stability combined with low
operating weight, durability and strong construction, high operating safety,
low maintenance costs and extreme versatility are just some of the many
features of Liebherr's technologically advanced hydraulic crawler crane.
The HS843 HD is a 60t class machine and supersedes the HS842 HD. In comparing
the two cranes, the new product has 30 per cent more engine power, with no
change in operating weight. There is a corresponding 27 per cent increase in
the hydraulics performance too.

Link-Belt Construction Equipment Company has introduced its new 150t LS-238H
crawler crane. This all-hydraulic lattice boom model offers contractors lift
capacities equal to the older Link-Belt LS-518, with fast non-assisted
stripdown and lightweight modular components that are easy to transport.

CRANES: A different class

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

With the AC 75 City Class, Mannesman Demag presents a new two-axle telescopic
crane which they claim combines manoeuvrability, compactness, outstanding
performance and functional design.

The overall length of the carrier is only 6.68m, and clearance height is
below 3m. The boom sits next to and slightly below the cab in travelling mode
to give optimal driver visibility.

According to market studies carried out by the manufacturer, transit time to
a job site can take up much of a crane's daily operation time. With its fully
automatic transmission, fuel efficiency is maximised at any speed.

INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN ASIA: Doing business by the bay

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

When Wong Wen Chi flew into the Philippines to work for telecommunications
giant Thomson Consumer Electronics at the burgeoning Subic Bay Freeport, he
was destined to find both business and pleasure.

The Subic Bay Industrial hub, where Thomson relocated 15 per cent of its
world-wide telephone manufacturing operations in 1994, has emerged as one of
the Philippines' leading manufacturing centres as well as a recreational
paradise.

"It's very convenient here," said the 50-year-old Wong, who oversees the
production of 250,000 telephone sets every month at a plant in the freeport,
located in Subic town, Zambales, about 90km northwest of Manila. Outside of
work, he sweats it out on a tennis court, learns golf or makes use of one of
the many sports and amusement facilities inside the 14,600-hectare industrial
area.

Wong's company, attracted by the freeport's infrastructure, availability of
English-speaking production staff and air and sea cargo links to major
capitals, is planning to expand business by transferring its entire telephone
manufacturing operations, now spread across Asia, to Subic.

The transformation of the former U.S. naval base is phenomenal. Just five
years ago, it was partially buried under tons of volcanic ash along with
large areas of the main Luzon island after Mt.Pinatubo erupted. A year after
the eruption, the United States withdrew from the facility.

The Philippine government salvaged US$8bn worth of infrastructure left by the
Americans from under tons of volcanic ash and started transforming the place
into a boom town, envisioning another Hong Kong.

Today, the government agency in charge of the freeport, the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority (SBMA), has convinced 209 companies, mostly from
neighbouring Taiwan, to move in with about US$1.49bn worth of investments.
Some 137 of the firms, including Thomson, are already in operation,
manufacturing products that include computer motherboards, neck ties, Reebok
rubber shoes, armoured cars and small boats. The rest are preparing for
business.

The man at the centre of Subic's phenomenal rise from the ashes is Richard
Gordon, a charismatic but controversial politician, who heads the SBMA. "We
have survived Mt. Pinatubo's eruption. We have survived the closure of the
American base - and we have made the situation better," said Gordon, a former
mayor of Olongapo town next to Subic. Gordon's effort, backed by a battery
of young, Western-educated executives is paying off, but it's not all plain
sailing. Unable to rely on a national government too preoccupied with
rehabilitating a country from decades of political and economic stagnation,
Gordon set out on his own, travelling around the globe to reach out
personally to potential investors.

He privatised most of the freeport's utilities as a guarantee against the
unstable supply of power, water and other basic services that had driven away
investors elsewhere in the country.

Among Subic's utilities are a power supply of 60MW, water supply of 12m
gallons per day, a base telephone system with 7,000 (expandable to 13,000)
lines, and tank storage for 2.4m barrels of petroleum products.

Last year, the U.S.-based cargo carrier Federal Express made Subic the Asian
base of its world-wide delivery system after its 2,744-metre-long runway was
lengthened and widened to accommodate large aircraft. Fedex's entry also
boosted the freeport's potential as a manufacturing centre.

Subic was also chosen as the venue for the Apec Summit, a crowning glory for
Gordon, who is widely believed to harbour presidential ambitions.

Two years ago, the World Bank approved a US$40m loan to upgrade
infrastructure including a US$12m airport passenger terminal. Some good
fortune, coupled with incentives like a five per cent profits tax, duty-free
imports, full repatriation of capital and profits and land lease of up to 75
years, have lured big-league investors like Taiwan's Acer Computer and the
American-owned Coastal Petroleum, a distributor of petroleum products in
Asia.

Officials are also concentrating on developing Subic's potential as a prime
tourist destination. More than US$279m worth of construction projects -
including a hotel, condominiums, conference facilities, golf courses, marina,
and casinos are planned.

Subic is one of 18 industrial zones the Philippines is developing in its bid
to bounce back as one of Asia's economic tigers after decades of political
and economic stagnation.

The industrial zones were set up under the economic reforms unleashed by
President Fidel Ramos in an effort to liberalise practically all sectors of
business. The the government hopes they will act as investment magnets across
the Philippines.

About 50km north-west of Subic, another former U.S. military base is also
rising from the ashes of Mt. Pinatubo volcano. The Clark Special Economic
Zone, a 33,000-hectare former U.S. air force base is being transformed by the
Manila government into the Philippines' main gateway wit the building of an
international airport complex that will replace Manila's congested Ninoy
Aquino International Airport. Officials plan to construct another runway in
1998 in addition to two 3.2km-long runways at the airfield.

The Clark Development Corporation (CDC), the state agency overseeing
development in the former air force base, is planning to turn large
warehouses, stockyards, depots and residential units into factories that
would operate as an economic zone similar to Subic. Unlike Subic, however,
only a few big-name investors have moved to Clark.

Romeo David, chairman of the CDC, said a total of 71 foreign and local
companies have set up business and 78 others have committed to move into
Clark in the next five years, together bringing 18.9bn pesos (US$600m) of
investment. Among the top investors Clark has attracted are Japan's Yokohama,
one of the world's largest tyre manufacturers; Sampo Technology Corporation,
a leading Taiwanese electronics firm; and Mondragon Leisure and Resorts, a
local apparel distributor and resort developer.

Clark officials are trying to improve utilities and to fast-track
construction of tourist areas comprising hotels, sports complexes and a
27-hole golf course to lure investors.

The existing utilities at Clark include a telephony system for 5,000 lines
that is expandable to 50,000 lines, a road network of 3,000km, a power supply
of 50 MW, and a water supply of 5,000 gallons per minute. Two domestic
chartered flights ply routes from provinces in central and western
Philippines to the area almost daily.

A problem Clark - and to a limited extent Subic - is encountering when it
comes to attracting investors is a fear of further eruptions by Mt. Pinatubo.
Five years after the volcano wrought havoc on a region that used to be known
as the country's rice bowl, huge volcanic mud flows, driven by seasonal
rains, continue to periodically sever road links to Manila around Clark and
Subic.

When roads are totally cut-off as happened a year ago, detours lengthen a
three-hour drive from Manila to Subic to at least eight hours, a
transportation nightmare few investors would want to deal with. Although
government volcanologists predict that Pinatubo's fury is over and that its
small ash emissions are too weak to reach either Clark or Subic, many
investors remain apprehensive.

Such a problem gives an edge to economic zones near the business districts
of Manila, such as the one comprising a belt of provinces called Calabarzon
(for Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) south of the capital. Major
Japanese companies prefer Calabarzon's various industrial parks over Clark
and Subic.

Edgy businessmen concerned about the effects of Subic and Clark's success on
their profitability have also become a problem. Earlier this year, the
government scrapped a US$200 shopping privilege given to patrons of duty-free
shops in both Clark and Subic after local manufacturers complained that
imported products sold in the duty free shops cut their profits and deprived
the government of revenues.

INNOVATIONS: A vital link

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Lindapter International recently showed its full range of fixing systems at
the Offshore Southeast Asia show in Singapore.

Designed to offer significant reductions in installation time and costs, the
Lindapter range includes steelwork fixings, support fixings, steel cavity
fixings, floor fixings and rail fixings.

Lindapter steelwork fixings facilitate connection of structural steelwork
without the need for on-site drilling or welding. Common offshore
applications include suspension of lifting gear, fixing of drilling
equipment, pipe supports and guides, or connection of steelwork used in
accommodation modules.

Floor fixings, such as Floorfast and Gratefast for chequerplate and open
grate flooring are particularly suited to offshore applications. They can be
used without the need for hot work permits or specialist expertise, thus
saving contractors both time and money.

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

A new range of optional technical enhancements, offering increased
productivity, and, claims the manufacturer, superior control, greater
flexibility and easier operation has been added to the Astra series of
inverted, horizontal, form, fill and seal (HFFS) automatic packaging
machines, by Ilapak Ltd.

A key feature of the Astra is its random length, self-measuring facility
which allows continuous heat-seal flow wrapping of irregularly-shaped
products, whatever their length. This makes the product particularly suitable
for a wide range of non-food industries.

Unlike many other inverted machines which make fixed length packs, the
Astra's random length control option allows the machine to automatically
adjust film cut-off lengths from one item to the next, according to the exact
length of the product.

INNOVATIONS: Steel trials

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

British Steel have completed a series of piling trials and demonstrations
over a five day period in the Bangkok Basin area. Key specifiers and end
users were invited to witness first-hand the benefits of switching from the
standard 400mm wide sheetpiles in common use in Asia to British Steel's
stronger and wider LX product.

The trials took the form of a direct comparison between the 400mm and 600mm
sections during repeated driving/extraction cycles. All the sample piles were
measured for pile distortion including twisting, leg splaying, head/toe and
clutch damage.

According to British Steel, the results demonstrated that LX piles could be
driven faster than their narrower counterparts. With smaller capacity hammers
the extra weight and stiffness of the LX piles proved to be of advantage and
permitted accelerated driving times.

British Steel are producers of steel sheet piling with a comprehensive range
of sections and sizes.

INNOVATIONS: Adaptable treatment

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Manufacturers, municipal councils, mining companies and primary producers are
constantly seeking better ways to control the quality of wastewater or
recycled water as well as the possible reuse of purified water. This not only
relates to changing government regulations but also because in many instances
the efficient retrieval of valuable by-products from production is a very
important cost benefit factor. One way to achieve financial advantage is the
elimination of downtime in the removal of waste solids.

Syskill Australia Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based company with 14 years experience
in consulting and commissioning wastewater systems, has developed two system
packages which can be adapted to a range of industrial applications and can
provide any level of treatment (primary, secondary or tertiary). Selection
and development of the correct system for your particular process can ensure
cost efficiencies.

By cutting down on the solid waste volumes, including the thickening of
municipal and industrial sludges, the high cost of removal is greatly reduced
and therefore the transfer of solid waste into the sewerage system can be
eliminated.

INNOVATIONS: Drives and controls for Anshin Steel

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

When Malaysia's Anshin Steel Ltd needed a drives and controls system for
their hot-rolling bar and rod mill at Shah Alam they consulted the local
Control Techniques' Drive System Centre at Petaling Jaya. The company
manufactures a range of light rod and bar sections from purchased billet.

As a result the main mill motors have for the last three years reliably used
CT's "Mentor" drives which are rated at 1850A (DC)/600V. More than one
thousand of these have been installed in Thailand alone, so it was decided
to build Anshin's control panels in the Ladyao manufacturing Centre near
Bangkok.

Localised control boxes enable the operator to Run/Jog Reverse/Stop the
stands and lock off the power if the stands themselves need attention. The
mill cannot be started from the main pulpit, but cascaded speed control is
carried out from this position.

Menus for the varied products to be rolled are stored in a PC in the pulpit.
When a product is selected for rolling data concerning the dimensions of the
billet and the mean diameter of each roll is downloaded to a PLC. Control is
based on the principle of constant volume rolling and cascaded speed control
whereby the speed of each stand is related to the master finishing stand.
Calculations concerning motor speed for each drive are made continuously in
the PLC and sent to the second processor in the "Mentor" drives as 12-bit
parallel words. All stand speeds are simultaneously updated to avoid
tension/compression during changes of speed.

When the velocity of any section is adjusted the PLC calculated the new speed
of all upstream drives and updates them. Individual speed trims for the
drives are available to the operators from stations mounted near the mill
stands. The speed of the master stand is set using a preset potentiometer.
Anshin's two roughing mills use 1,000hp AC constant-speed motors. The related
conveyor systems use DC motors and "Mentor" controllers. These are controlled
by joysticks and have to accelerate rapidly to guarantee entry of bars into
the roughers. Other related DC drives run at the speed of the bar.

On exit the disc shear cuts the bar to preset lengths - multiples of the cut
length at the cold shear and accommodatable within the cooling bed. Speed and
positioning of the exiting bar is determined by measuring the time elapsed
between passing two detectors.

With this information the bar can be cut precisely. The disc shear is driven
by three DC drives, one for each blade and one to orientate the shear
mechanism. The run-in conveyor to the cooling bed is driven by 32 DC motors
connected in parallel across the controller.

Five 35hp DC motors located along the kick-off shaft drive this, being
controlled by the same number of four-quadrant "Mentors" which load-share.
If necessary the shaft can operate on only three drives. Braking is
regenerative, with the unit operating as a holding brake only.

The 80m cooling bed operates similarly, being driven by five 50hp motors
controlled by similar "Mentors" for accurate slowing and stopping.

Shuffle bars driven by 15hp motors, this time controlled by single-quadrant
"Mentors", carry the bars to the run-out conveyor. This uses three 30hp
drives which are operated manually from the cold shear desk. Three more
conveyor drives carry the cut bars to the packing line. This is driven by
four CT inverter drives and controlled by an Omron PLC. The packing line
itself was built in Malaysia.

In total there are 45 "Mentor" drives and six inverters controlling over one
hundred individual motors in this Malaysian finishing mill.

Control Techniques Asia Pacific have subsequently installed rod mill stands
at four steel plants in Thailand. The mill control system at Albion Steel,
the most recent, differs significantly from earlier projects. The
incorporated PC is much more powerful, enabling the whole mill to operate
using a SCADA Windows package. And the use of a beefier MD29 processor card
enables many tasks to be undertaken within the drive itself.

Current control strategy is to use the PC for product menus and on-line
monitoring, the processor card for closed-loop functions, and the PLC for
sequence control. This means a simpler and more user-friendly PLC can be
used.

Control Techniques' steel activities are not confined to hot rolling. The
company has supplied control panels and motors for slitting and roll forming
machines in both of the countries cited, and has installed cold rolling mills
in India, Indonesia and Thailand.

MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE: A flexible system

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Computer systems providing internal electronic communication facilities have
led to increased productivity and an evolution in working practices for a
major Japanese company.

Nippon Steel Corporation, the largest steel company in the world, is like any
other company constantly seeking ways to increase efficiency and cut costs.
At its biggest facility, the Kimitsu Works in Chiba Prefecture, output has
increased over the last 10 years while the total number of employees has
steadily declined. The size of the white-collar workforce, however, has
remained constant at around 1,400, indicating that management and
administrative processes have changed very little despite increases in
manufacturing efficiency.

Information technologies and process automation have played an integral role
in production processes at the Kimitsu Works since it opened in 1967. Today,
for instance, process control systems operate in blast furnaces and rolling
mills, while video systems record the performance of individual sites and
transmit images electronically to a production control centre. Office
systems, however, have lagged behind, with administrative processes changing
very little. Until recently, white-collar workers relied on inter-office
memos, telephones and fax machines for business communication and information
sharing.

In the early 1990s plant managers decided to boost white-collar productivity
and reduce labour costs by improving business communications and information
sharing within the organisation. They decided to invest in information
systems which would allow them to 're-engineer' essential business processes.
As a consequence, they expected to reduce the white-collar workforce by
around 400 once the systems were fully implemented. Key to their success was
choosing a workgroup computing system that could be easily adapted to both
the corporate culture and the network infrastructure.

In 1994 the company's Computer Systems Department conducted a six-month study
to define the requirements for a system that would best suit the Kimitsu
Works. It sought a flexible client-server system that would allow staff
located in many different parts of the plant to communicate and share
information electronically. It also sought a system that would build on the
company's existing technology and could be expanded incrementally as the need
arose. Key requirements included the ability to run on both MS-DOS and
Windows PCs, as well as compatibility with connections such as LANs, PBXs and
public switched telephone networks.

The department looked at a number of workgroup computing products available
in Japan, including Lotus Notes and MS Mail, before settling on TeamWARE
Office. Fujitsu Limited had adapted the base product to the Japanese market
and also provided the required dedicated support services.

Operation began in January 1995 with a single server configuration supporting
more than 1,000 users. The initial focus was on two essential aspects of
workgroup communications, e-mail and group information sharing, and for these
TeamWARE Mail and Forum software were installed. The total cost for the
server hardware, software and installation support was US$680,000.

Within a few weeks of installation, the system was being widely used by
staff. Users had little trouble learning how to operate the software, and
soon began to use both products in their everyday jobs. More than 1,000 users
at all levels of the corporation are logged onto the system.

People communicate and share information electronically, which has done away
with much of the need for telephone calls, fax messages and inter-office
letter mail. E-mail has spread to all areas of the plant, including the Cold
Mill and General Affairs Divisions, as well as the Production and Technical
Control Division.

E-mail has speeded up the flow of information through the organisation. Memos
and written requests that used to take two or three days to travel from one
department to another are now delivered within seconds. For example, senior
executives can have the minutes of executive meetings distributed throughout
the plant as soon as they are written, so that line managers receive almost
instant notification of important decisions. Moreover, executives and senior
managers can communicate decisions more effectively . They are beginning to
communicate directly with staff, which is leading to changes in the patterns
of office work and the delegation of responsibilities.

TeamWARE Forum promotes on-line discussions and information sharing, and
provides a collection point for opinions on any given topic. Users have
adapted quickly to the process of discussing issues on-line, posting topics
and responses in the same way they would e-mail. More than half the
individual forums are requests for new ideas; for example, a group might
discuss approaches to improving a production process in the rolling mill by
posting comments and replies. Then, when a manager needs to prepare
recommendations and conclusions, he simply reviews the comments made by
members of the group when writing his report. Similarly, when different
people need to contribute to a report, each person posts their sections in
the designated forum for the others to review.

Electronic communications have also had a democratising effect at the Kimitsu
Works. White-collar workers at many different levels of the organisation can
participate in on-line discussions and directly receive electronic
information from senior managers. This serves as an initial step towards
breaking down communications barriers. Younger workers in particular begin
to feel that they are more directly involved in the company's activities and
have a better idea about what they are expected to do. They can receive
direct copies of management memos and production reports, rather than having
the information selected and interpreted by their superiors.

The next stage for the Computer Systems Department is to extend groupware
capabilities by introducing TeamWARE Library and TeamWARE Flow, the system's
document management and workflow modules. Moving to an electronic archive
promises a number of benefits.

Workers will be able to find and share each others documents. They will be
able to search through large collections of documents in many different ways
- by titles, keywords or full-text words and phrases. They will also be able
to maintain a work history of specific projects, collating minutes, memoranda
and project reports, so that activities can be better co-ordinated. To
maintain security for sensitive documents, user access can be managed and a
record kept of each access to a document and any changes made.

TeamWARE Flow will enable the passing of information from one person to
another or from one group to another in a structured manner, reducing the
need to produce reports for general distribution. Initially, the department
plans to use the system for simple processes, such as exchanging requests
between departments internally, but once an electronic gateway to the
company's Tokyo head office is established, it expects to be able to
communicate with workgroups at the corporate level.

The TeamWARE electronic communications and information sharing systems have
proved a sound investment for Nippon Steel, allowing it to introduce
organisational changes at the Kimitsu Works and support new kinds of work
activities as users become accustomed to working with a networked on-line
electronic environment.

RUSSIA/CIS: Heavy engineering for Asian markets

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Two case studies reveal that Russian engineering is rebuilding fast. And the
number of trade fairs taking place throughout the CIS shows that this is a
source, and market, to be taken seriously.

Intriguing accounts of life in the new era for the heavy engineering
industries of the CIS have been appearing this year in the Moscow monthly
"Business in Russia"*. This is the sector that is supposed to be badly
affected by the continuing decline in industrial output. But some big
exporters are making good already.

First, worldscale truck maker Kamaz. Located in the autonomous republic of
Tatarstan on the steppes east of Nizhny Novgorod the ex-Soviet Union's
number-one truck plant entered production in 1978; a major fire subsequently
entailed major updating. Total output could be a massive 1.5m vehicles/year.
Kamaz trucks have a huge trading advantage in the new CIS - their spares and
service requirements are known everywhere. And they are designed for the
toughest road conditions imaginable,which is why non-CIS Asia is being
targetted as a key export sales zone now.

Kamaz was one of the first giant enterprises to be privatised, in 1990. Still
loss making, it receives no state support whatsoever. One of its biggest
problems is outstanding debt - to government agencies, amongst others. To
solve this it has set up a new mega-business partnership called
Kamaz-Sodruzhestvo Association with Gazprom,Russia's biggest company, LUKoil
and other major users, guaranteeing annual sales of 30,000 heavy vehicles and
involving substantial much-welcomed swapping of the debts that plague these
huge (mostly energy) businesses too. The two governments are associate
members, which means yet more "in house" sales.

So the domestic market looks very good. But to keep the massive multi-line
factory running more exports are vital - and if those are to take place
Kamaz's traditional reputation for go-anywhereability has got to be
supplemented with environmental-friendliness too. So last year the company
concluded agrrements with nearly 60 Japanese and European machine-builders
to supply the plant needed to build prime movers that meet the latest
environmental standards worldwide. These come on top of the earlier deal with
Cummins Engine Co (USA) to build a brand-new power unit.

Rockwell (USA) are supplying power trains; ZF (Germany) gearboxes; and DAF
(Netherlands) the technology to build new-style cab units. And the company's
close links with Gazprom, the world's largest supplier of natural gas, mean
it is now able to offer a dual-fuel (diesel/liquefied natural gas) power unit
which will be a trend-setter everywhere oil is becoming too costly to
extract. And in association with automobile manufacturer VAZ production of
over 100,000 passenger cars is planned too.

Kamaz's new Mustang fourwheel-drive truck series put up a good showing in the
Paris-Beijing Rally recently - this vehicle is aimed at defence ministry
purchasers worldwide. The new 43118 high-capacity 4WD truck was built to the
specifications of the Emergency Situations Ministry - and in Russia
"emergency" means just that. And the new 6520 dumper aimed at the energy
industries is designed to take on the best that the world's mining-truck
producers offer anywhere.

Nearly 20 joint ventures and representative trade offices now supply Kamaz
trucks and spares to 22 countries, including several in East Asia. As a
result export revenue nearly doubled year-on-year in 1995.

Financially the company has been reorganised with the aid of US investment
specialists KKR. Divestment took place and operations became more targetted
as a result; the leasing field has been entered to secure more sales at home.
Kamaz director Nikolay Bekh concluded his "Business in Russia" interview by
saying "I am convinced that our best days lie ahead".

Not converted to conversion

To the east in the Urals metallurgy region - one which has been experiencing
very lean times industrially - Uralvagonzavod (UVZ) presents another
engineering success story. But this company has not been privatised - it is
technically known as a state production association. It used to be the East
bloc's main producer of battle tanks. It still is, although the bloc as such
no longer exists. UVZ is a classic representitive of the "military-industrial
complex" for which Russian heavy engineering is famed, and used to be feared.
UVZ ought to be a classic case of "conversion" - swords into ploughshares,-
but isn't. Alongside its main function of building heavy weaponry it provided
the former Soviet Union with railcars (hence the name). But instead of
concentrating on these peaceful pursuits UVZ has kept its highly-skilled
design and production workforce together at Nizhny Tagil by continuing to
develop heavily armoured T-C series tanks - and selling them to governments
worldwide in competition with established US, European and Chinese suppliers.
It sells via the state armaments supplier Rosvooruzhenie. But it has
diversified into construction equipment with a military flavour - tracked and
wheeled excavators, bulldozers and front-end loaders. And it remains the
premier rail wagon builder in the CIS too.

As a state-owned business UVZ labours under a lot of difficulties which Kamaz
managers are delighted to be rid of. It is required to keep resources on
standby ready for transfer to complete military mobilisation at short notice.
It is plagued by debt. And it is required to participate in the operation of
a whole raft of state-provided services - local public transport and social
housing for example - which bleed its management and financial resources
heavily.

But UVZ is not standing still, and has rejected partial privatisation and
commercial diversification in the interests of doing what its workforce do
best at the three in-house design institutes.

These are two case-studies from the sharp end of heavy engineering in the CIS
- the very sharp end in the case of UVZ. They demonstrate that Russians are
refusing to de-skill their huge economy, to become a mere raw materials
supplier. Some of the world's top R&D institutions are located in the CIS;
the aim is to keep these highly skilled workforces intact; and this will be
achieved by recruiting managerial and financial cooperation from non-CIS,
including hopefully east Asian, sources.

RUSSIA/CIS: Buying and selling at trade fairs

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The organising of trade fairs is big business in the CIS. Distances are so
great and the concept of individual international marketing is so new that
attending a specialised exhibition is by far the best way for Eastern
businesses to make new contacts - whether buying or selling.

Moscow is still the centre of gravity with Mezhvystavka's EXPOCENTR in
Krasnopresnenskaya Nab, now firmly established as one of the world's top
trade fair complexes -you can fax them on +7 95 205 6055 for details of
1997's prolific programme. But independent rival centres are springing up
fast, and in terms of sheer numbers of specialised events, in order, the
following cities in the Russian Federation deserve serious consideration as
destinations: St Petersburg; Novosibirsk; Nizhny Novgorod; and Ekaterinburg.
Nizhny Novgorod deserves a special mention - 1996 is the 100th year of formal
operation of Nizhegorodskaya Jarmaka (fax 8312 443404), but the city has a
history of international trade exchange dating much further back than that.

A selection of 1997 events at EXPOCENTR is as follows:

20-24 January  - CONSUMEXPO - consumer goods
19-23 May      - SVIAZ-EXPOCOMM - telecommunications
16-20 June     - INLEGMASH - light industrial equipment, especially
                             textile/footwear machinery
1-5 July       - Byt i Moda - consumer goods
8-12 September - Stroyindustria Arkhitektura - building
20-24 October  - AGROPRODMASH - agricultural equipment

Readers interested in construction should also note the independent
organisation of MOSBUILD at the EXPOCENTR (12-15 March, fax +33 1 47 56 08
18 (Paris - this is an off-shoot of the long-established French BATIMAT
show).

And at the VVC Fairground in Moscow ITE (UK - fax +44 171 286 0177) will be
organising the first Russian International Machine Tool & Metalworking
Exhibition from 9-12 June.

Around the independent republics there is nothing like so much choice - for
Kazakhstan see the special Central Asia Digest at the front of this issue.
Moldova has its own international exhibition centre known as MOLDEXPO in
Chisinau (Kishinev; fax +373 2 62 74 20) with a diverse programme for 1997.
This includes EXPOCONS (consumer goods; 9-13 April); TEXTILES (wares and
equipment; 9-13 April); MOLDCONSTRUCT (11-16 June; construction equipment and
materials); Industry of Moldova (16-20 September; general local
manufacturing); and MOLDAGROTECH (15-20 October; agricultural and food
processing machinery).

In Ukraine there is a big consumer goods fair taking place in Kiev from 18-22
March (fax +49 30 844 0739), while Machine & Tool will be held from 29
September - 3 October (fax +49 40 460 4276). And Uzbekistan's International
Trade Fair will be held at the end of September in Tashkent (fax +49 221
695865). Interestingly, these last three non-Russian events are being
organised by German exhibition specialists who have spotted a good marketing
opportunity in the CIS. You could do so too.

SECURITY SYSTEMS: It pays to be prepared

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Condition monitoring can save money for manufacturers provided careful
forethought is given to projects.

Condition monitoring can prevent unexpected machine breakdowns and provide
early warnings of maintenance needs. It saves damage to plant, cuts wastage
of products due to line stoppages, helps keep production on target and is
acknowledged to save money and improve efficiency for manufacturers. An
approved system can also mean reduced machine insurance premiums.

However, it is not an area to be entered without careful forethought. Each
machine has its own monitoring needs, there are many techniques and types of
instrument, and a manufacturer has first to decide what is required from a
condition monitoring system. It is an area where many installations have not
paid for themselves.

The principle behind all checks on factory plant is to decide objectively
when machines should be taken out of service for maintenance. This saves
production being disrupted and enables maintenance and repairs to be planned
for quiet periods on the factory floor. It should lead to a more efficient
maintenance programme than one which relies on a fixed schedule.

Condition monitoring provides information which is not obvious from human
inspection. Information is collected from sensors on machines and the
analysis of readings taken over a period of time predicts when measurements
will exceed a safe level. This means a regular programme of inspection.

Each time measurements are taken the plant should be working under a similar
load to ensure an accurate comparison with previous data. This enables trends
to be predicted. It is not possible to assess the life left in a component
from a single measurement unless one has analysed data from similar
components. For a given reading one bearing could be close to failure while
another has a long life ahead. A key skill in condition monitoring lies in
calculating the future length of life of components from a trend of previous
readings.

This is where computer programmes are valuable. Software will predict trends
and display the results numerically or graphically. Data can be either fed
directly to the computer from the factory floor through a network, downloaded
at the machine to a portable or hand held computer and then transferred to
the main office machine or measured by hand held equipment and the readings
manually entered into the computer.

Measuring vibration

The most popular method of monitoring plant is to check the frequency and
amplitude of vibration of rotating parts using accelerometers and acoustic
or magnetic sensors. These transmit data to recording equipment which can be
fitted permanently to factory plant. The benefit of fitted instrumentation
is the warnings it can provide of unexpected events. Plant can be shut down
in an orderly sequence, rather than the operator having to hit the emergency
stop after hearing squealing, grinding or other expensive noises.

Recording equipment ranges from low cost meters, where the operator has to
enter readings on to record sheets, to microprocessor-controlled data
analysers which store many readings and display the results as a graph on a
screen or printout. Such equipment can automatically predict when readings
will move to unsafe levels and enable planned maintenance.

Vibration can be measured by laser-based equipment which measures shaft
movement without needing to touch the shaft. Machine condition can also be
reflected in a rise in temperature. A temperature sensor will measure spot
temperatures of bearings, seals and couplings, for example, but thermal
imaging shows exactly where heat is being generated as well as the
temperature.

Such thermographic surveys can pinpoint heat centres whereas engineers may
be mislead by heat being conducted along metal components. One such example
concerned an electric motor running hot. The abnormally high shaft
temperature indicated a worn motor bearing but a thermal imager showed a hot
spot in the motor's gearbox and heat being conducted along the shaft. Without
the thermal imager the motor would have been taken out of service for bearing
replacement and taken out again for gearbox inspection.

Advanced condition monitoring listens to plant and analyses a range of sounds
for frequency and amplitude. This can be displayed as a dynamic envelope, or
fingerprint, and is suitable for machinery with a complex series of
movements. This applies to special production machines with moving arms and
levers, for example, or electrical switchgear.

Condition monitoring also covers lubricating oil analysis, pressure and flow
of coolants, pressure and operation of hydraulic and pneumatic systems. A
drop in performance in any of these areas can lead to early machine failure.
A worn bearing or one about to collapse presents less resistance to flow of
lubricant so system pressure will drop as flow increases and accelerate
bearing failure. If plant is water or air cooled then failure of these
systems can cause overheating and thinning or degradation of lubricant.
Quality of insulation on high voltage equipment can be tested with partial
discharge techniques. Energy can be dissipated through insulation without
complete breakdown and where this results in a corona on insulators, the
radiation frequency and energy can be monitored. Condition monitoring of
insulating oil covers dielectric strength, colour, dissolved gas, and
moisture or detritus content.

Developing skills

For those who wish to develop condition monitoring skills, Schenck offers
training courses on dynamic balancing, vibration analysis and condition
monitoring. The company also offers a full range of equipment. The Series 40
consists of five portable instruments while the 1100 is a low cost
self-contained monitoring unit which attaches to a machine and provides alarm
and shut-down capabilities. The Vibrocam 4000 is PC controlled and can
monitor thousands of points. The trending and analysis software on this
system informs machine operators of potential failures.

SKF, which claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of bearings, has
used its production experience to develop a condition monitoring service.
This can supply equipment from pen-size hand-held instruments to
comprehensive machinery protection systems and analytical software. Its
latest instrument is the Microlog CMVA55, a portable data collector which it
claims has diagnostic capabilities never seen before in a portable
instrument. A liquid crystal screen displays readings in numerical and
graphical form.

At the other end of the scale, the company's M800A system can monitor
continuously a complete factory with data networked back to a central logging
and analysis facility. As part of its service the company has produced a 48
page booklet "How to Understand and Buy Condition Monitoring Equipment".
SKF's Asia Pacific office is in Singapore.

Bently Nevada has some 35 years experience in machine protection and offers
a comprehensive range of monitoring equipment, installation and training
service. It has nine offices throughout Asia.

For those who wish just to use condition monitoring techniques, vibration and
noise measurement specialist Bruel and Kjaer has developed a range of
equipment which can be operated by personnel unskilled in vibration detection
technology. For thermal imaging equipment, Land Infrared is a major
specialist and offers a wide range of temperature sensing equipment.

National Vulcan provides a condition monitoring service for audits and
feasibility studies and engineer surveyors for site visits. Bob Gray,
Technical Sales Manager, highlights the need to plan before installing
condition monitoring and points out the value of using a consultancy such as
National Vulcan to ensure that optimum results are obtained from a monitoring
system. The company is a leader in engineering insurance and says that the
installation of monitoring systems can reduce premiums.

Eagle Star also confirms that improved risk control reduces premiums. The
company is hoping to develop its machinery insurance services onto the Indian
sub continent and is already working in China. Its engineering division
offers technical support with inspections, training and consultancy as well
as machinery insurance.

Condition monitoring may be like insurance - you only wish you had invested
once it is too late. That can prove an expensive policy.

WATER QUALITY: Keep it clean

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The supply of fresh drinking water is a perennial problem, but a crop of
development projects across Asia promises to bring improved facilities to
large numbers of people.

In Hong Kong, for instance, the Ma On Shan water treatment works, due to come
on stream later this year, is designed to provide 227,000 cu m per day of
potable water to meet the ever growing demands of new and proposed
residential developments in Ma On Shan and Shatin.

Designed by US consultant Camp Dresser McKee (CDM) International, in
association with UK engineers Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick & Partners, this
state-of-the-art works consists of triple-tray sedimentation tanks,
flocculators and deep bed filters containing anthracite and sand to remove
DOCs (organic chemicals), and filter presses for dewatering sludge from the
filtration process.

Equipment suppliers include Atlas Copco (air compressors), Bailey Fischer &
Porter Corp, SCADA, UPS and fibre optics, British Transformers Ltd, Edwards
& Jones (filter presses), Hawker Siddeley Switchgear, Rotork Ltd (actuators),
SMC Pneumatics HK Ltd and Weir Pumps.

China, which will inherit Hong Kong's modern water treatment facilities next
year, is also investing heavily in improvements to the nation's facilities
with the aim of bringing them up to international standards.

Degremont UK Ltd is particularly active in China where it has been supplying
equipment since 1975; it also has permanent representation in Beijing and
Guangzhou. Since 1987 the company has entered into contracts to provide water
treatment plants for more than 50 municipalities. Equipment supplied includes
filtration plants, chemical dosing units, chlorinators, flocculators, pumps
and automatic control systems.

Also in China, Dewplan Ltd has recently been awarded a US$3m contract for the
design, supply and commissioning of a multiprocess water treatment works to
serve the new San Miguel Brewery. The plant is designed to treat borehole
water for the removal or iron and suspended material. It will also
incorporate pre-chlorination, de-alkanization and final polishing through GAC
(Granular Activated Carbon) filters.

The Japanese government has offered China a US$435m line of credit over the
next three years for water supply improvements in Liaoning and Gansu
provinces, Guang Xi and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

The UK's Overseas Development Administration (ODA) recently appointed Mott
Macdonald as lead consultant for the Shanghai Water Master Plan (SWAMP),
aimed at assisting the Shanghai Municipal Water Company (SMWC) to respond
more effectively to the rapidly changing demand patterns of its 3,900km long
distribution system.

In the Philippines, a private consortium comprising Kamaman and the Clark
Development Corporation has been commissioned to construct a US$50m water
supply system to serve the Clark Special Economic Zone, formerly a US air
base, in Central Luzon. The first phase comprises repairs to existing
reservoirs, the installation of eight chlorinators, the acquisition of
maintenance and other equipment, and the rehabilitation of five wells and
pumping stations together with 160,000m of distribution pipelines.

Meanwhile, 2m people living in the 20 poorest provinces of the Philippines
are to benefit from an Asian Development Bank US$37m loan to provide simple
low-cost water supply facilities to around 3,000 rural communities under the
government's Social Reform Agenda. Scheduled for completion by August 2001,
the project is designed to reduce waterborne diseases resulting from
contaminated open wells, streams and rivers.

In the same region, The US Filter Corporation recently acquired KBS Pure
Water Pte Ltd based in Singapore and Penang. KBS is a major supplier of water
treatment plant, including deionization equipment for the microelectronics
industry, and has established a 3,000 cu.m facility in Singapore.

Weir Pumps, in addition to supplying pumps to Hong Kong, has won a contract
to equip five stations belonging to the Metropolitan Water Authority in
Bangkok. The units, comprising single-stage, split casing pumps driven by
1200kW motors, are to be installed at Bang Khen, Klong Toey, Lat Phro,
Phahonothin and Samrong.

India, which suffers some of Asia's worst drinking water problems, is shortly
to benefit from a change of tack by the World Bank with the provision of the
country's first Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) schemes. New projects
include a US$70m rural water supply system for Uttar Pradesh, India's largest
state. in which the Bank is keen to involve NGO's, community organisations
and private sector companies.

The World Bank is also the catalyst for a private project designed to supply
Anhdra Pradesh, a southern suburb of Hyderabad, with 1,850ml/day of clean
water.

EXPRESS DELIVERY: UPS moves into Taiwan

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

In March 1996, after long delays, the government of Taiwan finally
granted international air express cargo company UPS (United Parcel
Service) the right to operate an integrated cargo facility at
Taipei's Chiang Kai-Shek (CKS) International Airport. If all goes
well, the move could spur the transformation of Taiwan into a
regional air cargo hub, as outlined under the government's
Asia-Pacific Regional Operations Centre (APROC) Plan.

The air express delivery market has expanded rapidly in recent
years. UPS boasts the largest turnover in the global industry, and
in 1995 realised a 35 per cent growth from the previous year in
overseas shipments from Taiwan. Another key player, DHL, the first
foreign air express company in Taiwan and the local market leader,
enjoyed growth of 27.6 per cent in the same period.

International express carriers are now posing a formidable
challenge to Taiwan's domestic air cargo companies, which are
handicapped by financial limitations and less well developed
operations. Antonio An, general manager of local express carrier
Lita International Express Co, claims that his firm's deliveries
from Taipei to Singapore have dwindled from 500kg to 100kg daily
since foreign carriers entered the market. "The route may not last
out next year," he says.

The war between domestic and foreign express air cargo companies
involves more than competition between carriers. Also caught up in
the fray is a network of air transport service firms, forwarding
agents, customs brokers and inland transportation and warehousing
companies. The question that many in the industry are now asking
is: will Taiwan emerge from this battle with a stronger logistical
base and sharper competitiveness in the industry? Or, in its haste
to achieve its APROC goals, will the government end up giving away
Taiwan's entire air cargo market to foreign companies?

Air express cargo companies were born in response to the commercial
need for fast delivery of original documents essential to the
operation of a wide range of industries, particularly finance and
shipping. Taiwan's document delivery business, however, is near
saturation point and does not hold sufficient profit potential to
satisfy international express carriers, especially latecomers to
the local market such as UPS and FedEx. To tap greater profits,
foreign firms have opened a new service offering express delivery
of consignments weighing over 45kg, which previously were shipped
as ordinary air freight.

Growing enthusiasm for this new service is attributable to a
combination of Taiwan's manufacturing orientation, its geographic
location and the time factor. Taiwan is far more attractive as an
air express cargo hub than many of its Asia-Pacific neighbours.
According to Adam Tsui, marketing manager for UPS in Taiwan, the
economies of both Hong Kong and Singapore are dominated by service
sector industries, meaning that urgent deliveries are mainly in the
form of paperwork, whereas Taiwan's economy is supported primarily
by export-oriented manufacturing industries, particularly in the
high-tech sector. Although South Korea has a strong manufacturing
base, it is largely in heavy industries and this, combined with the
country's geographical location, detracts from its potential as an
air cargo hub. Many of Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) are dynamic, high-tech goods manufacturers and these,
according to Tsui, form the client group with the greatest
possibilities.

Taiwan's largest computer manufacturer, Acer Sertek Inc., for
example, has a manufacturing facility at Subic Bay in the
Philippines that produces 150,000 computer motherboards per month.
If the components for making these motherboards were flown in from
Taiwan via the usual routes, they would have to go first to Manila.
Subic Bay is only about 100 miles from Manila, but delivery of
goods is often seriously delayed when heavy downpours turn poorly
paved roads into impassable rivers of mud. Acer now relies on FedEx
for chartered air cargo services direct to Subic Bay. The company's
deputy general manager Gen Chang lauds the efficiency of air
express services, but admits that costs are 30-50 per cent higher
than for delivery by ordinary air-freight.

The growth of industries for which time is money means a bonanza
for international express carriers. But the capital- and
technology-intensive requirements for the establishment of an air
express operation, combined with the demand for logistical
efficiency in integrated express delivery services, have
discouraged many businesses from trying to get a share of the
express delivery pie.

Currently only four international carriers - UPS, FedEx, DHL and
TNT - offer integrated air cargo services, in contrast to the
cheaper but less time-efficient services available from local
companies, which usually consolidate small consignments before
shipping. The big international players provide door-to-door
services that include pick-up and delivery to the airport, air
transport, customs clearance and freight forwarding facilities that
range from inland transportation to warehousing. This allows them
to control costs, guarantee delivery time and exploit economies of
scale, thus making them far more competitive than airline companies
and forwarding agents. Such considerations clearly explain the
differentials in shipping rates.

CH Lee, chairman of the Airfreight Forwarders' Association (AFA),
admits that the integrated, streamlined operations of international
air express companies have put them on an entirely different
footing from the rest of the air cargo industry. Forwarding agents,
customs brokers and airline companies have all been hit by the
growing popularity of specialised air express delivery companies.
Inland transportation and warehousing services are expected to
suffer as well.

The government's moves to develop Taiwan into a regional operations
centre may benefit international air express companies, but they
have sent a chill down the spine of the local industry. Since a
highly efficient air cargo system is essential to a regional
operations hub, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has in
short time decided to establish both an air express cargo zone, or
Express Handling Unit (EHU) and an integrated air cargo zone, both
at CKS airport. The emphasis at the moment is on transhipment,
which accounts for 75 per cent of cargo handled, while
import-export accounts for only 25 per cent.

The establishment of the EHU is a positive step towards replacing
the nine-to-five customs operation with a round-the-clock service
allowing goods to receive customs clearance regardless of how late
they arrive. However, even though customs processing in the zone
requires only one quarter of the time previously needed, few
clients have shown interest in this special facility. Contrary to
initial estimates that 1000 cases would be handled per day, only
900 were handled in the facility's first month of operation.
International air express companies have complained of its high
fees, stringent restrictions and the total of 32 approval seals
that still need to be collected for each shipment, despite
allegedly simplified import and export procedures.
Publications and home appliances cannot pass through the facility,
as they have to be inspected by the Government Information Office
(GIO) and Quarantine respectively. As one air cargo terminal
officer puts it, these unreasonable regulations cause "express
delivery" to become "slow delivery".

There are other serious limitations. Says Terence Chuang, general
manager of DHL's Taiwan office: "The problem with the new facility
is that it's only allowed to handle - at least for now - shipments
under 45kg, and with a value below US$740. Shipments that meet
those criteria constitute only five per cent of the total air cargo
market."

In addition to criticisms from international express carriers,
local airfreight forwarders and customs brokers complain that
anyone interested in operating in the EHU must have an electronic
data exchange (EDI) system, which allows shipping documents to be
computerised and thus processed more quickly and efficiently. This
requirement, they say, was instituted without seeking input from
local firms who are unlikely to possess such technology, and
seemingly with only the interests of international companies in
mind.

The second facility, for integrated air cargo operations, is
expected to set the ball rolling for Taiwan's transformation into
a regional operations hub. But among local air cargo companies, it
is regarded as yet another unfair privilege for foreign companies.
Operating rights in this zone give UPS an exclusive service area at
CKS airport, where it will have its own ground crew and warehouses.
Combined with its air transport, forwarding and customs clearance
services, and possibly inland transportation service in the future,
the arrangement gives UPS an advantage over local, as well as other
international, air express cargo companies. "There are plenty of
local companies that understand this business, and understand it
well," says CH Lee of AFA. "We have no problem with competition,
but it has to be fair competition. Foreign operators should not be
offered privileges that give them an unfair competitive advantage."

DHL's Terence Chuang agrees that local companies are being put at
a disadvantage by their exclusion from the integrated cargo
handling zone, and predicts a rough ride ahead. "We need to
recognise that there are too many airfreight forwarders here," he
says. "There are something like 500 in Taipei alone. In the face of
competition from integrated foreign express carriers, the larger
local companies will probably survive, and some may have to merge
their operations. But there's going to be a big shakeout in the
industry, and a lot of small forwarders are going to have to close
down. Local companies that want to survive will have to integrate
their operations, and establish co-operative agreements with other
integrated forwarders in cities around the world and with
commercial airlines."

The government has taken these steps with the broader aim of
sharpening the competitive edge of local industry. Moreover, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development and the Ministry of
Transport and Communications expect the initiative to have a
catalytic effect on the transformation of Taiwan into an air cargo
transhipment centre, while at the same time strengthening the
logistical base for the manufacturing and financial centres called
for under the APROC plan. Adam Tsui of UPS insists that the
regional distribution experience of international express
companies, following the establishment of the transhipment centre,
will spur the development of Taiwan as an exporter of value-added,
semi-finished products assembled on the island.

Not all agree, however. "It's a good idea, but they're going about
it in the wrong way," says CH Lee of AFA. What needs to be changed
for Taiwan to become a regional operations centre is the whole
environment for the air cargo industry, particularly in terms of
upgrading services at its international airports, rather than
through negotiations with selected parties and creating an
environment based on "special privileges" for international
companies. "This is good for neither consumers nor manufacturers,"
says Lee.

Critics view the government's haste to establish an integrated air
cargo zone as a reflection of its desire to quickly put a good face
on its APROC plan, about which most people are not particularly
optimistic. Tsai Ching-yen, director-general of the CAA, however,
insists that as the agency responsible for implementing the
government's policy, there was little the CAA could do to reduce
its impact on the local industry. He maintains that the present
arrangements are only temporary, and that other companies will be
welcome once an additional terminal has been built at CKS airport.

Both academics and industrialists insist that a complete
transformation of the air traffic industry is more important than
making special arrangements for Taiwan to become a regional air
transport centre. Anthony Han, a professor at National Chiao Tung
University's Department of Transport Engineering and Management,
comments in a recent study that the air transport operations
environment, customs clearance and air cargo terminals operations
all need improvement, and that pertinent laws and regulations must
be revised to meet the industry's changing needs. As one example of
what can be achieved, he cites Singapore's Changi International
Airport, which already offers 24-hour customs clearance for all
goods, not just express cargo.

The liberalisation and integration of Taiwan's air cargo operations
has seen international express companies get off to a good start,
while local companies claim they have been left behind. Terence
Chuang of DHL, however, feels it is not too late for them to catch
up. "Until CKS airport becomes an import-export hub, it's not going
to be of any real value. Right now, it's an image thing. At the
same time, I think the present emphasis on transhipment will
actually give local companies some breathing room and allow them to
upgrade their operations to be able to compete with international
firms when Taiwan becomes an import-export hub."

Asiaweek Continuing Special Report on Asian Languages 13/09/96

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Khalid ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Saud (1913-1982) former monarch of
Saudi Arabia and son of Ibn Saud, the founder of the kingdom.
A well-liked moderate, Khalid rose to the throne in 1975 after
the assassination of his half brother Faisal and continued
with the latter's economic and social reforms. Upon his death,
Khalid was succeeded by a half brother, the currently reigning
King Fahd. TRIVIA: Khalid was the first foreign head of state
to pay a visit to France's Elysee Palace after Francois
Mitterrand came to power.

Khalistan literally "Land of the Pure" in PUNJABI. Name for
the (as yet unfulfilled) independent Sikh state demanded by
militant adherents of the religion. In its purest sense, such
an entity would include not only the Indian state of Punjab,
but also the adjacent territories that once belonged to the
realm of the great Sikh leader Ranjit Singh (1780-1839).

Khalkha the dominant Mongol group, making up more than three-
quarters of Mongolia's population. The word also refers to the
language, which is spoken by 1.8 million people in Mongolia
and is the country's official tongue, and the territory
controlled by the Khalkha people in the past (once also known
as Outer Mongolia). Khalkha submitted to Chinese rule in the
late 17th century, but declared independence when the Qing
dynasty collapsed in 1912. It became the Mongolian People's
Republic in 1924. (The "people's republic" was dropped from
the name in 1992.)

Khalsa (FIG.1) from PERSIAN khales, meaning "pure." Religious,
military and social brotherhood established by the last Sikh
guru, Gobind Singh, in 1699. Now the dominant order of
Sikhism. Upon reaching puberty, most Sikh children are
initiated into the Khalsa. After the ceremony (amritsanskar),
they assume the surname "Singh" (Lion) or "Kaur" (Lioness).
Khalsa members (called amritdhari) are required to distinguish
themselves by bearing the Five K's: kesh (uncut hair -
representing spirituality), kangha (comb - spiritual order and
discipline), kara (steel bracelet - unity with God and
allegiance to the Khalsa), kirpan (sword - courage, dignity
and self-sacrifice) and kachha (short trousers - moral
restraint). They must also adhere to a strict code of conduct;
one is prohibited from consuming intoxicants (especially
tobacco), engaging in adultery and dyeing or plucking out
white hair. Sikhs not belonging to the Khalsa are called the
sahajdhari ("slow adopters").

khalwat MALAY in Islam, the offense committed when a man and a
woman, who are not married to each other, are in close
proximity to each other in a secluded area. If you take your
girlfriend into your house in the evening, a nosy neighbor may
well assume you are up to hanky-panky and notify the religious
authorities. (Every once in a while, there is a highly
publicized case where a well-known politician, a prominent
businessman or a film star gets caught in such a situation.)
Being a popular destination for lovers, Kuala Lumpur's scenic
Lake Gardens are a particularly fruitful area for religious
officers after dark. Errant couples looking for a quiet spot
may well find themselves being pounced on by the eagle-eyed
enforcers and ordered to appear in court, where a fine or a
promise to get married is extracted from them. Non-Muslims are
exempt from charges of khalwat.

Khamenei, Ayatollah Seyed Ali (FIG.2) (b. 1940) Iran's
spiritual leader. Once a student under Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, Khamenei was imprisoned six times and exiled during
the rule of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. After the 1979 Islamic
Revolution, he served as Iran's president from 1981 to 1989
and succeeded Khomeini as the supreme religious leader when
the latter died in 1989. He is something of a scholar-figure
who did not shrink from lecturing on Islamic theology when
addressing the United Nations in 1987 (he also did not refrain
from fulminating against the U.S., causing the American
delegates to walk out). He does not have the use of his right
hand - the result of an 1981 assassination attempt in which a
tape recorder with a bomb hidden inside was placed on the
lectern while he was giving a sermon.

khamsin hot, dry and dusty southerly wind that occurs in North
Africa and the Arabian peninsula. Reaches temperatures of up
to 40 C. The name is derived from an ARABIC word meaning
"fifty" (referring to the approximate number of days the wind
lasts each year).

Khamtay Siphandone (b. 1924) prime minister of Laos. A
postman-turned-revolutionary, Khamtay served as the military
commander of the Pathet Lao movement and was appointed deputy
prime minister and defense minister when the Lao People's
Democratic Republic was established in 1975. Succeeded Kaysone
Phomvihane as PM in 1991 and, upon the latter's death in 1992,
as head of the ruling Lao People's Revolutionary Party.

Khan, Imran (FIG.3) (b. 1952) Pakistani cricket great of
Pathan stock. Making his not-so-auspicious Test debut in 1971
against England, Khan shook off his jittery beginnings to
achieve a reputation as one of the best all-rounders (i.e.,
proficient in both bowling and batting) in the history of the
sport. He captained the Pakistani team from 1982 to 1992 (with
two brief breaks due to injury and a short-lived retirement)
and crowned his illustrious career by leading his country to
its first World Cup title in 1992. As durable as his
reputation on the field was his image as a playboy: the one-
time most eligible bachelor was long known for his string of
high-society girlfriends. He ended up marrying Jemima
Goldsmith, a wealthy British financier's daughter half his
age, raising more than a few eyebrows - and probably breaking
more than a few hearts - in the process. Now retired, he is
presently lavishing his attention on his Shaukat Khanum Cancer
Hospital - named after his mother, who died of cancer in 1985
- and harboring political ambitions (he recently launched
Tehreek-e-Insaf, or Movement for Justice).

Khan, Jahangir (b. 1963) Pakistani squash great of Pathan
stock. Coming from a family of squash champions (father
Roshan, uncles Hashim and Azam, and cousin Mohibullah
dominated the sport in the 1950s and '60s), Khan burst into
the international squash scene in 1979 by becoming the first
unseeded - and, at 15, the youngest - player to win the World
Amateur Championship. In 1981, he embarked on a remarkable
five-year unbeaten streak of more than 500 games; when the run
came to an end, he was still only 22. Towards the end of the
1980s, Khan seemed less invincible but nevertheless won his
sixth World Open title in 1988 and the British Open for an
unprecedented 10th consecutive time in 1991, silencing those
who had dismissed him as over the hill.

Khan, Jansher (b. 1969) another Pakistani squash great of
Pathan stock (no relation to Jahangir). Currently ranked No.1
in the world, Jansher first came to the world's attention when
he beat Jahangir in 1987 (he went on to defeat his older
compatriot in their next 10 encounters). The kind of respect
and adulation showered on Jahangir, however, has been slower
in coming to Jansher, partly because of his somewhat abrasive
personality.

BUSINESS: Stocks To Watch: It"s the Economy, Stupid: Buying bank stocks?
Look at the big picture first 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Assif Shameen

Anyone bottom fishing for cheap stocks in Asia these days is
likely to dredge up a number of big-name bank stocks. Be
selective. "It's not a good time to be in Asian bank stocks,"
warns Robert Zielinski, regional bank analyst at Jardine
Fleming in Singapore. "Banking really is 95% macro-economics."
Powerhouses from Singapore to South Korea are starting to slow
down partly because of a slump in electronics demand but also
because it is simply time for a breather after years of heady
growth. "Banks generally are very sensitive to levels of
economic activity," says Simon Smithson, a regional bank
analyst for Kleinwort Benson Securities. "There is a prima
facie case for more circumspection in investing in banks."

But there are bright spots. Zielinski is enthusiastic about
the Philippines, which surprised analysts last week by
announcing better-than-expected first-half GNP growth of 7%.
"Wow!" he says. "It's a fantastic economic recovery and growth
story. Most bank stocks there are up more than 50% this year."
The Manila stock market may be nearly a year away from its
peak, he says, because "the Philippine economic cycle is about
two years behind Malaysia and about three years behind
Thailand." Raymond Lee, an analyst for Lehman Brothers, is
bullish on Hong Kong: "The economy is picking up not only
there but also in China. People talk about U.S. interest rates
rising but you have to realize that the Hong Kong economy is
now much more closely linked with China, where interest rates
are heading downward."

So which counters look good? John Hobson, a bank analyst at
Morgan Stanley Asia, says his house has a buy on eight bank
stocks worldwide but only one of them is in Asia - that's HSBC
Holdings, which controls Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank. The
counter is a favorite with many industry watchers. "HSBC has
great regional exposure," says Lehman's Lee. "They've targeted
the growing affluent class in Asia, and as a leading bank
group in Hong Kong, they are a key beneficiary of economic
recovery in the territory and China." Smithson likes the fact
that HSBC derives nearly two-thirds of its profits from Asia.
"That proportion will go up rather than down," says the
Kleinwort analyst. "Even as it expands in Europe and the U.S.,
HSBC will remain an Asia-centered bank. It is one bank that is
well-equipped to deal with the changing nature of Asia's
banking marketplace."

Zielinski is not so sure. "HSBC has such a huge exposure in
Britain and the U.S. that bad news there can more than offset
the good news in Asia," he argues. And HSBC and subsidiary
Hang Seng have had a great run this year. "All the good news
for HSBC as well as Hang Seng and some of the other banks in
Hong Kong is already in the price," says Bonnie Lai, a bank
analyst at brokerage Yamaichi International. She favors
laggards like the International Bank of Asia: "It's a small
bank that has underperformed the market and therefore is
likely to fare better in the next few months." But Zielinski
cautions: "There are lots of imponderables in Hong Kong beyond
the July 1, 1997 handover to China. There could be a whole lot
of Chinese banks doing all sorts of things."

If he were to purchase just one Asian bank stock, says the
analyst, "I would buy Philippine National Bank." True, PNB has
disappointed analysts in the past three years with its slower-
than-anticipated recovery, but Zielinski says this time
around, the former government-controlled bank is really going
to surprise people. PNB valuations are just half those of
other comparable lenders in the Philippines. "PNB may have had
lower returns on assets and returns on equity in the past few
years, but you've got to realize this is a turnaround story,"
says Zielinski. "It will have higher earnings growth than most
other banks over the next three years. There's little downside
and lots of upside." Smithson likes Metrobank, which is bigger
than PNB. Lee says he also wants to be in the Philippines, but
worries about high valuations: "You can't pay the moon for
even the best stock."

Zielinski is bullish on big Indonesian banks BDNI, Bank
Internasional Indonesia and Bank Danamon because they are
cheap. "Indonesia, like the Philippines, is an underbanked
market," he says. "This means banks have plenty of room to
grow." One problem: interest rates. "At 20% per annum, they're
higher than what an investor can earn from bank stocks," says
Zielinski. "So over the long term, if you believe rates won't
move too much either way, you must see if the stock you are
looking at can somehow get a return of more than 20%." Lee has
other worries. "In Indonesia, the macro economic picture isn't
that bad, but you have political instability," he says. "And
the central bank is trying to control credit growth and may
increase the required capital adequacy ratio."

What about the slowing economies? Zielinski finds good value
in Korean bank stocks, especially Shinhan Bank, Commercial
Bank of Korea, Korea Long-Term Credit Bank and Kookmin Bank.
"The Korean banking sector is probably the only one in Asia
where stock prices could double or triple in two to three
years," he says. "Now is the time to be accumulating bank
shares. Many are selling at 7 to 8 times this year's earnings.
An average bank in Asia sells over two times its book value.
Korean banks are selling at 70% of book value or a third of
the Asian average." But Morgan Stanley's Hobson has a caveat:
"Unless you believe the Seoul bourse is going to rise
substantially, you should stay away from most Korean banks."
He says banks in Korea are required to make provisions against
only 50% of their stock market losses.

Lee and Smithson like Malayan Banking in Malaysia, though they
concede the stock is expensive. "If you have to pick a bank
stock there, you might as well choose Maybank," says Lee.
Smithson says Maybank is better positioned than any other
lender in Malaysia, where "concerns about overheating are
receding and there is a degree of optimism about the medium-
term macro-economic fundamentals." Zielinski has a different
take. "Malaysian bank stocks are among the most expensive in
the world and the banks are still lending like crazy to
property developers, so they can't be a bargain in the long
run," he argues. What about Singapore? Banks there, says
Zielinski, "are very exposed to the overheated property market
at a time when the government is trying to cool things."
Lenders like Overseas Union Bank do have a reputation for good
management. "But with earnings growing so slowly, I'd give
them a miss," says Smithson.

The outlook in other countries does not look much better.
Economic worries in Thailand may continue to be a drag on bank
stocks, including heavyweights like Bangkok Bank. "Slower
growth will impact on loan growth, interest margins and
possibly bad debts, and thus hurt profitability," says Lee.
"People wonder when might be a good time to start fishing in
Thailand now that the water level is so low. I believe a
further fall will make banks very attractive. But right now,
Thai banks are a high-risk punt." Hobson is worried about a
surge in the level of non-performing loans. Zielinski says
bank credit outstanding as a percentage of GDP in Thailand, as
in Malaysia, is higher than anywhere else in the world. "The
ratio of credit to the size of the economy is about 140% to
150% and that's incredibly high. When Japan was at this level
of development, its ratio of credit to GDP was 70%."

Investors should also realize that things have changed. "In
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, it's no longer
possible to look at banks as a growth industry," says
Smithson. "The days of 30% to 40% loan growth are gone." You
may get that in India with lenders like the State Bank of
India or in the Philippines. "In the more developed markets,"
says Smithson, "banks have become a mature business." The
industry has also become more competitive, "but not all the
banks will be equally well-placed to prosper in the new
environment." Still, banks will always remain part of any
large regional portfolio. Says Hobson: "If there is no
deterioration in asset quality, you can get a better return
from a bank compared with an industrial company or one that
sells consumer goods." Just be careful about fundamentals,
price and timing.

BUSINESS: Money & Investing: Banqueting With the Bears: As prices decline,
savvy punters get hungrier 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The apparent economic slowdown in Asia this year has cooled
investor enthusiasm for stocks. But as markets fall, Hugh
Young, 38, managing director of Abtrust Fund Managers
(Singapore) Ltd., says he is becoming more bullish. The trick,
as usual, is to know where to tread. The Exeter University
graduate, who since 1985 has managed Britain's top-performing
Asian unit trust, Abtrust Pacific, spoke with Asiaweek's
Steven K.C. Poh. Excerpts:

Has the Asian growth story changed?

Overall, the longterm economic outlook for Asia is as
promising as ever. With the exception of Japan, which is
undergoing a structural, not cyclical, change and is having to
open its doors to the outside world, the forecasts for GDP
growth over the next 3 to 5 years in Asia are a comfortable
6%-7% per annum.

So, should we worry about the apparent slowdown?

That depends. I regard the slowdown we're seeing in Singapore,
and indeed throughout the region, as fundamentally healthy.
But it's also going to be painful for certain industries,
specific companies and unwary investors. Singapore is a good
example. The boom in the global electronics industry over the
past few years has had a dramatic effect, boosting economic
growth above virtually all forecasts. It surprised me that
first-quarter 1996 growth was so strong at 10.9%. Yet now
everyone is sunk in deep gloom over second-quarter growth of
7.0%. I find it hard to understand this reaction to a cyclical
event, which should have been expected. Cycles are part of
life, and so is development. Development or economic success
brings its problems and I think that is what we are seeing in
Asia today. All the region's economies are starting from a
higher base each year, so sustaining high growth levels is
ever harder. Labor, property and associated costs are all
rising; that puts pressure on margins, and eventually squeezes
certain businesses out.

What are the implications for earnings?

Corporate earnings are coming in much as we expected, but we
have had forecasts well below the consensus. Overall for our
Asian portfolios, we are seeing earnings-per-share growth
slowing to around 12% in 1996. This is a function of
increasing costs and increasing competition. With tariff
barriers coming down across the region, businesses are moving
across borders ever more rapidly. Any inefficient producers
who have traditionally been protected by tariffs will go out
of business and those who survive will have to be forward-
thinking and agile.

It sounds as if you are bearish on Asia.

No, oddly enough I'm getting more bullish as markets slip. I
think the key is knowing what you're doing. It's no longer
sufficient to close your eyes and invest in Asia, relying on
economic growth to carry you through. I think markets will
punish most concept stocks or those that have relied on
financial engineering and aggressive leverage. Conversely, the
rewards will go to stocks that invest in professionally
managed, well-financed companies - providing one is careful
about not overpaying for those earnings. For those investors
who are prepared to do the hard work there's some great value
to be had.

Is there value in sectors?

Obviously there are sectors that we naturally favor. Anything
benefiting from the growing wealth of the consumer should do
well, so we favor areas such as retail, insurance and media.
Similarly with strong economic growth, we like banks and
financial institutions. Also the infrastructure story will
remain a core investment theme in Asia for many years to come.
But at the end of the day, you have to be terribly stock
specific and focus on management because you are going to need
some skilled and visionary people to cope with all the
pressures of success that Asia is facing.

What stocks do you favor?

Among the large-capitalization issues, it is hard to do better
than some of the region's banks. Well-managed and standing on
reasonable ratings, we would buy HSBC, even after its strong
performance, and the Thai banks, such as Bangkok Bank, Siam
Commercial Bank and Thai Farmers Bank (but taking care to
access these either via the local board, if legally
permissible, or via convertible bonds). In Singapore there is
fabulous value to be discovered, but again only if one has the
ability to access the local board. The local board stocks that
look very cheap are again the banks - DBS, OCBC, OUB and UOB.
Singapore Airlines, which can be bought at asset value, and
Singapore Press Holdings are also bargains. Elsewhere among
the region's larger capitalized stocks, we are comfortable
with companies such as Indostat in Indonesia and Philippine
Long Distance Telephone and with some property companies that
are beginning to appear to be good value, such as Sime-UEP in
Malaysia and Sammakorn in Thailand.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: RATING YOUR BANK 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Every year Asiaweek ranks the region's 500 biggest commercial
banks according to assets. We also tell you how they compare
with each other in deposits, loans, net profit and
shareholders' equity. We calculate profit as a percentage of
assets and of equity (the higher the number, the more
efficiently the bank makes money), and equity as a percentage
of assets (the higher the number, the more capital the bank
can tap to deal with financial strains and emergencies). Loans
as a percentage of deposits, meanwhile, says how much a bank
is able to make use of relatively cheap deposit funds in
making lucrative loans.

In the following tables, we classify the banks by country and
indicate their moneymaking abilities, that is, their profit-
to-assets and profit-to-equity ratios, which are important in
picking what bank stocks to buy. For the first time, we also
include a table showing net interest income (NII). This tells
you how much money a bank made from its core business of
making loans plus its earnings from other assets, such as
interbank deposits, bonds, stocks and securities. Compare NII
with total net profit, and you will get an idea of how
diversified a bank is - or how dependent it is on interest
income.

Another tool: a ranking of top banks according to capital
adequacy ratio. You arrive at a lender's CAR by dividing total
capital - equity plus other assets - by the value of loans,
securities and other assets, weighted according to their
riskiness. The Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements,
which acts as a clearing house for the gold and currency
reserves of many countries, recommends a minimum CAR of 8% for
international banks. Those with higher ratios are regarded as
exceptionally stable, since they have more than enough
resources to cover risk assets.

What does this all mean to you as a depositor, borrower and
investor? As they say, forewarned is forearmed. Know thy
banker and thy bank. By all means, look for good service,
attractive deposit rates and cheap loans. But don't forget the
fundamentals. The numbers in these pages are a good starting
point.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Rapped on the Knuckles: Can Jardine Fleming
regain investor trust? 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Hong Kong's Jardine Fleming Bank, ranked No. 350 in the
Financial 500, might be thankful it focuses on treasury and
foreign-exchange transactions, not on retail services.
Ordinary depositors could have been spooked by news last week
that a Hong Kong sister company, Jardine Fleming Investment
Management, had been censured for lax controls. JFIM's London-
regulated affiliate, Jardine Fleming Asset Management or JFAM,
was fined $625,000 and had its license in Britain withdrawn.
Three other investment firms within Britain's Robert Fleming
Group, half-owner of Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming Group,
were each penalized $156,000 for failing to make sure that
JFIM had adequate controls before entrusting it with its
clients' money.

British and Hong Kong authorities came down hard on former
JFIM senior fund manager Colin Armstrong for enriching himself
at the expense of three funds, and on former JFIM and JFAM
chief Robert Thomas for failing to adequately supervise
operations and deal with the misconduct. Armstrong, who
resigned in March, and Thomas, who was sidelined to another
part of the group a month later, had their license in Hong
Kong revoked. (Thomas was also banned from working in
Britain's fund-management industry.) Armstrong has returned an
undisclosed amount to JFIM; the company will use the money as
part of a $19.3 million compensation fund for affected
investors. "This has been a painful experience," said Henry
Strutt, managing director of the Jardine Fleming Group. "We're
glad to have been able to put the matter right."

It is not over. Asia's biggest investment manager with $22
billion in funds, Jardine Fleming faces the task of reassuring
institutional and retail clients across the region. Last week,
Robert Fleming disclosed that it had repatriated three funds
under JFIM management, worth a combined $1.1 billion, back to
London, though it insisted the move has no connection with the
investigation. The controversy comes at a bad time. The Hong
Kong government will introduce a mandatory provident fund
scheme next year, which could mean billions of dollars in new
pension money needing managers. Some of JFIM's existing
provident-fund clients are said to be looking at their
options.

JFIM had been housecleaning even before the five-month
British-Hong Kong probe was completed. It had named a new
chief of compliance and hired experts to review procedures.
JFIM says it is banning personal-account dealings and
introducing a centralized system to check when and where all
trades are routed. Because of the loopholes, Armstrong had
allegedly found it easy to delay the booking of a trade. If
the transaction was especially profitable, say the regulators,
it would be credited as a deal made by his personal account or
one particular client account. If not, it would be allocated
to another fund he manages.

Despite the disciplinary action, Armstrong has yet to be shown
to have broken any Hong Kong criminal law. And JFIM? The
challenge is to remain entrepreneurial while making sure no
regulation is breached. JFIM's success has been credited to
its free-wheeling management. "This is the same business style
lauded in the press as more dynamic than half-a-dozen of its
competitors," says an industry source. "But any system is only
as good as the people within it." The regulators - and
investors - are watching.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: A Behemoth Awakes: New Delhi"s biggest bank
reinvents itself 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

In India, a giant is stirring. The State Bank of India
(assets: $36.1 billion) is putting away its musty files and
ledgers the size of billiard tables. Chairman P.G. Kakodkar,
59, aims to computerize 1,000 branches a year. SBI has also
started streamlining management structures and delegating
power to division heads. In August, it announced the formation
of subsidiaries to handle credit cards and securities trading,
and launched a partnership with travel firm Thomas Cook to set
up a tourism development finance company. "Internationally,
the bank is positioning for a dominant presence in the cross-
border loan syndication markets and also in the issue of
Indian paper by blue-chip companies," says Kakodkar.

There is much to do. Ranked No. 63 in the Financial 500,
state-controlled SBI employs 229,000 people and has 8,763
branches in India and 49 overseas. Owned 60% by the state, SBI
is under orders not to fire people, which raises the question
of what it will do with excess staff after computerization and
streamlining. Still, improvements are beginning to show.
Customer complaints are now considered black marks that can
affect an employee's prospects. SBI offices are less often the
dingy affairs that prompted jokes about the bank's expansion
strategy: go to a village, look for a cowshed, drive away the
cattle and set up operations. "The first thing we're doing
with the computerization of branches is to rework their
interior decor," says SBI spokeswoman Ranjana Bharij.

"It's a huge task to make SBI friendlier to the ordinary
customer," says investment analyst Imran Contractor. "They
have been so used to resting on their power." Improving
service to corporations should be easier. A new commercial
accounts division has just opened a Bombay branch to serve
business groups exclusively. SBI has also reduced processing
time for all loans. "These changes will ensure that old
clients will not go away," says Prasanna Someshwar, a banking
analyst for W.I. Carr in Bombay. "This is important because
new private banks are going for big business."

Can SBI compete? Contractor says the bank is still "highly
susceptible to government interference." But Someshwar is
optimistic: "It used to be a giant which did not know where it
was headed. Now it is focused." Four years ago, SBI
commissioned Canadian management consultancy firm Mackenzie
and Co. to study ways of improving its operations. The bank
started implementing the recommendations in January. In
Kakodkar, says Someshwar, SBI has found "an instrument of
reform, not necessarily a visionary." An SBI veteran who once
headed the bank's training college and technology division,
Kakodkar became chairman only two months ago. But he knows
where the bank has been - and where it wants to go.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Too Many Lenders?: Let the market decide, says
Manila 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Edgardo Reyes has accounts with three financial institutions.
"One bank is more efficient than the others," says the
Filipino entrepreneur, "but I do business with all three
because I can get better terms that way." He is learning to
take advantage of the country's two-year-old banking
liberalization. The money people are getting an education too.
"Times have changed," says Rafael Buenaventura, president of
PCI Bank and the Bankers Association of the Philippines. "It's
no longer unusual for us bankers to wake up in the morning and
discover that changes have occurred overnight. As we scan the
morning papers over breakfast, we find out that one new bank
is about to open, a new product has been introduced, and the
government is thinking about some new means of taxation."

Welcome to the brave and ever- expanding new world of
Philippine banking. In the last few months, Filipino-owned
East-West Banking Corp., Ecology Bank, iBank and Total Savings
Bank opened their doors. Earlier, Banco Santander of Spain,
Dao Heng Bank of Hong Kong and Taiwan's Chinatrust teamed up
with Filipino partners to launch three new ventures. Last
year, 10 foreign banks - among them Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
Development Bank of Singapore and Bangkok Bank - started full-
scale operations. The tally so far: 152 institutions. "Our
banking density ratios have significantly declined from more
than 17,000 persons per bank in 1990 to about 12,500 in 1995,"
says Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson. "That is bringing
us closer to the much lower densities seen in Hong Kong and
Japan."

Good or bad? Ask the public. Pre-liberalization, the 137
mostly Filipino-owned banks offered only basic services. These
days, lenders entice clients with phone banking, automated
teller machines that sell airline tickets, high-yield savings
plans - and longer hours. "Various product and market
diversification strategies have been implemented and a host of
electronic banking innovations created to tap yet unserviced
consumer segments," says Antonio Abacan, president of
Filipino-owned Metrobank, the country's best-capitalized
commercial bank. Rates for customers have improved. In 1994,
the spread between the lowest deposit rate and the prime
lending rate was 12.5 percentage points. The gap is now only
half that.

But there are worries. After Indonesia opened up its banking
sector in 1988, hundreds of new banks and deposit-taking
companies set up shop. Some found themselves dangerously
overstretched. One casualty: medium-sized Bank Summa, which
collapsed in 1992 under the weight of $800 million in debts.
"I would like to admonish some sectors not to be too hasty in
pressing for more liberalization," says Buenaventura. "It's
premature to consider the entry of more foreign banks."

Singson insists that safeguards are in place to protect the
banking system. The central bank has increased minimum
capitalization - from $30 million to $48 million for
commercial banks - and tightened its monitoring, especially of
risk management. "Everywhere in the world, government
officials have a poor track record whenever they start
substituting their judgment for that of the market," he says.
"Business decisions are best left to the bankers." And to bank
customers.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Asian Promises: The WTO hopes to solidify them


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The financial services trade deal that took effect Sept. 1 was
a baby step on the road to open markets. Next comes the hard
part: making the tentative promises, agreed to last year in a
pact signed by 44 World Trade Organization members,
permanent. Those promises include things like increasing the
number of foreign banks allowed to operate in a given country
or permitting overseas brokerages to establish joint ventures
with local companies. Beginning Nov. 1, 1997, the signatories
will have 60 days to amend, add or withdraw promises already
made. That is not the only unfinished business. Last year, the
U.S. dropped out at the last minute. The hope is that
Washington will be more willing to deal once presidential
elections are past.

The U.S. has been especially critical of Asian nations for
practicing protectionism. Asian negotiators respond that they
see little to gain from matching the U.S. in opening markets.
How-ever, that didn't stop many from making concessions. By
sector, here are some of key ones:

BANKING

India: Increased to eight from five the number of banking
licenses it awards to foreigners each year. Also agreed not to
count automatic teller machines against the quota, which has
been a sore point between regulators and foreign banks.

Malaysia: No longer requires foreign banks to hold training
programs for Malaysians before bringing in outside
specialists. Also, foreign-owned banks now can accept foreign
currency deposits from local residents.

Philippines: Raised the limit to 49% from 40% on how much
equity in domestic banks a foreigner can buy.

South Korea: Agreed foreign financial institutions could take
minority equity positions in domestic banks for the first time
beginning this year.

Thailand: Promised to sanction two new branches for each
existing foreign bank by 1997.

INSURANCE

Japan: Will allow insurance brokers to operate in Japan,
liberalize cross-border insurance deals for ships and aircraft
of Japanese registration, and ease reserve requirements.

Malaysia: Promised to allow new foreign entities in non-life
reinsurance. Seven new licenses are pledged by June 30, 2005.

Pakistan: Established a new 51% limit for the share foreign
entities can own in new life insurance companies. The same
percentage will apply to banks' portfolio management arms.

Philippines: Liberalized market access for foreign-owned or
controlled insurance and reinsurance companies.

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

India: Promised to allow foreigners to incorporate local
stockbroking joint ventures as long as the foreigners didn't
own more than 49%.

Indonesia: Promised to eliminate all market access
restrictions in financial services by 2020. Before, the
promise was for only partial elimination.

Malaysia: Pledged to raise the foreign equity limit in certain
financial firms to 49% from 30% by July 1, 2000.

South Korea: Lowered the operating fund requirements for
foreign securities firms doing business in the country. More
significantly, it raised from 10% to 15% the proportion of
shares that foreigners can own in a Korean company.

NO SPEEDING

Flush with triumph at having brokered a major trade deal
without the involvement of the U.S., European Union members
scoffed at what they thought was Japanese timidity. Tokyo
wanted to give the 44 signers of the financial services treaty
a year to debate and approve the treaty in their home
capitals.

Japanese negotiators prevailed, and today it is their turn to
harrumph. Ten of the original signers missed a June 30, 1996,
deadline for ratification. Today, four EU countries have not
acted to endorse their promises, though all 10 Asian countries
that signed have.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Bankers on Banking: The buzzwords: change and
service 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Like it or not, all of us have to deal with bankers. So what
makes that experience a boost rather than a bane? A great
institution requires a mixture of profitability,
competitiveness, quality service, innovation, corporate
responsibility and, of course, financial soundness. But it
also demands a dynamic leader to add a dash of inspiration. We
talked to head honchos of top banks about their recipes for
success. Excerpts:

Antonio Abacan, 53, president of Metrobank in the Philippines
(No. 218 in the Financial 500), knows a thing or two about
good service. "Since most products and services in the banking
system are homogenous, with minimal price differentials, many
clients have become indifferent," he says. "But one factor
that spurs customer loyalty is outstanding service." Schooled
in Western and local techniques, Abacan defines Metrobank's
vision as singularly Asian: "The Western way is
straightforward and to the letter. In our way of banking, even
if your customer's financial statement is negative but you
know his business, you will lend to him."

Amirsham Aziz, 46, managing director of Malayan Banking Berhad
(No. 70), has been working for Maybank for 19 years. The
institution has been extending loans and deposit facilities to
its customers since 1960. Amirsham puts commitment to people
first. "Being No. 1 has many responsibilities," he says. "The
public expect excellent services, our staff expect an
excellent working environment, shareholders expect superior
returns. Meanwhile, our competitors try to match every move we
make. All this sums up the need to be a truly efficient
organization which continuously strives for excellent service,
to satisfy the expectations of increasingly sophisticated
customers."

Banthoon Lamsam, 43, president of Thai Farmers Bank (No. 96),
aims to combine Asian conservatism with Western innovation.
"First, extremely careful lending, and second, changing the
way we provide services" are his winning strategies, says the
Harvard- and Princeton-trained billionaire scion of the bank's
controlling family. One of his pet peeves: long lines at
teller windows. He has trimmed them.

David Li Kwok Po, 57, deputy chairman and CEO of the Bank of
East Asia (No. 154), is one of Hong Kong's most prominent
bankers and the industry's representative on the territory's
Legislative Council. Li's family has made BEA one of the major
banking forces in the territory. He once aspired to the
Anglican Church ministry, but chose instead a more secular
career path. His secret for success? "It's confidence," says
Li. You have to convince the client that you are trustworthy
by providing good service, he urges. Do that and loyalty will
come. One strategy: student loans. Li aims to turn them into
loyal clients early.

Okkie A.T. Monterie, 51, deputy president director of Bank
Internasional Indonesia (No. 245), says transparency is one
strong reason for the bank's success. For starters, it makes
raising money offshore far easier and often cheaper.
"Investors know exactly what we're doing," he explains. "We
have a clear-cut image." He compares BII and Bank Central
Asia, the country's largest privately owned institution. "BCA
is not a public company; we are," says Okkie. "There is no
pressure on them to show a good bottom line. A public company
has more visibility, more transparency."

Peter Seah Lim Huat, 50, president and CEO of Overseas Union
Bank (No. 116), joined the Singapore lender after 10 years at
Citibank, widely regarded as one of the few truly global
institutions. That experience gave Seah a taste for thinking
internationally and keeping up with an ever-changing market.
"Consumer banking is going through a radical evolution," he
observes. "We are moving into a highly electronic environment
with a broader range of more complex products. That requires
different skills, a different mentality, retraining and
repositioning. When you have been in a business for over 40
years and are steeped in tradition, these changes are not
simple."

Yoon Byung Chul, 60, president of Hana Bank (No. 115), sees
virtue in both big banks and boutiques. "You're either a niche
bank or a universal bank that provides just about any kind of
financial service," he says. "These days there is nothing in
between." Hana is setting up a stockbroking firm and wants to
offer unit trust, insurance and other services as soon as
Korean regulators will allow them. Plainly, Asia's best banks
are hardly sitting pretty waiting for the interest to pile up.

FINANCIAL 500: The Asiaweek Financial 500: From global giants to nimble
niche players, Asia"s banks tell the secrets of success 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Ricardo Saludo and Matthew Fletcher

In a world of phonebanking, automated teller machines, online
asset switching and smartcards, Antonio Abacan has a secret
weapon. "We serve tea in all our branches," allows the
president and chief operating officer of Metropolitan Bank &
Trust Co., the Philippines' largest financial institution, No.
218 in The Asiaweek Financial 500 ranking of the region's
biggest banks.

The hot cups of Chinese brew are part of Metrobank's Asian
style. "We've developed a niche - Filipino-Chinese
businessmen," Abacan says. One such client, a Mr. Angpin,
appreciates the familiar touch: "They know the Asian way. You
can drop by, give a bag of money to the manager for deposit,
and not bother counting the money." Yes, confirms Abacan, "our
teller will later call him to say, `Your deposit is 1 million
pesos.' Other banks try to imitate our style, but this kind of
trust takes years and years to cultivate."

As competition hots up in the liberalizing world of Asian
banking, the leading players are finding that tried and tested
ways are just as important in staying ahead as the latest high
tech and financial legerdemain. Banker-legislator David Li
Kwok Po, chief executive of Hong Kong's third-ranked Bank of
East Asia (No. 154 in the 500), breaks no news when he
expounds on BEA's success formula: generating confidence,
providing strong service and building relationships. Plus a
maverick streak: the bank's early push into China has made it
probably the most profitable foreign player on the mainland.
"You can't be too aggressive because your customers won't like
that," Li explains. "But you can't be too conservative either.
It's hard to get the mix right."

But mix the top banks must. This special report looks at how
some of the best performers in key Asian markets cope with
rising competition and rapid change. Their moves and those of
the regional industry are major factors in shifts among the
Financial 500 banks. Now in its third year, the annual ranking
(starting on page 60) again chronicles in telling numbers the
surges and strains of Asian banking. Trillion-yen write-offs
in Japan? No wonder the 500's top 20 lossmakers are Japanese.
Roaring economies in Greater China? Indeed: with just 15% of
the 500's assets, banks from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan
generated nearly 40% of all profits.

The world's largest financial institution as of March 31,
1996, the end of the fiscal year covered by the 500, was Dai-
Ichi Kangyo Bank (assets: $536.6 billion). But DKB's return to
first place (it was No. 1 for years during the 1980s) lasted
but a day. The newly merged Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, with
combined assets of $791 billion, dwarfed it on April 1 - and
pointed to the likely future of Japanese banking. Faced with
monstrous dud loans and equally gigantic competition, and
urged by the Finance Ministry, lenders in Japan are seeking
strength in tie-ups and takeovers. Four institutions with
stakes in Taiheiyo (No. 169) are rescuing that lender. Nippon
Trust (No. 131) cut its losses by $1.2 billion after it was
taken over by Mitsubishi Bank (No. 3). The latter's merger
with Bank of Tokyo (No. 12) is just the latest union among
several in recent years, which also created Sakura Bank, No. 1
in the previous Financial 500.

The marriages and write-offs by Japanese institutions
highlight a key plank in the strategies of topnotch Asian
banks: Beef up your capital. Singapore's Overseas Union Bank
(No. 116) plans a big push in both regional and consumer
banking. For that, OUB and its subsidiaries have more than
tripled their capital to over $2 billion since 1992,
polevaulting from 400 to 162 in the ranks of world banking
groups by capital funding, and fifth in ASEAN. "Our much
larger size has enabled us to effectively penetrate [loan]
syndication markets in Thailand, China, Hong Kong and even
Australia," says OUB chief Peter Seah Lim Huat. The heftier
equity base has also helped it acquire Chase Manhattan's
credit-card business in Singapore. With investment banking
ambitions, Japan's Sanwa Bank has augmented its capital by
cashing in some $1.3 billion in stocks. That lifted its
capital adequacy ratio to 9.12%, well above the 8% recommended
for international institutions and despite a $9.2-billion
write-off charged against equity.

The urge to merge is also spurred by intense competition. "You
will see it happening in Hong Kong," says Thomas Koetzsch, a
Hong Kong-based analyst for bank rating agency Capital
Intelligence. "There are too many banks." And more are coming,
from outside and inside Asia. Bank Austria is among the latest
Western institutions following corporate clients to Asia.
Koetzsch reckons Hong Kong could see local tie-ups or
purchases by mainland banks of Hong Kong institutions after
next year's reunification with China. Many large Chinese banks
are eager to widen their presence in Hong Kong, and "the
`easiest' way seems to be to buy a local bank," says Koetzsch.
London-based HSBC Holdings, parent of the Hongkong & Shanghai
Banking Corp. (No. 19), is rumored to be among the suitors for
Australia's state-controlled ANZ, whose strengths in South
Asia, Australasia and the South Pacific would complement
HSBC's reach. The new government in Canberra is believed to be
open to a foreign takeover.

Asian banks revving up for tougher competition also need to
enhance their human and technological resources. Sheltered
domestic markets, steeled by high regulatory walls, once led
to world-beating spreads and profits. But they left homegrown
institutions short on technology, innovation and marketing
savvy. "The prosperity of Asian banks is due not to good
management or innovation, but to protectionism and cartels,"
says Robert Zielinski, research chief of Jardine Fleming
brokerage firm in Singapore. "Banks have become fat and
inefficient." But they're changing, says analyst Phuah Eng
Chye of Kleinwort Benson Research in Kuala Lumpur. "Banks are
focusing on how to reinvent themselves. Once complacent, they
are now more alert and flexible."

At least, that's the goal. For Thai Farmers Bank's billionaire
boss Banthoon Lamsam, it means only one thing: Build a
service-oriented staff. "Our service was terrible - that was
the assumption from the beginning," says the Ivy Leaguer,
whose ethnic Chinese family founded Thai Farmers (No. 96 in
the 500) in 1945. He partly blames entrenched habits in the
domestic industry, where banks tend to be "very bureaucratic
and controlled by a closed group who take advantage of
consumers." Banthoon's solution: new technology and training
people for high performance.

Overcoming employee resistance to change has been the toughest
challenge, he says. To meet it, Banthoon revamped and
revitalized a core group of about 200 managers, imparting to
them his vision of Thai Farmers as a world-class player.
Result: online accounts, phonebanking, automatic bill payments
and credit-card clearance are now standard. Queues at Thai
Farmers are much shorter. And the improvements are getting
noticed. "Thai Farmers is perceived as a bank with vision and
a long-term plan to stay competitive," says Susheel Neruda,
head of research at Seamico Securities in Bangkok.

Metrobank's Abacan has also worked to improve employee morale,
teamwork and drive. He has helped create a spirit of
belonging, which has spurred staff to work long and hard and
be loyal (average length of service among senior executives:
27 years). Bank chairman George Ty himself sets the example,
at 64 still at his desk every day. Another morale boost:
spouses are often invited to bank functions. "They're family,"
says Abacan. Also boasting high productivity, Bank
Internasional Indonesia (No. 245), which has to make the most
of its relatively small headcount - 5,800 - spread among 170
branches. "We're very much lower in operating expenses vis-a-
vis competitors," says senior v.p. Manuel Sia, a Filipino who
joined BII in 1990. That has helped give the bank a 23.6%
return on equity, highest among the top 20 Indonesian banks.

Part of the Sinar Mas wood-based empire, the Jakarta-based
institution has grappled with another issue facing Asian banks
in a changing industry: universal vs. niche banking. Does a
bank offer a full range of services to all comers, or focus on
a narrow stratum of services and customers? But whichever one
chooses, the imperative, as BII has seen, remains the same:
Develop a market position. A bank should resolve the
universal-niche issue based not on theoretical arguments
favoring one or the other, but on what its market demands. And
once chosen, the market position should be developed by
gearing up to service the target clients and publicizing the
kind of bank one aims to be.

"In the beginning we were looking at corporate banking, but it
didn't make sense," recounts BII deputy president-director
Okkie A.T. Monterie. He saw that Indonesia's growing ranks of
affluent consumers wanted bankers that could offer everything
from car loans to credit cards. Three years ago BII shifted
gear. "The right direction for Indonesia is universal or
supermarket banking," says Okkie, who notes that two other
corporate-oriented players, Bank Niaga (No. 324) and Bank Bira
(No. 427), are going the retail banking route. BII seems well-
advanced on that road - literally: to better publicize its
consumer tack, it has bright red ads touring Jakarta on the
bodies of public buses.

Building a market position from scratch is a daunting
challenge, of course. One solution: take over a successful
operation, which will bring with it the hard-to-duplicate
customer relationships that underpin any banking operation.
HSBC bought J.P. Morgan bank's dollar-clearing unit, vaulting
itself into the top five in the global business, handling $80
billion a day for some 700 institutional clients. The quest
for an instant market base on which to build motivates buyouts
of consumer banking businesses like Chase's credit-card
operation in Singapore. That acquisition, says OUB's Seah, has
been "instrumental in energizing the rest of our consumer
business." For its part, Taipei-based Chinatrust Bank (No.
144) stole a march on rivals with a different kind of tie-up:
with auto dealers for its push into car loans. It's the same
tack for BEA, which is linking up with German marque Mercedes
Benz in China. "They have the name," says CEO Li. "We build
the relationship."

Like market position, the issue of technology suffers from
slogan-ridden herd-driven thinking. Everyone is innovating, so
banks feel they have to or else. Asia's smart bankers follow a
hard-nosed, market-led rule of thumb: Use technology to reach
the client. Not to impress other bankers or follow the fad,
but to improve service and boost profits. Old-style banking
required the public to travel across town, line up before
tellers and fill out complicated forms. The high-tech variety
enables customers to avail themselves of the same services and
more from the comfort of their office desk or bedside table.
Financing is arranged when it is needed: as the client buys
something.

Hongkong Bank aims to use that strategy in its drive for the
high-end consumer market. So will its subsidiary Hang Seng
(No. 49), which is targeting a mass market that is only now
becoming comfortable with innovations like phonebanking and
credit cards. Helping HSBC's techno-ambitions is its size: it
can spread the cost over eight major affiliate institutions,
including Midland Bank, one of Britain's top four, and
America's Marine Midland.

For Metrobank, high tech and modern systems helped it reach
out to the thousands of Filipino workers overseas. Its Private
Electronic Remittance and Communication System handles large
volumes of money remittances fast. The service allows cash to
be withdrawn by a worker's family in the Philippines on the
same day he or she deposits the money at one of Metrobank's
online terminals abroad. Technology upgrades being such a
daunting operation - Thai Farmers had to re-engineer 500
branches over three years - they have to pay for themselves
and more. And they can if they bring in customers.

What about going international? Under the World Trade
Organization's financial services deal, banking markets in
many countries are opening up. But Kleinwort Benson's Phuah
believes for most of the region's institutions, "globalization
does not appear feasible because Asian banks are not clear
what objectives can be achieved. How does opening a branch in,
say, New York, London or Tokyo contribute to profitability?"
He expects banks with international ambitions to expand
regionally first. But Amirsham Aziz, head of top-ranked
Malayan Banking (No. 70) goes further back: "To be successful
abroad, you would need to first succeed in your own market.
Then you would need to know the foreign country well and make
sure you can be an important component in its development."

Maybank is itself grappling with the challenges of banking in
the New Asian Economy, where old developmental priorities have
given way to the demands of fast-expanding affluence and
regional business. Its experience mirrors those of other
established Asian lenders, most of which started as conduits
of funds for early industrialization and infrastructure.
"Maybank was established in 1960, when the country had just
achieved independence," recounts Amirsham. "We played our role
as a mobilizer of capital for economic development."

Such institutions were more concerned with bankrolling roads,
bridges and factories than attending to their bottom line. Now
that their nations have achieved economic strength, they
ironically face the prospect of losing the fruits of their
nation-building efforts to newcomers more attuned to such
thrusts as consumer financing and investment management. In
Korea, for instance, while the largest lenders creak under
non-performing business loans built up during the decades of
rapid industrialization, a relative upstart like Shinhan Bank
(est. 1981, No. 61 in the 500) can plot bold moves with its
clean balance sheet.

Can the established lenders of the development years adapt and
profit from the very success they helped create? Maybank,
which serviced mainly companies during the development years,
has been moving to develop its consumer banking business. In
this endeavor, Amirsham points out, "the bank's early
expansion to reach various segments of the people gives us a
strong market presence." He adds that the bank's development
orientation also imbued it with concern for the client.
"Meeting customers' needs has always been at the forefront of
everything we do," stresses the CEO, a 19-year veteran at the
bank. "We've also adopted a philosophy that values long-term
relationships with our customers."

In sum, nation-building lenders may in fact have the same
traits that could win them loyal customers in today's boom
times if - a big one - they can target the new class of
clients. But in doing so, Asian institutions need to maintain
a cautious conservatism in the face of unfamiliar booms that
could so easily go bust, as Japan's bubble-economy bankers
have seen. Kleinwort Benson's Phuah rings out a familiar
warning about Kuala Lumpur, which would apply to many other
Asian cities: "Easy liquidity has fueled asset prices,
especially in property. If there's a severe fallout, bad debts
could rise."

At the same time, years of intimate experience in Asia's
markets give its lenders a unique plus. Says Chinatrust
executive Steve Chou: "Imagine a multinational walking into a
laundry shop to evaluate credit risk. Local banks have lived
with these people so many years, they know." Whether gauging
risk, building relationships or just having tea, the ultimate
tenet in regional finance seems clear: Banks in Asia can win
by being Asian. After all, in a business built on trust, it
helps to be one of the family.

PEOPLE: Now, Enter the Mongolian: Sumo fans would have to wrestle with a
name like Daba Badobayaru 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Sumo fans would have to wrestle with a name like Daba
Badobayaru. So in Japan, he is known as Kyo-kushuzan. But,
whatever his name, fame beckons the 23-year-old Mongolian. He
has become the first wrestler from his country - and only the
sixth foreigner ever - to compete in the top makuuchi level of
the sport. The current three other non-Japanese wrestlers are
all Hawaii-born. "It was painful adjusting to Japan in terms
of language and food," said Kyokushuzan - though his 1.83-
meter, 121-kg frame suggests he has now mastered the cuisine
at least. Kyokushuzan has made giant steps since 1992 when he
launched his Japan career in Osaka. Last week he barged into
the elite 40 of about 800 professional sumo rikishi. "I'm a
happy man," he told journalists. No one in the audience dared
dispute him.

PEOPLE: To Coach or To Be Coached?: "I would like to coach," says former
women"s world table tennis champion... 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

"I would like to coach," says former women's world table
tennis champion Jiao Zhimin. "I have not played at all since I
came to South Korea. I played ping-pong for 18 years in China
and I think that is enough." But, if Jiao's fans have their
way, she is unlikely to hold a ping-pong paddle again. Since
settling in Seoul, the former Chinese athlete has been a TV
and newspaper reporter, a model, and, most recently, an
actress in Daughters-in-Law From Three Countries, a TV mini-
series. Jiao caught the fancy of Koreans when she and Korean
table tennis player Ahn Jae Hyung fell in love during the 1986
Asian Games. They married in December 1989 and now have a
five-year-old son. For all her fame, Jiao, 33, says she still
isn't comfortable acting. "It's very hard, especially since my
Korean isn't that good yet," she says. "When I memorized my
lines, my acting was bad. And when I acted okay, I would
forget the words." Right, maybe coaching would come more
naturally.

PEOPLE: The Mee Pok Girl: Singaporean actress Michelle Goh may be last
year"s movie sensation... 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Singaporean actress Michelle Goh may be last year's movie
sensation, but in a country with a track record of rarely
making more than one film a year, she's still a big deal. Goh
played the female lead character, Bunny, a prostitute, in
director Eric Khoo's drama Mee Pok Man, about a noddle-seller.
About a year (and 22 international film festivals) since the
movie was released, she's still known as the "Mee Pok Girl."
Postcards of Goh (barely) dressed in a bra-top and tight
shorts were a popular giveaway offered to subscribers to an
online magazine. She has also taken part in a Japanese TV
special called Asian Beauties and has cut a couple of songs
for a CD. Goh, 22, who had never acted before last year, will
soon be starring in a soap, My Grandson The Doctor, on
primetime Singapore television. Prior to showbusiness, she had
a different kind of high-flying career - as a Cathay Pacific
flight attendant.

Technology Computers: Tick Tock Goes the Clock: Experts race to head off
the Year 2000 crisis 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Jose Manuel Tesoro

The way the doomsdayers tell it, the world as we know it will
end at midnight, Dec. 31, 1999. The second the next millennium
begins, people will be recorded with negative ages. Phone
calls will be billed in millions of dollars. Instead of paying
interest due on loans, borrowers will receive a percentage of
what they owe - while depositors will be asked to pay banks
part of their savings. Building security systems may fail,
financial markets could be paralyzed.

All this is forecast to happen because computer programmers
decided over 30 years ago to save on data storage space by
designating years with two-digit numbers. They assumed that by
the time the 1990s rolled around, hardware and software would
have been replaced by versions that do not assume all dates
are in the 20th century. The old "legacy" systems think "00"
signifies 1900 - so at the beginning of the next millennium,
they will start calculating current bills, interest-rate
payments, pension disbursements, bond maturities, mortgages
and the like as if they began, ended or spanned the beginning
of the century. The bug will affect both personal computers
and mainframes.

Since business and government have become so dependent on
computers for data processing and analysis, the stroke of
midnight could have an ominous ring to it (see box). Ana-lysts
have likened the so-called Year 2000 problem to a virus -
though it technically is not one - since it is so wide-spread
and so dangerous. U.S.-based market research firm the Gartner
Group estimates that fixing the "millennium bug," which may
require rewriting millions of lines of computer code, will
cost $600 billion. Last April, its research director, Bruce
Hall, told the U.S. Congress that "the Year 2000 virus is the
most devastating ever to infect the world's business systems."

That dire? Maybe not. Many companies - both computer suppliers
and their customers - have long been aware of the bug and have
been working on solutions. In addition, Asia generally has the
advantage of having adopted the latest technologies, which
have benefited from the results of this awareness. So, as with
many things in the region, the Year 2000 crisis could end up
being the Year 2000 moneymaking opportunity.

"It's a business problem - and people really have to take the
bit between their teeth," says Ray Muller, business consulting
manager for CSSL, a Hong Kong-based reseller of IBM mainframes
that will soon launch a consulting division to offer clients
solutions to their Year 2000 problems.

Dozens of U.S. and European companies are already in the
market. Software and services company Compuware, for instance,
offers a package that includes software products as well as
programming professionals to diagnose, test and solve problem
applications. The process, says Andy Lewandowski, Compuware's
manager of international operations, will "take a lot of human
intervention." Though off-the-shelf solutions exist, rewriting
customized code will need people.

That is good news for India, which has a wealth of computer
professionals. Over 50 Indian companies working on ways to
squash the millennium bug have formed a special interest group
to promote their services. "We will offer cheap, quick and
easy solutions to the problem," says industry spokesman Dewan
Mehta. These companies feel that they can grab around $5
billion of the global business.

"The tools to solve this problem are the same everywhere,"
says Raghavendra Rao of Hyderabad-based Satyam Com-puters.
"But it requires extensive manual intervention. And people
costs in India are cheaper - less than half of those in the
U.S." The Gartner Group estimates that farming codework out to
offshore sites such as India will cut costs by 40%.

The Indians think the Gartner estimate of $600 billion is
high. Mehta says the final figure is likely to be between $60
billion and $200 billion. One reason: many companies have
addressed the problem early. Hongkong Bank, for example, began
making its systems "Year 2000-compliant" in the mid-1980s. "We
knew it would be a problem," says Bob Carlson, the bank's
technical services director. So the company simply included
Year 2000 compliance as part of its normal program of up-
grades. The bug "is a real problem," Carlson acknowledges,
"but the situation is being exacerbated by some of the people
who have most to gain from offering services to fix it."

Hongkong Bank has been aided by the relative newness of its
systems. Many U.S. and European companies adopted - and still
use - technologies from the 1970s and early 1980s. Still, says
Compuware's Lewandowski, Asia's slight advantage should not be
an excuse for complacency. "Never assume anything," he warns.
Preparing for the Year 2000 should be every business's
business.

negative ages.

Jan. 1, 1990, was a weekday. Jan. 1, 2000, falls on a weekend.
Bank vaults might open automatically.

PC clocks may go back to Jan. 1,  1980, ruining date-based

Entertainment: Borrowed by Bollywood: Indian movies have some very familiar
scenes 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Originality is one thing not expected of the strange and
mongrelized world of the Indian cinema. Given a choice between
creating their own ideas and "borrowing" someone else's,
producers can be counted on to take the easy option. In this
sense, Bollywood, as India's Bombay-based movie industry is
called, is an apt name. It suggests a cut-rate, bloated and
folly-ridden version of Hollywood.

Alert copyright lawyers could make a killing from an industry
that doesn't settle for stealing merely ideas. Some Indian
directors also lift scenes, dialogue, music, posters and
billboards. Try, for instance, to spot the artistic difference
in the posters, right, for Hollywood's Mr. Jones, starring
Richard Gere, and Bolly-wood's Akele Hum Akele Tum (I'm Alone,
You're Alone). Naturally, the Indian movie is also a faithful
copy of the original.

In one of the most celebrated cases of borrowing in recent
years, the famous scene in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables,
when a baby carriage bumps its way down a staircase - itself a
nod to Eisenstein's Battle-ship Potemkin - was reproduced in
its entirety in N. Chandra's Tejaab (Acid).

At the moment, there are three Hindi versions of Sleeping With
the Enemy playing to packed houses in Indian cinemas. Each
puts a new, uniquely subcontinental twist on an already warped
theme. In one, titled Yaarana (Friends), the eternal triangle
is resolved with a macho male-bonding finale. In another, Agni
Sakshi (As Fire Is My Witness), the harassed wife becomes a
vamp, while the stalker is portrayed as the wronged party. And
in Daraar (Fear), the busty and popular Juhi Chawla plays a
gyrating song-and-dance version of the Julia Roberts
character.

Director Mahesh Bhatt's most recent effort, Phir Teri Kahani
Yaad Aagaye (Your Memory Comes Back to Haunt Me), is a copy of
Basic Instinct. Bhatt's daughter, Pooja, plays Sharon Stone.
She also recently made tabloid headlines by appearing on a
magazine cover wearing body paint. Daring stuff, except that
Demi Moore did it better on the front of Vanity Fair - and
without the bulky bikini that Bhatt wore.

A new TV series, From Hollywood to Bollywood, is attracting
big audiences with its formula of juxtaposing scenes from
Western films with their Indian copies. The series has
provided a new understanding of where Bombay's filmmakers pick
up what they call their inspiration.

Books: Hot Buttons: A spy novel that gets behind the headlines 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Derek Parker

The political thriller has never really taken off as an Asian
genre. Perhaps authors think that the field is crowded, with
tomes by Tom Clancy and the more elegant products of John le
Carre. But The Tim-Tim Man (Penfolk, Ashwood, Victoria,
Australia, 567 pages, A$19.95, paperback) is a valiant attempt
at mixing up an Asian brew of political conspiracy against an
historical and factual background. The author, Kerry Collison,
is Australian-born, although he is now an Indonesian citizen.
He once served as a diplomat in Jakarta and has a sound
understanding of the country and its politics.

His protagonist, Stephen Coleman, is  a middle-level
Australian diplomat who also happens to be a spy. Caught up in
the coup that toppled Sukarno, he makes contact with a rising
star of the Indonesian army, Nathan Seda. They form a
lucrative business alliance based on secret arms sales for
Indonesia's armed forces. But Seda has a hidden agenda: East
Timorese by birth, his ultimate aim is independence for his
native island. He secretly steers weapons and money to the
Fretilin resistance fighters.

The book begins in the turbulent mid-1960s, and tracks Seda's
rise through the 1970s and 1980s. Sometime in the near future
he is within sight of the ultimate political prize. Yet the
"Tim-Tim man" (slang for Timor) never forgets his real
mission, independence for East Timor, carefully disguising his
ambition behind a lot of national unity bluster. To achieve
this goal, Seda plans to provoke war between Indonesia and
Australia by planting a bomb in Australia's Parliament.

Meanwhile, the head of the Australian secret service is also
conniving. He  sees some benefit from a nice little war, and
he manipulates Coleman, who has fallen out with his former
friend, into a plot to kill the general. The labyrinth of
deception and counter-deception ends, literally, with a bang,
although not one which any of the protagonists had planned.

The author hits all the hot buttons: corruption, East Timor,
the Suharto succession and sometimes touchy Australian-
Indonesia relations. So it is not surprising that Indonesian
customs officers burned an early consignment of the book,
although the action seemed to to be the result of a lower-
level misunderstanding rather than orders from the top.

Regrettably, Collison cannot resist the temptation to
editorialize about Indonesian politics and sometimes seems to
lose the thread of the narrative as he pursues various
sidetracks. The key to success in a thriller is to keep the
story moving, and he only just manages to avoid getting bogged
down. Perhaps his second novel, to be called Merdeka Square,
will show a defter touch.

IN BRIEF: A spice that heals  Relations between India and the U.S. are
spicing up - literally 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

A spice that heals  Relations between India and the U.S. are
spicing up - literally. The Indian government's Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research is to challenge the patent
for turmeric granted in 1994 to two Americans who argued that
the herb's active ingredients have medicinal qualities as an
antiseptic.

Known to South Asians as haldi and to botanists as Curcuma
longa, turmeric is the yellow powder most commonly found in
curries. In India it is also used as a wound salve, a facial
cleanser and a disinfectant after funeral rites. In addition,
a 1992 study in the Indian Journal of Physiology and
Pharmacology found that a one-week course of the spice lowered
cholesterol levels by 29%.

Turmeric is made up of curcuminoids - anti-bacterial compounds
that also counter inflammation. AIDS patients even report that
they feel better when taking it, but it should be stressed
there is absolutely no evidence it has any effect on the HIV
virus.

So a lot more than fragrant curries are at stake here. Dr.
Ranjit Roy Chaudhury, chairman of India's Advisory Council on
Traditional Medicine, says: "We are moving towards the 21st
century and cannot keep saying we have been using these
substances for centuries as an excuse for not obtaining
patents." Dr. Chaudhury says Asian scientists should protect
their interests by taking out patents on herbal and
traditional treatments.

But while the international debate rages, you can use homemade
turmeric preparations whenever you wish.

Health: Inflationary Pressures: Some timely tips on avoiding intestinal gas


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Catherine Shepherd

It's an embarrassing topic. But it is a real enough problem
for all that. We all know what it is like to have stomach or
intestinal gas. Overindulging at a family banquet or having
one beer too many can be at best embarrassing, and, at worst,
very uncomfortable. So what causes gas? There are more
villains than you ever thought.

First, leave those candies and chewing gum on the shelf. When
you suck hard candy, the constant swallowing of air causes
bloating and burping. Also, sugar-free gum often contains
sorbitol - a sweetener that the bacteria in our colons gobble
up and break down to produce large amounts of gas. This makes
the muscle walls of the colon contract; you feel the
contractions as cramps. So cut back on the gum or read the
label carefully. Sorbitol and other similar sugar-free
sweeteners are often listed as "sugar alcohol" on ingredient
lists.

Avoid leftover carbohydrates. Corn and whole-grain rice form
gas-producing compounds when refrigerated. Thawing and
reheating refrigerated leftovers increases the bacterial
activity that causes gas. If you must eat leftovers, then try
them cold. If they don't go down well that way, heat only
enough for one sitting.

Fiber is an important cholesterol-lowering and colon-cancer-
preventing nutrient. But too much of it causes intestinal gas.
If you plan to add fiber to your diet, do so slowly. The
recommended intake is 25 g per day, and working up to this
amount gradually will be easier on your gut. In particular, be
wary of beans, cabbage, apples and broccoli.

Lastly, reduce your fats and oil consumption. Lowering fat
intake is sage advice for any healthful diet, but fats are
also the most difficult nutrient to digest. They can stay in
your stomach up to two hours and delay the emptying of your
intestinal tract, causing cramps and bloating. All fats,
whether from cooking oil, meats or desserts, cause the same
reaction, so refusing that third helping of fried noodles or
your second mooncake could go a long way to keeping your
stomach happy.

If you cannot avoid the culprit foods, there are a number of
ways to purge the gas from your gastro-intestinal tract.
Following a meal with a spice such as peppermint, cinnamon or
ginger will prevent vapor formation and aid digestion. Steep-
ing ginger-root or a cinnamon stick in hot water will give you
an aromatic, anti-gas tea.

Fight the tendency to lounge after a meal. Going for a brief
walk will increase the movement of gas from your digestive
system. Never lie down; it will only worsen the symptoms. And
if these drug-free remedies don't work, try an over-the-
counter gas medication, and follow the package directions
carefully.

Art: strokes of brilliance Please: Thai artists brush aside their rivals in
the third ASEAN art competition 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Julian Gearing  Bangkok

No room for the finer things of life in the business-before-
all-else world of Southeast Asia? Think again. A total of
3,624 entries were received for the ASEAN Art Awards 1996, the
third time the prestigious competition has been held.

Judging took place in the National Gallery in Bangkok, where,
to the delight of locals, Thais took the first three places.
Top prize of $10,000 went to Sakchai Uttitho, for his Life
Upcountry No. 6 - a paean to the charms of his home town of
Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand. "I am happier
there, more peaceful," says the 28-year-old, who is studying
for a masters in fine art at Bangkok's Silpakorn University.

Life Upcountry drew praise from Sawasdi Tantisuk, 71, one of
Thai-land's leading painters and a judge for the Philip
Morris-sponsored ASEAN competition. "Sakchai has composed a
natural picture of the countryside, with a strong contrast
between light and dark," he said. "It has a lot of energy,
which contributes to its beauty."

Vorakorn Metmanorom, a 28-year-old commercial artist, took
second place - and $8,000 - with Yearning for Return of
Spirituality # 1. Of his work, he says: "It is a reflection of
the fact that you need hope. Take farmers, for example. Even
if the wind is strong, if there are floods, if the crops are
not good, they always have to have determination. There is no
security for them, no guarantee the crops will be good. The
focus is on hope and determination."

In third place, with prize money of $5,000, was Light of Asia,
by Metha Kongsonthi, 25. Like Sakchai's Life Upcountry, this
swirling, colorful work is an evocative tribute to the
spirituality of northeast Thailand. Behind the top-placed
Thais came a Filipino and an Indonesian. Alfredo D. Esquillo
Jr. took fourth spot, and $3,000, with his spiritual conundrum
Daang Ligid-Krus (Cross Roads), and Sugeng Restuadi was fifth
with Life II, 1996. His prize money was $1,500.

Thais have dominated the ASEAN Art Awards since their
inception in 1994. In that year, Santi Thongsook won first
prize with his much-discussed Breath in the Capital City - a
disturbing image of a birth in the crowded streets of Bangkok.
Another Thai, Navin Biadklang, was runner-up last year. Why
this apparent Thai mastery of the Southeast Asian arts scene?

Sansern Milindasuta, chairperson of the department of visual
arts at Bangkok University, says it is partly because of
changing social attitudes. "The number of people visiting
galleries and exhibitions has increased," he says. "Also, the
number of artists has grown. Students are showing more
interest in taking up fine arts. And parents are more
understanding."

Phaptawan Suwannakudt, who runs the Place of Art gallery, says
another factor is a boom in art competitions. "Thais love
competitions," she says. "Young people try their best in them.
They follow the rules and the style and take into account the
taste of the judges."  But that, says Bangkok University's
Sansern, is one of the problems. "There is simply too much
rivalry in competitions," he argues. "There is another way to
be an artist. They can present their work in an exhibition.
That is better than entering a competition." Sansern maintains
that in the past five years or so, it has become easier to
live as a professional artist in Thailand. "There are more
private collectors, institutions and foreign collectors," he
says.

As Thailand's budding art scene continues to grow, second-
placed Vorakorn says one major incentive is missing. "We still
don't have a contemporary art gallery in Bangkok," he
complains. "So there is no place for permanent exhibitions."
Until then, Thais will continue to enter competitions - and
most likely win them.

- Entries  from the ASEAN Art Awards will be on display in the
National Museum in Kuala Lumpur Oct. 6-31.

EYEWITNESS: BOOZING BOVINES: A bottle or two of beer are all part of the
pampered lifestyles of the cows of Matsusaka 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The irony about Japan's recent food-poisoning outbreak is that
the archipelago's inhabitants are generally the most
fastidious farmers, careful cooks and demanding diners in the
known universe. Every day, some of the finest and freshest
foodstuffs end up on Japanese plates. Among these, few are
produced with as much attention to detail as "Kobe beef" from
the Matsusaka area, southeast of Osaka. Not just any cow can
be a Matsusaka cow. It must be female and virginal - or, at
least, calf-less. "Female beef is sweeter," explains farmer
Nagata Koichi, "and virginal cows are more tender if they
haven't gone through the struggles of labor." What's more, the
heifers are constantly fussed over - especially in terms of
feeding, which is astonishingly precise in its timing,
quantity and content (hay, soy, vitamins, minerals and beer).
The result: meat with the finest of fine threads of fat in
beasts worth up to $18,520 a head. In good Japanese
restaurants, that can translate to about $9 a bite.

Nations: India: The Emperor"s Troubles: The Shiv Sena boss is down, but not
out 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Ajay Singh and Arjuna

Balasaheb Thackeray, leader of the rightist Shiv Sena party,
is called Hindu Hriday Samrat by his followers, which means
"Emperor of the Hindu Heart." The 69-year-old politician has
long been proud of that title. "My power will never wane," he
once said.  But a series of recent crises suffered by
Thackeray seem to belie his boast.

The latest setback to the Hindu radical leader was the death
of one of his henchmen, Amar Naik. A powerful mafia boss in
Bombay, Maharashtra's capital and India's richest city, Naik
was wanted in connection with 28 crimes, including several
murders. In early August, police gunned down the 47-year-old
gangster as he was driving a stolen car.

The Shiv Sena, which rules Maharashtra state with the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was angered by
Naik's death. An editorial in the official Sena daily, Saamna
(Confrontation), called on the police to stop targeting Hindu
mafia dons and go after Muslim gang lords instead. It
suggested that Hindu gangs should be allowed to take over
Bombay's underworld because the city belongs to the Hindu
majority.

Naik was apparently targeted at the behest of state deputy
chief minister Gopinath Munde, who belongs to the BJP and is
in charge of the local police. According to a BJP member, the
party's high command did not take kindly to Naik's enormous
power and the patronage he received from Thackeray. The BJP is
the main opposition party in India and its regional ally's
association with a gang leader was clearly a political
handicap.

Munde is also said to be behind another problem for Thackeray.
In late July, police discovered the body of Ramesh Kini, a 45-
year-old Shiv Sena member, in a cinema in Pune, near Bombay.
Investigations revealed that the tenants in the Bombay
building in which Kini lived had been pressured for years by
their landlord, Laxmichand Shah, to vacate their flats. Shah,
who is a close friend of the Thackeray family, wanted to
demolish the building to make way for a larger apartment
block. Except for Kini, all the other tenants had either
willingly left or were forced out.

Kini's widow, Sheila, has accused Raj Thackeray, the Sena
leader's 33-year-old nephew, of complicity in her husband's
death. She alleges that Raj and Thackeray's son, Jaidev, had
threatened Kini to leave his flat a few days before he died.
Raj was questioned by police but has denied any involvement.
The Maharashtra government, apparently under pressure from
Thackeray, changed the state attorney midway through the
investigations. Sheila has demanded a federal probe into her
husband's death.

The Kini case shot to public prominence after state opposition
leader Chhagan Bhujbal raised the issue in the Maharashtra
assembly. Bhujbal, 49, was a Sena member and a confidant of
Thackeray until his defection to the Congress party four years
ago. The two politicians have been sworn enemies since then.
Says Bhujbal: "There are hundreds of cases against the
Thackeray family that have been hushed up."

Neither Thackeray nor any of his family members hold formal
posts in the government, which allows them to wield power
without being publicly accountable. Anurag Chaturvedi, a
Bombay political columnist, says the string of scandals
surrounding the Thackerays point to a steady decline in the
power and public reputation of the Shiv Sena boss. "Two years
ago, it would have been unthinkable for the police to question
a member of the Thackeray family or touch Amar Naik," he says.
"The myth of Thackeray is being eroded."

Dissent from within the Shiv Sena is also brewing. Several
senior party leaders privately criticize Thackeray for his
high-handedness. Maharashtra Chief Minister Manohar Joshi, who
is a Sena member and owes his position to Thackeray, rarely
goes out of his way now to defend his political mentor. At a
recent press conference, Sena member Madhav Deshpande
criticized Thackeray for not holding party elections. "People
are appointed at his whim," he said. "I do not want to see the
Sena committing sati [self-immolation] for the Thackerays."

But for all his problems, Thackeray is still one of Bombay's
most powerful leaders. On Aug. 20, Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda met with Thackeray in Bombay, reportedly to solicit the
Shiv Sena's support in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh state
assembly elections. The PM wants the Shiv Sena to split from
the BJP, thereby helping his  United Front Alliance win the
state. For now, Thackeray may be down, but he is definitely
not out.

Nations: Indonesia: A Split Within the Ranks: Jakarta is abuzz with talk of
a military shakeup 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Susan Berfield and Keith Loveard Jakarta

Indonesia's military has been flexing its muscles at home and
abroad. Troops patrolled Jakarta's business district with
automatic weapons in the wake of the July 27 rioting, and
security forces have since rounded up leading members of
opposition groups. Last week, the armed forces launched its
largest and most complex war games ever: some 19,000 airborne
troops, 50 warships and 41 aircraft are taking part in a 17-
day drill in the South China Sea. The site of the exercise is
the waters around the gas-rich Natuna Islands, part of which
Beijing covets.

These shows of force, however, have diverted attention from
what appears to be a growing and unusually public rift within
the military, whose political influence is unmatched by any
other national institution. For the past 30 years, the armed
forces have underpinned President Suharto's government. And
Suharto in turn has molded the armed forces to meet his own
ends. Now, the president is faced with reshaping a divided
military at a crucial time.

The army supports the president as always. But that support is
split into emerging factions. "In the old days, the armed
forces commander would go to the president and say, `This is
our position,' " says a senior officer. "Today there is no
such thing as a military position, there are only the opinions
of certain officers."

The talk in Jakarta is that Suharto, as supreme commander, is
planning a major shakeup. The rumors have prompted authorities
to issue formal denials. Nevertheless, says political
scientist Ariwibowo: "Everybody knows that something is
happening within the army."

Suharto's first move came on Aug. 15, when he sacked the Armed
Forces chief of staff Lt.-Gen. Suyono, who has been at odds
with Armed Forces commander Gen. Feisal Tanjung for some time.
Feisal, who ranks second only to the president, may himself be
in trouble. Also in danger is the military socio-political
chief, Lt.-Gen. Syarwan Hamid, who ranks just below Suyono.
All three have been criticized for the heavy-handed way the
army quelled the Jakarta riots.

In the background is the presidential succession. Suharto, who
will almost certainly seek another term in 1998, wants a
military that he can implicitly count on. When he does
eventually step down, he is expected to cede power to someone
selected from within its ranks. That person must be able to
protect the president's family and their business interests.
In the meantime, "the military is being transformed into a
palace guard for a president facing an uncertain future," says
Australian analyst Gerry van Klinken of the Indonesia
Resources and Information Program in Melbourne.

Rival generals are scrambling to secure the high ground. The
tensions center on two pivotal figures: Gen. Feisal and army
commander Gen. Hartono. Each has civilian allies. Feisal is
backed by Research and Technology Minister B.J. Habibie, who
is also chairman of the prominent Muslim group known as ICMI.
Hartono is backed by Suharto's daughter Siti Hardyanti Rukmana
(Tutut), who is a leading official of the ruling Golkar group.
One well-connected ex-intelligence officer told Asiaweek: "The
situation is explosive."

For the moment, neither Feisal's nor Hartono's prospects look
promising. If Feisal is ousted, former Jakarta commander Lt.-
Gen. Wiranto is expected to take over, even though Hartono
outranks him. If Feisal stays, Hartono also loses. Come
November, when his appointment ends, Hartono could find
himself pushed onto the sidelines.

This would be a surprising turnabout for Hartono, given that
some have said Suharto was grooming him to be the next vice-
president, or even president if Suharto decides to step down
during his next term. Influential Muslim leader Abdurrahman
Wahid says Tutut virtually endorsed Hartono as the next
president during a recent talk to ulamas, or religious
leaders, in East Java. Says Wahid: "She told them `If you want
Hartono to be president, by God's will you will have him as
president.' "

Tutut's enthusiasm would seem to bode well for Hartono. But
according to a well-connected civil servant, "The backing of
the president's daughter doesn't necessarily mean that much.
Suharto is believed to be far more wary of Hartono than of
Feisal, who is just doing his job."

The way the armed forces commander has handled that job,
however, has caused friction. The military's violent takeover
of the Democratic Party of Indonesia's headquarters from
supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri on July 27, and its tough
response to the rioting that followed, has alarmed many. "The
armed forces bared their teeth in a way not seen for some
time," says van Klinken. The cost, he says, is an erosion of
the military's legitimacy. Even Suharto is thought to be
displeased.

What the president will do to show his displeasure, however,
is still anybody's guess. Until last week, most believed that
Gen. Feisal and Lt.-Gen. Syarwan would be the next casualties.
The once-whispered rumors of their downfall were spoken so
loudly in Jakarta that top officials have for the first time
issued formal denials. On Aug. 16, State Secretary Murdiono
said that no changes at the top were planned.

To many, that denial only confirmed that there was something
to the speculation. Syarwan later told Asiaweek that high
command had "heard nothing about [a shakeup]." And then added:
"This sort of thing doesn't happen overnight. There is a
process involved."

But when Sudomo, the head of the Supreme Advisory Council and
a Suharto confidante, also called the rumors fiction, some
figured Feisal would survive after all. He might even be
reincarnated as defense minister. Edi Sudrajat, who currently
holds that position, would then take over Sudomo's job. And
Sudomo would go into graceful retirement.

For his part, Lt.-Gen. Syarwan is fighting back. He told a
gathering of officers in Surabaya Aug. 13 that rumors of a
split within the military were "divide-and-conquer" tactics
used by enemies of the government. "Such political deception
is being carried out by irresponsible parties," he said.

So serious are the divisions at the top, however, that some in
the old guard have broken rank and publicly criticized the
current military leadership. Among them are senior retired
military leader Abdul Haris Nasution, one of the founders of
the modern armed forces, and former Home Minister Rudini. When
Rudini oh-so-gently reminded the military that it owed its
allegiance to the people, not the president, Coordinating
Minister for Politics and Security Susilo Sudarman had to
remind the retired officer of the need for unity, at least in
public.

Still, despite the heightened tensions within the ranks, and
the growing calls for a more open political system, the
military remains the dominant power in Indonesia. "It is
highly likely that the armed forces will influence the
political process in Indonesia for several decades," says Ian
MacFarling, lecturer at the Australian Defense Force Academy.

Civilians within Golkar admit that the generals will probably
thwart their plan to push Information Minister Harmoko as
vice-president. "We have to accept that the military is still
too strong," says a member of the Golkar central board. And
all other political institutions are still too weak.

The only one with any control over the generals remains
Suharto. He alone chooses who goes and who stays. The question
now is, how will Suharto shape the military, and to what ends?

Nations: Taiwan: Remaking the Opposition: The DPP"s new leader takes a
moderate tack 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Todd Crowell and Laurence Eyton Taipei

The Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's largest opposition
force, has fallen on hard times. After fighting two bruising
elections within four months, it has little to show for its
efforts. The DPP's momentum stalled in the legislature polls
last December, and its standard bearer in the island's first
popular presidential contest in March finished a very distant
second to the incumbent, Lee Teng-hui of the Kuomintang. And
if morale is low, the party's financial coffers are even
lower: last month, it could not even meet its payrolls.

DPP partisans hope these problems can be solved, given a
little time and fresh leadership. But it won't be easy to re-
animate the issues that had motivated supporters, not a few of
whom went to prison for their beliefs. Their backing made the
party Taiwan's fastest-growing political group during the
heady days of the early 1990s, when democracy was flowering
after the end of four decades of martial law. Inevitably,
perhaps, tensions and divisions have emerged within the ranks,
prompting some former stalwarts to set up their own party.

The DPP, which holds 51 of the Legislative Yuan's 164 seats,
was founded during martial-law days in the 1980s. In the early
1990s, it called boldly for Taiwan's political independence.
Party leaders also demanded more civil rights for the island's
non-mainlander majority and greater democracy for all. Now, of
course, Taiwan is just about fully democratic. An indigenous
politician occupies the presidency. So the party's ritual call
for independence is looking increasingly like something that
will bring Taiwan little benefit - and much trouble from
China.

The task of turning the DPP's fortunes around falls to Hsu
Hsin-liang, who was elected chairman in June. He replaced Shih
Ming-teh, a key member of the party's hardline pro-
independence faction. Though Hsu has a longstanding reputation
as a dissident - he started his political life with the KMT
but quit the ruling party in 1977 - and has endured exile as
well as a year in prison for his political activities, he
hails from the DPP's moderate wing. He wants to reposition the
party as a more liberal, social democratic, "caring"
alternative to the government.

But first, Hsu has to resolve the DPP's financial crisis. He
says he wants to reschedule debt, negotiate more loans and
raise more money from members. But the DPP may in fact be
banking on government funding of political groups. Hsu is
asking that all parties receive an annual subsidy of NT$100
($3.60) for every vote they won in the last election. "Right
now the situation is unfair," he says. "The KMT has all its
corporate wealth. The other parties have nothing."

Given the Kuomintang's majority - albeit a narrow one - in the
Legislative Yuan, the chances of the opposition pushing
through a political funding bill would seem slim. Yet Hsu has
some leverage. The ruling party is seeking bipartisan support
to break the gridlock that has characterized the current
legislative session. KMT secretary-general Wu Poh-hsiung
called on Hsu recently to seek the opposition chief's
cooperation in passing laws. Hsu's precondition: that his
party obtain some relief from its financial problems.

Hsu denies that he is selling DPP support in return for
passage of the political-financing measure. Rather, he says
that more cooperation, rather than confrontation, would be a
good thing at this stage. "What I want to see is something
like the National Government in Britain during World War II,
where all parties worked together in the face of a big
crisis," Hsu explains. "We have many historical problems, such
as threats from China. The KMT itself is immobilized by its
own money politics and links with gangsters. Given this, only
a coalition can carry out reforms Taiwan needs."

But Hsu's call for enhanced cooperation across the benches has
alienated some of the DPP's purists. One is its former
presidential candidate, Peng Ming-min, who has already left to
form his own Nation-Building Party, which is more aggressively
pro-independence. He and other dissenters claim that there is
little difference now between the KMT's position of
"reunification - sometime" and the Hsu-led DPP's call for
"independence - but not yet." Still, by couching the issue in
vague terms, both are probably in tune with the great majority
of Taiwan's people.

Hsu thinks that his opponents within the party may be fighting
yesterday's battles. "We can't consider the KMT a `colonial'
regime anymore after the presidential election in which Lee
Teng-hui got more than 50% of the vote. The whole political
environment has changed fundamentally, and our party has to
adjust." He hints at the prospect of putting on the back
burner the DPP's core issue - independence. If the party were
to gain power, Hsu suggests, it might not proceed with its
long-promised plebiscite on the matter, at least not
immediately.

Still, the DPP faces the difficult challenge of coming back
from the political wilderness to regain a cutting-edge
relevance among voters. In an evolving, increasingly
sophisticated Taiwan, continuing to wave the banner of
independence may not be the way to do that. Hsu is counting on
doing better with his new emphasis on a "caring society."

Nations: Thailand: A Gateway to Vietnam: Thais debate where next to bridge
the Mekong 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Nakhon Phanom is at the end of the road. A sleepy Thai border
town on the banks of the muddy Mekong river, it is a place
where opportunity is mostly elsewhere. When young people
graduate from school, they generally head to dingy employment
offices to sign up for work in Bangkok or West Asia.
Otherwise, things move slowly. On a recent afternoon, a queue
for the ferry to Laos consisted of five vehicles. One driver
had just missed the boat. No matter. He would sleep patiently
in his cab until morning.

But Nakhon Phanom won't remain the stereotypical backwater for
long, at least not if Santi Kowabootr gets his way. Four years
ago, the town's self-appointed savior cottoned on to an
inescapable fact: the city is a potential gateway to Vietnam
and, most crucially, the South China Sea port at Vinh, 338 km
away. Even back then, there was talk of upgrading the mostly
dirt road across Laos. Santi, a liquor store owner and bus
fleet operator, saw a bridge across the Mekong as the missing
link and resolved to get one built.

"Right now we can trade with Laos only," Santi says, as he
drives his car along dusty red roads to the site of the
proposed span. "There are not many people in Laos, with a
population of 4.8 million. But with a connection to north
Vietnam, we have a market of 32 million." Links are already
growing. Trade between Thailand and Vietnam in 1995 reached
about $500 million, or 0.5% of Thailand's world trade, up from
$142 million in 1991.

Fellow residents are skeptical, but Santi has one very
important reason to be optimistic: Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. The
deputy prime minister wants a bridge there too, and as a
possible contender for the top job in the next Thai
government, he may help Santi get his way. Two years ago,
Chavalit gave up his constituency outside Bangkok for Nakhon
Phanom. The populous northeast is a valuable vote bank for a
would-be premier. Since the switch, Chavalit has been currying
favor with the locals, building roads, hospitals and now - he
hopes - a bridge.

Not so fast. A hundred kilometers downstream, the town elders
of Mukdahan are lobbying hard for their own span, and they
have strong political backing too. The interest is
understandable since the stakes - and opportunities - are
huge. The Mekong is the world's 12th-longest and arguably
least developed major waterway. The river's resource-rich
basin is also home to 229 million people, a market that one
day could rival Europe.

Who will pay for the infrastructure needs in the largely
underdeveloped region? That has yet to be worked out, but
there have been some encouraging signs. Under the aegis of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), plans for some $22 billion worth
of roads, rails, dams and airports have been hatched for the
river basin. And last week, delegates from the six Mekong
nations of China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and
Vietnam met in the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming for
the latest in a string of meetings held since 1992. The
neighbors are trying hard to cooperate. Their challenge is to
find a mutually beneficial strategy to develop a complex and
fragile region that until recently was best-known for jungle
firefights and khaki commerce.

Nakhon Phanom and Mukdahan are competing to be the first
commercial hub of what the ADB calls the East-West Corridor
from Thailand through Laos to Vietnam. Four new routes are
planned along existing (and largely unpaved) roads: Routes 8,
9, 12 and 18 (see map, opposite). Once open, they will provide
major opportunities for trade between Thailand and Vietnam, as
well as give landlocked Laos access to the sea. If the more
starry-eyed planners have their way, new asphalt could one day
run clear through Myanmar, shaving hours or days off the
journey from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean.

It is easy to see why Santi is in love with the idea of a
bridge. "Developing a trade route to Vietnam is not only
important for Nakhon Phanom," he says. "It is also important
for the whole of northeast Thailand." The problem is that
Bangkok-centric politicians and business types have long
ignored Isan, as the impoverished region is known.

With prosperity around the corner, Isan residents rarely talk
about what is good for Laos - and Vientiane's aging socialists
have noticed. Only now emerging from decades of economic
isolation, Laos has been wary of opening up to foreign
influences too quickly. Sandwiched between two powerful
neighbors bent on expanding bilateral trade, the Laotians hold
some good cards, and they are no longer shying away from the
gaming table. Last month, Vientiane announced that before the
end of the year tourists and business people will be able to
obtain visas on arrival. Local residents on both sides of the
Mekong can now move relatively freely across the border. And
in an important breakthrough, Laos indicated at a recent ADB
transport forum that it was considering fully opening its
borders.

Even so, cross-river commerce promises to be complicated, at
least in the short run. Under one scenario, Thai trucks would
have to unload in Laos once they have crossed the Mekong from
Nakhon Phanom. Laotian or Vietnamese carriers would take over
from there. Impractical yes, but in theory all parties
benefit. Such an arrangement would help Laotians believe their
country was not merely a Thai highway.

Eventually, Thai and Laotian goods could be shipped from
Vietnamese ports. This would be an incalculable boon to
traders based in Nakhon Phanom. One wood exporter now sends
Laotian logs to Bangkok, then on to Singapore, where finally
they sail to the U.S. With a new road, says the firm's
expatriate manager, "We would only be faced with a short trip
to a deep-sea port in Vietnam and then we could ship direct to
the States."

The north Vietnam market - and the Laotians' demand for a
short Vientiane-to-Vietnam route - make Nakhon Phanom a strong
contender. With construction on Route 8 expected to finish
within a year, Vietnam-bound Thai goods may soon roll through
Laos. But a bridge at Nakhon Phanom is probably not on the
immediate horizon. Pramaul Khuntri, proprietor of the
optimistically named Windsor Hotel, is candidly pessimistic:
"It could take as much as five years," she says. Or longer.
After the Friendship Bridge linking the northern Thai town of
Nong Khai with Vientiane was completed in 1994, planners
turned to other potential sites, and Mukdahan, not Nakhon
Phanom, was touted as the best place to start.

Politics played a part in making the town the frontrunner. One
local MP is a Democrat and the bridge was greenlighted when
party leader Chuan Leekpai was prime minister. As well, the
Laotian finance minister hails from Savannakhet, on the Lao
side of the river. And ADB officials insist that there are
practical reasons for Mukdahan getting a bridge before its
upstream rival. "They're constantly having to dredge the river
to allow ferries to cross [at Mukdahan]," says Preben Nielsen,
an ADB economist. During the dry season, passage is even more
arduous.

Moreover, Mukdahan is fast emerging as a trading hub. Perhaps
200 trucks cross by ferry each day, and last year the town
exported some $71 million worth of goods to Laos and Vietnam.
By contrast, Nakhon Phanom exports amounted to some $24
million, and most went to Laos. On the agenda at last week's
Kunming meeting was an upgrade of Route 9, which runs through
Laos from Savannakhet (opposite Mukdahan) to link with the
Vietnamese port at Danang. Barring delays, an all-weather
Route 9 will open in 2003; the bridge in 2001.

The boosters of a span for Nakhon Phanom are hardly giving up.
One of their oft-cited arguments is that their town is 154 km
closer by road to Vietnamese ports than is Mukdahan. In
addition to Route 8, there are also plans to upgrade Route 12,
which would provide a direct link to a new Vietnamese port at
Vung Ang, south of Vinh. But the upgrade will take time. Route
12 is still a dirt track, and a hilly one at that.

A bridge at Nakhon Phanom seems inevitable - especially since
the Laotians are eager for Route 8, which would provide
Vientiane's new capitalists quick access to ports at Vinh and
Vung Ang. And Thai officials and ADB planners insist that the
question is not if, but when.

Standing at the site of the planned bridge outside Nakhon
Phanom, Santi gazes across at the verdant, unspoiled hills of
Laos. Even he finds it is hard to imagine a four-lane highway
and bridge cutting through this idyllic spot where water
buffalo currently outnumber cargo trucks. He chuckles: "If
Chavalit becomes prime minister he can build a bridge at
Nakhon Phanom tomorrow or next year. If not, maybe we won't
have a bridge for 10 years." Not surprisingly, the town has a
backup plan: more ferries. Which would mean more trucks. Even
without a bridge, Nakhon Phanom could well vault past its
rival.

Nations: Philippines: "Just and Lasting Peace": What the president wants
for Mindanao 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Fidel Ramos first met MNLF leader Nur Misuari when then-
president Corazon Aquino forged a ceasefire with the Muslim
separatists in Sulu in September 1986. At the time, Ramos was
Aquino's armed forces chief, in charge of crushing the
insurgency. Last week, Misuari signed an accord to bring an
end to the 24-year-long war. President Ramos recently talked
with Senior Correspondent Antonio Lopez about his hopes for
peace in the region. Excerpts:

What is the Southern Philippine Council for Peace and
Development?

The SPCPD is not a regional government. It is not a governing
authority. It has no lawmaking power. It has no power over
local government units. Neither will it have control over the
local police and military. The SPCPD is neither an autonomous
region nor a political subdivision of government. It is simply
a transitory administrative arm under the control and
supervision of the president. Its powers and functions are an
extension of the powers of the president.

What is your vision for Mindanao?

Our vision for Mindanao is three-fold: First, to remove from
the southern Philippines the roots of dissidence, injustice,
and inequity which gave rise to separatist movements,
rebellions and the 25-year-old condition of instability.
Second, we foresee Mindanao as a very progressive social,
economic and political component of the Philippines. Mindanao
has certain advantages in terms of its proximity to the more
progressive countries of ASEAN, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore and Brunei. The third aspect consists of bringing up
all of the people of Mindanao - Christians, Muslims, and
Lumads or indigenous people - to a level of development
already achieved by many, many Filipinos in the Visayas and in
Luzon, so that together, all Filipinos can be truly
competitive in the 21st century.

Why did you negotiate a deal with Misuari?

On day one of my administration, I called on radical
insurgents to give up their armed struggle. Our goal is a
just, comprehensive, peaceful and lasting resolution of the
internal armed conflict that has cost the nation and our
people so dearly.

What do you think of Misuari?

He is not an ordinary revolutionary. He is a man with a
statesmanlike vision to perform his mission for his people. He
has gone through the various stages of armed struggle, but now
I see him turning to a peaceful, legal, constitutional
struggle through elections. I also see him as a very deep-
thinking intellectual who is also pragmatic, in that he can
negotiate and be flexible in order to forge a solution to a
very difficult and complex problem. Lastly, I see him as a
very admirable leader. He has not veered from his cause to
bring Muslims in the Philippines a better life.

What happens to the three other separatist groups, the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, the Islamic Command Council and the
Abu Sayyaf?

We will continue to work with the MILF with regard to a
ceasefire. Talk of a ceasefire has been going on for quite
some time. I am optimistic about these talks. The ICC and the
Abu Sayyaf are different. They first have to forgo violence
and terrorism.

Nations: Philippines: The Anatomy of a Deal: How Ramos"s government and
Muslim rebels made peace in Mindanao 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Tim Healy and Antonio Lopez Manila

Back in 1968, Nur Misuari was not much for niceties. The 27-
year-old student firebrand staged a nine-day protest in front
of Malaca-ang Palace demanding the ouster of then-president
Ferdinand Marcos. Not long after, he barged uninvited into
Marcos's office to seek - successfully, as it turned out - the
release from prison of an ailing Muslim rebel leader.

Last week, Misuari was back in Malaca-ang, but under
substantially different circumstances. The rebel chief of the
Moro National Liberation Front was the star at the dramatic
signing Sept. 2 of a peace accord with President Fidel Ramos's
government, ending a 24-year rebellion on the southern island
of Mindanao.

Some 120,000 people - half from the ranks of the MNLF - have
died in the secessionist struggle. The government has spent at
least $3 billion prosecuting the war. Misuari told Asiaweek:
"The first time I came to Malaca-ang was for the cause of one
man's freedom; the second time is for the cause of peace."
Replied Ramos: "Today we are all victors - triumphant over war
and violence."

Ramos and Misuari, one a West Point military man who rose to
become president, the other a former university professor and
onetime Maoist, could hardly say enough good things about each
other. Ramos's eyes moistened as Misuari asked the 1,500
guests at the signing to rise in the president's honor.
"Without your boldness and heroism, we would not have reached
this far," said the rebel to the president.

Both men have a sizable stake in the accord. Neither of
Ramos's two predecessors, Marcos or Corazon Aquino, were able
to achieve a permanent peace, despite years of effort. Ramos
had to overcome opposition from the Christian majorities in
southern Mindanao, who do not trust the MNLF or Misuari. Ramos
hopes to win them over with his economic development plans for
the region (see interview, p. 22).

For Misuari, who founded the MNLF in 1968, signing meant
settling for something short of his original goal of self-
government. During the negotiations, which began in Jakarta in
October 1993, Misuari frequently came under attack from
compatriots who said he was selling out. "I was tiptoeing on
barbed wire," he recalls.

The treaty creates a Special Zone of Peace and Development
encompassing 14 provinces and nine cities. Overseeing
development in the area will be the Southern Philippine
Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD), to be headed by
Misuari or a hand-picked ally. The five-member council, which
comes under the Office of the President, will not have
lawmaking powers, but will be able to channel much-needed
development funds to the region. After three years, the member
provinces and cities will be asked to vote on a fully
autonomous government.

As part of the deal, Ramos's Lakas-NUCD party is backing
Misuari in the Sept. 9 election for governor of the Autonomous
Region for Muslim Mindanao. The ARMM comprises the four small,
mostly Muslim provinces that chose autonomy in a 1989
plebiscite.

During the three years of formal talks, Manila and the MNLF
clashed over what kind of administrative system should be
installed in southern Mindanao. Misuari originally demanded a
10-year provisional government; Manila's chief negotiator,
retired four-star Gen. Manuel Yan, offered one year. Misuari
compromised on five years and Manila came up to two. The talks
stalled at that point. Then, Libya and Indonesia intervened to
get negotiations back on track. Indonesia was especially
helpful, says Ramos. At the signing ceremony, the president
lauded the Indonesian delegation as "the best negotiators in
the world." Misuari and Yan eventually settled on a three-year
transitional council.

But what form would the council take? In 1994 and 1995, the
two sides agreed on 123 items, including how MNLF forces would
be integrated into the Philippine military. But they could not
settle on a structure for the transitional body. Misuari
objected to a plebiscite, which the Muslims could lose in the
Christian areas, but Manila insisted that the Constitution
required a vote. Talks recessed at the end of 1995.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas credits Ramos for the
breakthrough: "It was President Ramos's idea for the Council
for Peace and Development that broke the deadlock." The
proposal, which actually originated with Ramos's chief of
staff, Ruben Torres, was to create a non-elected government
body or regional development council, already authorized by
the Constitution.

Senior Indonesian diplomat Wiryono Sastrohandojo sold the idea
to the MNLF. Barging into a private meeting, he told the
rebels: "The SPCPD will have powers derived from the Office of
the President. It is derivative power, but power just the
same. What is important is you will have money for
development." Eventually, the MNLF agreed.

Now it is up to Misuari to make it work. Not all Muslim groups
have signed on. The foremost holdouts are the 15,000-strong
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the 500-man Abu
Sayyaf terrorist group. Misuari believes he can win over the
first: "I maintain contacts with my brothers in the MILF." And
the other? "The only problem is the Abu Sayyaf. I will try to
reach out to them to convince them to join us in this
experiment." After 24 years of bloodshed, Filipinos can only
hope that he will succeed.

Editorials: JUST DO IT: Japan should cut the excuses and legalize the pill


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

When oral contraceptives were developed in the 1960s, Japan's
government banned them, saying they had unhealthy side effects
and promoted sexual promiscuity. With the advent of the low-
dosage pill, another pretext was needed - and conveniently
found in the spread of AIDS. Legalizing the pill, of course,
might discourage the use of protective condoms. When that
argument began to wear thin, Japanese health officials
discovered another excuse in a claim by a British medical
journal that oral contraceptives might be slightly conducive
to blood clotting.

One way or another, Japan's guardians of public health and
morals have found reasons to limit the birth-control choices
of its women. As a result, Japan shares the dubious
distinction, with North Korea, of being the only countries to
proscribe the sale of oral contraceptives. Only in recent
months have there been signs that Tokyo might consider
changing course and legalizing the pill. What Japanese
authorities should do, as soon as possible, is to wind up the
endless debate - and just do it.

A key catalyst has been the appointment of a new health and
welfare minister. Unlike his predecessors, Mr. Kan Naoto seems
inclined to listen more to consumers than to special-interest
groups. That suggests change may finally be at hand. Indeed,
an ethos is emerging in Japan that citizens, rather than
bureaucrats, should be their own guardians. However,
formidable opposition remains. Some health officials seem to
have gone out of their way to undercut their minister's
reformist positions. More pertinently, powerful commercial
interests object to legalization.

Chief among them are the country's condom-makers, who
obviously want to forestall competition from the pill. With
Japan the world's top consumer of prophylactics, they ply a
lucrative trade. Aligned with them are the nation's
physicians, who think that the unrestricted sale of the pill
would cut into their highly profitable abortion practices. The
doctors, overwhelmingly male, are organized by the Japan
Medical Association. Longtime supporters of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, they exert considerable influence on the
policymaking process.

Their maneuvers have not been balanced by any strong movement
to legalize the pill by women's organizations or family
planners. In Japan, unwanted pregnancies is hardly a burning
issue. In fact, the nation worries more about its falling
birthrate, which some people think is the real, if unstated,
reason that the government has been reluctant to legalize the
pill. By some estimates, only 10% of women would choose the
pill over other methods if it were made legitimate - though
even that would be a big boost from the 1% now using it under
a legal loophole.

If there is no clamor to legalize the pill, why do it? There
are several good reasons. The unavailability of oral
contraceptives is one factor behind Japan's unusually high
abortion rate. About 350,000 women choose to abort every year,
most of them because of unwanted pregnancies rather than
economic pressures or fear of giving birth to a malformed
child. There are virtually no legal barriers to abortion and,
on the surface at least, few religious or moral strictures
either.

But abortions are cause for deep personal disquiet in Japan,
as they are anywhere else. The evidence lies in the thousands
of tiny statues to "water babies" - memorials to aborted
fetuses - that dot the nation's cemeteries. And though
abortions are performed by licensed practitioners, the surgery
is not entirely without risk. By encouraging more abortions
than would otherwise be performed, the restrictions on the
pill add unnecessarily to the health hazards facing Japanese
women.

Moreover, about 200,000 women use oral contraceptives under a
loophole that allows doctors to prescribe them as a means of
regulating menstrual disorders. Yet the only one permitted is
the old-style high-dosage, high-hormone variety. That means
the women who really are using the pill only to avoid
conception are also subjected to risks unnecessarily. Japan is
a major contributor to family planning organizations around
the world. By banning in its domestic market one of the most
commonly used methods of contraception, Tokyo lays itself open
to charges that it callously dumps pharmaceuticals in
developing countries that it considers "dangerous" at home.

Even so, the most powerful argument is that legalizing the
pill gives women additional control over their own
reproductive lives. In the three decades since the advent of
oral contraceptives, the world has had ample time to
understand that their benefits far outweigh their
disadvantages. The decision on whether to use them should rest
with individual citizens. Japanese authorities have run out of
excuses.

Editorials: JUDGING THE PAST: Nascent democracies must beware the perils of
score-settling 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Mr. Paul Bell, a South African journalist, likes to recall how
he once bumped into Rev. Desmond Tutu in a shopping mall.
Almost without thinking, he thrust his young daughter into the
bishop's arms. "Please bless my child," asked Mr. Bell. Rev.
Tutu readily complied. "I couldn't tell you why I did that,"
says Mr. Bell. "I just wanted my child to have that
beneficence bestowed on her." Actually, his instinctive
response is entirely understandable. Rev. Tutu's ethical
stature makes nearly irresistible the opportunity to receive
his blessing. The Nobel Peace Prizewinner has been chairing
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which
serves as both confessor to sinners in the nation's past
apartheid brutality as well as therapist to its victims.

Note well the touchstones of Rev. Tutu's organization: truth
and reconciliation. Then consider the recent court verdict in
South Korea, in which two former presidents, tried at the
behest of their onetime political ally, President Kim Young
Sam, were convicted of treason and manslaughter. Mr. Chun Doo
Hwan was sentenced to death, and Mr. Roh Tae Woo to more than
two decades in jail. And think about developments in
Bangladesh, where the government of Sheikh Hasina Wajed has
implicated the slain husband of the prime minister's chief
political rival after a vigorous inquiry into the 1975
assassination of her father, founding PM Mujibur Rahman. It
seems unlikely Mr. Kim or Sheikh Hasina will be asked to bless
babies anytime soon.

With the onset of democratic reform, governments around the
world are faced with the question of how to deal with unsavory
pasts. Take Eastern Europe. Shortly after Romania threw out
communism in 1989, the nation's new leaders tried, convicted
and executed Nicolae Ceausescu for crimes committed during his
24-year reign of terror. Ex-dissident Vaclav Havel chose a
gentler approach when he became president of the Czech
Republic. He advocated that those convicted of past human-
rights abuses be barred from civil service jobs.

The line between justice and vengeance can be fine indeed.
After Mrs. Corazon Aquino became president of the Philippines,
many expected Mrs. Imelda Marcos to be nailed by a probe into
the 1983 assassination of Mr. Benigno ("Ninoy") Aquino. Mrs.
Aquino had long contended that President Ferdinand Marcos and
his wife were behind her husband's dramatic murder at Manila
airport. But the rule of law prevailed. Mrs. Marcos was
cleared for lack of incriminating evidence. By accepting the
court ruling, Mrs. Aquino refuted allegations that she was
bent on a personal vendetta.

It would, of course, have been understandable if Mrs. Aquino
wanted to avenge her husband's murder. Similarly, Sheikh
Hasina's zeal to gain justice for her father - even in the
face of a constitutional provision granting pardon to the
perpetrators - might be excused in different circumstances.
But Mrs. Aquino was bound by a higher standard to allow the
Philippine judicial system to determine Mrs. Marcos's guilt or
innocence. In the same way, the Bangladesh Constitution is not
a document to be changed at the whim of an incumbent prime
minister, however personally wronged.

In the quest to determine how to deal with transgressions from
the past, a society must take the law as its starting point.
And if statutes are found inadequate or outdated, they should
be changed through legally constituted channels - but not
applied retroactively. Above all, legal justice must be
dispensed evenly, not shaped to scoop up specific victims. It
is not a tool to be used by those in power.

This will surely have occurred to President Kim. He is
constitutionally barred from seeking a second term when his
current one expires in 1998. That means he will soon be in a
similar position to Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh, before their arrests
late last year. He might hope that his successor is more than
a friend, for his own friendship with Mr. Roh counted for
little during the latter's travails. Korea may need a new
president who is willing to take on a system that condones
illegal activities such as bribe-taking, rather than simply
gunning for individual bribe-takers and ignoring the
fundamental problem. In short, the country needs someone
unlike Mr. Kim.

What would such an approach mean for the hundreds of
demonstrators killed in Kwangju 16 years ago? Should no one in
power be held accountable? Can the living forgive on behalf of
the dead? The simple answers are yes, there should be
accountability, and no, forgiveness cannot be bestowed in
absentia. If he pardons the two ex-rulers, Mr. Kim is likely
to come in for much criticism. But, for a number of important
reasons, that would be the right thing to do.

Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh have been rightly tagged with serious
wrongdoings - truths recorded for posterity. But blame for
even the worst offenses rarely rests on just one person. Who
were Mr. Chun's accomplices in the Kwangju crackdown, and to
what extent were they involved? And how many, actually, were
killed? The trial failed to shed light on these key aspects,
squandering perhaps a historic opportunity to do so. If the
government had established such truths, it would have done
much more to put the incident to rest than by staging a trial
whose outcome always seemed predetermined.

Then there are practical considerations. Pursuing truth and
justice may mean a chance to lay ghosts to rest through a
public catharsis. But what about the costs? If the United
States had not intervened in 1986 to spirit Mr. Marcos out of
Malaca-ang Palace to Hawaii, civil war could have erupted in
the Philippines. Those who wanted to hold Marcos fully
accountable for abuses under martial-law rule were denied the
opportunity to punish him accordingly. But consider the gains:
large-scale conflict was averted, the strongman was gone for
good - and a popular uprising succeeded, without shedding
blood.

In the wake of the South Korean verdict, Myanmar's ruling
junta must be wondering whether it would ever be smart to cede
power, even incrementally, to democrats without a bloody
fight. Similar thoughts must have occurred to close associates
of Indonesia's Suharto family while contemplating the
consequences if their benefactor ever lost political
authority. Vengeful score-settling only reinforces the natural
reluctance of autocrats to share power or undertake democratic
reform. And while the Kwangju survivors have no real
obligation to consider how their pursuit of justice might
affect others, it is the responsibility of elected leaders,
like Mr. Kim, to do so. Besides, every system of government
has its winners and losers. It would be inimical to a nation's
stability as well as its broader interests if new winners were
constantly to re-evaluate those they replaced, turning their
predecessors into new losers - a vicious cycle.

In the end, governments must always keep their attention
focused more on the present and the future than on the past.
Bangladesh has one of Asia's lowest per-capita GDPs and faces
such monumental challenges as feeding its people, developing
viable industries and raising literacy levels. Can it afford
to have its leaders doggedly pursuing decades-old
assassinations? In South Korea, the rampant corruption that
helped fell Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh highlighted longstanding
malpractices. The Seoul government would more productively
spend its energy and resources tackling their root causes than
pursuing further redress for past wrongs. As Rev. Tutu would
probably agree, once the truth has been established, a nation
should move on to reconciliation. Down that path lies
progress.

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

PILOT PROGRAM Cathay Pacific has flown into the future by
graduating its first woman pilot. Candy Wu Suk Fun decided she
wanted to fly the big birds when she was an engineering
student at Hong Kong University. Says the 24-year-old second
officer: "I don't see any difference between me and a man
pilot." Other Asian airlines have held a similar view for many
years. Chinese, Indian and Philippine carriers all have women
flyers. For now, Wu will be a relief pilot on long-haul
flights. She won't make captain for at least eleven years. By
then, Cathay will probably have more women pilots. Given Hong
Kong's 1997 handover to China, expect mainlanders to number
among them.

MONEY TALKS Donald Tsang Yam Kuen's message to George Soros
is: back off. Hong Kong's financial secretary has warned the
billionaire investor not to bet against the territory's
dollar. In 1992, Soros helped force the British pound out of
Eu-rope's Exchange Rate Mechanism by successfully speculating
it would be devalued. Tsang, 51, told Bloomberg news agency
Soros's people have been informed that Hong Kong would
vigorously defend its currency's U.S. dollar peg: "We showed
them our bank account." It includes the Exchange Fund, holding
nearly $60 billion. That sort of money even Soros would
respect.

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

PARTY ON Three years ago, maverick MP Hatoyama Yukio, whom
many Japanese regard as a fresh, bold kind of leader, helped
form the Sakigake party to shake up local politics. While it
plays a gadfly role in the ruling coalition, Hatoyama, the
subject of an Asiaweek cover story in May, is not satisfied.
The immaculately pedigreed son of a former foreign minister
and grandson of an ex-PM is setting up a new party - yet to be
named - to re-launch his crusade against business and the
bureaucracy. Ideals - and money - keep Hatoyama, 49, going. A
multimillionaire, he is one of Japan's wealthiest politicians.
Reform may be Hatoyama's catch-cry, but to achieve it, he
cannot do without an old-style war chest.

Balance of Power Hydroelectric power is controversial. While

environment in other ways. But most countries have decided
that the pluses outweigh the minuses. They are generating

CUTTING EDGE: How to Meet a Shark and Live to Tell 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

For people who do not subscribe to the conviction that the
only good shark is a dead one, here comes the Protective
Oceanic Device (POD). It is the environmentally safe way to
avoid dangerous encounters with sharks without having to kill
them. Developed by South Africa's Natal Sharks Board, the
battery-powered POD costs a little less than $1,000 and
consists of three parts. The main section is strapped to a
diver's aqualung, the pad to one of the fins, and the control
is hand-held. The POD unit functions by generating an ultra-
mild electrical current that works against sensors in a
shark's snout which normally pick up the electrical emissions
of prey. The device creates a sort of force field around the
diver, repelling a shark from a distance of four to seven
meters. Though the POD works well for recreational divers, it
is probably more useful as a tool for researchers who want to
mingle with the beasts. It was successfully tested by two
documentary film makers swimming with sharks in tanks as well
as in the open sea. The Natal Sharks Board is working on
adapting the units for swimmers, surfboards, canoes and even
lifejackets.

Update: Justice Delayed: The year 1984 was one of great upheaval for India


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The year 1984 was one of great upheaval for India. The then
prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered troops into the Golden
Temple to flush out militants holed up inside Sikhdom's
holiest shrine, sparking outrage among believers worldwide. A
few months later, two of Gandhi's Sikh bodyguards gunned her
down. In retaliation, predominantly Hindu mobs slaughtered
nearly 3,000 Sikhs in Delhi alone. Now, 12 years later, 89 men
- among the last originally held for the bloodletting - have
each been sentenced to five years in jail. The defendants, out
on bail all this time, were convicted of lesser charges of
damaging property and violating curfews because of insufficent
evidence. Judge S.N. Dhingra blamed "a lack of concern by the
administration and the courts" for the long delay.

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

It is often inappropriate to compare prominent personalities
in one country to those in another, not least because
cultures, backgrounds and motivations are usually different.
But that has not stopped Lt.-Gen. Syar-wan Hamid of the
Indonesian army, still rabidly chasing "subversive elements"
for causing Jakarta's July 27 riots. Syarwan says opposition
politician Megawati Sukar-noputri fancies herself as the local
Cory Aquino, while an ally, Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid,
is Jaime Cardinal Sin, referring to two key players of the
1986 Philippine "People Power" revolution. Wahid's rebuttal:
Syarwan should take the parallels further - by naming whom the
Indonesian Marcos would be. The answer is obvious, even if the
question is perhaps unfair. But the general asked for it.

FRONTLINES: Encountering Cyberstatic 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Recent heavy rains in Hanoi have not only caused chaos in the
streets but confusion in cyberspace as well. Subscribers of
Vietnam's only public e-mail service Netnam, managed by the
state-run Institute of Information Technology, have reported
difficulties sending and receiving international messages. The
foul weather has indeed disrupted basic services, but some
users also suspect a sinister hand at work. The alleged
culprit: the state telephone monopoly, Viet-nam Post &
Telecommunications, which has been agitating for an exclusive
license to run Internet services in the country.

Because officials have turned down VNPT's repeated requests,
some users be-lieve it is sending static down lines tapped by
Netnam subscribers. One subscriber claims oscilloscopes
connected to the lines show inexplicable signals whenever Net-
nam is accessed. Suspicions also mounted after the e-mail
provider sent a message to subscribers saying nothing appeared
to be wrong with its equipment. Netnam says it does not know
what is causing the problem, which means Vietnam's
cybercommunity will have to continue weathering the storms.
Both of them.

FRONTLINES: Democratic Bridge to Beijing? 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

As Hong Kong's transition to 1997 quickens, the thaw between
China and its local nemesis, the popular Democratic Party, is
gaining momentum. Both sides are making cautiously
conciliatory statements in public. Early last month, Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in-vited the Democrats to
participate in the Selection Committee, a 400-strong body
whose responsibility is to choose Hong Kong's first post-1997
chief executive and provisional legislature. Though their
reply was no, the Democrats said they were willing to hold a
dialogue with Beijing on other transition issues. Qian said
fine, but stressed that joining the Committee would improve
the atmosphere.

The mood is already much better. Party sources say that
preparations are already under way for two of the group's
stalwarts, chairman Martin Lee Chu Ming (pictured) and vice-
chairman Yeung Sum, to travel to Beijing in the near future.
Apparently, both sides have agreed in principle to such a
trip. Indeed, the buzz in the territory is that a ranking
member of the party has already been to the Chinese capital.

The Democrats have little problem with the Selection Committee
picking Hong Kong's future leader, but the party has long said
it will not participate in the entire process because it
considers the interim lawmaking assembly illegal. Beijing's
latest compromise proposal to the Democrats is: join the
Committee and abstain from voting on the provisional
legislature - so long as you do not openly continue to oppose
its creation. With public opinion in Hong Kong running
strongly in favor of Democratic participation in the selection
body, the party faces a tough - and potentially divisive -
decision.

ASIAWEEK: LETTERS & COMMENTS: 13 September 1996 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

I find your hagiographic article about 20 days in the life of
the bombastic Sri Lanka president, Chandrika Kumaratunga
["Under Seige," Cover Story, Aug. 23] somewhat disingenuous.
Her actions do not reflect her apparent high-mindedness about
human rights and justice. Her peace-through-war strategy has
caused innumerable sufferings to the Tamil civilians of the
north and east of Sri Lanka. Her willingness to gloss over
this human tragedy and to let the Sri Lankan armed forces
prosecute the war with unparalleled brutality and impunity has
only deepened the ethnic chasm in Sri Lanka.

The latest Amnesty International report on Sri Lanka slams her
government for its tolerance of continuing human rights
abuses. Perhaps, president Kumaratunga should reevaluate her
concept of human rights and justice for the sake of
alleviating the misery of thousands and thousands of innocent
Sri Lankans.

E. S. Anton, Ph.D.

New Haven, Conn.

U.S.A.

Ron Gluckman had erroneously failed to record President
Chandrika Kumaratunga's determination to restore civilian life
and rehabilitate the war-ravaged North. In June, the President
unveiled an ambitious plan to raise money from foreign
countries to restore the Jaffna region. The plan envisages the
rebuilding of roads, re-equipping of schools, creation of
farms, restoration of postal and telecommunications services,
and so forth. The plan is expected to cost about $274 million.

But equally determined are the Tamil Tigers to sabotage the
rehabilitation work  as demonstrated when a suicide bomber
killed 23 and injured 60 others including the Minister for
Construction.

P.A. Samaraweera

Darwin, Australia

Prabhakaran, Cont'd

Sachi Sri Kantha's observations [LETTERS, Aug. 16] amused me a
great deal. That Anthony Davis did "a good profile" of
Prabhakaran hinges on what was intended. Reading between the
lines, the aims and goals of transnational "Tiger Inc." are
violence, murder and sudden death. I do not think the article
would have earned the ire of the Sri Lankan government in
particular. They would have welcomed it.

Mr. Sri Kantha latches on to the statement, "Prabhakaran's
acumen is as much that of a CEO as of a military commander."
One is reminded of a GI's comment about General "Blood and
Guts" Patton: "His guts and our blood."

Mr. Sri Kantha must have a very fertile imagination to claim
that the profile of Prabhakaran differs but little from those
of George Washington, Mao, Begin and Arafat. As far as Begin
is concerned, the parallel seems correct. It would be an
insult to the others and to Nelson Mandela to associate them
with Prabhakaran.

Mr. Sri Kantha has failed to mention the true Asian
revolutionary, Ho Chi Minh, whose thesis was to "work the
socialist revolution through the nationalist aspirations" of
the people. And in Ho's lexicon, nationalism was not the
racist dogma that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has in
its lessons of indoctrination to very young students or in the
oath of hate taken at the commencement of daily parades.

How can he compare the military spending of the LTTE with that
of the Sri Lankan government? The government of Sri Lanka is a
legitimately elected government, whereas the LTTE's is, de
facto, a rogue or outlaw organization. If, as Mr. Sri Kantha
maintains, the LTTE embodies the genuine aspirations of the
Sri Lanka Tamils, why is it then that they have dungeons in
which those thought to be opponents, and those who have
refused to contribute in kind or in money under coercion, are
incarcerated and tortured? Amnesty International has
documented evidence of this as have the University Teachers
for Human Rights (Jaffna).

Mahathir for the U.N.

I would like to bring your attention to the fact that former
United Nations Secretary General U Thant of Burma was not a
cabinet minister as you mentioned. ["The Asian Factor in the
U.N. Race," FRONTLINES, Aug. 23]. He was merely a parliament
secretary in the Ministry of Information in the government of
the late U Nu, the last elected civilian prime minister of
Burma. In 1952 U Thant became a Burmese delegate to the U.N.
and five years later became the country's permanent
representative.

You also forgot to mention the most outstanding potential
candidate, one who is capable of doing the job of Secretary
General efficiently, with a proven record of building the
nation to prosperity: PM Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia.

What Comes after Having It All

I refer to "How to Know You Have It All" [NATIONS, Sept. 6].
As a Singapore citizen who had worked his guts out and came
close to karoshi [a Japanese term for sudden death from
overwork] through his 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s, to eventually
attain the 5Cs [Cash or career; Credit cards, Car, Condo,
Country club membership] cleanly (no mortgage or other debt),
I wonder whether young Singaporeans are aware that what comes
after they have made the 5Cs are the 5 Ds: Decay (hair and
teeth), Disability (worsening myopia, arthritis, etc.),
Disease (clogging of arteries, cancer, gout), Depression
(boredom from not working) and finally Death.

There is more. When you have finally attained the last D, you
have a choice of the 3Es: `Eaven (heaven), `Ell (hell) or
Extinction (if you do not believe in the first two Es).

Mike Chan, 55

Singapore

CORRECTION  Our story "The Billionaires' Binge" [BUSINESS,
Aug. 23] mistakenly said that Singapore's Fraser and Neave has
Coca-Cola bottling franchises in Myanmar, among other
Southeast Asian countries. Though F&N Coca-Cola has soft drink
operations in eight Asian countries in all, Myanmar is not one
of them. Furthermore, the company has no current plans to
enter the country. Asiaweek regrets the error.

Toxin law case ends in defeat: Worker pledges to press on with her
three-year battle

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

Thaksina Khaikaew and Chakrit Ridmontri

A woman's three-year battle against a former employer she blames for
aluminium poisoning was thrown out by the Central Labour Court yesterday.

The verdict ended a case that symbolised a fight for justice by an
ordinary worker against a multi-national with government backing.

In 1993, Mayuree Taevivat filed a six-million-baht damages action against
Electro Ceramics (Thailand) Co, a Thai-Japanese venture in Lamphun.

Mrs Mayuree, who started work at the Electro Ceramics plant in the
Lamphun industrial estate, said she had been exposed to aluminium dust
for five years.

Handing down its ruling, the court said Mrs Mayuree had failed to prove
alumina dust was the cause of her illnesses. It ruled the company, which
produces electronic parts and components, was not obliged to compensate
her because it had been entitled to terminate her employment after she
had been absent for more than six months.

Five years after beginning work at the plant, Mrs Mayuree suffered body
pain and headaches. Tests at Chiang Mai's McCormic Hospital established
she had been exposed to chemical poisoning.

Some 13 workers have died of suspected chemical poisoning in Lamphun but
the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand contends they died of Aids.

After the verdict, a tearful Mrs Mayuree said she would appeal. Mr
Praphan, her husband, said the family had accumulated more than 300,000
baht in medical bills.

He said his family was waging a lone battle against a big corporation.
None of their neighbours, who work at the estate, dared lend them support
for fear of losing their jobs.

The authority is cooperating with the SSPA Maritime Consulting Co of
Sweden on an environmental risk assessment in electronics plants at the
Lamphun estate.

The study, funded by Sweden's International Development Cooperation
Agency, aims to identify the risks so appropriate safety measures can be
introduced. Factories will assist the study.

Ingemar Palsson, of SSPA, said the assessment is focusing on factors that
may have adverse effects on workers. After the assessment, he said,
safety measures would be introduced.

Mr Palsson said safety measures must comply with legal standards and must
be acceptable to the workforce.

Environmental risks in the electronics industry mostly concern solder and
cleaning work. Soldering, which involves melting lead to connect
electronic components on circuit boards, produces toxic fumes that are
extremely hazardous to health. Cleaning involves solvents that are also
toxic.

Kasemsri Homchean, director of the authority's Environment and Safety
Control Division, confirmed that the assessments would be carried out
soon but said it was up to factories to decide if they were to adopt
prescribed measures.

Factories that adopt the recommendations would manage their own
environmental management performance, he said. It could be a stepping
stone towards environmental management under ISO 14000, he added.

Help sought in condo scam

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

Over a hundred people in Pathum Thani are in debt to Siam City Bank for
failing to make mortgage payments for condominium units they did not buy.

They sought help yesterday from the Office of Civil Rights Protection and
Legal Aid.

One of them, Arunee Vijitkraisri, 55, said the bank is demanding that she
repay a loan plus 19% annual interest, adding up to 476,107 baht.

Otherwise it will ask the court to confiscate the unit she is alleged to
have bought at Maitreekij Estate Co's MT Condominium in Thanyaburi.

But Mrs Arunee said she did not buy the condo or apply for a mortgage
from the bank.

She said she had been told by a broker, Somchai Kulhiransawat, that she
would be paid 2,000 baht by Maitreekij Estate Co for helping to reserve
a unit of its project.

As her husband makes only 4,500 baht a month to feed six mouths, Mrs
Arunee said she and her four children agreed.

Her family and neighbours went with Mr Somchai to Thanyaburi Land Office.

Officials there asked her to sign some documents. Mrs Arunee, who is
illiterate, said she did not know what the documents were about.

She was then paid 2,000 baht. Her four children also reserved four units
and were also paid 2,000 baht each.

Prosecutor Yuenyad Jaisamut said the people, most of them low-income
workers, demanded about 500,000 baht each from the bank in suits filed
with South Bangkok Civil Court and Thanyaburi Court.

Mr Yuenyad alleged the condo project owner conspired with bank officials
to cheat the people and could be charged with fraud.

The penalty for fraud is not more than five years in prison or a fine not
exceeding 10,000 baht or both.

Mr Somchai, the broker, was among the victims filing complaints with Mr
Yuenyad yesterday.

Mr Yuenyad said he had ordered the agency's lawyers to investigate and
gather evidence.

The agency provides assistance free of charge, but the people must pay
a 1,000 baht court fee by themselves.

He called on the Government to help pay the fees for these poor people.

British royals warmly greeted: Second time here by UK queen since 1972

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

Anjira Assavanonda and Varalee Sinlarat

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II renewed her acquaintance with Thailand for
the first time in 24 years yesterday.

The British monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh, her consort, who are on
a five-day state visit, were greeted at Don Muang airport by Their
Majesties the King and Queen.

Hundreds of people, Thais and foreigners, watched the greeting before the
King and Queen accompanied their royal guests to motorcade.

From the airport, they went to Maha Jesadabodin Pavilion, where city
officials were in attendance. Thousands of people lined Rajdamnern Avenue
waving the tri-coloured Union Jack and Thai flags.

Silence descended moments before the motorcade arrived at 3.40 p.m.

Queen Elizabeth, in an emerald green dress and hat, stepped out of the
car, drawing expressions of delight and excitement from the crowd.

Chariya Rattakul, wife of Bangkok Governor Bhichit, and Sunantha
Samalapa, wife of City Clerk Prasert, presented garlands to Queen
Elizabeth, Queen Sirikit and Prince Philip.

On behalf of Bangkok, Governor Bhichit welcomed the monarch and presented
her with a key to the city.

The key is gold-plated, eight inches in length engraved with the emblem
of the city showing Indra, keeper of Amarawadi heaven, atop Erawan, the
white elephant.

In response, Queen Elizabeth thanked the people of Bangkok and expressed
pleasure at a welcome that was as friendly as in 1972.

She said she arrived in Bangkok then by river, but this time she entered
the city from the newly-expanded airport. From the short drive, the UK
Queen said Bangkok had changed almost beyond recognition.

She said she was glad the city, despite modernisation, had retained its
rich cultural heritage which would be enjoyed not only by Thais but by
an increasing number of overseas visitors, including Britons.

"I am sure the citizens of Bangkok, in facing up to the demands of modern
living, have lost none of their warmth and humour," she said.

The Queen told Mr Bhichit he had been elected governor of one of the
great cities of Asia and had accepted a responsibility both exciting and
rewarding.

She also wished the governor and the people success in continuing to make
Bangkok a thriving and happy place in which to live in years ahead.

After the ceremony, the King and the Queen accompanied Queen Elizabeth
and Prince Philip to Boromabhiman Mansion, where they will stay.

Most people in the crowd expressed delight for a chance to welcome the
royal visitors even though many of them did not have a clear view.

Porntip Pimcharoen, 57, and her daughter, from Min Buri, had arrived at
Rajdamnern at 5 a.m but missed seeing the Queen because she left her spot
for a few moments just as the motorcade arrived.

She said, however, she was glad to be there. "As a Bangkok citizen, I'm
glad she has come here. It will be a long, long time before she comes
here again. I keep reading about her in the newspapers every day."

Having missed her chance, Mrs Porntip said she would try again.

At Boromabhiman Mansion, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip gave an
audience to Thai and foreign journalists. As the gathering was a social
event, press coverage was not allowed at the request of Buckingham
Palace.

The royal visitors have a busy itinerary. Today's engagements include a
visit to Ayutthaya where they will view ancient temples, floating
lanterns on the Chao Phraya, a light and sound display at the old capital
and a private dinner with the King and Queen.

Scholarship was watershed in boy's life

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

When Queen Elizabeth was taken to Bhumibol Dam on her last visit 24 years
ago, she said she wanted to support the education of some hilltribe
students.

Lee Suk, then 17, said to be the brightest of the H'mong students, was
selected and told Queen Elizabeth he wanted to become a doctor.

He was granted a queen's scholarship for five years, which enabled him
to complete MS5 secondary education, but he did not make it to medical
college.

He said he tried to do too much and his marks fell short of the minimum
requirement for medical college. Instead, he entered the agriculture
college at Chiang Mai University, which was a blessing in disguise.

After MS5, Lee Suk was on his own, but reluctant to give up education,
he borrowed money for university fees and books. He brought his problem
to the attention of representatives of His Majesty the King's hilltribe
programme. As a result, he was granted scholarships from the government
and Australia, which enabled him to finish his BA in agriculture in
Chiang Mai.

Three years ago, he took leave to study for a master's in agricultural
promotion in Chiang Mai, and in January, he graduated.

Born in Pa Wai, Nakhon Thai, Phitsanulok, Lee Suk's childhood was spent
fighting malaria and poverty. He barely knew Thai until 11 when a group
of volunteer teachers set up a school for H'mong children in his remote
village. It was the first time he had learned the Thai language.

Lee Suk excelled over his peers. He picked up the language faster and was
praised by all the teachers. But his studies came to an abrupt end when
communist insurgents raided the village and shot dead the headmen.

His parents and their nine children fled to a temple in Nakhon Thai town
where they took refuge for three months before they settled in Tak, where
Lee Suk resumed his studies at a state school.

Today, Lee Suk, or Lee Suk Rithnettikul, as he is known to his
colleagues, works at the Hilltribe Development and Welfare Centre in
Chiang Mai, where he is using his knowledge for his people.

Lee Suk counts himself as lucky to have been granted the scholarship from
Queen Elizabeth, which was a turning point in his life. Many other H'mong
children wanted to study but were not as lucky.

Plaintiff's lawyer can talk to media

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

The South Bangkok Criminal Court has ruled that the lawyer of a Khon Kaen
businessman, who brought a 695.62 million baht lawsuit against Samitivej
Hospital in the death of his pregnant wife, can speak to the media.

In its ruling last Friday the court said the lawyer has the
constitutional right to speak to the media and his action would not be
interpreted as contempt of court.

The court also set December 16 for the first examination of the
plaintiff's witnesses after the two sides failed to reach an out-of-court
settlement.

In the lawsuit filed April 30, Burin Seriyothin said his wife, Jureerat,
died on September 6 last year after being left unattended in the delivery
room.

Mrs Jureerat died of suffocation after being given an injection. No
doctor was present to help her.

Mr Burin claimed that his wife, who was manager of Khon Kaen Hae Uan Co
at the time of her death, had an annual income of 25 million baht.

Chiang Mai

Five Israelis were seriously injured in a cable car accident at Wat
Phrathat Doi Suthep yesterday.

A car carrying 20 tourists derailed and crashed after the cable snapped
halfway up Doi Suthep at 3 p.m. yesterday.

The Israelis, whose names were not released, suffered serious injuries,
including broken legs.

Temple worker Phrommin Doatraphan said the car derailed because it was
full while another on the way down was empty.

The service has been halted pending investigations in which police are
looking for evidence of negligence.

Samak fumes over defeat in latest poll: Clean sweep for the Democrats
predicted

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Prachakorn Thai leader Samak Sundaravej was enraged by the latest
Matichon opinion poll which says he will lose the November 17 general
election.

The poll predicts a clean sweep for the Democrats in all but two Bangkok
constituencies -- 7 and 12 -- which are Palang Dharma's and Prachakorn
Thai's respective strongholds.

The poll was conducted on 2,550 people in the 13 constituencies of
Bangkok on Saturday. Between 146-205 respondents were selected at random
from each constituency.

Mr Samak questioned the reliability of the poll, saying its results were
misleading since the number of respondents was too small to represent
Bangkok's entire population.

He also doubted all the respondents were eligible voters.

The survey predicts a clean sweep by Democrats Vinai Sompong, Thawatchai
Satchakul and Gen Panlop Pinmanee in the three-seat Constituency 1, with
Mr Samak coming in fourth.

Mr Samak blasted the poll, saying it was aimed at classifying political
parties into good and bad ones in a misleading way.

"Let me ask you this. Will the (pollsters' relatives) at home die or get
sick all of a sudden, or will their office buildings collapse if they go
without the poll?" he said.

The Interior Ministry has instructed its officials to stay neutral in the
lead-up to the election to ensure a fair and clean poll.

Speaking to a meeting of some 966 district chiefs and provincial police
chiefs yesterday, Deputy Interior Minister Arsa Meksawan warned them not
to side with any candidates.

"Some officials have close ties with local politicians who may ask them
to do something to boost their chances of getting elected. As state
officials, we have to ensure fair and clean elections. Don't let
unscrupulous people order you to do something that violates the law," Mr
Arsa said.

The ministry's permanent secretary, Chuwong Chayabutr, who was also
present at the meeting, asked district authorities to warn local
community leaders against helping canvass votes for candidates.

"Every election season, there are complaints that kamnan and phuyaiban
(tambon and village heads) serve as canvassers for some candidates.
Therefore, it is the task of the district chief to warn local leaders in
his or her area of jurisdiction not to become a tool of politicians," Mr
Aree said.

Three-party coalition seen

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Phetchabun

There is a distinct possibility of Democrat, Chart Pattana and Chart Thai
parties forming the next coalition government, former House Speaker Panja
Kaesornthong said yesterday.

Mr Panja, who recently quit Chart Pattana and will contest next month's
election on the Chart Thai ticket, said his party could play a crucial
role in the formation of the new government.

He said Chart Thai leader Banharn Silpa-archa was not angry with the
Democrats, who questioned his nationality and academic qualification
during the censure debate, for deep inside he understands that they were
only performing their duty as an opposition party.

Mr Banharn would not accept any cabinet posts if his party was invited
to join the new coalition, said the veteran politician and former
Phetchabun MP.

In a way the mass defection of former MPs did the party a world of good,
Mr Panja said, because Chart Thai was now left with only quality members.

Mr Panja, who once left Chart Thai to help Gen Chatichai Choonhavan form
Chart Pattana Party, said he returned to Chart Thai because Mr Banharn
wanted him to help salvage the party.

Party policies on army TV

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

The army is to air a programme for parties to explain their policies.

"Last Lap of Election '96" will be televised live on Channel 5 on
November 6 from 8.15 p.m. to 11.15 p.m. from Kittikachorn Hall at army
headquarters.

Lt-Gen Jaturit Phromsakha na Sakon Nakhon, assistant chief-of-staff for
civilian affairs, said parties will use the first segment to outline
policies, after which the audience, mostly military personnel, will raise
questions that have been screened.

"The army will not allow politicians to attack one other. They can only
present their views and visions," Lt-Gen Jaturit said.

Leaders or representatives of 13 parties in the poll will be invited to
the office of the army secretary tomorrow to discuss the programme.

If the programme is too short for all parties to make their policies
known, the army may consider another programme on November 8.

MP accused of forging document: Used against PM at no-confidence debate

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Democrat Chamni Sakdiset was yesterday accused of falsifying an alien
registration paper which he used to attack Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa in last month's no-confidence debate.

The accusation was made by a complaint filed with the Crime Suppression
Division by Somsak Phakhipho, a 58-year-old lawyer.

The lawyer said the copy of an alien registration paper produced by Mr
Chamni during the September 18 censure debate and which the Democrat
claimed to have been issued to Sengkim sae Bay, Mr Banharn's father,
showed that Mr Sengkim arrived in Thailand in B.E. 2480 (1937), while the
genuine document showed the year of his arrival to be 2450 (1907).

Mr Chamni, meanwhile, said in Nakhon Si Thammarat yesterday that doubts
over the legality of Mr Banharn's Thai nationality raised by him during
the September 18 censure debate have been distorted and used by three
political parties with support bases in Bangkok to attack the Democrats
in a bid to maintain their popularity.

He said what he raised during the debate was the suspicion that Mr
Banharn might have obtained his Thai nationality illegally, basing his
arguments on the alien registration paper issued to the premier's father.

However, he said, the Prachakorn Thai, Muan Chon and Palang Dharma
parties have twisted the real issue to accuse the Democrats of racial
discrimination.

Mr Chamni said before the debate he had tried to verify the document with
the police but they refused to cooperate.

The Democrat said he was responsible for what he had done and would not
mind if Muan Chon leader Chalerm Yubamrung filed a complaint with the
police over this matter.

"Pol Capt Chalerm himself should not have stayed on as caretaker justice
minister because he was one of those who had betrayed Mr Banharn by
forcing him to resign after the censure debate," Mr Chamni said.

Democrats go for Islamic votes: Pledge to open a new world for Muslims

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Somchai Meesane

The Democrats are going high-tech to win the hearts of Muslim voters in
the four southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Satun.

Campaign director Surin Pitsuwan said yesterday a party which could "open
a new world" for Muslim communities stands to win.

The Democrats are relying on video multivision and the print media as
their main weapons in the battle for votes in the four Muslim-dominated
provinces.

Mr Surin used video multivisions in the Yawi and Malay languages for the
first time during his campaign in Pattani's Yaring district on Sunday.
The new technology was warmly welcomed there.

The former deputy foreign minister said the battle between the Democrats
and New Aspiration in the South has boiled down to a race to build up "a
new process of learning" for Muslim communities.

The old strategy of the Wadah Group headed by New Aspiration's Wan
Muhamad Nor Matha, which demands that Muslim people look up to their
religious leaders as the only channel for news and information will not
work this time, Mr Surin said.

The Democrats lost in the past because it had no chance to clear
themselves of accusations made by the Wadah Group, then led by Den
Tohmeena, which rejected learning through reading, listening and
watching, said the former Nakhon Si Thammarat MP.

Mr Surin said attempts by his party to bring "a new way of learning" to
the Muslims in the South through its campaigns helped it win in the four
southernmost provinces in the last election on July 2, 1995.

He said if the Democrats could instill the habit of learning through
reading, watching and listening in them, he believes Muslims all over the
country will vote for the party.

The four provinces were the strongholds of New Aspiration for about a
decade until the July 2 election when the Democrats managed to snatch
eight seats from New Aspiration, which could hold on to only five.

This time it's going to be a fierce contest again between the two parties
vying for the 13 seats at stake -- four each in Pattani and Narathiwat,
three in Yala and two in Satun.

The Democrats aim to capture 12 seats this time, leaving only one seat
in Yala to deputy New Aspiration leader Wan Muhamad Nor Matha.

New Aspiration, meanwhile, hopes to not only keep its five seats but also
to win three more from Den Tohmeena in Pattani's Constituency 1, Parinya
Jetapivat in Narathiwat's Constituency 2 and Horsaree Mahrem in Satun.

That means Mr Den, a veteran Pattani MP, has to beat Democrat Mareepeng
Pajakiya, while Mr Parinya and Mr Horsaree must defeat Ramree Mama and
Thanin Jaisamut, respectively.

Muslims, who form 70 percent of the total population of the four
southernmost provinces, are therefore the deciding factor.

Apart from video multivisions, Mr Surin will also issue a party journal
featuring Democrat achievements in the South under the theme "Recovering
the Thai Economy and Building the Darussalam (land of peace)."

The journal covers Democrat policies on Muslim communities, the Growth
Triangle, promotion of hadji affairs, Malay language studies.

Some 200,000 copied will be distributed to Muslims all over the country.

The wind of change has been so strong Mr Wan Nor, who now leads the Wadah
Group, admitted he could no longer rely on Muslim religious leaders to
help canvass votes for New Aspiration.

Mr Wan Nor has ordered former Mass Communications Organisation of
Thailand director Rachan Husen to prepare multivision media for the
party's election campaign.

He will also issue leaflets in Thai and Yawi to publicise the Wadah
Group's work in the South.

The group has also stepped up its campaign among young eligible voters
-- those between 18-20 years old -- by promoting sport competitions and
recruiting them to help with the party's work.

Mr Surin claimed young voters who were against the "old process of
learning" were a major force behind the defeat of the Wadah Group in the
last election.

There are about 20,000 young eligible voters in each of the four
southernmost provinces.

Mr Wan Nor admitted the "Chuan Fever" is very strong in the South and
that New Aspiration leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh could not match the
Democrat leader in terms of popularity in this region.

The Wadah Group has already dropped the "Chavalit for prime minister"
slogan here and switched to "Southerners for NAP ministers" instead.

PollWatch sets eyes on cash transactions: Big sums changing hands in
provinces

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Wut Nontarit

Khon Kaen

Pollwatch is keeping a close watch on unusual cash transactions in this
province, where there has been an upsurge in demand for 100 and 50-baht
banknotes.

Preeda Thumthiang, chairman of the PollWatch committee in the Northeast,
said many banks in the province came across clients asking to have
millions of baht in cash changed into the 100 and 50-baht notes.

Such practices were rare outside the election period, he said, adding
that a PollWatch investigation had found that people who carry large
amounts of cash work for a big political party with a large support base
in the region.

But so far, no one has been caught violating the election law. PollWatch
will continue to keep an eye on activities that may lead to vote-buying.

Mr Preeda said he expected fierce competition in all four constituencies
of Khon Kaen.

The various parties have begun selecting canvassers to work for them in
the different localities.

The parties have spent a lot of money devising election strategies to be
deployed in rounding up support from potential voters.

He explained that canvassers are usually chosen from respected figures
in the community. They will tour the villages recommending their
candidates to the people.

The local people were told the candidates would fulfil their promises if
they were elected.

The canvassers often threatened to withdraw support for the villagers if
they did not vote for their candidates. "Now is just about the time to
find the canvassers," said Mr Preecha.

He said PollWatch volunteers would closely monitor the canvassers' moves.
Legal action would be taken against them immediately if there was
evidence to suggest they had committed wrongdoing.

Mr Preeda opposed New Aspiration's bid to woo local voters by supporting
its leader as prime minister for the Northeastern people, saying this
would only divide people of the different regions.

He said the party's effort to draw votes from the teachers may eventually
prove futile because election victory depended on many other factors.
Vote-buying, for example, looked likely to change the voting pattern.

Starting from November 5, PollWatch would despatch its officials to
educate locals about democracy and the adverse effects of vote-buying.
The campaign is expected to be joined by more than 120,000 residents.

Vote-buying is likely to be particularly heavy during the week preceding
the election.

So far, PollWatch has received reports that some parties have distributed
coupons which can be redeemed for cash to attract people to their
campaign rallies. The coupons have a value of between 20 and 50 baht.

Sukit Wattanasuk, head of Khon Kane's PollWatch Development Office, said
about 1,300 volunteers, mostly Khon Kane University students, were sent
to monitor the pre-election situation in the villages.

PollWatch has also asked the provincial governor that its officials be
allowed to man election units on election day so as to prevent
malpractice.

He said it was found the voters were handed ballot papers which had
already been marked, adding that vote-buyers and officials often worked
as a team.

Election snippets: Party canvassers use lotto-strategy

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

The competitive atmosphere in Phuket is heating up, with many canvassers
using a new strategy to seek votes for some candidates by selling
underground lottery tickets to local people.

Some candidates' supporters reportedly sell the so-called "MP lotteries"
to people in Phuket for ten baht each and promise to pay 1,000-5,000 baht
to those buying lottos with the name of the winner.

Many villagers have complained to to Phuket PollWatch chairman Kittipong
Thieng Khunatham, requesting that the agency take action.

Two-time Democrat MP for Phuket Anchalee Vanich Thepbutr and New
Aspiration candidate Revuth Chindapol are fighting a political battle to
capture the single seat in this southern province.

Election snippets: Partisan police will face reshuffle

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Police officers in the North will face immediate reshuffle if they
support certain political parties, according to the head of Police
Regional Bureau 5, Pol Lt-Gen Prasarn Wongyai.

Pol Lt-Gen Prasarn said he had authorised every provincial police chief
in the North to transfer every officer acting against election laws out
of the area urgently.

"Policemen of every level will be transferred to other remote areas to
prevent more malpractice if they use their authority to benefit some
parties or candidates. I myself will be ready to face the same penalty
if found guilty of any allegations," he said.

Police under the Regional Bureau 5 have also been ordered to ensure
safety for every candidate and canvasser, and keep a close watch on
gunmen who may cause trouble at the election.

Election snippets: More PollWatch officials urged

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

A Palang Dharma candidate contesting the poll in Samut Prakan's
Constituency 1 has asked for more PollWatch officials to ensure a fair
election.

Dr Wallop Youngtrong said Constituency 1 was notorious for rigging. He
cited the January 8 election last year when hundreds of voters turned up
but could not cast their ballots because others had already voted for
them.

Several election officials were arrested and charged in court but were
eventually acquitted, said the PDP candidate who expressed concern that
vote-rigging was likely to be repeated here.

He said a shortage of PollWatch officials to man election booths could
cause problems. Worse still, he said some parties had refused to send
their representatives to monitor the ballot casting.

Planned port site a threat to sea-turtles: Pollution would limit chances of
survival

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Kanittha Inchukul

A proposed site for a deep-sea port under the Southern Seaboard
Development Project in Phang-nga is a potential threat to the habitat of
endangered sea turtles.

Its proposed location at Ban Thap Lamu in Thai Muang district, about 20
kilometres north of Khao Lampee-Had Thai Muang Marine National Park, is
a well-known breeding-ground for sea turtles in the Andaman Sea.

The Southern Seaboard Committee chaired by Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa approved the idea last week and is to submit the proposal for
cabinet approval next week.

A recent report on a study by Ecolas, a Belgian consultancy, notes that
oil pollution from the deep-sea port and its activities coupled with
changes in coastal morphology would certainly threaten the survival of
this endangered species.

However, it said that the environmental impact would be lower than that
expected at the original site in Krabi. Based on this assessment, the
Southern Seaboard Committee decided to relocate the port to Phangnga.

Environmental officials agree that any negative impact on the sea turtle
population, if it occurs, would likely occur as a result of many
different activities at the port both during and after its construction,
especially oil spills from large tankers.

The high frequency of transportation would possibly disturb the migratory
route of the sea turtles heading to nest at the peaceful Thai Muang beach
in the national park.

Ecolas suggested that the Phra Thong Island in Ranong province could be
created into a new nesting ground for the migrating sea turtles. However,
environmental officials argued that turtles always lay their eggs on the
same grounds where they are born.

An average of 77 nests with 100 eggs of leatherback and olive ridley
turtles can be found on the current nesting ground each year but the
number is said to be declining, according to the record books of the
Phuket Marine Biological Centre.

Four different species of sea turtles found in Thai waters, apart from
eight other species found worldwide, include the green, hawkbill, olive
ridley and leatherback. The leatherback is found in the Andaman Sea but
not in the Gulf of Thailand.

Suraphol Sudara, a marine biologist from Chulalongkorn University is
disappointed with the decision. He said the Southern Seaboard Committee
has ignored the proposal to study other sites proposed by the Science,
Technology and Environment Ministry.

The ministry favours the site between Trang on the Andaman coast and
Songkhla or Pattani provinces on the east coast because the project will
not have a serious impact on the environment.

He said an impact assessment study carried out by Ecolas concentrates
only on the planned construction of the sea port in Phangnga.

Flags to be posted beside roads in 'dust-free zones': Trucks entering the
zones must cover up

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Poona Antaseeda

Signboards and flags are to be posted along roads designated "dust-free
zones", a senior city official said yesterday. Deputy City Clerk
Kriangsak Lohachala said the move is an attempt to inform motorists of
the programme beguan in August with Sathorn as the first dust-free road.

A month later, each of 40 districts had designated at least one road as
part of the programme.

Trucks entering dust-free roads are required to cover what they are
transporting if it is construction materials or materials that may litter
the roads. Their wheels and bodies must be free of dirt.

Mr Kriangsak said the city's attempt to install the signs came after it
received complaints from people who said they had no way of knowing which
road has been designated dust-free.

It was one of the reasons why motorists unintentionally broke the rules,
he said.

He said the project had so far proved successful, although truck drivers
spurning the rules were still to be found.

Some drivers avoided police checkpoints by using other roads because they
knew the time and place where police usually set up their checkpoints,
Mr Kriangsak said.

The authorities have since suggested to the police that they periodically
change the time and location of their checkpoints or apply a random
system to deter violators.

Chiang Rai

An American was arrested yesterday on charges of having 350 grammes of
heroin in his possession.

Lee Roy Frank, 55, was stopped at Chiang Rai airport at about 12.30 p.m.
as he was about to board a flight to Bangkok.

Police allegedly found 350 grammes of heroin hidden in a compartment of
his luggage.

Mr Frank had travelled to Thailand 12 times and visited Chiang Rai twice
before his arrest.

Meanwhile, police held two suspected drug traffickers in a separate raid.

Police stopped to search a pick-up believed to have smuggled illicit
drugs on the Chiang Saen-Chiang Khong road.

Driver Wirat Chanthawan, 33, of Chiang Rai's Wiang Pa Pao district, and
Monkasem Chainit, 42, of Nakhon Pathom, were caught after police found
5,000 amphetamine pills and 70 grammes of marijuana hidden in the
pick-up.

Thavorn Chunnanond has been nominated as the new Port Authority of
Thailand director, replacing Anuparb Sunananta who is to be transferred
to an inactive post, a source in the PAT board said yesterday.

Mr Thavorn was the agency's deputy director before the nomination made
in a meeting on Thursday of the PAT board headed by Navy chief Adm Vichit
Chamnankarn, its new chairman.

The nomination will be forwarded for cabinet endorsement today.

The source said Mr Anuparb will be made a water transport specialist at
the Transport and Communications Ministry as recommended by Deputy
Minister Chaipak Siriwat who oversees the PAT.

Learning of the upcoming change, Mr Anuparb initially planned to quit PAT
on September 30, but changed his mind after Mr Chaipak urged him to leave
even earlier than that, the source said.

That was why the change had to be effected through the board last week,
the source said.

Mr Anuparb was the deputy secretary-general of the National Economic and
Social Development Board before his appointment to head the PAT in
January last year.

Camp to be cleared by November: About 600 boatpeople to face repatriation

Nakhon Ratchasima

Thailand plans to complete the repatriation of an estimated 600
Vietnamese boat people still at Sikhiu camp by mid-November, officials
said yesterday.

The remaining Vietnamese are to be sent back in groups at the rate of two
flights a week, they added.

Amid varying degrees of protest, Thai authorities have sent back a total
of 1,824 Vietnamese in 12 separate batches since the operation began on
July 1, after United Nations funding support ended.

A Vietnamese who was due to go back with the latest group on October 24
was rushed to hospital and narrowly escaped a suicide bid by swallowing
insecticide. Ninety-nine others made the journey back without him.

The Vietnamese, who have failed to be accepted for resettlement in third
countries, are being reintegrated into Vietnamese society with initial
support of US$240 each from the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.

Karen rebels to hold ceasefire talks with Slorc

Tak

The anti-Rangoon Karen National Union is to enter into ceasefire talks
with the Rangoon junta on November 17, a source said yesterday.

Gen Bo Mya, the KNU president, took up Rangoon's offer after it was
discussed at a three-day meeting of 25 Karen executives at the Htee Ka
Per base, opposite Umphang.

The 25-member panel, chaired by Gen Bo Mya, assigned Lt-Gen Tamalabaw to
lead the talks with the State Law and Order Restoration Council.

It was agreed the KNU guerrillas will keep their arms and propose Slorc
withdraw its forces from around Karen-held areas.

If the parties reached a formal agreement, the KNU will ask the junta to
hold peace talks with all anti-Slorc minorities.

In the meantime, hostilities continue. Karens clashed with 100 troops of
Slorc's Battalion 257 near the border opposite Umphang last week.

Rangoon sent troops to guard a company prospecting for ore in the area
after it claimed to have received a protection demand.

Contract farming overhaul agreed: Current system puts farmers at great
risk

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Chakrit Ridmontri

The government has agreed in principle to overhaul contract farming
whereby private firms will be required to share risks with farmers,
Agriculture Minister Suvit Khunkitti said yesterday.

Under the existing system firms submit their projects to the ministry,
and if approved, the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives
(BAAC) extends soft loans to farmers.

This system puts farmers at a disadvantage because they are obliged to
buy all their production tools from the contracted firms. The firms in
turn buy the produce from them at a pre-determined price in the contract.
If, for whatever reasons, the quality of the produce does not meet the
contractual requirement the prices go down.

"The farmers have to be responsible for debts incurred in undertaking the
project while the private firms risk nothing, lose nothing," he said.

Many farmers are driven into bankruptcy as a result of the low quality
of seeds, fertiliser and equipment supplied by the firms.

The government-private sector coordinating committee for agriculture
development has suggested a cost-sharing system which would require
private firms to share risks with farmers.

"Under the new system private firms will provide the means of production
to the farmers who will repay the loans only after they have successfully
harvested the crops and sold the produce to the firms at pre-determined
prices," he said.

Under the current system farmers borrow money from the Bank of
Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, but in the revised system the
private firms will have to borrow money from BAAC or other commercial
banks at 5% interest and transfer the cash to farmers or provide them
with equipment and production material.

Besides, the firms will have to deposit cash with BAAC amounting to 10%
of the value of the produce. This money will be used to assist farmers
if they face crop failure, he added.

If the farmers fail to meet contractual obligations they will be dropped
from the programme and required to repay their debts at the normal
interest rate.

Conversely, if the firms break the contract farmers can file for
compensation.

Mr Suvit said the ministry will submit the proposal to the cabinet soon.

Private firms, meanwhile, were not happy with the revised scheme.

A representative of Panchaphol Pulp Industry Co Ltd, which specialises
in fast-growing trees, said the company has decided to withhold its
project in light of the new cost-sharing system.

The project, spanning five years, would require soft loans totalling over
1,600 million baht to grow trees in the central region.

"The existing system is good enough. Private companies have no intention
to manipulate farmers," he said.

Move to probe NHA deal

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

The Interior Ministry may order a probe into a land deal in which the
National Housing Authority (NHA) allegedly bought a 832-rai plot in
Pathum Thani province at highly inflated prices.

Deputy Interior Minister Sornchai Montriwat who oversees the NHA said
Interior Permanent Secretary Chuwongse Chayabutr will soon decide whether
the deal should be investigated.

The NHA signed a contract on October 4 to buy a 832-rai plot in Lam Luk
Ka district at the rate of 1.8 million baht a rai, which is double the
official rate of 900,000 baht per rai.

Maj Sornchai later put the deal on hold after complaints of
irregularities in the deal.

The previous NHA board, headed by Interior Permanent Secretary Aree
Wong-araya who retired at the end of last month, approved the purchase
and the subsequent contract was signed on the day the cabinet ordered
dissolution of the board.

A new board was appointed with Mr Chuwongse as its chairman.

Maj-Gen Sornchai said he is waiting to hear from NHA Governor Preedi
Buranasiri why the agency paid so high a price for the land.

Import of costly medical tools needless: Researcher says local supplies
plentiful

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

Increasing quantities of expensive medical equipment are being imported
needlessly, according to the Health Systems Research Institute.

Thailand has plenty of equipment that is not being put to full use, said
Dr Viroj Tangcharoensathien, a researcher at the institute.

Tax exemptions on imports under the free trade policy should be reviewed,
he said, to avoid over-consumption and inefficient use of equipment.

Dr Viroj said the medical equipment market expands at 20 percent a year,
rising from six billion baht in 1984 to 7.2 billion baht in 1995.

While the United States is a free market economy, it controls technology
used in its 52 states and avoids unethical market promotion.

"To bring an extra CT scanner (computer x-ray) into California, a
hospital needs a certificate of need and must prove full use is made of
existing equipment," he said. "In this case, it means it is used in 2,500
cases."

America also limits the number of disease centres, for instance there is
only one heart disease centre per city. "We have sufficient expensive
modern technology but it is under-used and has very low productivity,"
said Dr Viroj.

"To maximise use, it should be distributed to the provinces. Much of it
is in private hospitals in Bangkok."

A survey in May 1995 found there were 205 CT scanners (each costing 10-20
million baht), 20 Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) computerised x-ray
machines (70-80 million baht), 37 extra corporeal shock wave lithotripter
(ESWL) used for stones of less than 3cm (8-39 million baht), 114 lasers
(cost varies) and 594 ultrasonograms (1-5 million baht).

The survey found that 59 CT scanners are used in public hospitals and 146
in private hospitals. Of those, 43 percent are in Bangkok.

MRIs: eight in public and 12 in private hospitals; 75 percent in Bangkok.
ESWLs: 19 in public and 18 in private hospitals; 38 percent in the
capital. Lasers: 36 in public and 66 in private hospitals; 88 percent in
Bangkok. Ultrasonograms: 259 in public and 309 in private hospitals; 36
percent in Bangkok.

Most of the equipment has a high health care cost impact on patients but
there have been no systematic evaluations of clinical outcome.

Dr Viroj said there is a probability of the needless application of
medical equipment, for which patients pick up the bill. The probability
of abuse involving ultrasonograms is high of lasers and MRI possible and
there is no definite information on CT scanner abuses.

Though there has been lesser abuse of ESWLs, they are only used on 50
percent of patients with stone disease.

Though most patients are from the lower income group, 38 percent have to
pay for treatment out of their own pockets. Since 30 percent come for
treatment when the stone is big -- more than 3cm -- they have operations
rather than ESWL treatment, he said.

Developed countries treat 80 percent of patients with ESWL because they
are treated when the stone is smaller than 3cm, he added.

New operation plan for city bus agency: Private sector to be assigned more
routes

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

Amornrat Mahitirook

The director of the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority, Arun Chirachavala,
has prepared an operational plan to help the debt-ridden bus agency
before announcing his resignation at the end of the month.

His resignation will follow the reshuffle of the BMTA board endorsed by
the cabinet earlier this month at the urging of Deputy Transport Minister
Chaipak Siriwat, who has been assigned to supervise the agency.

Mr Arun said the operational plan designed to be used in the next five
years will focus on improving three major areas of the bus agency so that
it can begin generating profit from 1998 onwards.

Under the first area of the plan, the BMTA will improve passenger bus
routes, the fare collection system, and bus conditions, and award more
routes to private operators.

Secondly, the agency will reduce the size of its own organisation by
reducing the number of its buses from 4,624 currently to 4,000 and cut
the number of staff from 23,346 currently to 17,573 within 2001.

The third area of the plan focuses on the BMTA's finances. The agency
will ask the government to subsidise the loss-ridden operation of
ordinary buses, the fares of which have been frozen in the public
interest.

The authority will also ask for approval to introduce a single fare rate
for air-conditioned buses.

The rate will be 12 baht per trip instead of the current one which ranges
from six to 16 baht depending on traveling distances.

The BMTA will also raise capital of 7,698.12 million baht to clear its
old losses.

If the plan is implemented, the agency will have a net profit of 447
million baht in 1998, Mr Arun said.

He described his operational plan as a "masterpiece".

BECL's guided bus project passes technical evaluation: Construction work
to begin next year

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

Supoj Wancharoen

The Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA) has passed the guided
bus project of the Bangkok Expressway Co Ltd (BECL) through its technical
evaluation.

ETA deputy governor Somchai Charukasemratana said an ETA sub-committee
selecting the guided bus operator met yesterday to consider the technical
aspects of the BECL's project, and agreed that the details complied with
the ETA's terms of reference.

The ETA will consider the financial proposal of the BECL next week and
expects that the construction of the system could start next year, he
said.

The BECL is the only contender vying for the contract of the project,
which will be built under the second-stage expressway system for a
distance of 16 kilometres from Chaeng Wattana to Victory Monument. The
firm is now operating the second-stage expressway.

Mr Somchai said the BECL proposed a guided bus system which could serve
5,000 passengers per hour per direction as the ETA required.

The firm also intended to use gas-fuelled buses from Germany with
diesel-fuelled buses as an option, he said.

The service proposed to charge 18 baht per trip, but the ETA would try
to cut it down, he said.

The ETA allows the guided bus operator to develop areas along the bus
route for commercial purposes, but the BECL has said that the areas are
not sufficient for commercial development.

The firm wants to develop the areas into parking lots for motorists to
leave their cars and catch guided buses, Mr Somchai said.

Arrest of saboteurs still to be verified: Army in touch with Malaysian
officials

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

The Army has been unable to verify a report that Pattani United
Liberation Organisation's military commander Haji Sama-ae Thanam and the
movement's three other leading members had been arrested by Malaysian
police with a large quantity of explosives, an Army source said.

According to the report Ma Pelis, the PULO secretary, Poh Sube, the
leader of its political wing, and Yama Sateng, chief of its sabotage
unit, were arrested along with Haji Sama-ae Thanam with a huge quantity
of C4 detonators while on their way from Kelentan to Kedah, some 40
kilometres south of Narathiwat's Su-ngai Kolok district.

Yama Sateng is believed to be the mastermind of the bomb blast at the Hat
Yai Railway Station early last year in which many people were killed and
wounded.

PULO is one of the Muslim separatist movements whose bandit groups
operate in southern border provinces.

The source said Army chief Gen Chestha Thanajaro had ordered military
intelligence units to check the report by coordinating with Malaysian
authorities. So far there had been no reply from Malaysia.

If the report is true, problems could arise in seeking their extradition
because it was still uncertain whether Haji Sama-ae held both Thai and
Malaysian nationalities, the source said.

The military is seeking confirmation of the arrests from the
Thai-Malaysian Coordination Office in Songkhla.

"The matter is a delicate one because it concerns political relations
between the two countries," the source said.

UN urged to oust regime

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 08

Asian advocates of democracy in Burma plan to call on the United Nations
to expel the country's military junta from the UN general assembly.

The UN should "take immediate steps to eject the Slorc [State Law and
Order Restoration Council] from the assembly on the grounds that the
Slorc is not the legitimate government of Burma", the activists said in
the draft of a declaration expected to be released tomorrow.

The "Alternative Asean Declaration on Burma" is being finalised at a
two-day meeting opening in Bangkok today that has drawn human rights
activists, trade unionists and academics within and outside Asean, as
well as members of Burma's pro-democracy movement.

An independent source noted that as the UN comprised sovereign states
only countries, not regimes, could be expelled from its assembly, which
meets yearly. Yugoslavia was the last UN member to be expelled from the
assembly, after South Africa.

The draft declaration also urges Asean to review its position on Burma,
saying Asean membership would provide the Slorc with a "de facto licence"
to continue its "attacks" on Burmese people.

Asean gave observer status to Burma in July, but remains undecided and
divided on when to integrate it into the organisation. The Slorc stepped
up pressure on pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters
after applying for full membership of the grouping in August.

The activists' draft declaration also calls on the international
community to ban promotion of the Slorc's Visit Myanmar Year "until the
human rights situation improves in that country".

Spearheaded by the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum
Asia), the activists also plan to launch an "Alternative Asean Network"
to mobilise regional support for democracy in Burma.

EU on offensive in Asem talks: Saroj: Move seen as ploy to raise touchy
subjects

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 08

Nussara Sawatsawang

The European Union has proposed that the 25 Asian and European countries
involved in the Asia-Europe Meeting (Asem) engage in "comprehensive"
political discussions, a senior Thai official said yesterday.

Permanent secretary for foreign affairs Saroj Chavanaviraj did not reveal
details of the proposal put forward at an informal meeting of senior
officials in Japan last week.

But another official said the EU proposed that the Asem discuss United
Nations reform, nuclear proliferation, regional issues, as well as
unspecified "values".

Launched in Bangkok in March, Asem so far has touched on general
questions, but made no provision for concrete discussion of political
issues.

According to Mr Saroj, Asian participants reacted cautiously to the EU
proposal, which was seen as an "offensive" by Europeans to raise
controversial issues like human rights, democratisation, and labour
standards.

The meeting on October 24 brought together senior officials of the Asem
members, including the 15 members of the EU, and 10 Asian countries:
Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

"[The European Union] wants to launch an offensive in matters in which
there are still differences [between Asia and Europe]," Mr Saroj said.

"We [Asia and Europe] have our own [values]. They do not have to be the
same," he added.

Mr Saroj said political issues were already being discussed at other
forums, for instance the regular dialogue of foreign ministers of the EU
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).

The Asian side agreed to study the European proposal and discuss it
further at the next meeting of Asem officials in Dublin in December,
before their foreign ministers meet in Singapore in February, Mr Saroj
said.

East Timor and Burma are two controversial issues where Asia and Europe
have distinctly different approaches.

The EU did not indicate the format for the political discussions, or the
level of the would-be participants, said the official who asked not to
be named.

The official went on to say that Thailand feels that the discussions
should be informal, pragmatic and flexible, as was the approach of the
first Asem meeting here.

At the same meeting, Japan showed interest in taking part in development
cooperation in Indochina, the official added.

And although Japan was not invited to a meeting in Malaysia in June which
discussed development of the sub-region, Malaysia pointed out that Japan
would "eventually" join the programme, Mr Saroj said.

Thailand and Japan will host separate meetings of Asem finance and
economic ministers in September next year. Stabilising the monetary
system is on the tentative agenda of the finance ministers' meeting in
Thailand.

Based on consensus reached at the recent Asia-Europe business forum in
France, the senior officials agreed to exchange information on
investment, and to finalise discussions on policy and regulations by the
end of this year, the official said.

Vietnam elephant killer jailed for 20 years

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 08

Hanoi -- A Vietnamese man who killed a domesticated elephant for its
tusks has been jailed for 20 years and ordered to pay more than US$10,000
(200,000 baht) in damages, a report said yesterday.

The Supreme People's Court in Danang jailed Ho Van An for 20 years and
also imprisoned three accomplices for between five and 10 years for
killing the elephant in the central highlands province of Daklak, the
Saigon Times Daily said.

Mr An, 60, had several previous convictions for killing elephants, which
are a protected species in Vietnam. Most are killed for their tusks and
skins which can fetch thousands of dollars.

FEATURE / PHILIPPINES: The slums make way for Apec

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 14

CECILIA QUIAMBAO

Manila

They live beneath bridges, on unused lots and soap boxes precariously
propped up by stilts on the banks of rivers and open sewers. They push
shoddy wooden carts on daily prowls through the metropolis, rooting at
garbage cans for food and scraps. Their only contact with the rest of the
city is when they rap at car windows to beg, hawk cigarettes by the stick
or snatch a purse or a wristwatch from pedestrians.

Now, as the Philippines steps on to the world stage with the coming out
party of its once-ailing economy, the great unwashed of the Philippine
capital are under siege as the government lays on a giant snow job to put
a silver lining to its imperfections.

Three people have been killed and several hundred others have so far been
injured, a rights monitor here says, as giant squatter colonies which
blight this city of eight million are torn down by government demolition
crews armed with crowbars and court orders ahead of the November 25
summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum.

President Fidel Ramos denies any connection between the slum campaign and
Apec, and last week controversially stopped the demolition of a colony
of 4,000 squatter shanties clogging a waterway in the central Manila
district of Paco.

Mr Ramos, who at that time had been holding a dialogue with a church
support group calling for an end to violent demolitions, said that "if
what happened is intentional, this is subverting the government".

The Department of Interior and Local Government said it has relocated
22,320 squatters so far to government-built relocation sites in the
nearby provinces of Bulacan and Cavite, and that about 300,000 remain to
be removed.

Some analysts say the latter figure is grossly understated.

Manila and its satellite cities and towns hold about 12 percent of the
population of 68 million, and a World Bank study shows a third of the
eight million residents do not hold a title or contract allowing them to
stay in their current abode.

The big numbers of these squatters are routinely blamed for causing
crime, flooding, pollution, disease and other ills which how afflict this
city. Last month, Health Department investigators traced the cause of a
cholera outbreak which killed five people to an illegal tap in the water
system, possibly contaminated by human faeces from a squatter colony
which had been stealing the water.

"There is a certain Hobbesian element that sets Manila apart," said
University of the Philippines political science professor Alex Magno.

He described Manila as a "cruel city" where "the air is bad, traffic is
terrible, sewage does not work, a third of the population live in slums,
housing is expensive".

The vice mayor of the city of Manila, Lito Atienza, said the Paco
squatters at the centre of the Apec flap had been notified to vacate the
area two years ago, with them "fully aware that they are occupying a
danger zone".

"With or without Apec, we are using our mandate which maintains the good
living conditions of our constituents," said Mr Atienza.

The congestion of Manila is blamed by the government on the lack of
employment opportunities in provincial areas. Most of the squatters
regularly run over by speeding trains are migrants from provinces south
of Manila which arrived by rail in search of jobs and proceeded to build
their shacks beside the tracks.

"One has to be glad that the Apec meeting has been scheduled here," said
Horacio Paredes, a cabinet member in the previous administration of
Corazon Aquino.

"If the holding of such a meeting clears the city of squatters, at least
along the roads and waterways that the rest of us need to maintain
resident-free for the metropolis to have some breathing space, then well
and good," he said.

"Imagine how much urine, human excrement and garbage those 4,000 families
dump into that canal daily," he said of the Paco squatters.

Some politicians say squatter colonies are coddled by some local
officials, who find in them a big reservoir of swing votes to keep them
in power in the next local election.

"Their presence there is symptomatic of the failure of government to
govern properly," said Mr Paredes.

Complicating the resettlement problem is a law that states that slum
abodes cannot be demolished unless a relocation site has been prepared
for the residents ahead of time. Critics say this gives the act of
squatting an attractive incentive.

The law does not cover those who obstruct roads and waterways and those
who live in zones that are considered dangerous to human habitation, such
as river banks or beside railroad tracks.

Opinion on the whole issue however is divided.

Manila Times newspaper concedes that while "the cost of keeping blighted
communities now exacts a toll on nearly everyone, from questions of
sanitation and health to matters of peace and order", it argued that
"there must be a more dignified way of cleaning up the metropolis other
than chasing people down with truncheons and water hoses".

Looking to the longer term, the government has initiated moves to try to
decongest the city. It is now granting tax incentives to companies which
set up industrial enclaves in other regions and to the factories which
set up there.

Many of the new industrial projects are now being set up in the so-called
Calabarzon growth area, comprising the provinces of Cavite, Laguna,
Batangas, Rizal and Quezon, south of Manila.

President Ramos has also created a government task force to study other
means of dispersing economic growth, which serves as a magnet for
migrants, to other regions.

Parties turn up the heat in the battle for Bangkok

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 14

BANYAT TASANEEYAVEJ

The heat is rising in the lead up to the election two weeks from now, and
the 37 seats in Bangkok will be the determining factor in whether Chuan
Leekpai or Chavalit Yongchaiyudh becomes the country's 22nd prime
minister.

As the centre of information with the largest educated population,
Bangkok has always acted as somewhat of a barometer in measuring the
political climate around the country.

And since the people of the capital are closest to the seat of power,
they follow the moves of politicians and their parties more closely than
their rural cousins and can be turned off or on by the slightest thing.
It is for this reason that no single party has ever been able to dominate
the city for any length of time before falling out of favour.

The Democrats once held the hearts and minds of city people in the years
when they fought the military dictatorship. Prachakorn Thai captured
nearly every seat in Bangkok in the mid-1970s when the country swung to
political right, and Palang Dharma swept aside all challengers in the
late 1980s and early 1990s when the public became fed up with corruption
and opted for a party promising them honesty.

The political wind seems to be blowing again in the Democrat Party's
favour for the November 17 election. The Democrats know their immediate
political future rests with taking the capital since they cannot hope to
beat New Aspiration in the Northeast where vote-buying is the determining
factor.

The Democrat team chosen to contest the city have been selected based on
their perceived ability to undertake the key issues of political reform
and economic management. Most members of the Democrats' so-called
economic dream team are running in Bangkok; Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda,
Supachai Panitchpakdi, Abhisit Vejjajiva and Savit Bhotiwihok.

Mr Chuan went to pains during his two-hour speech at the party rally at
Royal Plaza Saturday to excite the political consciences of city folk.
He told them his party won only seven seats in Bangkok in the last
election, while the other 30 were won by parties which threw their
support behind Banharn Silpa-archa.

History, he said, might repeat itself if the Democrat candidates are not
elected in great numbers.

Most of the Democrat seats last election came from the South, where the
party expects to win most of the 52 available seats this time. But the
largest number of seats, 137, are concentrated in the 17 provinces of the
Northeast, where Gen Chavalit's New Aspiration Party is expected to do
well since it has recruited the largest number of known politicians from
the region.

In the last general election, the NAP captured 36 seats in the Northeast,
Chart Thai 29, Chart Pattana 27 and the Social Action Party and Democrats
14 each.

With such a short campaign period, vote-buying is expected to be even
worse in the Northeast this year. This means Bangkok represents the only
hope for the Democrats in beating the NAP and returning Mr Chuan as prime
minister.

In the last general election in Bangkok, the Palang Dharma Party won 16
seats, Prachakorn Thai 12, the Democrats seven and Muan Chon two.

The other parties will be ganging up on the Democrats this time. Though
Palang Dharma is not an ally of either Prachakorn Thai or Muan Chon, it
will have to join in on the attack on the Democrats.

Both Prachakorn Thai and Palang Dharma have been attacking the Democrats
for raising the issue of Mr Banharn's and his father's nationality during
the no-confidence debate. The raising of the race issue by the Democrats
was not very well received by the ethnic Chinese community in Bangkok.

In the Thanam Ratchawong Chinese community for example, a large poster
declares: "We don't want politicians who look down on the ethnic origin
of fellow Thais."

The community is in Constituency 2, the former stronghold of the PDP
leader. Even though Thaksin Shinawatra is not running this time, party
candidate Orathai Kanchanachusak hopes to keep the three seats there
under the party's control.

The Democrats are fielding a strong team in the constituency made up of
former House Speaker Marut Bunnag, respected academic M.R. Sukhumbhand
Paribatra and dream team member Supachai Panitchpakdi. If all three can
win a seat, this would shatter the PDP's strongest base in the city.

Mr Chuan is now concentrating his efforts on helping party candidates
campaign in Bangkok using a two-pronged approach: Getting people to vote
for them and building fear among constituents of the possibility of Gen
Chavalit becoming premier.

Dateline Bangkok: Race debate is unhealthy

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

Destructive criticism seems to be the theme of most campaigns launched
by political parties contesting the coming election. Instead of talking
about the policies of their parties, candidates tend to engage in
mud-slinging that could create political conflict and division among the
people.

In the July 2 general election last year, the Prachakorn Thai and Palang
Dharma parties, the two major political rivals in Bangkok, lost much of
their popularity among voters.

Palang Dharma, in particular, came under much public criticism because
of dramatic changes in its political role and conduct. Both Palang Dharma
and Prachakorn Thai are Bangkok-based parties. They have shown no
interest in expanding party branches outside the capital to make
themselves a truly mass party.

In the September 13, 1992 general election, Palang Dharma lost many of
its seats while Prachakorn Thai won only two seats in Bangkok. The
Democrat Party made considerable gains. In last year's election in
Bangkok, both Palang Dharma and the Democrats suffered a setback, while
Prachakorn Thai made considerable gains. Palang Dharma and Prachakorn
Thai, however, were invited to join the Banharn Government.

The first no-confidence debate in May this year led to a Cabinet
reshuffle. Both Palang Dharma and Prachakorn Thai resigned and then
rejoined the Government in a manner that caused much confusion among the
public. The Democrats, meanwhile, managed to regain its popularity by
explaining its handling of the Sor Por Kor 4-01 land programme to the
public.

Palang Dharma leader Thaksin Shinawatra and his predecessor Chamlong
Srimuang are not contesting the coming election. As the election campaign
hots up in Bangkok, Palang Dharma and Prachakorn Thai are apparently
joining hands to attack the Democrats. Political friendship is a good
thing, but both parties should not bring up the issue of racial prejudice
because it could cause disunity in the country.

Bangkok Post Postbag: Changes at council part of a re-focus

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

There has been some speculation in your letters column about the British
Council, and I would like to take this opportunity to respond to the
various queries regarding its function, its library and information
service, art gallery, educational counselling service and English
language centre.

The British Council is Britain's principal agency for cultural relations
with other countries and its work in these countries is supported by a
grant from the British Government. It actively promotes educational,
cultural and technical cooperation between Britain and the rest of the
world. In each country the British Council adapts its services to meet
the particular needs of that country.

Consequently the services offered in India, Malaysia, Japan or Singapore
will differ from those offered in Thailand. In Thailand, the British
Council through its offices in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, offers a wide
range of services. First of all, it provides access to information about
contemporary Britain. Furthermore, it initiates and develops projects
between British and Thai government, educational and non-government
organisations, particularly in the fields of English language teaching,
education, science and engineering, health, the environment, governance
and the law, and the arts. In these areas it has a particular track
record of promoting long-term partnerships between British and Thai
universities and other education institutions.

The British Council Library in Bangkok makes available English language
teaching materials (including audio-visual and multimedia programmes) to
all its library members. When the British Council moved to its new
location at 254 Chulalongkorn Soi 64 on the edge of the Chulalongkorn
campus in Siam Square, it decided to use the opportunity to re-focus its
library and information services so as to respond more effectively to the
demands of the majority of its members.

Based on research and data collected from its members' borrowing habits,
it decided to extend those areas where demand was greatest and also
update its technology to provide a more efficient service. Some areas and
books which were less well used were removed. In addition to information
about all aspects of Britain, the British Council library now offers its
members a comprehensive collection of materials on English language
teaching and study, a selection of British newspapers and periodicals as
well as British films, documentaries and popular television programmes
on video and a collection of modern British fiction.

For the use of library members, government and educational institutions
seeking information on the United Kingdom, a reference section with books
and CD ROM is also available. We are continually adding to this material,
but information not immediately available can be obtained from the
British Library in the UK. The opening hours of the library have also
been extended and we are now open six days a week.

The British Council library was never intended as a general library and
reading room, but as a gateway to information on contemporary Britain.
To make space for the specialist areas that have been in heavy demand
from the Thai public, educational institutions and other users of our
services, we either donated the excess books to Thai educational
institutions or sold them to our library users for a small consideration.

If some residents in Bangkok missed the sale that was held in the library
premises over several months, I am sorry that they lost the occasion to
acquire some excellent books. I can only advise them to turn up for the
annual Ploenchit Fair on Nov 23 at the British Embassy when the British
Council will again be running the second hand book stall (if any Bangkok
Post readers have unwanted books in reasonable condition we would be
pleased to take them off your hands -- the proceeds all go to charity).

The British Council continues to have art exhibitions on its premises,
there have been two since we moved. In addition to the forthcoming
exhibition of "Thailand Drawings" by Justin Knowles (Nov 4-23), whose
work was recently acquired by the Tate Gallery in London, and another
exhibition of prints based on nursery rhymes by Paula Rego (Nov 24-Dec
20), we have acquired from the British Council Collection in London
several works by British artists and sculptors for permanent display.

As in a number of our offices around the world, the British Council in
Thailand offers individual and group counselling and information to all
those interested in study and training in Britain. This service is
offered free of charge by our specially-trained Educational Counselling
Service (ECS) staff who guide applicants through the process of choosing
a course at British educational or training institutions to best suit
their particular needs. They can advise them on how to apply for that
course and even provide a follow-up service if required.

The ECS also holds a broad range of reference materials, as well as
prospectuses, CD ROM databases and videos from schools, institutes and
universities. They also provide detailed information on fees, and
scholastic and English language requirements for entrance to secondary,
graduate and post-graduate courses in the UK. In addition, the British
Council will be holding its 10th annual British Education Exhibition at
Imperial Queen's Park Hotel in Bangkok from Nov 22-24, where interested
candidates can meet with representatives from about 100 British schools,
colleges and universities.

The ECS office is located in the main entrance hall of the new British
Council premises in Siam Square and we are sorry that the two visitors
to our office who wrote to your newspaper failed to notice it. The ECS
is now also available in Chiang Mai and the British Education Exhibition
will this year, for the first time, also visit Chiang Mai (Nov 28-29) at
Lotus Hotel, Pang Suan Kaew.

The English Language Centres of the British Council across the world
believe in setting high standards in English language teaching. This
applies to the range of courses we offer in Siam Square where we cater
for beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of study, for younger and
mature learners and as well as to our other teaching operations in Chiang
Mai and New Phetchaburi Road. We therefore recruit well-qualified and
experienced native-speakers of English as teachers. They use up-to-date
materials and facilities matched to the needs of the class and in Siam
Square have available a CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning) Room
equipped with purpose-designed CD ROM materials.

I hope this letter will satisfy the queries of your letter writers. Our
records indicate that none of your correspondents on this issue are
currently members of the library. However, my colleagues and I are ready
to answer any queries and complaints, and would encourage those with
concerns to discuss them directly with us so we can improve our services
to library members, centre students and other users of the British
Council.

Bangkok Post Postbag: Not every Aussie has racist views

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

I refer to the recent coverage of the racism debate in Australia. It
concerns me greatly that your readers are getting an impression of
Australia as a racially intolerant society simply because of remarks made
by an ignorant minority. I would like to put the debate into perspective.

Australia is a democracy and the second largest multicultural nation in
the world. As such, it represents a wide variety of different cultures
and views. Recently, a very small minority of elected representatives
have made racially based remarks which the majority of Australians reject
and despise. The fact that nine out of 10 members of Port Lincoln Council
resigned because of the racist remarks of its mayor illustrates this
point clearly.

Racism exists everywhere. As a Caucasian, I have also been the subject
of racism during my travels in Asia, but I do not see everyone in Asia
as racist because of an ignorant few.

We must all fight against racism. The fight is happening in Australia
now.

Australians are proud of their rich multicultural heritage and their
position in Asia. Never doubt that.

Bangkok Post Postbag: Ticky-tackyness of US politics

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

I was watching the American vice presidential debate recently on Channel
7 and I noticed the similarity between Al Gore and a young Ronald Reagan.
The way Al Gore held his head and looked into the camera reminded me of
how our Ron used to look.

Is Al a secret member of Ron's family or is it a prerequisite for
American politicians to come from the same mould?

It all reminds me of that old song, "Little Boxes", where the chorus
goes: "And they are all made of ticky tacky and they all look just the
same".

Commentary by Paisal Sricharatchanya: Station outside Mater Dei should go

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

In the weeks and months after the second school semester reopens this
Friday, Bangkok will witness a new struggle of an extraordinary kind.

After a year of quiet and unsuccessful negotiations with the various
parties concerned, the prestigious, all-girl Mater Dei School on
Ploenchit Road will begin mounting a public campaign to get rid of a
planned electric train station right outside its front door that -- if
built -- will almost definitely worsen the children's quality of life and
pose serious hazards to their health and safety.

The campaign is at the centre of what looks like a grossly uneven match.
A well-behaved and deferential Catholic school is finally forced to stand
tall to fight against the financially-powerful and politically
well-connected BTSC, the concessionaire of Bangkok's elevated electric
train project.

But the solidarity movement that has taken shape among the almost 2,000
students, their parents and teachers plus alumnae is determined to fight
to the very end.

The high point of a comprehensive package of campaign strategies calls
for a petition to His Majesty the King, who spent part of his childhood
at this very school. The petition, however, will be a last resort if and
after all else fails.

This is not simply a fight between the school and BTSC. At stake is the
vital question of whether innocent children who will graduate to become
the country's precious human resources should fall victim to greedy and
irresponsible Big Business.

What is also pertinent to this campaign is another crucial question of
whether greater transparency and accountability should be instilled into
the national decision-making process of granting concessions to
large-scale public projects bearing a direct impact on the environment
and citizens' rights.

In the apparent haste with which the electric-train project was approved
during the tenure of former Bangkok Governor Chamlong Srimuang,
fundamental requirements such as a proper environmental impact assessment
study have either been glossed over or imperfectly fulfilled.

Given the fact that construction of the entire project is going ahead at
full steam, it appears there's no turning back in spite of its known and
unknown shortcomings.

But the ghastly structure that is planned to become one of the main
stations right in front of Mater Dei should be shifted elsewhere. And if
shifting it to another adjacent location is not possible, the station
should be scrapped.

Siting a large and crowded train station at the doorstep of an all-girl
school smacks of extreme irresponsibility on the part of the project
managers. The high-pitch noise and polluting particles resulting from
trains arriving at and departing from the station every two minutes will
pose appalling health hazards to the school children. This is not to
mention other threats to their safety.

Alternatively, scrapping of the Mater Dei station should cause little
financial damage to the project operator -- if finances are their main
concern -- since passengers travelling on the route can still be
adequately served by two not-too-distant stations: one in front of the
Mahathun Building and the other just around the corner near the Regent
Hotel.

A dangerous precedent will be set where innocent students at other
educational institutions may also be victimised in the future if this
serious blunder is allowed to go ahead.

All the phu yais at BTSC and Bangkok Metropolitan Administration will do
a great service not only to the Mater Dei students but also the public
at large if they demonstrate the sort of moral conscience and social
responsibility expected of them by ordering the relocation or scrapping
of the planned station.

Sakchay takes on sport's top job

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 16

Suchin Chirakul

In a surprise decision, Dr Sakchay Tapsuwan was yesterday appointed
Governor of the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT), taking over from Dr
Somchai Prasertsiriphant who resigned suddenly last week.

Long serving deputy governor Dr Charoenthat Jinthanaseri had been tipped
to take over the post.

Minister of the Prime Minister's Office Pongpol Adireksarn, who is the
SAT president, announced that the SAT committee endorsed Dr Sakchay to
be governor for the next four years.

The meeting acknowledged the resignation of Dr Somchai, who was governor
for six years and who many thought would stay on much longer until his
retirement.

Although Dr Somchai officially retired to give someone else a chance at
the job, it is generally believed major internal conflicts were the real
reason for his resignation.

Late last year he had been sacked as director of the organising committee
of the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok and there had been some questions
about his administrative ability.

However, Dr Somchai, who has worked for Thai sport for 28 years, is not
totally out of the picture and has been named special councillor where
he will still have a say in decision making.

Dr Sakchay is also vice-president of the International Amateur Boxing
Association and secretary of the Amateur Boxing Association of Thailand.
He is closely involved with the 13th Asian Games.

The new governor is regarded as a good administrator and diplomat, which
is essential for organising big tournaments.

With Dr Somchai's resignation the governorship has now become a four-year
post, but one that can be renewed for two more years.

SAT also announced yesterday its budget for next year would be over 4
million baht, most of which would be used for the Asian Games.

Somprasong chairman faces fraud charges: Prasong evades warrant, employees
try to block search

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

Krissana Parnsoonthorn and Busrin Treerapongpichit

Police are hunting for leading property developer Prasong Panitpakdee on
charges of doctoring financial statements, falsifying his company's
reports and destroying evidence.

There were rumours yesterday that Mr Prasong, chairman and managing
director of troubled Somprasong Land Plc, had fled the country. However,
police believe he is still in Thailand.

An arrest warrant was issued after Economic Crime Investigation Division
police received complaints from a group of Somprasong shareholders. A
preliminary investigation found grounds to believe that Mr Prasong was
responsible for wrongdoing.

A search warrant was also issued for the Somprasong headquarters in the
Klong Sarn area of Thon Buri.

Economic Crime Investigation officers arrived at the building at 10 a.m.
but company employees wouldn't let them in. They relented after police
showed them the search warrant -- and threatened to arrest them if they
resisted.

The employees continued to make the officers' job difficult by refusing
to give them keys to certain rooms. Police had to call a locksmith to
open the rooms, which they found filled with destroyed documents and
piles of others awaiting destruction.

Officers also forced open an out-of-service elevator and found it filled
with destroyed documents.

Police said they believed Mr Prasong knew in advance that they were
preparing to move in on him, and that he ordered his employees to start
destroying documents at 3 a.m. yesterday.

Investigators collected documents hat had not been destroyed but a
Somprasong lawyer would not allow them to take the documents out of the
building.

The Economic Crime Investigation officers called local police at Samrae
Police Station for help. They had called Somdej Chaophraya Station
earlier, but were told that Somprasong executives had asked a senior
officer to refuse the station's help to the Economic Crime police.

Reinforced by local police, the economic police eventually took the
documents to Samrae Station.

Police said Mr Prasong is likely to face additional charges of share
manipulation. Officers said they found many share certificates and some
evidence that Mr Prasong may have been involved in manipulating the
prices of certain stocks.

According to the complaints lodged by company shareholders, Somprasong
had falsified its earnings from several property projects in reports to
the Stock Exchange of Thailand. This misled investors to believe that the
company's performance was favourable, they complained.

News could spark realty share selloff: Somprasong lenders can also expect
investor scrutiny

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

Cholada Ingsrisawang and Busakorn Pothasuthon

News that leading executives from Somprasong Land are under police
investigation is expected to hurt the entire realty sector, with worried
investors looking to sell property stocks.

That said, although the preliminary news about Somprasong was broken by
local newspapers yesterday, the company's stock price closed at 8.40
baht, up 0.30 baht, with stocks worth 11.23 million baht.

Industry analysts said financial firms acting as creditors for Somprasong
would also be hurt by the news even though most had plans in place to
deal with financial troubles of their clients in the reality sector.

The creditors all reported having sufficient collateral from the troubled
firm, though the auction of land used as collateral might not be enough
to recover the total loans under slow market conditions.

The analysts said Somprasong Land had been hurt by long-running rumours
that it was struggling, with rumour-mongers possibly trying to depress
the price of the company's stock so that they could eventually take over
the struggling firm at the cheapest price possible.

Banterng Tantivit, the chairman of National Finance & Securities Plc,
Somprasong Land's major creditor, said yesterday that his firm would not
be hurt by the news because it had sufficient collateral to back up its
loans to the firm.

Siam City Bank president Som Jatusipitak said his bank had extended about
100 million baht to the Somprasong Group, but the collateral placed
against the loan did not meet the loan's worth.

Dr Som said other banks had also loaned money to the group on collateral
of less than the value of the loans.

He explained that the problem had arisen because at the time the loan
contracts were made, the property sector was booming with Somprasong Land
leading the way.

Meanwhile, Stock Exchange of Thailand president Singh Tangtatsawas said
the SET would study the case and decide whether the current problems were
simply personal in nature.

"If it is a personal issue, then the SET will not suspend Somprasong
Land's stock from trading," Mr Singh said.

Promotion zones in Northeast proceed

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

The Board of Investment says it will go ahead with a plan to develop a
special promotion zone in 12 northeastern provinces.

The board said the area was appropriate after calls to establish a
similar zone to the five southernmost provinces.

BoI Deputy Secretary General Chakkramol Pasukvanich said 12 northeastern
provinces were selected for the plan because they were the poorest, with
an average per capita income under the gross national product (GNP).

The income of people in the five southernmost provinces was above GNP and
infrastructure system was better.

BoI feared that to heed private sector calls would create a precedent
which would allow other provinces to also set up a similar zone.

According to World Trade Organisation regulations, average income must
be lower than GNP when offering special privileges to avoid excessive
export advantages over other countries.

Mr Chakkramol said the northeastern plan will be submitted to Cabinet
after the new government is formed, regardless of which political party
is the coalition core.

New tool in money market: Central bank plans more active role in managing
liquidity

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

The Bank of Thailand expects to introduce a new tool by the end of the
year to help it manage the money market more effectively.

Known as open market operation, the system will make the central bank an
active player in the money market through bond trading with local
financial institutions selected as direct dealers..

Central bankers say the system will allow them to allocate liquidity
better and minimise liquidity fluctuation.

The Bank of Thailand currently manages money market liquidity through the
bond repurchase market, meaning it must wait for financial firms' call
to buy or sell bonds with a repurchase agreement.

Once the system is in place, the central bank will be able to adjust
liquidity in the market right away by calling its primary dealers.

Those dealers must have a good liquidity management and be able to quote
the bidding and offering rate of their bonds instantly, so the central
bank can inject liquidity into the market by purchasing bonds and absorb
it by selling them.

"Under the new method, the Bank of Thailand will be able to manage
liquidity more efficiently. The method will create confidence in the
market in times when there might be abrupt impact on the market's
liquidity.

"In a way, the central bank will provide direction and avoid the
fluctuation of local interest rates," said Paiboon Kittisrikangwan, chief
analyst in the central bank's banking department.

He ruled out suggestions by some analysts that the bonds circulating in
the system were insufficient for the operation.

Mr Paiboon said private bonds circulating in the banking sector were
worth about 300 billion baht, with state-enterprise bonds worth 250
billion, Bank of Thailand bonds 19 billion baht and Government bonds 22
million baht.

"The amount is enough for the central bank to intervene in the money
market and guide its monetary policy," he said, adding that this system,
together with the central bank's moves to adjust the mechanisms for
quoting interest in the bond repurchase market, would force financial
firms to adjust their liquidity more effectively.

The central bank will trade only bonds with one-month-up maturity,
resulting in market managed liquidity in the longer term.

In the first stage, the central bank expects to choose 15-20 finance
firms as its dealers. Those dealers must be able to trade bonds worth 10
billion baht with the central bank.

A letter has already been sent to all local financial firms inviting them
to apply for the available positions.

Dealers working with the central bank to manage liquidity will benefit
by being allowed to trade bonds after the operational time of the bond
repurchase market.

The tight money market and the pending US presidential election are
influencing interbank rates.

Last week the interbank rate was quoted around 12%. It was climbing
slightly up investors bought US dollars and sold other currencies.

One analyst, who declined to be named, said the greenback was
appreciating with the approach of the presidential election and would
slip back to a normal level after the poll. The exchange rate yesterday
was about 25.52 baht, while the mid-rate quoted last week was 25.48 baht.

As a result, the retail rate is close to 26 baht if commissions and other

Customs tell traders to get competitive: Tax subsidies can come later

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

The Customs Department has signalled a warning to exporters, urging them
to sharpen their competitive edge before Government tax subsidies are
waived on exports.

A customs source said the tax subsidy was introduced to promote exports.

Under the subsidy system, the Customs Department would calculate a
subsidy rate for exporters, which it prefers to call compensation.

The source said compensation meant exporters would be exempted from
paying import duties on raw materials used for export-oriented
production, and freed from paying value-added tax. Exporters would also
get tax reprieves on the export of some machinery and fuel.

Compensation rates now range between 0.17-8% of the export value, down
from the previous 11%.

The source said the car industry benefits most with a reprieve of 8%.

But the source said exporters will have to prepare themselves by
sharpening their competitive edge to cope with international competition
when the government help stops.

He said the Government could no longer shoulder the tax burden.

An agreement of the World Trade Organisation also says the compensation
will have to be waived to create fairer competition, the source said.

But Customs Department director-general Supachai Panitchpakdi said
Thailand has to retain compensation to stimulate foreign investment.

But he said the measure might later be reviewed.

He said compensation has caused worries among department officials
because it opens the way for unscrupulous people to claim false tax
export figures to claim tax rebates.

Beginning in January next year, the department would counter false export
tax claims by introducing an accounting system to control tax claims for
imported raw materials.

He said it would not be compulsory for exporters to participate in the
new system, but he would like them to take part and capitalise on its
benefits.

An accounting system would facilitate exporters, therefore the department
would not pressure exporters to participate, he said.

Tripods cut exploration costs: Platforms first to be designed locally

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Unocal Thailand is introducing new locally-designed platforms for its
extensive gas production in the Gulf of Thailand.

The new platforms will help the US gas prospector to cut the overall cost
of developing gas reserves in the Gulf of Thailand.

Fabrication of the first two fully automated tripod (three-pile)
well-head platforms is near completion and installation of those
structures in Funan and Pladang fields is planned for early next year.

These tripod platforms, the first to be designed and installed in
Thailand, offer substantial savings on fabrication costs over traditional
four-pile platforms. Unocal's offshore wellhead platforms, currently
totalling 60, have traditionally been of the four-pile type.

Unocal's tripod platform is more compact than a four-pile one. It
requires 755 tons less steel, is insensitive to water depth, and is fully
automated. Most importantly, it is as safe and strong as the conventional
type, and can support the same number of drilled wells.

Unocal Thailand president Brian Marcotte said the new concept formed part
of Unocal's attempt to reduce the overall cost of developing gas reserves
in the Gulf.

"Tripod platforms will have a significant impact on how Unocal operates
its fields in the Gulf and elsewhere around the world. They are the
platforms of our future," the American executive said.

A multi-disciplinary team of Thailand-based technical professionals,
including geologists and engineers, came up with a design to suit the
actual geological conditions and drilling experience in the Gulf of
Thailand. From engineering design to completion, the team took less than
a year.

Drilling of gas wells will be carried out by a jackup rig, which will be
able to move between development well and delineation well activities as
needed, thus eliminating the need to use two different rig types.

The company recently sailed away its last four-pile platform from Thai
Nippon Steel's fabrication yard in Samut Prakan. Thai Nippon Steel has
built most of Unocal's platforms to date. It is also the fabrication
contractor for the tripod platforms.

Operating for co-concessionaires Mitsui Oil Exploration and PTT
Exploration & Production (PTTEP), Unocal has been producing natural gas
from fields in the Gulf of Thailand since 1981.

Unocal gas production from fields in the Gulf in the first nine months
of this year came to an average of 735 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd)
and 26,482 barrels per day (b/d) of condensate.

Industry aims to top Malaysia: Call for leaders who can see potential

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Kornrarath Silsmith

The Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) and the Industrial Finance
Corporation of Thailand (IFCT) are convinced Thailand's electrical
appliances and electronics sectors can overtake those of Malaysia to be
ranked top in the region.

This is possible if the new government has good vision, they said.

Sompong Nakornsri, president of FTI's electrical and electronics group,
told an Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand seminar of the
potential in Thailand's electrical and electronics industry.

Thai industrialists can produce electrical appliances and electronics
themselves because they have cheap labour, raw materials and good
supporting industries.

Thailand can also develop technology itself and improve products to be
in line with worldwide standards. As a developing country, the local
market has a high demand for these products, which could also be
exported.

But Thailand has before lacked leaders with a long-ranging and clear
vision, which meant the industries were not well developed.

High technology electrical products such as electrical fans, motors,
adaptors and compressors are better than those produced in Malaysia.

To help Thailand occupy the top rank in the production of electrical and
electronics goods within the next decade, the new government should have
five-, 10-and 15-year plans to promote investor confidence.

The tax structure and details of the Customs Department should be
improved. The government should also act urgently when imported goods are
dumped and when import tariffs are raised by trading partners.

Taxes for raw materials are higher than those for finished goods. For
example for the optic-fibre industry, plastic pellets are taxed at 30%,
but finished imports are taxed at 5%.

"Thailand is the only country that imposes a tax for unprocessed
materials at a higher rate than for finished products. The procedures of
the Customs Department is more confusing and slower than those in
Malaysia which permits the imported and exported goods to pass the
Customs Department within 24 hours without any difficulties over
documentation," said Mr Sompong.

Sirikul Jongtanasarsombat, assistant vice-president of the IFCT, said
Thailand needed more engineers. Thai education did not produce workers
with appropriate skills for the jobs at hand. There was also a lack of
markets, market information, export testing centres and money needed as
capital by small firms.

Housing projects likely to increase Supalai profit

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Real estate firm Supalai Plc expects 40% growth in sales to more top two
billion baht this year, mainly through three housing projects.

The new projects are Supalai Grand Park at Bang Na-Trat Road, Supalai
Orchid Park 3 and Supalai Ville at Thon Buri-Pakthor Road.

"Encouraged by these projects, Supalai's sales volume this year is
expected to reach 2.65 billion baht, up 42% compared to last year's
result of only 1.9 billion baht," said president Prateep Tangmatitham.

Sales from January to September recorded 42% growth to 2.1 billion baht
over the same period last year.

Mr Prateep said Supalai's 15 projects will earn the company more than
12.6 billion baht in 1997. Under other development schemes, Supalai has
formed a joint venture with local investors in Khon Kaen and Hat Yai to
develop real estate, which it expects to earn more than 1.3 billion baht
in 1997.

The company is trying to bring its liability ratio to lower than 2.5:1
in 1997, and to below 2:1 in the next 2-3 years. To stabilise its
financial structure, Supalai requires revenue from customers as a source
of investment.

Downpayments from its 15 projects are expected to represent cash of about
500 million baht, with the last ownership transfer from 13 projects
accounting for another 1.8 billion baht cash.

Supalai has appointed Siam Commercial Bank and SCB Advisory Co to be
financial adviser and underwriter for the local issue of financial
instruments worth one billion baht.

The move is part of an effort to refinance existing debt and to cover its
additional investment fund, said Mr Prateep.

Environmental services exhibition set for June

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Phusadee Arunmart

Lyon, France

Thailand's largest environmental technology exhibition is scheduled for
June.

Organised by the Thai government and Blenheim Thai Exhibition Co, a
subsidiary of the London-based Blenheim Group, the Entech-Pollutec Asia
'97 show will be held on June 26-29 at the Queen Sirikit National
Convention Centre.

The exhibit will be very similar to Pollutec '96, the twelfth
international exhibition of environmental equipment, technologies, and
services, held in Lyon, France, last week. That exhibition attracted
1,700 exhibitors from 24 countries.

Blenheim Thai Exhibition managing director Steven Seet said the company
decided to host a similar exhibition in Thailand because the country is
a hub within the rapidly-growing Asean group.

"New industrial plants, infrastructure, and property development are
taking place throughout the region. Environmental protection must be
built into those developments now rather than added later," Mr Seet
explained.

He said there were substantial opportunities in Thailand for companies
marketing environmental protection products because the country is in the
midst of adopting the ISO 14000 standard. To receive that standard,
industries must produce their products in a way that is environmentally
friendly.

Thailand relies greatly on the technology and expertise of foreign firms
for its waste-water treatment, air filtering, solid waste disposal, and
hazardous-waste management needs.

Caltex appoints Pornchai as director

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Caltex Oil (Thailand) Ltd, the country's fourth-largest oil marketer in
terms of market share, has continued its reorganisation with the
appointment of a Thai to a key executive post.

The US oil company said the appointment of Pornchai Sripraphai, who will
become COTL director on November 1, demonstrated the company's trust and
acceptance of the abilities of Thai nationals.

Dr Pornchai, 53, has held the position of senior manager in the brand and
retail marketing section since joining COTL last November.

He obtained a Master's degree in general administration and a doctor al
degree in administration and sociology research from Miami University in
Ohio state.

An expert in education and research, he was employed as a senior
researcher at the University of Saarland in Germany for 14 years before
joining Robinson Department Store for four years.

COTL has one other Thai director, Mr Suvit Senavatin, who is responsi ble
for the supply and customer ser vices division.

Call to rethink ETO monopoly: Transport agency's role at port branded
parasitic

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Wichit Sirithaveeporn

The Express Transport Organisation's monopoly at Bangkok Port needs
reconsideration by the cabinet, according to the Economic Stability and
Security Policy Committee.

It will put the issue to the cabinet, opposing the Transport and
Communications Ministry's endorsement of the ETO's monopoly for another
two years when the contract comes up for renewal in December.

Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan, a member of the committee, said the
cabinet had full authority to review the ministry's decision because the
ETO was under government control.

"The issue is one of revision. The committee earlier made a strong
commitment that the organisation's monopoly at Bangkok Port would not be
extended. The ministry's endorsement was given without the committee's
consent," Dr Amnuay said.

Currently, the ETO is said to account for only 25% of total trucking
transport services at the port, with 75% belonging to its
sub-contractors.

Dr Amnuay described the ETO's action as that of a parasite waiting to
suck blood from its fellow Thais, particularly exporters.

Liberalisation of the transport industry was the best way to prevent
this, he added. "It doesn't mean the government will stop the
organisation's requirement to continue its business. But the government
needs to create more open competition among operators in the field."

The ETO's board had previously agreed transport services at the port
should be opened to competition because of pressure from customers and
other truckers.

But the liberalisation plan has been delayed, with Deputy Transport and
Communications Minister Chaipak Siriwat championing efforts for the ETO
to continue its port services that provide 87.5% of its annual income
currently totalling one billion baht.

The port's long-term plan envisages ending the ETO's privileges and
encouraging more truckers to offer their services and end bribery and
other corruption allegedly fuelled by the monopoly.

Mr Chaipak's policy aims not only for the ETO's monopoly to remain, but
for it to directly handle 50% of truck services at the port.

MBK shrugs off poll worry: Services takes shape in hope of licence

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

MBK Properties & Development Plc plans to set up a commercial bank
despite political uncertainties posed by the general election.

The group was one of the three groups short-listed by the bank selection
committee. Licences require the finance minister's approval.

Company managing director Pakong Leelawong said yesterday her group had
spent one million baht a month on hiring potential staff for the bank.

National Finance & Securities Plc chairman Banterng Tantivit will be its
chairman and Nopporn Ruangsakul, a former Thai Danu Bank executive
vice-president, will be the managing director.

The group forecasts the new bank, focusing on wholesale banking, will
break even in 5-7 years.

Mr Banterng said he was unsure whether or not the new government would
change the policy on awarding new banking licences to his group.

Mrs Pakong said her group had testified to the police about an allegation
that bribes of 750 million baht per licence were paid to the selection
committee. She stressed all three groups had rejected the claims.

Meanwhile, MBK Properties & Development Plc's one-year net profit to
September 30 was 373.14 million baht, or 2.40 baht per share, up from a
net profit of 273.92 million baht, or 1.62 per share, last year.

The firm will pay a dividend of two baht per share this year.

Mrs Prakong said her company's outstanding total assets this year were
worth 18.38 billion baht, up from 8.17 billion baht last year.

The company expects to benefit when the Mass Rapid Transit Authority's
underground railway, with a terminal near its property, is completed. It
expects its net profit to reach 608.67 million baht.

But the company's 383-room Pathum Princess Hotel in the Mah Boon Krong
centre compound is projected to lose 5.7 million baht next year before
breaking even in 1998.

Plastic club wants duty kept: Manufacturers call for help to cut costs

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Plastic and petrochemical manufacturers have urged the government to
scrap import tariffs cuts scheduled for January.

The Federation of Thai Industries' Plastic Industry Club has also called
for the current tariff structure to be kept for 3-5 years and for the
government to help manufacturers trim their costs so they can compete
with imports.

Club chairman Virat Kleo-patinon recently put its case to Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-archa.

Plastics and petrochemicals were basic industries that had only just
begun in Thailand and were not strong enough to compete with imports, Mr
Virat said.

Ethylene and propylene, the industry's main feedstocks, were bought from
the National Petrochemical Corp and Thai Olefins Co at prices higher than
those of imports.

The industry also paid more for electricity than counterparts abroad and
chemical tanks and terminal charges were expensive, he said, adding there
was also the burden of high interest on loans, as well as guarantees and
tax.

Neighbours including Malaysia and Indonesia had offered their
manufacturers tax breaks and other incentives.

But Thailand had lifted its protection measures and had made it easier
to import low-priced foreign supplies, causing serious losses for local
manufacturers, Mr Virat claimed. The government had been cool on their
request for help in integrating production to cut costs, he added.

TA cordless phones can share numbers: Handsets will also work well in
vehicles

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Suphaphan Plengmaneepun

TelecomAsia Corp says its personal cordless telephone (PCT) service to
be introduced in the middle of next year will enable more than one person
to carry handsets with same numbers.

PCT, previously known as the personal handy phone system, can be used in
vehicles travelling at up to 60 km/h, compared with 30km/h in Japan where
the technology was developed.

TA vice-president Vallobh Vimolvanich said TA's cordless service would
enable users to apply for more extended lines or handsets.

If a family has more than two members, they can apply for extended lines
for each of them. These additional handsets will have the same home
numbers.

For incoming calls, owners can set all lines to ring simultaneously or
just a particular handset. PCT also provides call-waiting services or
conference links.

TA will seek Telephone Organisation of Thailand approval to collect the
monthly fee for extended lines. This will be 100 baht/month for the
second handset in addition to 200 baht/month for the first.

The airtime fee will be three baht for the first two minutes and 1.50
baht for each subsequent minute of each call for each handset used.

PCT will cover 1,600 sq km of Bangkok. By end of 1998, the coverage area
will extend to 4,500 sq km to take in outlying areas.

Mr Vallobh said he expected more than one million subscribers within the
first three years.

The service could be used in cars travelling at 60 km/h because the
system's cell sites were close to each other. TA would have to fix cell
sites on all 800,000 power poles of the Metropolitan Electricity
Authority to provide efficient coverage, he said.

Motorists travelling at more than 100 km/h would find cellular phones
more efficient than cordless sets, he noted.

TA and Thai Telephone and Telecommunication (TT&T) will ask the TOT to
allow them to use the same control frequency that would allow a roaming
service between the two cordless networks.

TT&T's subscribers could then use their cordless phones in Bangkok, while
Bangkok subscribers could use their sets in the provinces.

Both TA and TT&T would have to negotiate their sharing of revenue from
the roaming service, Mr Vallobh said.

TA is also negotiating to provide a cordless service for subscribers to
the TOT's 1.7 million phones in Bangkok in addition to TA's 2.6 million
lines.

TOT wants 21% of the revenue but TA considers this to high.

TA's multi-media fibre network for the 2.6 million lines in Bangkok has
the capacity to handle six million lines, Mr Vallobh said. Therefore when
new fixed-line operators wanted to share the network, they could do so
without having to pay for cables. But they would pay TA a share of the
revenue, he added.

Micro-breweries to be franchised: Boon Rawd plans 10 restaurants

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Boon Rawd Brewery Co is preparing to open the first of what it expects
to be 10 franchise micro-brewery restaurants, according to executive
chairman Viroj Phutrakul.

The Hartmannsdorfer Brauhaus will be located in SCB Park Plaza on
Ratchadaphisek Road, and will be operated by Pomona Trading, a joint
venture between Boon Rawd and a German partner.

"The concept of the micro-brewery is very popular in Europe and America,
and is fast catching on in Asia," said Boon Rawd chairman Piya Bhirom
Bhakdi. "Asian people are switching to drinking beer, encouraging the
micro-brewery business to grow very fast."

The Hartmannsdorfer Brauhaus has a total brewing capacity of 300,000
litres annually. The 1,500-square-metre restaurant seats 400 people.

Boon Rawd is entering the business after seeing the success of the
Paulaner Brauhaus which has two popular outlets in the Sukhumvit area.
Boon Rawd has operated the Singha Beer Haus on Asoke Road for several
years, but it has not expanded to other branches.

Pomona Trading will invest some 80 million baht in the prototype
Hartmannsdorfer outlet, named for a beer produced by a Boon Rawd-owned
brewery in Germany. After it achieves success, the franchise will be sold
under the responsibility of Boon Rawd Asia Co, within a year.

"We plan to give Hartmannsdorfer franchises to 10 franchisees, half of
which will be in Bangkok. We are hopeful of expanding our franchise
within a year after we succeed with this first restaurant," Mr Viroj
said.

The investment outlay for each Hartmannsdorfer Brauhaus will range from
30 million to 80 million baht.

Boon Rawd is also preparing to franchise the products of its German
brewery, Mittweida Lowenbrau, producer of Hartmannsdorfer and Mittweida
beers.

The first Mittweida franchise is expected to be sold to a brewery in
China. Boon Rawd also plans to open its first joint-venture brewery next
year with the Charoen Pokphand Group in China.

"Local demand for beer in Thailand is growing by more than 20% annually.
We do not have enough production capacity, so we need to find some
production bases to produce our beer to be supplied to the European and
US markets," Mr Piya said.

Thailand's total beer market is currently worth about 40 billion baht.
Boon Rawd is the market leader with more than 80% market share.

Insider: A modest beginning

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Given all the fuss about telecoms, one would think that the
Telecommunication Association of Thailand would have a very high profile.

Not so, says association president Sribhumi Sukhanetr. With all the
public-and private-sector players involved, the possibility of the
association taking a stand that would annoy someone is high.

Tempted as he might be to sound off, Mr Sribhumi prefers the association
to play a neutral but constructive role. If people want to call the TCT
-- the initials chosen to avoid confusion with the TAT -- a paper tiger,
he doesn't mind.

"At the moment we're concentrating on training courses and I have to
remind myself not to be critical on other issues because it would create
a problem later. The association needs cooperation from both the private
and public sectors so we don't want to have problems with any of them."

Starting on Friday, the TCT will hold a three-day seminar at Central
Plaza. The objective? To help educate the public about uses, trends and
developments in the field.

Registration is 2,200 baht for non-members and 2,000 baht for members.
Proceeds will be donated to the Royal Projects.

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

For 100 years the New York Times has proclaimed itself the home of "All
the News That's Fit to Print". When it went on the World Wide Web, it
looked for a new slogan.

The newspaper held a contest that drew some 8,000 entries, including the
likes of "All the News That's Fit to Click", and "All the News That's Fit
to Print Out".

So what did the judges finally settle on? "All the News That's Fit to
Print". It has a certain ring to it.

Insider: Air scare

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

This month's Bad Taste Award goes to Ryanair, an Irish discount airline.

The offending advertisement showed a picture of a hijacked Sudan Airways
Airbus-130 on the tarmac of London's Stansted Airport, with the door open
and boarding stairs nearby, but without a passenger in sight.

"It's amazing what lengths people will go to, to fly cheaper than
Ryanair," the copy proclaimed.

The Irish Airline Pilots' Association -- and consumers -- didn't think
there was anything funny about hijacking. The ad was dropped.

CHINA-TOURISM: News in Brief: --Ancient Bells Chime for Museum Visitors

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

--Ancient Bells Chime for Museum Visitors.  The Han Dynasty
Emperor Wudi Maoling Museum has recently added an Ancient Bell
Exhibition and Concert Hall to perform Chinese music dating more
than 2,400 years.

The Maoling Museum, 40 km northwest of Xian, is famous at home
and abroad for a number of large Han Dynasty stone inscriptions.
In the concert hall, a set of 64 bronze chime of bells are
exhibited. A chime of bells is a set of bells whose tones span
one octave. Simple and unsophisticated in shape and fine in
workmanship, they hang from bronze frames in three layers and
eight groups. The original pieces were discovered in Zeng Houyi's
tomb of the early Warring States Period (475-221 BC) in Suizhou,
Hubei Province in 1978. Although they sat underground for more
than 2,400 years, they still have a wide range of sounds and can
play ancient and modern music. This collection is the oldest
large musical instrument with 12 and chromatic scales in the
world.

--The Japanese-Chinese Friends Association Silk Road Exploration
Commenced on August 2: The 26-member group traversed over 6,000
km by car to Lanzhou, Jiayuguan Pass, Dunhuang, Urumqi, Kashi,
ancient city of Miran and Xining, and will return to Xian after
28 days.

CHINA-TOURISM: New Xian-Lhasa Airline

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Upon approval from the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC), Southwest Airlines opened the Xian-Lhasa Airline on July
1, this year, completing an air bridge from northwest China to
the roof of the world.

The Xian-Lhasa Airline links Kathmandu's International Airline
with a return flight stopping in Xian and continuing to Beijing,
an air distance of 1,900 km, flying 2 hours and 40 minutes by
Boeing 757 each Monday and Thursday. People in tourist circles
estimate the opening of the new airline will link the capital,
Beijing, with the ancient cities of Xian, Lhasa and Kathmandu.

Since the first successful flight from Sichuan's Chengdu to Lhasa
in 1956, the CAAC has opened Sichuan's Chongqing, Beijing to
Lhasa and Chengdu to Tibet's Qamdo air routes, which have safely
flown over the plateau for 40 years. The opening of the Xian-
Lhasa Airline will further improve the air transportation network
in the Tibet Autonomous Region.

CHINA-TOURISM: Giant Reclining Buddha at Wutai Mountain: During the 7th
Wutai Mountains International Tourist Month...

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

During the 7th Wutai Mountains International Tourist Month,
tourists will be see a new sight--a 1,000-meter-long reclining
Buddha.

The giant Buddha reclines with his head lying in the Puhua Temple
and his feet in the Nanshan Temple. The 3,000-meter-meandering
Qingshui River passing his body is a grand Wutai Mt. spectacle.
Just before sunrise is the best time to see the sleeping Buddha,
when the silhouette of the 1,000-meter-long sleeping Buddha is
clearly visible in the sun's first bright rays.

This giant Buddha has been a legend for many years, the subject
of stories and fascination, but its existence was not verified
until recently. In 1995, the Buddha was finally discovered by
some artists from the Taiyuan Art Academy in Shanxi Province.
Climbing the Wutai Mt. during several different seasons and times
of day, one morning they at last discovered the 1,000-meter-long
sleeping Buddha, observing it in the first rays of the morning
sun from the upper floor of a government office building in the
Wutai Mountains Scenic Spot.

A terrace especially for viewing the Buddha will be built in the
Wutai Mountain Scenic Spot.

CHINA-TOURISM: Hebei's Special Itineraries

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

CHEN ZHONGLIE

To kick off the Visit China '97 promotion, Hebei Province, with
its original Great Wall Tour, Fitness Tour, and Acrobatics and
Marshal Arts Tours, will again offer another four special
itineraries.

Forest Grassland Tour. North Hebei Province has a verdant expanse
of grassland and a vast sea of forest. The interesting grassland
tents, wooden houses, unique barbecue and special milk tea,
horse-riding, shooting and particularly the grand evening
bonfires and unique Manchu and Mongolian song and dance evening
parties make this tour an explosion of ethnic and cultural
adventure.

Bird-Watching Tour. The Beidaihe coast has attracted migratory
birds for centuries. In addition to wildlife splendor, visitors
can enjoy luxuriant forests, splendid grasslands, and long
stretches of beaches and marshes--a bird's paradise. According to
studies, in Beidaihe and its environs, 405 kinds of birds have
been logged, 68 of which are under state protection. Red-crowned
cranes, large swans, white storks, goshawks, sea vultures,
sparrow hawks and other rare birds can be observed here. The best
times for bird-watching in Beidaihe are April to May and October
to December.

Buddhist Temple Tour. Shijiazhuang, capital city of Hebei
Province, occupies an important position in the history of
Buddhism. As early as the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the Chan Sect
of Buddhism was flourishing, and the Linji, Longxing, Bailin,
Diyin, Pilu and another 17 temples are well known at home and
abroad. The Linji Temple was the birthplace of the Linji Chan
Sect. The Linji Chan style, initiated by Master Yixuan, is
practiced widely in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Southeast
Asian countries. The Bailin Temple is the oldest site for
ceremonial rites to worship the Goddess of Mercy. According to
historic documents, the Tang Dynasty eminent monk Xuan Zang
lectured in the Bailin and Diyin temples and then went
pilgrimaging to the west. The annual Grand Buddhist Doctrine
Summon at Diyin Temple attract numerous Chinese and foreign
Buddhists and tourists.

The Three Kingdoms Cultural Tour. Zhuozhou in Hebei Province is
the birthplace of the Three Kingdoms culture. The famous historic
work, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, was originated from
here. The Lousang Temple, native home of Liu Bei (king of the Shu
State), the Zhongyi Temple, home of Zhang Fei (a Shu State
general), the Zhang Fei Well, the Sanyi Temple where Liu Bei,
Guan Yu (also a Shu State general) and Zhang Fei became sworn
brothers in the Peach Garden, and other ancient historic remains
have been renovated. The Zhuozhou Film and TV City, built for
shooting the grand TV serial The Romance of the Three Kingdoms,
covers an area of 146.7 hectares. It encompasses the Han Dynasty
Imperial Scenic Spot, and four folk residential complexes named
as the Bamboo Garden, the Peach Garden, the Plum Garden and the
Pear Garden. The Bronze Sparrow Terrace, a magnificent
architectural structure in the State of Wei (220-265), is
acclaimed by many as the epitome of perfection.

CHINA-PRESS: Annual Salary System Introduced: ''Zhongguo Qingnian
Bao''

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

(China Youth Daily)

The annual base salary-plus system, which is common abroad,
began to be trial practiced by the Shanghai Fountain Pen Factory
four years ago.

Clearly defined property right relationship and coordinated
reforms provided the precondition for instituting this system.

The system enables appointed officials of state-owned
enterprises to become professional entrepreneurs.

This year, 20 of the 140 pilot enterprises practicing the modern
enterprise system have introduced  the new salary system.

The base annual salaries for directors and managers, ranging
between 20,000 to 50,000 yuan, are determined in accordance with
the size of each enterprise's net assets. Salary supplements, or
what is sometimes known as risk incomes, are determined according
to management achievements, including the growth rate of assets
and profits, with the ceiling level tripling the base salary.

For example, regardless of level of achievements in business
operations, the maximum salary ceiling for the director of a
large enterprise will not exceed 200,000 yuan. This sum is
reasonable under China's current conditions. Introduction of the
base salary-plus system not only inspires enterprise directors
and managers to work harder and restricts abuses of power, but
also takes into account the interest of employees.

Implementing the base salary-plus system in state-owned
enterprises will pave the way for forming an orderly professional
entrepreneur market.

CHINA-PRESS: Changes in Employment Structure

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

YANGZI WANBAO

(Yangtze Evening News)

With the acceleration of reform in China's labor system and the
improvement of labor markets, changes have also occurred in
employment structures.

First, a two-way migration work patterns is taking shape. A
growing number of urbanities now seek jobs in rural areas. Among
the country's 130 million employed by township enterprises, 10
percent are urbanities. For example, many urban skilled workers
in southern Jiangsu Province prefer township enterprises where
they can gain higher incomes and have greater life choices. In
some township enterprises, one-third of workers come from cities.
Even university graduates and qualified technicians prefer to
work at township enterprises. For example, a continuous stream of
university graduates come to the Hongdou Group for employment.
The 6,000-employee firm, located in suburban Wuxi City, Jiangsu
Province, now employs more than 600 university graduates.

Second, the number of employees in the private and individual
businesses has increased rapidly. By the end of 1995 the number
had reached 19.6 million, accounting for more than 10 percent of
the country's total employees.

Third, the number of government employees declined, with the
1995 figure dropping by 210,000 from 1994.

CHINA-PRESS: To each his own: Women's Bookstore

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

(China Youth Daily, May 16, 1996)

RENMIN RIBAO

(People's Daily, Overseas Edition )

A bookstore dedicated to serving women opened in Beijing two
year ago.

The store offers a wide selection of famous works authored by
ancient Chinese women such as Cai Wenji and Li Qingzhao;
classical works related to the life of women, including  The West
Chamber  and  The Unjust Case of Dou Er ; representative works by
modern Chinese authors, including Bing Xin, Ding Ling, Lin Haiyin
and Zhang Ailing; and contemporary works by authors, including
Zhang Jie, Chen Rong, Wang Anyi and Chi Li.

The store also offers excellent works written by female authors
from Hong Kong, Taiwan and various foreign countries. In
addition, its shelves contain biographies of successful women
from various circles and works related to the accomplishment of
women and personal appearance.

The store's unique features have attracted an  increasing number
of customers. For example, numerous representatives and scholars
from across the world visited and praised the store during the
Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995.

The store has opened four branches in Beijing, and plans to open
chain stores in numerous other cities.

Zheng Zhihui, proprietor of the Women's Bookshop from Taiwan,
visited the store to discuss the development of women's
literature and plan to hold book exhibitions on women in Beijing
to promote the cultural exchanges between the mainland and
Taiwan.

Women from France, Britain, the United States and Yugoslavia
joined in expressing admiration for the bookstore.

CHINA-PRESS: Skill Training on the Rise

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

GONGREN RIBAO

Workers' Daily

At present, skill training is gaining popularity throughout
China, following the drive to enhance university degrees and
doing business.

The training is oriented to diversified skills beyond the
learners' own professions. Numerous training classes,
continuation classes and advanced classes have been opened in
many cities, where the employed, unemployed or off-job workers
learn driving, accounting, cooking, tailoring and  foreign
languages.

More than 3 million people are registered to receive various
kinds of adult education and training annually in Beijing.
Approximately 30 million persons nationwide have received their
driver's license through training. The Nanjing Vocational
Training Center reports that 91 percent of their students hold
full-time jobs.

This rush toward continuing education is a direct result of the
development of a market economy. If

workers hope to stay competitive and get better jobs, they must
update their skills regularly. The grim situation in China's
labor market requires people to learn what the market needs and
conscientiously seek more skills for their future development.

CHINA-PRESS: Lecture on Peking Opera Makeup

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

RENMIN RIBAO

(People's Daily, Overseas Edition)

This May, Famous Peking Opera makeup master Yan Shaokui lectured
at length on makeup techniques for the famous Peking Opera to a
fascinated group of students from Europe, America, Asia and
Africa. Sponsored by Nanjing University's Department of Foreign
Students, the lecture included a display of hundreds of lively,
colorful Peking Opera makeups made of paper, clay or fiberglass-
reinforced plastic. Makeups ranged in size from one or two meters
to about 10 cm.

Yan introduced to the several dozen foreign students the
development and significance of the cosmetic makeups in the
evolution of the Peking Opera, the relationship between makeups
and Peking Opera, and some basic techniques for drawing. To
demonstrate, Yan applied a black makeup to his face and performed
a related role from the opera highlight.

In response to requests of audience, Yan painted some of their
faces as well. He deftly transformed Nina from Sweden into the
Monkey King after 20 minutes of magic. While doing varied makeups
for five additional women from the Republic of Korea, Japan and
Indonesia, Yan explained various dramatic allusions, the use of
color and drawing skills, which was thoroughly impressed the
audience.

It was a special treat for foreign students to learn from a
master in Peking Opera makeup. They found the makeups vivid and
charming and looked forward to learning more about Peking Opera.
Women whom Yan had made up left their new faces on a second day
to show off the makeups to their friends. They took numerous
photos as a memento of this quintessentially Beijing art form.

CHINA: Libraries Adapt to New Demands

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Our Staff Reporter Feng Jing

The excited librarians at the Shanghai Library ignored
this summer's sultry hot weather and busily packed the many books
shelved in the 40-year-old structure for shipment to a new
library complex.

The new library, which covers 3.1 hectares on Huaihai
Road in downtown Shanghai, has a total floor space of 83,000
square meters capable of shelving more than 13 million volumes.

The library's two main buildings--a 55.6-meter-high
structure and a 106-meter-high tower building--symbolize the
accumulation of human culture and pursuit of knowledge. The
compound is landscaped with lawns, flower beds, fountains and two
squares.

The library, scheduled for a limited opening by the end
of this year, offers 5,000 seats in 20-odd reading rooms
featuring books, periodicals, and audio-visual and electronic
packages catalogued in terms of differing disciplines. The
facility's expansive book lending center offers wide-ranging
works published during the last five-eight years.

The library is equipped with computer and
telecommunications technology for the management of purchasing,
cataloguing, circulation, public inquiries and lending systems.
It will also introduce a CD-ROM system and various specialized
databases for items such as classical and rare books and
contemporary photo archives. In addition, the complex will be
equipped with various audio-visual systems, facilities for the
production of audio-visual materials, cataloging and monitoring
systems, and satellite  dishes.

Deputy Director Wu Jianzhong noted that constantly
expanding public access to information requires libraries to
alter the previous practice of stressing book collections, and
instead place priority on improving services for readers. "We
will shift the focus of work from simply collecting books to
upgrading services,'' said Wu.

Library Expansion

Statistics show that the country had 392 scattered
libraries in large cities at the founding of New China in 1949.

By 1994, however, the number had soared to 258,477, with
more than 400,000 employees, housing collections of over 3
billion volumes. They facilities included 2,596 public libraries
above the county level, 1,080 university and college libraries,
more than 8,000 large and medium-sized libraries serving various
scientific research institutes, and a substantial number of
children's libraries and various libraries attached to trade
unions, primary and secondary schools, Party schools and army
units.

Since the 1980s, numerous library buildings featuring
diversified architectural styles have mushroomed in various
localities, with a new facility opening every couple of days.

The new library for the China National Museum, located in
the western suburbs of Beijing, is the pride of Chinese citizens.
The modern facility, which opened in 1987, is the largest library
in Asia and one of the top five libraries in the world, with its
design offering unique national flavor. The complex, with a total
floor space of 140,000 square meters, currently houses 16.7
million volumes, including 280,000 rare books from the
collections of imperial families in various dynasties and famous
private collections.

The Tibet Autonomous Region now has 50 libraries at
various levels. The first public library in the region was built
by the 18th Army Group of the People's Liberation Army in the
early 1950s. Soldiers led yak carrying gunnysacks full of books
to fill the shelves of the facility.

The new Tibet Library, the largest of its type in the
region, opened on July 1 this year. The modern multipurpose
library, which sits at the highest elevation compared to any
library in the world, mainly collects books and materials on
Tibetan studies, and will gradually be transformed into a major
center offering materials to Tibetanologists both at home and
abroad, and a major venue for comprehensive public education.

China currently has 427 libraries in minority nationality
areas.

New Technology

Many of the libraries have introduced new technology
such as computers, microfilm, xerox, audio-visual equipment, CDs,
automatic transmission and fire- and theft-resistant facilities.

Computer technology, the nucleus of modern technology, is
gaining increasing popularity. According to a 1995 study of 3,139
public, university and scientific research institute libraries
nationwide, subject facilities were equipped with 6,521
computers, 2,296 terminals, 1,076 databases for different
categories of information, 3,113 photo copy machines and 1.93
million audio-visual packages.

The National Library in Beijing, Zhongshan Library in
Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen Library are engaged in an
extensive effort to developing software and databases. Notable
progress has also been made in establishing a network linked to
the Zhongguancun Library in Beijing, a Beijing-Shanghai-Wuhan
computer network linking libraries of all institutes under the
China Academy of Sciences in the three localities, and a
satellite network for libraries attached to the People's
Liberation Army.

The National Library, the Beijing Eastern District
Library and various other libraries currently have reading rooms
offering electronic publications. China's first public computer
library--the Zhongnan Computer Library in Guangzhou City--opened
early last year. The facility which occupies 250 square meters in
the Guangzhou Library is equipped with computer operations and
software rooms, computer publications reading rooms, computer
sales halls, and expert reception rooms. The library offers
readers access to more than 100 computers and 200,000 sets of
software free of charge.

Capital Shortages

The public library in the bustling and hot city of
Shenzhen provides residents with a quiet and cool place to relax.
The current situation, however, is much different from only a few
years ago when capital shortages prevented the facility from
installing air-conditioners. A leading local government official
decreed that the library should be air conditioned prior to
occupation of the municipal government office building.

China's library system has developed despite the fact
that financial strain has hindered both construction and
operations. Capital shortages have led to the overuse of numerous
facilities, including the National Library in Beijing. In
addition, constant price hikes for publications in recent years
have resulted in a decline in the availability of new books and
periodicals in most public libraries. Du Ke, director of the
Library Division of the Ministry of Culture, noted that
government capital appropriations to public libraries have, in
fact, increased constantly, with annual funding soaring from less
than 60 million yuan in the 1980s to over 740 million yuan in
1995, a rate far exceeding that for national economic growth and
increases in financial revenue. Nonetheless, the admirable effort
has been unable to fully facilitate the developmental needs of
libraries.

Serving Economic Development

Qu Jiankang, director of the Shaanxian County Library in
Henan Province, was somewhat surprised at a meeting when a farmer
popped in to present him with over a dozen carp. The farmer
thanked Qu profusely, saying that the books Qu had sent on fish
breeding techniques and methods for treating aquatic diseases had
prevented him from losing as much as 100,000 yuan.

"Providing services to spur economic development is one
of our major tasks,'' said Qu. According to statistics for recent
years, despite being handicapped by limited operational funds of
only 280,000 yuan, the Shaanxian Library has provided various
sectors in the county with information and materials which have
helped to create over 6 million yuan in output value. Upon
learning that the county's chemical fertilizer plant planned to
launch an art paper manufacturing project, Qu invited the
factory's technology director to the library and provided him
with all related books and materials. The materials helped the
factory to quickly formulate construction and production plans
for the new facility and in turn saved 450,000 yuan in
construction funds alone.

In recent years, libraries at different levels in various
localities have provided materials and information for major
state and local construction projects, and in so  doing have
played an extremely important role in the country's economic
development. The National Library has contributed information and
materials to key projects involving mineral exploration, water
conservancy, metallurgy and geology. The Shanghai Library
provided invaluable assistance to the Huangpu River tunnel
project. The Gansu Provincial Library provided assistance to
construction of the Tianshui-Lanzhou, Lanzhou-Urumqi and Baotou-
Lanzhou railways, as well as to survey and design projects for
the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station. The Henan Provincial Library
joined in the Yellow River treatment project and the Hangzhou
Library participated in the cross-channel dike project for the
Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant. The Library of the China Academy of
Sciences has provided voluminous materials concerning the
ecological and environmental impact of the Three Gorges Project
on the Yangtze River. Services provided by the libraries have
helped to solve many technical problems, improve design, expedite
the progress of related projects and save construction funds.

Since 1986, libraries nationwide have worked in
cooperation with responsible departments to promote the Spark
Program, a major project the State Science and Technology
Commission introduced to expedite the industrialization and
commercialization of the results of scientific and technological
research. The goal of the program is to accelerate local economic
development. Some 70 libraries in Hunan Province have provided
more than 200 local Spark projects with follow-up services,
including 85 key projects. The libraries have compiled and
printed more than 40 scientific and technological information
pamphlets and 150 catalogs for specialized publications. In
addition, they have sponsored 250 practical technology training
courses which have attracted over 12,500 people.

Special Services

Many libraries now offer special services, with Beijing
libraries in particular recording notable progress in related
activities.

A 1986 survey conducted by the East District Library
revealed that the 25 clothing manufacturing factories in the
district accounting for the majority of both the total output
value and number of employees were in urgent need of adapting
themselves to rapid changes in the clothing market. The library
immediately formed a clothing information group. To facilitate
constantly increasing demand, in 1990 the library established the
clothing information section with a collection of several
thousand books and periodicals, and scores of video tapes on
fashion industries from more than a dozen countries and regions,
including the United States, France, Japan, Switzerland and
Italy. The information section, now known as the capital's
clothing information center, has introduced reading rooms which
attract numerous garment designers and manufacturers.

The West District Library, located in an area with
abundant cultural relics and tourism resources, has established a
tourism materials section which categorizes existing books,
periodicals and materials into tourism trends, scenic wonders in
China, scenic sites and folklore in Beijing, and special services
in the Chinese capital. It has also established cooperative
relations with the Lushan Library in Jiangxi Province, AT&T
(China) Co., and various travel services, with the effort
dedicated to arranging exchanges and sharing tourism information.
Last year, the section served more than 20,000 readers, or 40
percent of the library's total number of visitors. The section
lent more than 90,000 books and periodicals, with the figure
accounting for over 90 percent of the library's total circulation
volume.

In recent years, the Decorative Art Materials Section of
the Haidian District Library has attracted a growing number of
people engaged in arts and crafts, decoration and advertisement
design, and general readers with a strong affinity for the arts.

The Chongwen District Library offers a wide-ranging
collection of books on architecture, while the Xuanwu District
Library is known for its collections of books and materials on
folklore and packaging. The Capital Library is currently
accelerating formation of the Beijing Local Documents Database.

The past closed management style of Chinese libraries was
characterized by each facility pursuing the accumulation of large
quantities of materials and complete volumes of documents. The
approach resulted in duplicated collections and prevented the
full use of limited funds. Experts contend that the current
practice centering on each facility pursuing its own advantages
provides basic material conditions for the establishment of
cooperation networks which will promote share and inter-library
lending. The formation of said networks will also help
rationalize the use of funds.

Knowledge Pool

Two-year-old Yangyang frequently visits her grandparents
on weekends, with her parents seizing the opportunity to visit
the local library.

In recent years, the couple, university graduates who
respectively earned degrees in oceanography and chemistry in the
late 1980s, have regularly visited the local library on Sundays
to update their knowledge and information.

Along with the rapid development of the market economy
and the increasingly fierce competition in the job and
information markets, many people, particularly those in rapidly
growing localities, opt to supplement their knowledge with
information provided by libraries.

The Shenzhen Library's annual practice of issuing new
book cards represents a special occasion in the city. As many as
10,000 people often queue in front of the library from dawn to
dusk, with some even coming on the previous night. According to
statistics, the Shenzhen Library now serves 5,400 readers daily.

Rural township libraries have mushroomed in southern
Jiangsu Province since 1990, with more than 430 townships in
Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou cities opening facilities by 1994.

Each library in the 35 townships in Wuxi County, Wuxi
City, have collections exceeding 10,000 volumes. The libraries,
which have a total of 600,000 volumes, serve 1.2 million rural
readers annually, with their combined circulation surpassing 2
million volumes.

Rural families in southern Jiangsu traditionally hold a
family feast on the evening of the Winter Solstice. On last
year's Winter Solstice, however, many residents of Luoshe Town,
Wuxi County, visited the local library after dinner, filling the
300-square-meter reading room. The visitors refused to leave
despite a power outage. Librarians proceeded to light candles,
and the over 100 avid readers, ignoring the dim light, continued
reading until closing time.

CHINA: High-Tech: A Hope for China's Agriculture

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Our Staff Reporter Zhou Xin

Can China solve its agricultural problems? Practice of the Sino-
Israeli Demonstration Farm offers a positive answer. By relying
on advanced agrotechnology, China will create a new miracle in
agricultural production.

The Sino-Israeli Demonstration Farm (SIDF), which is located in
the southeastern suburbs of Beijing, has attracted worldwide
attention since its establishment two years ago. No visitor from
any part of the country hesitates to express admiration for the
high yields brought about by high technology.

The four large white greenhouses, the most eye-catching
structures in the farm, are totally controlled by computers, in
which high-yield and quality crops introduced from Israel are
planted. According to Zhu Hongfeng, head of the farm, the
greenhouses, which were imported from Israel, are fairly
advanced. The two insulating layers on the ceilings keep the
greenhouses warm in winter, and protect plants from the scorching
sun and lower the temperature in summer. These devices can be
moved automatically to ensure the necessary temperature for
different stages of vegetable growth.

The trickle irrigation system, a symbol of Israel's high
agrotechnology, crisscrosses the farm's 75-hectare field. This
water-efficient system ensures the crops  fully absorb moisture
and fertilizer.

Israel and China face common problems in agriculture, namely
infertile land, drought and water shortage. However, the former
has solved its problems by applying high technology.

Chinese agronomists hold that the advanced agrotechnology
displayed by the farm is highly suitable for China, especially
for the arid and water-deficient inland areas in northwest
regions, such as Gansu and Ningxia which were widely considered
as places unworthy of agricultural development.

A bare fact may well explain why Chinese farmers show such a
great interest in Israel's irrigation system. The system enables
the SIDF to create several firsts in vegetable production. For
example, the quarterly output of tomatoes has reached 5,500 kg
per mu (1 mu equals 1/15 hectare), three-four times that produced
by individual farmer households. Green pepper's output hits
15,000 kg per mu, with one pepper weighing 700-800 grams.

The key to the success of the farm lies in the country's longing
for agricultural modernization. In many parts of China, farmers
still sow seeds manually and plough their fields with the aid of
ox. The backward farming techniques lead to low yields and
vulnerability of grain production to natural disasters, typically
annual flood in the south and drought spells in the north.

Due to the underdevelopment of agriculture, China has long been
obsessed by the grain issue and the question of how to fulfill
the growing demand for quality farm produce following the
constant increase of incomes. In addition, the low income from
farming has driven numerous farmers to cities, resulting in the
short supply of raw materials for industrial production, a major
factor restricting the development of the national economy.

Early this year, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
reported that China lags behind Western countries by 15-20 years
in terms of the comprehensive level of agricultural science and
technology. The per-unit yield of many crops is lower than the
average international level. To narrow this gap, China has
introduced from other countries more than 1,000 advanced
agrotechnologies during the past five years. Prior to the year
2000, the country plans to invest US$500 million for importing
another 1,000 advanced, applicable agrotechnologies.

Some people have asked whether the SIDF mode can be popularized
throughout the country. Undoubtedly, fine quality farm produce
would bring about generous profits. However, if unable to be
universalized, such high-tech agriculture featuring high input,
high output and high profits still faces an unpredictable market
in China.

According to Zhu, as the supply of his farm's products currently
falls short of demand, Beijing citizens can hardly get them on
the market. In fact, the farm's products are mostly bought by
luxury hotels because their price is four-five times that of
ordinary vegetables on Beijing market.

The SIDF is now trying to lower cost by combining imported
technology with local farmers' traditional practices. For
instance, the farm has built brick greenhouses and equipped them
with Israeli trickle irrigation and computer control systems.
Saving expenses for importing specially made greenhouses has
enabled the farm to cut the per-mu production cost by several
thousand yuan.

Zhu said that the per-capita productivity of his 170-staff farm
has attained a fairly high level and annually earns a net income
of 50,000 yuan from one mu of vegetable. "If the production scale
further expands, costs will drop further,'' assured an official
from the Ministry of Agriculture.

Expansion of the use of high technology is essential for China to
realize agricultural modernization and intensification. China is
cooperating with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and
other international institutions to explore effective ways for
spreading high agrotechnologies. The SIDF has become a base in
this regard. In spring this year, the farm began to host on-site
training courses for farmers from all over the country. The
farmers were taught the skills to grow the varieties bred by the
farm.

China plans to increase the contributory rate of science and
technology to agriculture from 35 percent to 50 percent by the
end of this century, and gives priority to importing applicable
advanced technology to enable more Chinese farmers to directly
benefit from agrotechnology.

Modern agrotechniques have not only enabled Chinese farmers to
gain direct economic results, but also provided foreign business
people with an opportunity to enter Chinese agricultural market.

Officials of the Israeli embassy in China assess the beneficial
results of the SIDF every month, and recently revealed the plan
of establishing two similar farms in other parts of the country.
An official of Chinese Ministry of Agriculture noted that the
SIDF has produced an advertising effect.

Li Hongyi, head of a Shandong farm, expressed willingness to buy
equipment and seeds as those used by the SIDF. He even intended
to employ one or two Israeli agronomists.

The SIDF, called by the Chinese as a "modernized agricultural
factory'', opens up a bright prospect for China's agriculture. An
economist noted that the time has come for China to create the
second miracle in agriculture by relying on high technology.

The first miracle emerged in the early 1980s following the
abolishment of the people's commune system and introduction of
the system of contracted responsibility for tilling the land. The
farmers' enthusiasm was greatly aroused, and in turn the
country's grain output increased by 80 billion kg in the
subsequent nine years. The effort is commonly regarded as a
system revolution, and now China is envisaging a technological
revolution.

CHINA: Chinese Foreign Ministry News Briefings

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Spokesman Shen Guofang.PI DAWEI

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang told reporters
attending last week's regularly scheduled news briefings that
Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Sheikh
Hasina will pay an official visit to China between September 12-
16, 1996, at the invitation of Premier Li Peng.

Shen then opened the floor for questions.

Q: Would you comment on the two missile attacks the US military
delivered against Iraq?

A: We deeply regret and are strongly dissatisfied with the fact
that the United States attacked Iraq with missiles, causing
casualties and property damages. The use of force against a
sovereign country not only represents a serious violation of
international norms, but also heightens the already tense
situation in the region and creates the possibility for serious
adverse effects. The Chinese government reiterates that Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected. We
sincerely hope that all parties concerned will immediately cease
military operations to relieve the tense situation in the region,
and will in turn reach a just and reasonable resolution to
problems lingering from the Gulf War through political dialogue
and on the basis of relevant UN resolutions.

Q: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat held their first summit on September 4.
How does China view the meeting?

A: China supports all steps leading to the realization of a just
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We believe the summit
between the two leaders will help Israel and Palestine establish
mutual trust and resume peace talks at the earliest possible
date. We sincerely hope that all parties concerned will observe
previous agreements in order to remove all remaining obstacles to
push forward the peace process under the principle of "land for
peace."

Q: The People's Liberation Army Daily recently carried an article
entitled "Losing 1,000 Ounce of Gold is Preferable to Losing One
Inch of Land." Does this mean the Chinese government will assume
an uncompromising attitude on the issue of the Diaoyu Islands at
the risk of losing 400 billion Japanese yen in loans?

A: The issue of Japanese loans is a totally different matter from
safeguarding China's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
Japanese loans to China will benefit bilateral trade and economic
cooperation. Nonetheless, the Chinese government offers no room
for compromise and will take whatever action is necessary to
safeguard China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. We duly
note that China and Japan have disputed control of the Diaoyu
Islands. Therefore, we propose that both sides shelve
disagreements and jointly develop resources in the islands.
Neither side should resort to any action which will heighten
tensions concerning the situation.

Q: According to recent reports, the Dalai Lama is scheduled to
visit Australia. What is China's position?

A: We believe the Dalai Lama is not only a religious figure, but
more importantly a political figure in exile. Therefore, we
maintain that any country maintaining normal diplomatic relations
with China should not host visits by the aforementioned political
figure. We also believe that any country maintaining normal
diplomatic relations with China is blatantly interfering in
China's internal affairs by hosting the Dalai Lama.

Q: According to recent reports, Taiwan's Li Teng-hui informed
Australian reporters that he would like to visit Australia. How
would a visit by Li affect Sino-Australian relations?

A: China and Australia currently maintain normal diplomatic
relations, with political, trade and economic ties developing
rapidly in recent years. Therefore,  Australia should refrain
from meddling in China's internal affairs on the Taiwan issue. We
sincerely hope that Australia will honor its commitments in
accordance with the joint communique for the establishment of
Sino-Australian diplomatic ties by refraining from developing
official relations with Taiwan. Any other course will seriously
affect Sino-Australian relations.

Q: German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will meet Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen at the end of September in New York. He also
hopes to visit China in October to pave the way for a November
visit by the German president. Does this indicate the
normalization of Sino-German relations?

A: China attaches great importance to developing relations with
Germany, with economic and political ties expanding rapidly in
recent years. However, various factors earlier this year created
a strain in Sino-German relations. We hope the meeting between
the German foreign minister and Qian Qichen will be successful
and will in turn return Sino-German relations to a course of
sound development.

CHINA: The world has reason to watch for whither Japan is heading Japan:
Don't Do Anything Foolish

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by People's Daily Commentator

In the last few weeks Japan has carried out a series of
provocative actions over the Chinese territory, Diaoyu Islands,
situated between Taiwan and southern Japan.

On July 14, the right-wing Japanese Youth Foundation built a
lighthouse on Diaoyu Island, the main island of the islets, and
the Japanese government announced an exclusive economic zone of
200 nautical miles on July 20, taking in the Chinese islands.

Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda then openly claimed that
the Diaoyu Islands belong to Japan and that there is no need to
justify this claim.

On August 18, a right-wing group from Japan's southern Okinawa-
ken put up a board on one of the islands with a drawing of the
Japanese flag.

There are reports that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
ordered the military to prepare for any contingency and that the
Japanese authorities even went so far as to threaten force if
necessary.

The Chinese people will not stand by violation of their
territorial integrity. The Diaoyu Islands, like Taiwan, are an
inalienable and indisputable part of China since ancient times.

Evidence dating back as early as the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),
when Chinese fishermen conducted activities in this area, prove
the islands are part of China.

Japan seized Taiwan and its surrounding islands, including the
Diaoyu Islands, during the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895. In
April 1895, the government of the Qing Dynasty was forced to sign
the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and ceded the islands to Japan.

After World War II, a defeated Japan returned Taiwan to China,
but privately handed the Diaoyu Islands over to the United
States. In 1971, the US government illegally returned the Diaoyu
Islands to Japan, an action the Chinese government strongly
opposed.

When Japan and China normalized relations in 1972 and signed the
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1978, the two
countries, taking overall relations into account, agreed to
settle the issue of the Diaoyu Islands in the future.

Japan, however, broke its promise and has intensified its efforts
to create instability and stir up trouble. Japan tried to
strengthen the symbolic significance of its occupation of the
Diaoyu Island by playing the shameless card of "if I have
occupation, I have possession."

It is well known that in international relationships, the issue
of ownership of territory is the most crucial. Japan has upset
this sensitive balance many times recently and evidently wants to
take advantage of the changes in the political situation in East
Asia since the end of the Cold War to demonstrate its power to
the outside world and to test China's determination to safeguard
its territory and sovereignty.

China has always handled the issue holistically and cherishes
friendly relations with Japan. China's stand on the Diaoyu
Islands is to put aside their dispute and jointly exploit the
region on the precondition that China has sovereignty.

Over that past 100 years, the Chinese people have never kow-towed
to foreign powers. They won back the independence and sovereignty
of the country with the blood and lives of millions of people.

Today, if anyone thinks China's 1.2 billion people will surrender
even one inch of soil, they are indulging in fantasy; if anyone
holds the illusion that the Chinese people will yield to foreign
forces, they are day dreaming; if anybody wants to take advantage
of the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits,
they are making a grave mistake. The Chinese people are united
and adamant about maintaining their territorial integrity.

Japan's challenge to China's sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands
is not accidental but is an inevitable result of emerging
rightist elements in Japan's internal political situation and
Japan's intention to flex its muscle.

To illustrate this tendency recently, many Japanese have
distorted the country's history, glorified its war of aggression
and imbued its countrymen with a sense of militarism.

Some Japanese politicians are exaggerating the so-called "China
threat," trying their best to sow dissent between China and its
neighboring countries and inventing an excuse for the expansion
of its forces.

The Japanese government has strengthened the Japan-US security
system, expanded the scope of defense beyond Japan's borders and
even talked about "watching for trends of the Chinese military"
in its official defense white paper. Japan has continually
increased its military expenditure, built up its weaponry and
tried its best to send its forces abroad.

Asian countries have long expressed their concern that Japan
would embark on its old road of militarism. These fears are not
groundless as this series of activities seem to prove. Asian
countries should tell those expansionist Japanese not to do
anything foolish. At the same time, Asia must maintain high
vigilance over Japan's actions.

CHINA: Rightist Comeback in Japan: Cause for Vigilance

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Da Jun

Diaoyu Islands  Denial of Massacre   Denial of aggression  Balm
Visiting Yasukuni Shrine

This summer, Japanese rightists, with the connivance and and
support of the Japanese government, built a lighthouse and
erected a Japanese flag on the Diaoyu Island, the largest of the
Diaoyu Islands which have been part of China's territory since
ancient times. This provocative act cannot but arouse strong
indignation from the Chinese people as a wanton encroachment upon
China's territory.

Attempts

A review of Sino-Japanese relations suggests that Japan began to
covet China's Diaoyu Islands long ago.

In the late 1960s, large deposits of oil and natural gas were
discovered off the islands. The Japanese unilaterally took a
series of actions attempting to establish claim over the
territory. They first sent  exploration teams and then cruise
boats to the islands, removing the original Chinese marks and
replacing them with Japanese ones. They also renamed eight islets
in Japanese.

In 1978, when China and Japan were negotiating the signing of a
treaty of peace and friendship, some members of the Japanese Diet
(parliament) demanded that China recognize Japan's sovereignty
over the islands. The Japanese government, in answer to the
rightists' calls, dispatched patrol boats and airplanes to
monitor Chinese fishing boats working near the islands.

In May 1979, the Japanese shipped personnel and equipment to
Diaoyu Island and built a helicopter airport there. They also
sent an investigation team and a surveying mission to the area.

In October 1990, when the West was imposing sanctions against
China, Japanese rightists, with an understanding from the
government, built a beacon tower on one of the islets. The
Japanese government sent 12 ships and two helicopters to prevent
Taiwanese fishing boats from moving toward the islands.

These facts indicate that Japan's every move on Diaoyu Islands
was designed not only to attempt to seize the resources in the
vicinity but also to use the issue to plot against China. The
events occuring this summer well illustrate the issue.

Japan unexpectedly announced that it would redesignate July 20 as
Ocean Day and set it aside as a national holiday once again --
July 20 was a national holiday before World War II. The Japanese
royal prince and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto attended the
celebrations. On the same day, Japan officially began to
implement the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and
the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. By so doing Japan
expanded its waters by more than 10 times -- altogether more than
6 million square kilometers, the sixth largest in the world.

It seems, therefore, that Japan's celebration of the Ocean Day is
not purely incidental. The seizure of Diaoyu Island would add to
Japan's already large waters and resources on its continental
shelf. No wonder the Japanese government connived at the
rightists' activities on Diaoyu Island.

A Rightist Comeback

While the rightists were staging their shows on Diaoyu Island,
the Japanese cabinet adopted the 1996 defense white paper. The
official document contained such statements as "continuing to
watch for trends of the Chinese military," "Russia no longer a
threat to Japan" and "further cementing military cooperation with
the United States." It specifically blamed the military exercises
conducted by the Chinese Liberation Army in March 1996 for
"creating tensions across the Taiwan Straits."

The publication of the white paper is believed to be a result of
closer US-Japanese military cooperation, which occurred after US
President Bill Clinton visited Japan in April this year. While
expanding military cooperation with the United States, Japan put
China on top of its hypothetical enemy list.

There are other signs that indicate a comeback of rightism in
Japan. Some Japanese politicians openly deny the existence of
"comfort women" that the Japanese government recruited during
World War II for its Imperial Army. Prime Minister Hashimoto
openly visited the Yasukuni Shrine which houses the remains of
many top Japanese war criminals for worship. An art show
featuring Japanese atrocities during the Nanjing Massacre of 1937
had to be canceled in Osaka because of rightist threats.

On August 15, the 51st anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War
II, some Japanese staged a farce in Yasukuni Shrine, reopening
the old wound of other Asian nations. On that day, some ex-
Imperial Army soldiers put on their military uniform with a saber
on their belt, parading around the shrine. Some Diet members
joined the farce in shouting slogans such as "the Great East Asia
War was a sacred war" and "Tojo was innocent." Then they paid
homage to the shrine honoring the war criminals.

In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II,
Japan, instead of repenting its war record, intensified its
efforts to justify their acts of war in total defiance of world
opinion. A number of ministers and Diet members denied Japan's
history of aggression and, in an attempt to divert attention from
the government's attitude toward World War II, condemned China's
nuclear testing instead.

The so-called "no-war" resolution that was supposed to assure the
world of Japan's remorse over its past and determination for
peace was adopted by the House of Representative only and failed
to address the fundamental issues.

Japan has sought to become a political and military power. In
addition to whitewashing history, it has also broken the taboos
of limiting its military spending to less than 1 percent of the
gross national product and of not sending forces overseas.
Japan's Self-Defense Forces, armed with the most advanced
offensive weapons and spending US$50 billion annually, have
become a military force to be reckoned with. In 1996, Japan
expanded its range of defense to include the entire Asia-Pacific
region. These developments have aroused suspicion and vigilance
from many of Japan's Asian neighbors, including China.

Roots

After the end of World War II, although some major war criminals
such as Hideki Tojo were condemned to hang by the International
Tribunal, a number of other die-hard militarists who held
unshirkable responsibility for launching that war of aggression
were shielded by the occupying US forces as part of the US Cold
War strategy. Shortly after the war, many war criminals who had
not paid for their military crimes were set free by the United
States or its allies. Aided by rightists in the political and
financial circles, these ex-war criminals made a comeback in the
political arena and assumed major government offices, including
the office of prime minister. The question of whether that war
was a just or an unjust one, therefore, has never been answered
in clear-cut terms in Japan.

In sharp contrast, Germany, which was one of the three Axis
powers during World War II, took a completely different attitude.
In 1970, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt knelt down in front
of the Warsaw Monument in memory of the Jews persecuted by Nazi
Germany during World War II. The world responded with
forgiveness. That act was possible because Germany under joint
occupation by the Allied powers took on a demilitarized approach
to history. In Germany, war criminals and those associated with
Nazism were under strong pressure from the government and the
society. Even to this day, Nazi war criminals at large are still
being hunted down. The Germans have been appraised of the Fascist
crimes and their grave consequences. Attempts to revive Nazism
are getting nowhere in Germany.

Japan's economic success has also lent to the uprise of the
conservative forces in Japan. With rightism and nationalism
running rampant, many Japanese choose not to confront their
history of aggression and disregard national feelings of other
peoples. Some Japanese attempt to cover up aggression in the
textbooks and the media. On the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, they confuse the perpetrators with victims of war.
Propped up by a sense of racial superiority, they increasingly
look down upon other Asian nations. In the eyes of many Japanese,
Japan is fast becoming a major power in the world.

CHINA: Backgrounder: History Proves Diaoyu Islands Are China's Territory

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China  Russia  DPRK  ROK  Japan  Diaoyu Islands  Ryukyu Islands
Taiwan Province

The Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea between China and
Japan, have belonged to China since ancient times. The islands
include some small islands and reefs, with the Diaoyu Island the
largest one covering an area of five square kilometers. Lacking
fresh water, no one can live there.

The islands are 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan, 200
nautical miles east of China's mainland and 200 nautical miles
west of Japan's southernmost island Okinawa.

Geologically the islands are attached to Taiwan. The waters
around the islands are 100 to 150 meters deep and there is a
2,000-meter deep oceanic trench between the islands and Japan's
Okinawa islands.

Fishermen from China's Taiwan and Fujian and other provinces have
fished and collected herbs here for centuries.

The islands are recorded in a book published during the rule of
Yong Le (1403 to 1424 AD) in the Ming Dynasty, more than 400
years before Japan claimed discovery of the Diaoyu islands in
1884. Since then many historical documents refer to the islands.

In the 15th century during the Ming Dynasty, China included the
Diaoyu Islands into its coastal defense area. In 1556, General Hu
Zongxian was appointed governor to fight Japanese pirates and
defend the coastal area including the Diaoyu Islands.

A map published in Japan between 1783 and 1785 marking the
boundary of the Ryukyu Kingdom showed the Diaoyu Islands as
belonging to China.

Japan never questioned China's sovereignty over the islands
before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895.

In April 1895, the government of the Qing Dynasty was forced to
sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which China ceded the whole
island of Taiwan and its surrounding islands including the Penghu
Islands to Japan.

Only since then has Japan had its own name for the area where the
Diaoyu Islands are located. Before that, Japanese maps marked the
islands by their Chinese names.

Japan was occupied by the United States after it was defeated in
World War II.

In 1951, Japan and the United States illegally signed a treaty in
San Francisco without the presence of China, which was one of the
victor countries in the World War II.

Although Article 2 of the treaty said that Japan surrendered its
claim over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, Article 3 wrongly
assigned the Diaoyu Islands, which Japan had stolen from China,
and other islands, to the Ryukyu zone which was under US control.

The then Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai lodged a strong protest and
said the Chinese government would never recognize the San
Francisco Treaty.

In a statement on territorial waters in 1958, the Chinese
government said that Japan should return all the territory of the
People's Republic of China including Taiwan and the islands
around it to China.

On November 11, 1969, Japan and the United States signed an
agreement to return the Okinawa islands to Japan. In 1971, the
United States, proceeding from its Cold War policy against China,
returned the area under its trusteeship including the Diaoyu
Islands to Japan.

The Japanese government thereby regarded the islands as a part of
its Okinawa-ken prefecture and included them in the "air defense
distinguishing rim" of its Self-Defense Forces.

On this situation, the Chinese government issued a solemn
statement on December 30, 1971, announcing that the Diaoyu
islands are islands attached to Taiwan and they, like Taiwan,
have always been an alienable part of Chinese territory since
ancient times.

Consequently, it is an indisputable fact that the Diaoyu Islands
have historically been a part of China's territory.

The issue of the Diaoyu Islands once served as an obstacle to the
normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and the conclusion of
the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Taking into
consideration the overall interest to develop Sino-Japanese
friendship, the then Chinese and Japanese governments agreed to
settle the issue in the future.

However, the Japanese side has broken its promise repeatedly and
provoked incidents one after another in recent years in an
attempt to seize the islands.

CHINA: US Unilateral Action Protested

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China will by no means accept the unilateral action by the United
States of cutting China's 1996 textile export quota, a spokesman
for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said
on September 7.

The United States announced on Friday that it would cut its
import quota of this year's 13 categories of textiles from China
by 195,001 dozen and 134,029 kilograms, alleging that Chinese
textile products had been trans-shipped.

The spokesman described the cut as a severe violation of the
textile agreement reached between China and the United States,
because the US government took the action unilaterally without
presenting sufficient evidence and without full consultations.

After the United States presented a number of illegal textile
trans-shipment cases to China at the end of October 1995,
according to the spokesman, the Chinese side made a careful
investigation. The two sides exchanged views in Beijing between
March 25 and 27 this year, conscientiously checking related
materials of these cases. said the spokesman.

Judging by the materials provided, some cases were engineered
either by persons engaged in trans-shipment or by importers, and
others by individuals engaged in trans-shipment in collaboration
with importers, the spokesman stated and added that the Chinese
enterprises were wholly innocent of the transactions.

To further check the cases, the Chinese side wrote to the US side
on April 26 for more evidence. To date, however, the US side had
not provided any, but instead has made a unilateral assumption,
the spokesman noted. The Chinese government will by no means
accept it, he stressed.

The spokesman pointed out that the US government has continuously
raised obstacles to China's export of textiles to the United
States in recent years, severely hindering the Sino-US textile
trade.

He said that the Chinese government hopes that the Clinton
administration will reconsider its decision, with a stand
conducive to the development of Sino-US trade, and cancel the
import deduction action.

Otherwise, the spokesman said, the Chinese government will have
to respond further and the US side will be responsible for the
consequences.

CHINA: Minority Cities Step Up Opening

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

A number of cities in ethnic minority regions of China have made
satisfying achievements in foreign trade and inter-city economic
cooperation, according to a meeting of mayors from capital cities
of the country's autonomous regions which was held recently in
Hohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia.

Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, completed
370 economic cooperation projects valued at 400 million yuan over
the past five years. During the first two quarters of this year
alone, foreign-funded enterprises in Urumqi exported products
valued at about US$13 million, up 65 percent on the 1995 period,
with major exports centering on machinery, clothing and woolen
products.

Hohhot has established cooperative ventures with some 20-odd
nations and regions in the wool spinning, electronics and leather
processing industries. It is currently home to some 180 foreign-
funded firms which yielded a total output value of 760 million
yuan.

Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, has established
solid relations with 15 foreign and domestic cities. It sponsors
economic and trade talks during the annual Sour Milk Festival
with last year's talks ending with consummation of 17 agreements.

Yanji City in east China's Jilin Province, approved 17 foreign-
funded enterprises during the first six months this year, raising
the number of such ventures in the city to 383, with total
investments reaching US$4.4 billion.

CHINA: Grain Yields Exceed Expectations

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

The Chinese government procured 9.08 million tons of early rice
by the end of August this year, substantially surpassing figures
covered by the purchase contracts signed with farmers last year.

According to its contracts with the farmers, the state had
expected to purchase 7.96 million tons of early rice.

A report released by the State Grain Reserve Administration
attributed the increased purchase to this summer's record-
breaking early rice harvest of 44 million tons -- an increase of
1.79 million tons from last year.

Summer grain generally accounts for 25 percent of the total
annual grain yield.

Although the total rice yield surpassed expectations, not all of
the 10 major early rice producing provinces enjoyed increased
harvests this year. Jiangxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Hainan have
increased their early rice production, but Anhui, Hubei and
Sichuan provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, all
of which have experienced heavy floods, were unable to meet last
year's rice yield.

With bumper harvests and high sale prices, each farmer expects to
enjoy a net income of 1,800 yuan this year, an increase of about
5 percent over last year.

However, cotton harvests this year will probably decrease by more
than 1 million tons from the 4.5 million tons harvested last
year, according to agricultural sources.

CHINA: Healthy School Meals

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Students who eat lunch at school can expect safer and more
nutritious meals, following a new regulation on the hygiene of
school meals.

The regulation was introduced by the Ministry of Public Health
recently and is targeted at improving the quality of school
meals, reducing cases of food poisoning and guaranteeing the
healthy physical development of Chinese children.

Under this regulation, all staff preparing and distributing
school meals must receive professional training in nutrition. The
meals must meet national hygiene standards and be properly
packaged to avoid contamination during transportation.

The regulation also encourages each school to assign a special
supervisor to oversee the general quality of the meals.

The ministry has also made public the daily intake of nutrients
recommended for children as reference for meal providers.

Schools are required to order meals only from licensed producers.
They must set up facilities for storing the meals hygienically
and for students to wash their hands and clean utensils.

Meal suppliers and schools who violate the above regulations will
be punished according to the food hygiene legislation. Serious
cases will be brought to court.

In Beijing, about 20 percent of all school children eat school
meals, according to a sample survey of 1,100 schools taken last
year.

About 5 percent of the meals are provided by individual
producers, the rest by school canteens.

School lunches are convenient for both students and their
families, but some meals are inadequate and pose a threat to the
students' health, said Zhu Peifu, a spokesman from the Ministry
of Public Health. He said some meal providers sell unhygienic or
even spoiled food to the students, and this can result in food
poisoning.

CHINA: Rail Opens Linking Beijing and HK

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China's new backbone railway line linking Beijing with Kowloon
officially opened on September 1. The first passenger train left
Beijing West Station the same day and arrived at its destination-
-Shenzhen 38 hours later.

At the opening ceremony in Beijing, Railway Minister Han Zhubin
said that the line will greatly alleviate the country's north-
south transportation pressure and improve China's overall railway
system.

The railway runs 2,553 km through Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong,
Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Guangdong before reaching Hong
Kong.

Sources from the ministry say that initially 40 freight trains
and 10 passenger trains will run daily at an average speed of 60
km per hour. The new passenger trains will run between Beijing
and Shenzhen, Beijing and Hefei, Jiujiang and Shenzhen, and
Wuchang and Shantou. Tianjin to Lianyungang services will also
make use of the new line.

The railway bureaus of Beijing, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Shanghai,
Nanchang plus the Guangzhou Railway Corp will share management.

Shenzhen people celebrated, convinced that the line will benefit
the fast growing economic development of Guangdong Province and
improve relations between the province and Hong Kong.

Officials from Shantou, Dongguan, Huizhou and Heyuan cities
located along the new rail line in Guangdong are even more
delighted. Months before the railway opened they had organized
trade fairs in Hong Kong to woo investors.

Heyuan and Huizhou cities are deliberating opening foreign
railway ports to link directly with Hong Kong, which now accounts
for about 70 percent of Guangdong's foreign investment and 80
percent of the province's foreign trade.

"The operation of the railway will also benefit Hong Kong," a
senior Hong Kong railway official said at a press conference in
Shenzhen on September 1.

The Ministry of Railways is ready to open passenger train
services between the Chinese capital and Hong Kong, according to
Sun Yongfu, vice-minister of railways.

The construction of the 40 billion yuan railway project started
in 1993 and was completed last November. Students Guaranteed

CHINA: Archives: Records For Future

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Archives would become increasingly important in the 21st century,
Chinese Premier Li Peng said when addressing the opening ceremony
of the 13th International Congress on Archives in Beijing on
September 2.

People need to draw on the wisdom and experience of their
predecessors to achieve development and prosperity and to deal
with complicated circumstances, Li said.

Over 2,600 delegates from 130 countries and regions attended the
six-day global congress -- the first held in a developing country
since the International Council of Archives (ICA) was set up in
1950. It was also the last grand gathering of top world
archivists for this century.

The theme of the congress is ''archives at the end of the
century, taking stock and looking ahead.''

Archives are the authentic recordings of the social activities of
human beings, stepping stones of the progress of human
civilization and an important component of the world cultural
heritage, the Chinese Premier said.

He called upon the international archive community to further
preserve and enhance the world's valuable heritage and provide
authentic historical records for future generations.

China has a long history and is a nation with a brilliant
culture, Li said, adding that thanks to the fine tradition of a
long-standing commitment to archives, the Chinese culture has
been carried forward from generation to generation and the
Chinese civilization maintains its strong cohesive force.

He said the Chinese government always looks upon the archives as
a major undertaking for preserving the original features of a
nation and as an important resource for the administration and
development of a country.

Governments at all levels attach importance to strengthening
guidance and supervision over archival work and have brought such
work in line with the agenda of various administrations and
social-development programs to ensure continuous and healthy
progress.

"Archives have played an important role in the Chinese reform and
opening policy and in its socialist modernization drive,'' Li
said.

The congress discussed the history and future of archival work in
various countries, global trends in legislation on archives, the
development strategy of international archival circles and other
important issues.

CHINA: Forum on Asia: A Commitment to Peace

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China's destiny is closely linked with that of other countries in
Asia, Chinese Premier Li Peng said while addressing the 21st
Century Forum.

"China's development needs a stable and prosperous Asia; and
Asia's development needs a stable and prosperous China," Li added
in his keynote speech entitled "The Impact of China's Development
and the Rise of Asia on the World".

The premier stated that China will always be committed to world
peace. "The Chinese government and the Chinese people care
greatly about the future of Asia, and we stand ready to work with
other Asian countries for the stability and development of this
region," Li added.

The forum, sponsored by the country's top political advisory
body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC), was closed on September 6 after three days of
discussions. Over 500 statesmen and scholars from across the
globe, including former US President George Bush, former US
Secretary of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger and former
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, attended the forum.

The participants discussed China's role in the next century and
future political and economic trends for Asia's development.

The forum concluded that Asia has a promising 21st century and
that it should contribute even more to world peace and
development.

According to Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, one of the
participants at the forum, the next century will see Asia recover
its place in the world.

"For East Asia to maintain its rapid growth, peace and stability
must be secured. East and West together are responsible for the
future," Lee remarked while addressing the forum.

He also suggested that various nations learn to accommodate and
adjust to each other, even when they cannot agree.

He said that although most Western analysts view the rise of
China as a de-stabilizing influence on the present world order,
China has the power to demonstrate that, in the year 2020, a
huge, prosperous nation of 1.3 billion people, with a per-capita
GDP about one-fourth of that in the United States, can only be
better for the world than an impoverished and unstable nation of
the same population.

Lee emphasized that growth in China and the rest of East Asia
will provide opportunities for the West, and will also produce a
steadier global balance, both economic and strategic.

Talking about relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits, Lee said that he considered it impossible for Taiwan to
be independent against the will of a united and an economically
powerful China.

In his opinion, the two sides of the Straits should not get into
military competition, and neither the United States nor Europe
should look for excuses to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan.

Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in his remarks
at the forum that the United States and China have a common stake
in Asia's progress and stability and must work together to make a
"decisive contribution to work order".

"Some in America are calling for a containment policy toward
China as they watch her rise to industrial strength. But this is
an illusion," Kissinger stated emphatically, adding, "Such a
policy would have exactly the opposite effect and will have no
takers."

CHINA-CULTURE: The Sci & Ed Program Behind Olympic Golds

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

ZHANG YANHUI

Xu Yiming, chief coach of the Chinese Diving Team, is training Fu
Mingxia with a kind of special apparatus.

While people acclaim the combatant spirit and superb skills of
the Chinese athletes at the 26th Olympic Games, few know that
behind the athletes and coaches embracing each other for the
victories, there is a cause that helps the moulding of gold
medalists--the Science and Education Program of the State
Physical Culture and Sports Commission (SPCSC).

Athletics has evolved from the first stages of running, jumping,
throwing and pushing to the high level of today. In human
challenge to the limit of physical potential, it is not enough to
merely rely on the arduous training of athletes. They should know
at what time and under what condition can each muscle of the body
give forth the greatest strength, and be good at using it, just
as they should do in relation to a precision instrument. This is
what the sports scientific research studies.

According to Lu Xiaojie, deputy head of the Science and
Technology Division under the Department of Science and Education
of the SPCSC, the domestic sports scientific research focuses on
four fields of sports psychology, fatigue elimination, skill
appraisal and skill examination. The commission has allocated
special money since 1985 for scientific research and technical
service. It put in 2 million yuan in 1994 and organized 200
experts from 20 scientific research institutions into groups to
apply research results in practice. Among the 56 scientific
research subjects, major events, such as gymnastics, swimming and
weightlifting, involve excellent athletes Wang Junxia, Gao
Hongmiao and Cheng Xiaoyan who have special subject groups to
help monitor and instruct their training.

Li Furong, director of the SPCSC Training Bureau, noted that an
important experience of the Chinese Table-Tennis Team in
maintaining their dominance in the world for over three decades
is placing priority on theory. In effect, the remarkable progress
made in many other sports events is inseparable from sports
scientific research. The experts of the Chinese Swimming Team
examine and monitor the physiological and biochemical indexes of
each athlete every day. It often happens that the detailed data
of the morning training have already been delivered to the
coaches before the start of afternoon training, thus effectively
supporting the scientific sports training.

It's a long-term task for sports scientific research to enhance
the scientific training to a higher level. According to Lu, the
applied basic research in China mainly relies on the over 40
institutions and some universities throughout the country. A
relatively stable scientific research team has been formed. Every
year, a group of graduates from Tsinghua, Peking and Beijing
Medical Science universities will continue their advanced studies
at the sports institutions and will become the reserve force of
China's sports scientific research.

"The competition of athletes on the arena is actually a test of
the level of the coaches' scientific training. The athletes with
excellent coaches have grasped the initiative of winning.'' said
Yuan Weimin, vice-minister the SPCSC and the world-famous coach
who had led the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team to marvelous
achievements.

In 1982, the SPCSC set up a special office of cultural education
in charge of the training of coaches. As briefed by Li Quanqiang,
deputy head of the office, the current coaches' training system
consists of four parts including academic education, professional
training, short-term training and information service. According
to a survey at 29 provinces and cities in 1995, 61 percent of the
25,000 full-time coaches have received an education at or above
college level, 16 percent of whom have the same level of
education as undergraduates.

During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the SPCSC
will carry out a wider professional training plan for coaches
throughout the country in order to provide basic training for
over 90 percent coaches, accelerating the construction of
teaching materials and a teachers' contingent and finally form a
training network with several training centers at the core,
covering more areas nationwide. Beginning from the year 2000,
those coaches who haven't got a qualified certificate of
professional training will not be allowed to apply for position
or promotion.

Analysed by SPCSC officials, competition on the arena in the next
15 years will be manifest more and more as the competition for
science and technology and the Science and Education Program will
help prepare China's athletics for future competitions.

CHINA-CULTURE: Female Orchestra Graces Beijing Stage

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

The Women's Philharmonic Orchestra (WPO), consisting of 80 female
members led by the renown conductor Zheng Xiaoying, presented a
mid-August concert in the Beijing Concert Hall.

The audience was delighted with the repertoire which included the
overture for The Marriage of Figaro and various selections by the
orchestra's string section. They  also heard superb renditions of
Zhang Lida's first violin concerto entitled Indistinct Harmony,
Xu Zhenmin's symphonic fantasy Snow-Covered Plum Garden, and
Symphony No.9 by Shostakovich.

The event represented the orchestra's second performance since
its debut during the Fourth World Conference on Women. The latest
performance brought back memories of the WPO's September debut to
mark the opening of the FWCW, an event which won acclaim from the
thousands of female deputies from across the world.

The Women's Philharmonic Orchestra grew from a chamber orchestra
founded six years ago by more than 30 professional musicians from
different Beijing art troupes and conservatories of music.

The chamber orchestra focused on introducing Chinese, foreign
classics and modern music to the widest possible Chinese
audience, especially young people, with members raising funds to
present more than 200 performances.

In 1993, leaders of the orchestra began selecting and training
female musicians proficient in wind instruments, and in turn
formed the existing female symphony orchestra.

In addition to established professional performers, the orchestra
also includes students from the Central Conservatory of Music and
various middle schools. All musicians, ranging from teenagers to
the elderly, are required to fulfill designated standards.

According to violinist Situ Zhiwen, one of the founders, the
Women's Philharmonic Orchestra provides an excellent opportunity
for nurturing young female musicians.

CHINA-CULTURE: Sino-US Archeological Cooperation

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

A Sino-US archeological team, consisting of representatives from
the Henan Institute of Archeology and the Anthropology Department
from the University of Missouri, proceeded under the auspices of
the State Bureau of Cultural Relics to conduct a highly fruitful
survey between June-August this year. The survey, which covered
an area of 100 km in the upper reaches of the Yinghe River
Valley, focused on village ruins dating from the late Longshan to
the Erlitou cultures. The team used the global satellite
positioning and geographic information systems for the research
project.

The team defined the range, period and cultural significance of
all sites, and precisely determined the geographic location,
longitude, latitude and elevation. The data obtained was then
entered into the database of the geographic information system,
which in turn yielded computerized color relief maps for each and
every ruins site. The team's accomplishments provided accurate
positioning for future surveys, as well as laid a solid base for
trial excavations and further studies scheduled for next year.

The new approaches adopted by the joint team were of great
academic value with regard to research into the disintegration of
the primitive society, the emergence of private ownership and
countries, formation of the slave system and the origin of
Chinese civilization.

CHINA-CULTURE: New Trade Emerges From Culture

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Along with the newly emerging industrialists, creators, planners,
advertisers and designers, culture has entered the market and
social lives in the form of industrialization in recent years.

Engaging a large group of experts, scholars, artists, writers,
journalists and cultural agents as their consultants, the planner
companies have suddenly emerged as a new force early in the
1990s. They have become one of main strengths in the cultural
sector in a short time, because they start from a high point,
cover a wide-ranging area and are good at grasping the
characteristics of metropolitan culture. With the continuous
extension of cultural planner management, the market is expanding
increasingly, and cartoon companies, subject selection publishing
agencies and other sectors are constantly merging.

Generally speaking, people engaged in dress designing must have
their own factories and outlets. However, a fashion company,
which opened business not long ago in Beijing, is neither
producing ready-made clothes nor selling them, but engages in
selling designs. According to reports, over the past two months
the company has sold more than 40 designs to over 10  clothing
companies.

In Shanghai, watching TV has been regarded as a profession, a new
fashion trend of media investigation. In step with Shanghai being
an open international market, advertising has developed rapidly.
Those enterprises, clients and advertising agents who spend huge
amounts of money for advertising in TV naturally care that their
advertisements are broadcast correctly and on schedule. So,
spending just a little sum of money each month, they can have
their advertisements done by so-called ``watching TV company''
and can obtain an accurate broadcast record, thus making this
really a necessary matter.

The supplying of this data is only part of the companies'
business. Their main business is to offer more materials of
competitive brand-name products. Relying on their materials,
producers make appropriate readjustment for their ad. planning
when a new product brand is put on the market.

Some experts hold information and knowledge, creation and
designing, culture and art, appearing as new industries, have
become a new point of economic growth in today's China. The
management of culture with the viewpoint of creating and selling
it has become a general trend and opened a realm for an ever-
fiercer competitive market. At the same time, the economic
infiltration has injected vigor into the prospering culture.

CHINA-BUSINESS: Petroleum Exploration Welcomed

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China has recently abandoned the practice of prioritizing oil
exploration by administrative divisions.

To better manage the resource and attract foreign oil firms to
make exploration in China, responsible department has divided the
country's potential oil fields into four categories: areas for
foreign cooperation and bidding; areas inviting bids for risk
exploration by domestic oil-gas enterprises; exploring areas for
state-owned companies and exploring areas managed by oil gas
fields.

A spokesman of the China National Oil and Gas Exploration and
Development Corp. (CNOGEDC) said this new mechanism will help
expand the range of oil exploration, particularly in oil-abundant
basins in west China which have lied idle for a long time.

Thus far, China has opened to the outside world 2.50 million
square km of oil exploration areas, and signed more than 30
contracts and agreements for risk oil explorations with foreign
oil companies. Foreign business people, in line with these
contracts, have started exploration in areas covering 150,000
square km.

Domestic oil-gas firms have also exhibited great enthusiasm in
the bidding of western oil exploration areas. Not long ago,
Daqing, Shengli and North China oilfields won the bidding for
exploring blocks covering 117,000 square km in the northwest,
southwest and east sections of the Tarim Basin.

The CNOGEDC will provide both domestic and overseas explorers
with information on oil bearing regions in the country, in the
hopes of enhancing the success rate.

The corporation predicted that under the new mechanism, four or
five oil fields will be discovered this year with combined
exploitable capacities exceeding 120 million tons.

CHINA-BUSINESS: Ing Barings Offers Chinese Stocks

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Sources from Barings Shanghai revealed that Ing Barings
successfully helped two Chinese enterprises issue stocks valued
at US$140 million between July 15-19.

Barings itself purchased stocks valued at US$100 million outright
from the China Overseas Land Investment Corp., a Hong Kong listed
company under the Ministry of Construction. Said corporation, one
of the major construction companies in Hong Kong, had market
capital valued at US$1.1 billion prior to the new stock issue.

The corporation decided to float new stocks valued at US$100
million in order to expand investments in infrastructure

its outright stock purchase within only one day, with 40 percent
of the stocks going to Asia, 39 percent to Europe, and 21 percent
to the United States.

The Barings also floated B-shares in Shenzhen for the Wuxi
Little Swan Co. Ltd., a company engaged in the design,
development and manufacture of automatic washing machines. The
goal of the B-share issue valued at US$40.4 million was to expand
the company's production capacity and provide capital needed for
investments in a joint venture operated by companies from
Matsushita of Japan and Siemens A. G. of Germany. Barings
successfully sold the shares to investors in Asia (88 percent,
Europe (7 percent), and the United States (5 percent). Investors
were introduced to the stock issues during meetings held in Hong

CHINA-BUSINESS: Beijing International Auto Show

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Beijing plans to host an annual International Automobile Industry
Exhibition in either June or July beginning in 1997. The
exhibition will be held in the China International Exhibition
Center.

The decision to hold the annual event is designed to solve
problems resulting from the fact that frequent exhibitions
previously held in Beijing placed a heavy burden on exhibitors.

The first international automobile exhibition was held in 1993.
The two exhibitions held last June attracted several hundred
domestic and foreign auto manufacturers and well over 700,000
people.

Public opinion indicates that the comprehensive annual
international auto industrial exhibition will ensure authority
needed to promote exchanges and cooperation between the domestic
and international automobile industries.

The annual exhibition will be jointly sponsored by the Ministry
of Machine-Building Industry, the China National Automotive
Industry Corp., the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade, and the China Automotive Industry
Association.

Latest statistics indicate that the country's current annual
demand for motor vehicles stands at 11.5 million units. China
imported almost 2.13 million motor vehicles valued at US$21.8
billion between 1980-95, including nearly 1.05 million buses
valued at US$7.48 billion. The figures exclude units imported
through informal channels.

CHINA-BUSINESS: CITIC Expands Transnational Trade

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

A joint bid group consisting of two New Zealand companies and
CITIFOR Inc., an overseas subsidiary of the China International
Trust and Investment Corp., won timbering rights to large tract
of forest offered by the New Zealand government.  The group won
the rights on August 20, 1996, with a bid of US$1.34 billion. The
corporation's effort represents an important strategy adopted to
consolidate overseas affairs, expand its transnational
businesses, and eliminate shortages of resources on both the
domestic and international markets.

The 188,000 hectares of forest land is expected to yield between
3.1-3.6 million cubic meters of timber.  CITIFOR Inc. holds 37.5
percent of the stock in the project, with the other two
companies--the Lion Group and Brierley--respectively holding 37.5
percent and 25 percent shares. Funding was obtained in accordance
with the common international practice of a non-recourse loan.

The establishment of CITIFOR Inc. in the United  States was
designed to solve resource shortages on Chinese markets and
expand overseas markets. Over the past 10-odd years, the company
has accumulated vast experience in international market
competition. In recent years, CITIFOR has attempted to expand
forest land development by opening markets in Chile, Canada,
Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The related operations
undertake intensive processing activities in the forest industry,
and seek opportunities to develop high value-added forest
products.

The New Zealand investment will create new opportunities for the
company's further development.

CHINA-BUSINESS: Guangzhou Fair to Attract HK Firms

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

The '96 China International Children's Commodities Fair,
sponsored by the Guangzhou city government and the China Council
for the Promotion of International Trade, will be held in the
China Foreign Trade Center in Guangzhou between December 6-10.

The Hong Kong Trade and Development Council (HKTDC) plans to
organize a large delegation of firms to participate in the fair.
The fair's Hong Kong Hall will provide the region's firms with an
opportunity to tap the vast market potential for domestic
children's commodities.

China's 300 million children under 14 years old account for one-
fourth of the nation's total population. The vast market
potential cannot be neglected, said Yin Shuzhen, deputy manager
of the HKTDC Promotion Section.

"Traditionally, the Chinese pay great attention to  the
upbringing of future generations. The quality of life for
children is rising continually along with the development of the
domestic economy. China's one-child policy allowed parents to
allocate additional funds needed for rearing children. The
advantageous conditions have helped to form a sizeable market for
children's goods." said Yin.

"The fair, the first of its kind to be held in Guangzhou, will
provide children's goods manufacturers in Hong Kong with
opportunities to engage in trade talks and discuss cooperative
ventures with buyers and traders from all over China. Yin added,
"the fair will also help to expand markets."

 Participants will offer various types of children's clothing,
adornments, stationery, toys, electronic games, health foods,
commodities for infants, educational materials and musical
instruments.

CHINA-BUSINESS: VISA Introduces VSAT Technology

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

The Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) system now enables
China's VISA member banks to enjoy the great convenience of
international credit card transactions, with successful tests of
VSAT recently carried out in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Application
of the VSAT technology has provided China's member banks with
"wireless" links to VisaNet, VISA's global authorization,
clearance and settlement network.

The VSAT system makes it possible to link various local
authorized transactions without leasing telephone networks. Users
across China can now carry out credit card settlement procedures
with maximum ease and security. The VSAT system enables banks to
relay and receive settlement information from data processing
centers in the United States and Japan within seconds. But
currently, direct telephone links with VISA data processing
centers are necessary.

Application of the reliable VSAT system eliminates former
geographical barriers, and more importantly overcomes the
insufficient capacity of telephone networks in some countries.
China's credit card industry can now enter the stage of rapid
international business development. In addition, installing the
VSAT system requires only one-third of the time previously needed
to install traditional or digital telephone lines.

According to Raymond Chan, VISA executive vice-president and
general manager for North Asia, China is the first country in
North Asia to use VSAT for international credit card
transactions. The advanced technology effectively overrides the
inadequacies of the previous network and provides immediate
possibilities for the internationalization of China's credit card
industry.

CHINA-BUSINESS: New Measure for Foreign Exchange

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

On July 1 this year, the People's Bank of China introduced a
measure of allowing foreign-funded enterprises to deal directly
with banks when settling or selling foreign exchange.
Implementation of the new measure represents a major step leading
to the eventual convertibility of the renminbi under current
accounts, and has helped to link China more closely with the
international economic system. In addition, it has enabled
foreign-funded enterprises to promote efficiency when settling or
selling foreign exchange, and has strengthened the confidence of
overseas investors in the mainland market.

Implementation of the new measure has narrowed the gap between
China's existing exchange control system and stipulations in
Article 8 of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.
The effort has also demonstrated China's determination to further
its opening policy. At the same time, ongoing implementation
effort has created favorable conditions for ensuring the future
free convertibility of the renminbi.

Application of the new measure has provided a favorable
environment for promoting the economic development of inland
China, and has exerted major influence in the following areas. It
has enabled foreign-funded enterprises to promote efficiency in
settling and selling foreign exchange, with said enterprises now
enjoying the same rights as domestic enterprises to buy foreign
exchange under current accounts. In addition, they can settle and
sell foreign exchange by presenting appropriate documentation to
banks and the foreign exchange control administration has no
need to examine or approve them.

The new measure permits foreign-funded enterprises to complete
all formalities for the settlement and sale of foreign exchange
with banks, or to buy and sell foreign exchange through foreign
exchange regulation centers as before. The measure thus expands
channels available for foreign-funded enterprises to buy and sell
foreign exchange.

Banks can now determine exchange rate quotations in accordance
with market supply and demand. Service charges are waived and
exchange rates for purchases of over US$1 million are subject to
negotiation. Bank calculations for foreign exchange are more
flexible than those at foreign exchange regulation centers.

The new measure has greatly reduced the 3-4-day period foreign-
funded enterprises were previously required to complete all
transaction procedures at foreign exchange regulation centers.
The new measure enables traders to immediately settle accounts in
banks.

In addition, the Chinese government has standardized market
management by tightening supervision and control of the exchange
accounts of foreign-funded enterprises.

transnational oil companies...

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China plans to offer various major transnational oil companies
the opportunity to participate in a number of new cooperative
projects in petroleum and gas exploration and development.

Cooperative ventures will involve risk exploration for oil and
gas in west China and the Songliao Plains, with efforts to tap
natural gas reserves focusing on Sichuan Province and the Qaidam
and Tarim basins.

China has launched cooperative land oil exploration projects in
21 provinces and autonomous regions. In addition, the China
National Oil and Natural Gas Corp. is involved in cooperative
ventures with 32 foreign partners which include 28 of the world
top 50 oil producers. Foreign capital so far introduced has
reached US$500 million.

China has also developed considerable oil and natural gas
production capacity in overseas areas, while gaining rights to
prospect, participate in share-holding ventures and tap oil in a
number of countries, including Peru, Russia, Thailand, Canada,
Papua New Guinea and Sudan.

CHINA: China's Agriculture: Hopeful Despite Existing Problems

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Our Staff Reporter Zhou Xin

Jorgen Delman, a 1982 economics graduate from Peking University,
returned to Denmark and earned a Ph.D. with a doctorate thesis on
the promotion of Chinese agriculture. Delman formerly worked in
the China office of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and
now serves as director of the China-EU Center for Agricultural
Technology (CECAT) which was established in 1990.

CECAT, a highly successful agricultural technology popularization
center comparable to the Sino-Israeli Demonstration Farm, is
located in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. CECAT has scored
remarkable success over the past five years by playing an
intermediate role in promoting both domestic and overseas
agrotechnological and economic cooperation. The EU Committee has
decided to continue its investments in the center. Thus far,
investments from China and EU have totaled well over 100 million
yuan.

Delman, an eyewitness of China's agricultural development over
the past 10-plus years, provided the following answers to
questions during a recent interview:

Question:  How wide is the gap between Chinese  and modern
European agriculture?

Answer:  China can learn at least two very important things from
Europe. The first and foremost lesson centers on raising
agricultural efficiency, a major issue currently facing China,
and in particular, raising the economic efficiency of individual
farmers. Secondly, China has consistently emphasized increased
gross output, but it should also consider eliminating waste.
China wastes excessive amounts of grain, vegetables, fruit and
meat between the harvest and purchasing cycle. Nonetheless,
technology is readily available to solve the related basic
problems.

The key problem concerns the availability of land, or the scale
of a farm. A small farm makes it difficult to raise efficiency.
The solution rests with private ownership, a previous practice
which seems not to work on Chinese agriculture. Yet another
measure centers on practicing economy of scale by mechanizing
joint production, which has already been introduced in many of
China's major suburban areas. The rural population in some areas
has dropped, with the figure for Chongqing City standing at only
5 percent of the total, or the same level as Denmark. On the
other hand, however, the rural population in Sichuan Province
accounts for between 60-70 percent of the total. Therefore, China
should formulate policies in accordance with the population,
especially in southern areas where there are sharp contradictions
between population and land.

Another problem centers on high prices. China Daily recently
reported that prices for several agricultural products have
surpassed prices on the world market. The problem is most likely
the result of high production costs, excessive waste and poor
circulation efficiency. In terms of the latter, the large number
of intermediate organizations have led to price differences for
farm produce. While similar problems exist in European countries,
but the gaps involved are much less noticeable. For example,
farmers in Denmark and the Netherlands control the entire
circulation process from production to consumption. I recently
learned that China's Ministry of Agriculture will  introduce a
farm produce wholesale market as part of its ``Vegetable Basket''
project to protect the interests of both producers and consumers.
China's high prices and low-level production technology make it
possible to solve all related problems, and the central
government has announced it will raise the level of investment
and technology in agriculture.

Q: Will technology play a major role in China's agricultural
sector?

A:  The market is the key factor, with one of the major roles of
technology being to provide products for the market. Animal
husbandry developed rapidly on China's eastern plains following
an effort by the Ministry of Agriculture to promote the use of
straw as feed. The ensuing success proves it wrong to believe
that the area lacked potential for animal husbandry. The
livestock market on the plains is indeed more promising than
those in the Inner Mongolian and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous
regions due to its close proximity to consumers and low costs.

Raising the efficiency of agriculture depends on a number of
factors, including technology, organization and the type of
economic system. CECAT primarily focuses on providing technology
needed to solve problems, to meet the needs of the market, and to
help farmers raise both their income levels and living standards.

Technological problems demanding prompt solutions center on
specialized feed and searching for grain replacements. In this
regard, China has introduced unconventional feed products to
sustain 20 million head of cattle in developed livestock areas in
Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces.

Q: What is the scope of Sino-European agrotechnology
cooperation?

A:  China can easily find cooperative partners in European
countries. Earlier this year, CECAT organized a visit by a
delegation of 20-odd North European fishing companies interested
in providing fisheries technology to China. Next year, the
Netherlands will provide a soft loan of US$5 million for the
construction of an animal protein feed plant in Chengdu, capital
of Sichuan Province. CECAT is directly involved in the project
which looks very promising since China faces a shortage of animal
protein feed and related prices continue to rise.

Countries with close cooperative relations with China include
Denmark, the Netherlands, France and Britain. I firmly believe
there is also great potential for cooperative relations with a
number of other countries. Spain faces severe water shortages on
the same scale as China. I visited the former last year and found
extensive Spanish technology which would highly usable to China,
especially northern areas. CECAT is currently extending great
effort to promote agricultural cooperation between China and
Spain.

Q: What are the prospects for Chinese agriculture to attract
foreign investment?

A:  Regardless of certain difficulties, there is still great
potential for some projects to attract foreign investment. Rising
prices for Chinese agricultural products will serve as yet
another magnet for attracting foreign investment. In addition,
demand will continue to increase along with the constantly rising
income levels of Chinese citizens. I regularly tell foreign food-
processing businesses of the vast potential for food markets in
China's major cities over the next 10 years. Some companies,
including breweries, meat and dairy processors, have already
begun operations in China.

The key to attracting investors rests with the transparency of
China's entire system. The level of transparency is, in fact,
much higher than that of only 10 years ago. For example, a few
short years ago prices for farm produce seemed to be regarded as
state secrets. Now, however, prices are regularly carried by
publications such as Farmer's Daily. While investing in China is
much easier than ever before, success and the level of returns
rest with the type of project and one's understanding of the
market. CECAT is working to help raise the level of transparency
by providing foreign firms with timely information concerning the
situation in China.

Q: You have observed Chinese agriculture for the past 10 years.
Can China solve its grain and agricultural issues?

A: China has great prospects for the gradual development of
agricultural development. While China currently imports some
grain, the volume is significantly lower than some foreign
claims. Chinese agriculture can ensure the country's needs, with
the growth rate of grain output outstripping the population
growth rate for the past 10 years. While grain development has
been somewhat sluggish, areas such as meat and animal husbandry
have been growing rapidly, thereby indicating China's vast
resources and potential.

 BRAZIL: CARDOSO DECREES EXPORT INCENTIVES AS REFORMS LANGUISH IN CONGRESS

 Successive defeats in congress for the government's constitutional reform 
programme appear to have convinced the government that stimulating economic 
growth cannot wait for passage of the amendments to the pension, tax and 
administrative systems. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has begun to use 
decrees (medidas provisorias) to implement essential reforms, thereby 
skirting the need to secure a two-thirds congressional majority, and without 
putting at risk the stabilisation achieved through the Plano Real.

 For first of these came on 19 June, when Cardoso announced a series of 
incentives for manufactured exports, which have suffered from the Plano 
Real's high interest rates and over-valued currency.

 These were in part a response to heavy pressure from the Sao Paulo 
employers' organisations, which had warned that they were no longer in a 
position to compete. The government was forced to admit that some industries 
had been made to suffer as a result of the stabilisation policies adopted in 
January 1995, and the time had come to help them out.

 The main element of the export incentives is a US Dollars 1bn credit line, 
to be administered by the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico 
(BNDES). Loans will be made over 15 months at interest rates of 5.5% above 
Libor. That will mean a one-third reduction in financial costs, according to 
the new planning minister, Antonio Kandir.

 Ten sectors are to benefit from the new facilities: footwear, clothing, car 
parts, furniture, ornamental stones, ceramics, domestic appliances, 
electronic goods, tools and plastics.

 The shoe, textile and car parts industries are in dire need of 
restructuring to make them competitive with imports in the newly liberalised 
market. 

 The government hopes the stimulus will add some US Dollars 1bn to the US 
Dollars 46.5bn in exports registered last year. Cardoso has pointed out that 
the impressive expansion in Brazil's foreign trade in recent years has still 
not made much impact on overall world trade: Brazil accounts for less than 
1% of the total.

 The Sao Paulo employers' association, Fiesp, has welcomed the measures as 
the equivalent of a devaluation of the Real -which the government has ruled 
out.

 Kandir's appointment in place of Jose Serra (see Page 7, inside), has also 
been welcomed by the private sector as an indication that the privatisation 
programme will be pushed through more energetically than in the recent past. 
Despite his identification with the Collor Plan, with its confiscation of 
private savings, Kandir is a repected technocrat who is expected to get 
things done.

 BRAZIL: LAND: CARDOSO THREATENS TO HALT INVASIONS: BUT AT SAME TIME RHYTHM 
OF EXPROPRIATIONS IS PICKING UP

 The strains that continuing conflict in the countryside is putting on 
government policy were demonstrated in mid-June by two apparently 
contradictory developments: President Cardoso warned that land occupations 
would in future be treated as a national security issue, with the army being 
used to evict invaders; and the estate where such an eviction led to a 
massacre in April was expropriated by the agrarian reform ministry.

 Maranhao incident. Cardoso's tougher line with the Movimento dos Sem-Terra 
(MST) was partly explained by an incident in the forests of Maranhao state, 
where three security guards and one landless labourer were killed on 13 June 
when the guards tried to prevent MST members from re-occupying a logging 
estate from which they had previously been expelled.

 Fears that MST tactics would lead to growing violence in the countryside 
have led landowners to recruit private security guards to protect their 
estates, and the government is concerned that local militants may be out of 
the control of the MST leadership.

 These fears appeared to be confirmed on 21 June, when a Para landowner, 
Carlos Alberto Oliveira Neto, blamed the MST for the violent occupation of 
his property near Conceica de Araguaia, in which a foreman was wounded and 
13 workers kidnapped. But the MST said the attack was the work of gumnen 
trying to take advantage of the turbulence caused by pressure for land 
reform.

 MST defiant. The MST gave its answer to Cardoso when, on 20 June, 200 
activists occupied the local government building in Vitoria, state capital 
of Espirito Santo state. They had earlier staged several invasions of 
agrarian reform ministry installations, to the annoyance of minister Raul 
Jungmann.

 He had already announced that the Macaxeira estate in Para, where 19 MST 
members were killed by military police on 17 April, would be taken over and 
distributed among about 600 people. The agrarian reform institute, Incra, 
had earlier declined to expropriate the 6,000 hectare estate, after its 
owners claimed it was properly and productively run. Another Incra 
inspection subsequently established that this was not true.

 On 24 June, President Cardoso ordered the expropriation of 21 properties 
totalling 31,600ha for distribution to 1,239 families belonging to the MST 
and the moderate small farmers' association, Contag, in Para, Bahia and 
Minas Gerais.

 This operation brought the total area of land taken over (with payment to 
the owners) since Jungmann took over at the end of April up to 427,937ha, 
for distribution to 11,340 families.

 Contag leader Francisco Urbano said, however, that he did not believe the 
government would meet its target of 180,000 families settled on their own 
land over the next three years.

 ARAGUAIA BODIES SEARCH

 A team of Argentine forensic anthropologists has joined the search for 10-
15 bodies of the so-called 'Araguaia guerrillas', allegedly tortured and 
killed during the 1972-76 campaign in Para (see RB-96-05). Operations began 
in the Maraba area on 29 June.

 BRAZIL: EMPLOYMENT: TWO MILLION JOBS LOST IN SEVEN YEARS: BUT GOVERNMENT 
INSISTS SITUATION IS IMPROVING

 The news that manufacturing industry in Sao Paulo state had created 503 new 
jobs in the second week of June (see Pages 4-5) was of scant comfort to the 
unions that have been counting the cost of recession and restructuring in 
Brazil's industrial heartland. It was certainly not enough to persuade the 
trade unions that called the first general strike for five years on 21 June 
to drop plans for another such day of action.

 IBGE figures. Figures from the national statistical institute, IBGE, in 
late May, indicated that unemployment had increased by 38.62% over the 
previous year, and by 6.03% in April alone. That at least was lower than the 
6.38% registered in March, but well up on the 4.35% in April 1995. More than 
half of all lay-offs over the past year were in Sao Paulo.

 The unions' own statistical department, Dieese, calculated in mid-June that 
more than 2m people were unemployed in April in five of the main cities: Sao 
Paulo, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba and Brasilia. Unemployment in 
Sao Paulo was a record 15.9% in that month, Dieese reported.

 This figure was disputed, however, by presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral, 
who preferred to lump Sao Paulo in with five other big cities. The overall 
unemployment figure for those was 5.7% in February and 6.38% in March, he 
said. Since then unemployment had begun to fall, he added, as government 
job-creation programmes began to work.

 The ministry of labour reports that 2.1m jobs have been lost over the past 
seven years. It attributes the phenomenon to a combination of economic 
stabilisation, technological change and the high cost to employers of taking 
on workers.

 These job losses took place during a period in which the economically 
active population increased from 64m to 71m, the ministry noted.

 BRAZIL: HEALTH & POLITICS: DEATH TOLL MOUNTS IN HOSPITALS CRISIS: GERIATRIC 
CLINIC SCANDALS FOCUS SOCIAL POLICY CONCERNS

 Growing unease among government supporters about its social policies -or 
lack of them- has found a focus in a series of scandals and disasters in the 
health service. Health minister Adib Jatene, a leading heart surgeon, 
threatened to resign when it was rumoured that incoming planning minister 
Antonio Kandir would veto his pet scheme for funding public hospitals with 
an earmarked tax on financial transactions. This tax, known as the CPMF, 
could raise up to US Dollars 6bn a year.

 Clinic closed. The scale of the problems was underlined at the beginning of 
June when Jatene was forced to order the closure of a Rio geriatric 
hospital, Santa Genoveva, where 93 old people had died since April as the 
result of bacterial infections caused by contaminated water, decomposing 
food and out-of-date medicines. They were also found to be suffering from 
malnutrition. One patient told O Globo that they were sometimes given meals 
containing dog food.

 Jatene also ordered the transfer of 300 other patients considered to be at 
risk, and promised to begin civil and criminal proceedings against the 
owners of the clinic, which he described as in a disastrous state after a 
personal visit. The proprietors of Santa Genoveva, two wealthy businessmen 
with interests in 10 other geriatric and psychiatric clinics in Rio de 
Janeiro, were subsequently arrested in late June.

 The health ministry and local authorities ordered an immediate inspection 
of 37 other geriatric hospitals in Rio state -suggesting that such 
supervision has been absent in the past.

 The use of substandard and unsupervised private hospitals is one of the 
many widespread problems in the over-stretched and under-funded Brazilian 
health system. 

 Contaminated water was also found to be the underlying cause of a disaster 
at a renal dialysis clinic in Pernambuco, where 55 people had died by the 
beginning of June.

 An investigation by Veja magazine revealed that the Instituto de Doencas 
Renais (IDR) in Caruaru, in the arid outback of the state, had been using 
water contaminated with blue algae supplied by tanker lorries that cut 
corners in the purification process. It was found that the IDR's internal 
procedures for checking filters were inadequate, and regulation by the 
health authority was non-existent.

 It is clear from the above that not all the health service's problems 
derive from insufficient resources. Further criticism came in a May report 
prepared by two Brazilian consultants for the Inter-American Development 
Bank (IDB), which estimated that the government wasted at least US Dollars 
2bn last year through a combination of poor management and corruption. It 
pointed to a conspiracy by hospital administrators and health ministry 
officials to divert public funding into their own pockets.

 One of the favourite wheezes, according to the report, is for hospitals 
linked to the federal health system, SUS, to claim funding for non-existent 
patients, or for services that are not provided.

 Ageing population. Brazil's problems with geriatric care can only become 
more severe. Old people are the fastest-growing sector of the population 
(53% since 1980, compared with 44% for the population of working age). By 
the year 2000 the country will have 8.6m people over the age of 65 and 18m 
by 2020. As a World Health Organisation report notes, it does not have the 
infrastructure needed to look after them.

 On the contrary: the WHO notes that the number of geriatric hospital beds 
fell from 508,704 in 1994 to 503,461 in the following year.

 Infant mortality down. The Cardoso government's health policies can claim 
some successes, however. At the other end of the age scale, Brazil has 
managed, over the past couple of years, to reduce neo- and peri-natal 
mortality by almost a third. A church children's commission report found 
that the mortality rate in the first year of life had gone down by 28.4% in 
the first quarter of this year, in comparison with the same period last 
year: from 24.8 per 1,000 live births to 17.8. The improvement was most 
striking in the poor north and northeast.

 The church report attributes the improvement mainly to price stability 
under the Plano Real, which has enabled the poor to plan their expenditure 
more effectively.

 An example singled out by the report is that of Jaramataia, a town of 4,700 
inhabitants in the interior of Alagoas. In 1994 its infant mortality rate of 
359 per 1,000 births was one of the highest in the world. Last year it was 
down to 176, and to only 27 in the first three months of this year.

 INDIAN LIVES GROW SHORTER 

 Life expectancy for Brazil's indigenous population has fallen by 5.5 years 
since 1993, reflecting deteriorating living conditions and an increase in 
the incidence of diseases, according to a report by the IMTM tropical 
medicine institute, published in Folha de Sao Paulo in early June.

 Last year the average expectancy for the 329,000 Indians was 42.5, 25 years 
less than for the population as a whole and comparable to that of Sierra 
Leone. In the Javari valley of Amazonas state the average was 24.3 years for 
the Canamaris, Matis and Mayoruma, and only 21 among the Matubo people.

 Many deaths are the result of malaria and hepatitis brought in by illegal 
loggers, gold prospectors (garimpeiros) and settlers. NGOs reported in May 
that 3,000 garimpeiros using 35 landing strips had re-established themselves 
in the 10m hectare territory of the Yanomami, on the Venezuelan frontier, 
since the authorities stopped patrolling the reserve's boundaries in March.

 BRAZIL: FOCUS: INDUSTRY FACES TAKEOVER BOOM: M&A OPERATIONS UP 54% IN THE 
LAST YEAR

 Mid-June brought a small item of encouraging news to Brazil's industrial 
heartland: the regular survey conducted by the Federacao das Industrias do 
Estado de Sao Paulo (Fiesp) showed in the previous fortnight, for the first 
time in thirteen-and-a-half months, a net job-creation figure.

 It was indeed small (503) and industry is still a very long way from 
mopping up the huge numbers of dismissals (98,133 over the past 12 months).

 However, Fiesp experts say that it shows how little an upturn is needed for 
industry to start hiring again. The turnaround is attributed chiefly to the 
steady fall in interest rates; they now average about 15% in real terms, 
compared with twice that much a year ago.

 Takeover threat. The encouragement derived from the employment figures has 
not managed to offset a new round of concern about the effects trade 
liberalisation and 'globalisation' are having on Brazilian industry. Rather, 
this has been heightened by a report from Price Waterhouse which shows that 
in the first five months of this year there were 154 mergers and 
acquisitions, 54% more than in the same period of 1995. In 44% of the cases, 
the operations involved outright buyouts or acquisitions of controlling 
stakes.

 Because not all such transactions are reported, it is estimated that the 
true total of mergers and acquisitions may be up to three times higher.

 Brazilian industry is changing hands, and in an increasing number of cases, 
the buyers are foreigners. In January-May last year, foreigners accounted 
for just over a third of the takeovers; this year their share has risen to 
48%.

 [Brazilians have already been served notice that a new buyer of companies 
is to appear on the market. At the recent signing of the association 
agreement between Mercosur and Chile, President Eduardo Frei announced that 
Chilean investors, after having lined up investment projects totalling US 
Dollars 10bn in Argentina, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay, are beginning to 
target Brazil.]

 The reasons. Industrialists say that two factors have combined to stimulate 
the rise in takeovers. One is that many middle-ranking Brazilian firms 
lacked the capital to operate in a 'globalised' economy.

 With stockmarkets still too small to do the job, and subsidised lending by 
the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES) governed 
largely by an inward-looking approach, companies were forced to rely on 
their own funds, when they had them, or borrow on Brazil's financial 
markets. The astronomic interest rates prevailing until recently either 
deterred companies from expanding, or weakened many of those who tried.

 The other factor is the relative stabilisation of the Brazilian economy, 
which has dispelled many of the reservations held by investors in recent 
years and highlighted again the attractiveness of Brazil as a large, complex 
economy with potential for rapid growth.

 Entrepreneurial talent. One fear is that the wave of takeovers is also 
leading to the withdrawal of valuable local entrepreneurial talent. In late 
June a report published in the Jornal do Brasil identified three 
entrepreneurs who had not only sold out recently but had also pulled out of 
business activity:

 Adhemar de Barros Filho, who sold his interest in Lacta to Kraft Suchard 
Brasil, has turned full-time to his political activities as a federal 
deputy.

 Mario Adler, who relinquished control of Estrela to a management buyout, 
has retreated to his activities as a leader of the local Jewish community.

 Jose Mindlin, who sold his interest in Metal Leve to Mahle, of Germany, has 
turned full-time to his cultural pursuits.

 [The case of Metal Leve is particularly poignant, as it was one of the 
early pioneers of the 'internationalisation' of Brazilian industry, with two 
subsidiaries in the US.]

 Past 'internationalisation'. There is an element of irony in the fact that 
a growing segment of Brazilian industry should succumb to 'globalisation' by 
being bought out. Though Brazil arrived relatively late (end-1980s) to the 
wave of trade liberalisation, it was the country which had previously most 
emphasised the export orientation of its industry.

 Back in 1970, exports of manufactured goods totalled US Dollars 367m. By 
1985 they had expanded thirty-fold, to US Dollars 11.2bn. By 1992 they had 
almost doubled again, to US Dollars 20.5bn. In that same time-lapse, the 
share of manufactures in total exports rose from 15% to 52%.

 Where others, like neighbouring Argentina, often appeared to be engaged in 
a zero-sum debate (either develop manufacturing or go for primary products, 
at best processing the latter), Brazil managed to do both. This emerges 
clearly from the composition of Brazil's manufactured exports, where 
foodstuffs appear as the second-largest item, slotted between metal products 
and chemicals.

 The growing importance of manufactured goods in Brazil's export trade 
appears to contrast with the sector's diminishing share of GDP, from 33.2% 
in 1980 to 24.9% in the early 1990s. This partly reflects the expansion of 
other sectors during a particularly bad period for Brazilian industry: after 
growing at an average annual rate of 9% in the 1970s, its output shrank by 
an average 0.2% a year in the 1980s, and the decline got steeper in the 
first three years of the current decade.

 Since then, however, it has registered at least two years of growth at 
rates similar to those seen in the 1970s.

 During the bad years, Brazilian industry did not only expand outwards 
through exports: in the 1980s it also started investing abroad. It got into 
the apparel industry in Portugal and Spain, and into the production of parts 
for motor vehicles in Portugal and the US.

 Nor has it been absent from the more recent wave of outward investment 
fostered by the creation of Mercosur. In 1994 it is reckoned to have 
invested up to US Dollars 800m in Argentina, where there are already some 
300 Brazilian firms (admittedly not all in the manufacturing sector).

 BRAZIL: POLITICS & CRIME: WHO SHOT PC IN HIS ALAGOAS HIDEAWAY?: WAS IT 
CRIME OF PASSION OR DESTRUCTION OF THE EVIDENCE?

 The superstitious think it was the 'curse of the Collors' at work again. 
Those who put more faith in human and supernatural agency detect a political 
conspiracy. And the local police know a crime of passion when they see one. 
But one thing was clear: the murder of Paulo Cesar Farias ('PC') on 23 June 
put an immediate end to 30 pending lawsuits, and removed from the scene the 
key witness in more than 100 other criminal investigations, involving some 
prominent names from the Brazilian social and political elite.

 Man who knew too much. The conspiracy theory is by far the most beguiling, 
and the Brazilian press have gone to town on it. PC was said to have been 
terrified that someone would try to kill him and his family, and had sent 
his two sons to school in Switzerland to keep them out of harm's way.

 He was, after all, a man who knew too much. As the central figure in the 
kick-back and extortion scandals that had finally brought about the downfall 
of President Fernando Collor de Mello in December 1992, Farias knew where 
the bodies were buried and the money was stashed. But he had kept his mouth 
shut.

 Less than three weeks before his death, the federal police had submitted to 
attorney-general Geraldo Brindeiro the results of an exhaustive four-year 
inquiry into the scams and scandals of the Collor era, involving the 
examination of more than a quarter of a million documents. The report came 
up with the names of more than 400 alleged beneficiaries of PC's 
extraordinary fund-raising talents.

 Former ministers named. Among them were some important figures, not least 
Collor himself and his wife, Rosane. Ten of his cabinet ministers were also 
mentioned in the police document, including former finance minister Zelia 
Cardoso de Mello and presidency minister Marcos Coimbra (Collor's former 
brother-in-law).

 On the strength of this evidence, Brindeiro was reported to be preparing 
106 further indictments. The authorities had high hopes of pinning something 
at last on Collor, who had been acquitted of all charges by the supreme 
court in December 1994 (see RB-95-01).

 To stand any chance of securing convictions, the prosecution needed to put 
Farias in the witness box, as they had found no smoking gun in Collor's hand 
in all the thousands of documents. PC and Jorge Bandeira de Mello, a pilot 
he had used to ferry cash out of the country, were the only two participants 
in the so-called 'PC Scheme' to be convicted and jailed in 1994. Surely, 
once the new evidence started coming out in court, PC would want to set the 
record straight.

 He could throw light, among other things, on the favours that big 
contracting companies might have received in return for the millions of 
dollars they poured into PC's bewildering network of front companies and 
phoney bank accounts (see Zelia box).

 So his death could be regarded as highly convenient for a large number of 
prominent people who might have something to hide. The elimination of a key 
witness is not, after all, an unusual event in Brazil ...

 Rough politics. Besides, they have always played hardball in northeastern 
politics. Fernando Collor's own father, Arnon de Mello, shot a colleague 
dead in the senate in the 1960s; he had been aiming at a political opponent, 
but missed. And in neighbouring Paraiba, current senator Ronaldo Cunha Lima 
was elected in 1994 after riddling a rival with bullets in a restaurant.

 The conspiracy theorists were jubilant when, on 25 June, the company that 
claimed to have made the murder weapon, a .38 revolver, said it had been 
supplied to the Alagoas military police.

 If that were proved to be so, it would scotch the crime-of-passion theory 
right away. And the most enthusiastic proponents of that hypothesis, apart 
from the Farias family, are ... the Alagoas police.

 Crime of passion? As far as the forensic medicine department in Maceio, 
capital of Alagoas state, is concerned, it is an open-and-shut case. The 
body of the 51-year-old businessman was found in bed in his beach house a 
few miles from Maceio. He had a single bullet wound in the heart. Beside him 
was the body of his 28-year-old girlfriend, Suzana Marcolino da Silva, who 
also had a bullet wound in the chest. (Earlier reports, oddly, suggested she 
had taken poison or hanged herself.)

 Tests showed she had recently fired a gun, and the wound in PC's body 
suggested he had been shot by a non-expert, certainly not a hired assassin. 
(Police insisted, though, that the gun was hers.) Moreover, there were no 
signs of an intruder or a struggle. Domestic staff had heard the couple 
quarrelling violently early on the morning of their deaths (but curiously 
had not heard the gunshots).

 PC had recently told an interviewer that he had no intention of marrying 
again, but was thinking of entering politics, standing in the 1998 
congressional elections. Suzana was rumoured to be pregnant, and there were 
reports that PC had refused to acknowledge the child as his own; he was said 
to have had a vasectomy.

 The police are not the only people in Alagoas who subscribe to the crime-
of-passion theory. PC's lawyer, Nabur Bulhoes, insists that nobody could 
have had any interest in silencing his late client, as he had already told 
all he knew. And PC's brother, federal deputy Augusto Farias, said on 24 
June that his brother had recently confided in him that Suzana had tried to 
commit suicide a couple of months earlier.

 That is emphatically denied by the dead woman's family, who say she would 
have been the last person to take her own life.

 Curse of the Collors. As for the curse of the Collors, the evidence is as 
persuasive as that produced in support of rival hypotheses -so far. Ill-
fortune does indeed appear to stalk the superficially glamorous Collors and 
their allies.

 Fernando's younger brother, Pedro, who first denounced the corrupt 
practices he saw going on around him, developed brain cancer and died soon 
after his brother's acquittal. Their mother, Leda, suffered a stroke in 1992 
-allegedly brought on by the stress of her children's feud -fell into a coma 
and died three months after Pedro.

 PC's life had also been marked by tragedy. His wife, Elma, died suddenly, 
apparently from a heart attack, in July 1994, at the age of 44. She had 
always insisted that Collor, not her husband, was the mastermind behind the 
network of corruption.

 Her view, shared by many other Brazilians, was that Collor's inner circle 
of Alagoas politicans and hangers-on were intent on accumulating vast 
amounts of money to invest in expanding the family's regional media empire 
and constructing a dynasty that would remain in power for decades.

 Ministry's suspicions. The justice ministry has made clear where its 
suspicions lie. And it does not trust the Alagoas gumshoes to get to the 
bottom of things. Minister Nelson Jobim ordered the federal police to assist 
the local force with their inquiries within hours of the bodies being 
discovered. 'As Paulo Cesar Farias was involved, we cannot rule out the 
possibility that this was an attempt to destroy evidence,' said federal 
police commissioner Vicente Chelotti.

 COLLOR CLEARED

 Collor was cleared by the supreme court on 20 June of any part in a Farias 
racket, in which the Credicard company paid more than US Dollars 800,000 
into a fictitious bank account in return for PC's help with the renewal of a 
contract with the state-owned Caixa Economica Federal savings bank.

 ZELIA SUMMONED

 Former finance minister Zelia Cardoso had been summoned by the supreme 
court, STF, to give evidence in a case involving PC two weeks before his 
death.

 Zelia was suspected of accepting a US Dollars 800,000 bribe from the 
national bus operators' association, Rodonal, in return for decreeing a 
17.4% increase in bus fares on 14 September 1990. According to federal 
police documents, the US Dollars 800,000 was deposited in an account opened 
under a false name by PC on 13 September.

 A Rodonal official, Jose Augusto Pinheiro, told the police that the 
association paid Farias US Dollars 1m, but was told that, unless more was 
forthcoming, it would have problems with securing fare increases. The police 
think that the total amount paid out by the transport lobby during the 
Collor administration was more like US Dollars 3m.

 ROSANE'S EXTRAVAGANCE

 Rosane Collor used money from a charity she headed to fly her couturiers, 
doctor and spiritual adviser to Brasilia while her husband was President, 
according to a report from the social security department's legal advisers, 
submitted to the federal accounts tribunal, TCU, on 4 June.

 According to the report, she should be required to return US Dollars 15,300 
to the Legiao Brasileira, a social works foundation traditionally headed by 
the First Lady.

BEST HOPE OF STOPPING ERUNDINA AND MALUF

 The decision of Jose Serra, one of the Cardoso government's heavyweights, 
to resign from the planning ministry and run for mayor of Sao Paulo is 
evidence of just how seriously the government and President Cardoso's PSDB 
party are taking the October local elections. They can be seen both as a 
plebiscite on their performance so far and the first shots in the 1998 
campaign.

 Stop Erundina ... Serra's immediate mission is to stop the candidate of the 
left-wing Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), former mayor Luiza Erundina, who 
is well ahead in the opinion polls. But throwing him into the contest put 
yet more strain on the unstable congressional coalition of the PSDB, Partido 
da Frente Liberal (PFL) and Partido Progressista Brasileiro (PPB).

 The right-wing PFL is committed to backing Celso Pitta, candidate of the 
incumbent, Paulo Maluf (PPB). The PFL immediately withdrew its support for, 
and participation in, the administration of PSDB governor Mario Covas.

 On the positive side, Serra moved into second place within a week of 
announcing his candidacy, with 22% support against Erundina's 27% in a Vox 
Populi poll. As the senator who secured the highest number of votes in the 
country in the last national elections, he stands a better chance than 
anyone else of overhauling Erundina. If he does well, the governorship of 
Sao Paulo could be his next objective, in 1998. According to Veja, he might 
even go for the presidency.

 ... And Maluf. His other immediate task is to stop the presidential 
ambitions of Paulo Maluf getting off to a flying start. Maluf is said to 
have decided to support Pitta as PPB candidate, as the latter has no 
previous links with local government (he has a private sector background). 
His squeaky-clean image will do no harm to Maluf's plans to run for 
President in 1998. Part of his strategy is to portray the PPB as modern, 
innovative and open and Pitta, a black businessman, is seen as the epitome 
of such values.

 The political coordination minister, Luiz Carlos Santos, noted that 
'without [Serra] in the campaign, Maluf, Erundina, perhaps even Orestes 
Quercia would move into fill the space.'

 The mention of Quercia, former governor of Sao Paulo, was a reference to a 
split in the Partido do Movimento Democratico Brasileiro (PMDB) in the 
state, where a rebel group has defied the local leadership, dominated by 
Quercia, and put up deputy Jose Aristodemo Pinotti as its candidate for 
mayor.

 BRAZIL: POSTSCRIPT

 INEQUALITY/ Worst in the world. Brazil has the most uneven distribution of 
wealth in the world, according to a United Nations report. It says that the 
richest 10% of Brazilians hold 65% of the nation's wealth, while the poorest 
40% have only 12%.

 The UN's human development index, which attempts to put a figure to the 
standard of living, also varies substantially from one region to another. 
Brazil as a whole scores 0.797, only fractionally below the highly developed 
country threshold of 0.8. However, Rio Grande do Sul state stands at 0.871, 
while Paraiba registers only 0.466, comparable to the poorest countries in 
Africa.

 BANKS/ Riskiest in Latin America. A report published by credit ratings 
agency Standard and Poor's says that the country's banking system is now the 
riskiest in the region, because of loose regulations and an end to the 
banks' easy money period during hyper-inflation.  Small banks, the agency 
claims, are most at risk, while larger ones are on a par with their 
counterparts in the rest of Latin America. 

 ALCOHOL-FUEL CARS/ Appeal evaporates. The environmentally-friendly and 
economical cars which run on alcohol are becoming obsolete, because no-one 
is buying them. According to figures published by Anfavea, the car makers 
association, only 602 alcohol-fuelled vehicles were sold in May, 85% down on 
the May 1995 level, and for the second month running less than 1% of the 
total number of cars sold. Ten years ago 95% of vehicles in Brazil ran on 
alcohol; the figure is now down to 3%.

 INVESTMENT/ US Dollars 20bn in 1996. President Cardoso has predicted that 
long-term investment will total US Dollars 20bn this year. Figures released 
to date indicate that foreign direct investment in the first five months of 
the year had reached US Dollars 3.3bn, a 10% year-on-year increase; FDI is 
forecast to reach US Dollars 8bn by year-end. 

 TELECOMS/ Satellite service. Four companies have formed a joint venture 
called Globalstar do Brasil to offer telephone services via satellite to 
regions that lack them, starting in 1998. The new company comprises 
Brasilstar and Globalstar of Brazil, Loral Corp of the US and Germany's 
Daimler-Benz. Investment worth US Dollars 180m has been earmarked for the 
project.

 MEDIA/ Journalist dies. Julio de Mesquita Neto, editor since 1969 of the 
Sao Paulo newspaper O Estado, has died of cancer at the age of 74. He was 
one of the strongest critics in the press of the military regimes which 
governed between 1964 and 1985.

 CRIME/ Hard graft. Hasmany Ramos, the famous plastic surgeon turned super 
criminal who threatened to join the IRA to learn the art of bomb-making, has 
been recaptured by the police. Ramos, who was serving a 22 year sentence for 
murder and extortion, had escaped from prison after his 11th attempt. He was 
arrested by Minas Gerais detectives while attempting to collect a ransom 
payment from the family of an abducted businessman. The authorities, 
however, did not realise it was Ramos until they took his finger prints.

 NUCLEAR POWER/ New member. Brazil has been granted full membership of the 
Nuclear Suppliers Group. The association, which consists of thirty countries 
who have adopted policies to control the export of goods and technology in 
the nuclear sector, promotes the use of nuclear power for peaceful means.

 OIL/ Argentine imports. Argentina has overtaken the Arab countries for the 
first time ever as Brazil's leading oil supplier, according to a report by 
the state company Petrobras. Brazil currently imports 135,000 bpd from 
Argentina, compared with 125,000 bpd from Saudi Arabia and 90,000 bpd from 
Venezuela. The report adds that Venezuela is likely to overtake Saudi Arabia 
before the end of the year. Brazil imports a total of 700,000 bpd and 
produces marginally more itself, some 750,000 bpd.

 Petrobras search. The state oil copmany is looking for private sector 
associates to help it develop the rich natural gas reserves that are thought 
to exist in Amazonia, according to Gazeta Mercantil. The Urucu and Juru 
reserves are estimated to hold 82bn cubic metres of natural gas, making them 
the second most important in the country, after Campos in the state of Rio 
de Janeiro. Petrobras lacks the resources to build a 270km pipeline linking 
the reserves to the city of Coari, from where the gas could be distributed.

 The state company's overtures towards the private sector reflect its 
concern over potential competition from foreign multinationals in 1998, when 
Petrobras's monopoly in the hydrocarbon sector will end.

 TRADE/ May surplus. A trade surplus of US Dollars 268m was recorded in May, 
giving a US Dollars 31m surplus for the first five months of the year. 
Brazil exported US Dollars 4.5bn worth of goods and imported US Dollars 
4.2bn in May, the finance ministry says. In May 1995 a trade deficit of US 
Dollars 690m was sustained. 

 Paraguayan contraband. Between 1 May and 10 June 350 tonnes of goods 
smuggled into the country from Paraguay were seized by the authorities. The 
products included food, household appliances, tobacco and alcohol, and were 
valued at US Dollars 4m. Customs officials said they confiscated 50 tonnes 
of cigarettes, enough to supply 82,000 smokers for a month. Most of the 
products were destined for Brasilia's informal market.

 CONSUMPTION/ Spirits rise. Falling inflation and lower import tariffs led 
to a 25% rise in alcohol sales last year, to US Dollars 23bn, according to 
the weekly Veja. Wine, champagne and whiskey consumption rose by an average 
of 34%; beer and rum by 21%. Sales of cachaca, the country's most popular 
spirit, rose by 1%.

JULY: THE TURNING POINT?

As the phased decontrol of wages and prices frozen under Collor Plan II
at end-January proceeds, policy makers in Brasilia are monitoring the
inflation trend carefully -- and the early indicators appear favorable.  The
risk, as in past transitions from shock plan freezes, is that repressed price
pressures and high-inflation expectations will lead businesses to
implement sharp markups upon termination of controls, forcing the
government to close the vicious circle with implementation of a new
freeze.  But preliminary estimates indicating only a mild rise in monthly
inflation to around 10% in July have bolstered optimism that Economy
Minister Marcilio Marques Moreira will succeed in stabilizing the
economy without resort to a new shock.

Not all economic observers share that view: Cesar Maia, onetime aide
to Rio Governor Leonel Brizola and now a prominent economic adviser
to PMDB national president Orestes Quercia, contends that Moreira
already is stumbling into the same traps that ensnared previous finance
ministers.  And Moreira, whose efforts to restore dialogue with the
business community have allowed the government to achieve voluntary
sectoral pacts for wage and price restraint, has drawn criticism from the
private sector for his surprise move in late June to tighten terms for
industrial tax collection.  Rules established under Emergency Measure
297, issued in late June, reduce the maximum period for remittance of
industrial production tax (IPI) collection from 40 days to just five --
effectively requiring remittance before most payments from clients are
received.  Industrialists complain that the measure will cut deeply into
scarce capital reserves desperately needed to finance productive
expansion at a critical stage in Brazil's economic recovery (see
SPOTLIGHT report in this issue).

Moreira's supporters counter that the IPI collection term could prove an
effective and flexible tool to tighten fiscal policy when the pace of
growth accelerates to a level that could reignite inflation, and ease when
the recovery threatens to stall.  Moreover, other provisions of
Emergency Measure 297 could bolster the recovery while posing little
inflationary risk.  EM 297 authorizes creation of foreign exchange
debentures backed by export earnings, which should significantly expand
availability of trade finance to Brazilian companies.

Another key provision allows for immediate release of new cruzado
funds blocked at the Central Bank since the original Collor Plan entered
force in March 1990 for payment of tax and debt obligations to the
government incurred through end-1990.  Holders of blocked new cruzado
deposits also are authorized to transfer NCz$ funds to another party for
use in settlement of the latter's tax and debt obligations.  This measure
provides an effective mechanism to bolster the federal treasury even as
it diminishes the mountain of liquidity due to hit national money supply
in mid-September, when the government is committed to commence
disbursement of blocked NCz$ funds in monthly instalments over a one-
year period.  The option for transfer of NCz$ funds also offers a vehicle
to obtain liquidity without waiting for scheduled disbursements -- though
the discounts of 15-25% applied by companies and institutions to
cruzeiro payments for NCz$ funds will likely discourage small
depositors.

The debate over EM 297 highlights the difficult economic policy
challenge confronting the Moreira team in Brasilia.  On the one hand,
Moreira must avert a resurgence of inflation as price and wage controls
are lifted -- and that implies a monetary and fiscal policy sufficiently
tight to avert economic overheating.  On the other, he must provide
sufficient monetary and fiscal impetus to prevent the economy from
slipping back into recession.  If inflation can be capped around the 10%
monthly level -- as the  preliminary forecast for July suggests -- Moreira
can claim a critical victory on the inflation front, which should reinforce
business confidence in the new economic team.  Whether he can maintain
the delicate balance between moderate inflation and nascent recovery
remains to be seen: The economic outlook to yearend is reviewed in
depth in this week's SPOTLIGHT report.

July also marks a watershed month in Moreira's efforts to push long-
stalled debt negotiations toward conclusion by yearend -- a critical
element in the economy minister's long-term game plan for sustained
economic revival.  Moreira's unofficial visit last week to New York and
Washington, including talks with US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
and IMF Director Michel Camdessus, prepared the ground for the IMF
technical mission that arrived in Brazil this week for review of fiscal and
economic performance.  Moreira also conferred in New York with
money center bankers and the Brazilian negotiating team led by Pedro
Malan and Jorio Dauster (now charged with handling the Paris Club
talks), who had just returned from meeting with creditors in Japan and
Europe.  Moreira has assured creditor banks that they will be offered a
broad menu of options in renegotiation of Brazilian debt, including
securitization and debt swaps linked to impending parastatal
privatizations.

The technical mission now in Brazil will have to weight the recent
progress made under Moreira against lingering concerns, specifically
over the inflation outlook and a deterioration in the fiscal situation after
steady improvement in 1990.  The latter problem reflects a sharp
reduction in government revenues, caused by restoration of diverse fiscal
incentives by Congress and an unexpected plunge in income tax receipts
laid to bureaucratic confusion under the previous economic team.
Restored tax breaks alone have cost the federal treasury an estimated
US$1.77 billion, boosting total giveaways through fiscal incentives to a
crushing US$7.82 billion -- or 1.51% of GDP.  Bureaucratic foulups in
income tax collection over the past year have cost the treasury another
US$1 billion.

Despite these fiscal problems, Moreira stands a good chance of
persuading the Fund to sign off on a new credit facility so long as he can
offer convincing evidence that the economic situation has been stabilized
and inflation has been brought under control.  In this context, the July
inflation figures assume added weight as an indicator of the credibility
and effectiveness of Moreira's economic policy management.  His clout
with US and IMF officials in Washington should also help -- but no
amount of influence could overcome a renewed deterioration in the
inflation trend.

To bolster anti-inflation policy, Moreira has concentrated his formidable
diplomatic skills on persuading Congress of the need to resist pressure
for a return to full-fledged wage indexation.  His success in maintaining
wage restraint thus far should improve Brazil's case with the IMF.
Moreira also can be expected to emphasize the fiscal windfall anticipated
from the dramatic shortening of the term for industrial tax collections
under EM 297.

Assuming July inflation holds below 11%, Moreira is well positioned to
gain IMF approval of a new letter of intent, clearing the way for signoff
on a credit facility.  Moreira's immediate objective is to gain IMF
commitment to an 18-month standby loan, which currently is expected
to total between US$1.5-2 billion.  If Brazil remains on course in
meeting its IMF targets, the economy minister is expected to seek
subsequent Fund approval of an extended fund facility for a three-year
term, with a credit commitment totaling US$3 billion or more.

If the IMF hurdle can be cleared, Moreira remains optimistic that a deal
with commercial bank creditors can be reached by yearend.  The bank
talks can be expected to proceed in parallel with renegotiation of Paris
Club debt, currently estimated at around US$4 billion.

Conclusion of agreements with the IMF, the Paris Club and the banks by
yearend would significantly improve Moreira's position to achieve
economic stabilization and lay the foundations for sustained growth with
moderate inflation.  But the economic risks remain formidable: Witness
the fact that Brazil has failed to meet targets established in all of its six
previous accords with the Fund since 1982.  The optimists in Brasilia
contend that Moreira will succeed where his predecessors have failed --
the skeptics are deferring judgment for now.

COLLOR ON THE OFFENSIVE

President Fernando Collor de Mello has mounted a powerful
counterattack against former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia, now
national president of the PMDB and the early front-runner for the
presidency in 1994.  In the first week of July, Collor ventured into
Quercia's stronghold in upstate Sao Paulo to launch a new farm program
offering close to US$1 billion in credit for the 1991/92 harvest.  The
program, engineered by Agriculture Minister Antonio Cabrera, also
slashes taxes on farm equipment sales, bolsters price support levels for
local producers, and slaps punitive tariffs on subsidized agricultural
imports.  The clear intent is to pull Sao Paulo and other key producing
states out of recession, setting the stage for strong recovery in 1992 --
and shoring up Collor's eroded base of farm support in the process.

At the public unveiling of the farm program, the president shared the
platform with Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, a political
unknown until Quercia tabbed him as PMDB gubernatorial nominee last
year.  The gesture to Fleury appears consistent with Collor's recent
efforts to woo the Sao Paulo governor -- not only to secure the latter's
support for key elements of the administration's legislative agenda in
Brasilia, but also to weaken Fleury's relationship with Quercia and thus
undercut the Quercia presidential campaign.

Collor also has sought to steal the initiative from Quercia by
concentrating a heavy proportion of federal assistance for local public
works projects in heavily populated and prosperous upstate Sao Paulo.
Already these efforts have triggered a significant number of defections
by mayors and even congressmen in the state to Collor's small PRN
party, and more desertions are expected.  Collor's generous new farm
program will accelerate the flow of funds into the region, a center for
Brazilian agricultural production.

The key figures behind the administration's Sao Paulo offensive are
Leopoldo Collor, the president's oldest brother and a Sao Paulo
businessman; Secretary of Regional Development Egberto Baptista, an
increasingly influential member of the president's inner circle.  The
youthful Baptista, also a paulista, demonstrated his clout with his key
role in the kitchen cabinet campaign to oust former Economy Minister
Zelia Cardoso de Mello, and he is widely regarded as a politician to
watch.
Collor already has used his control over federal largesse to forge a
political alliance with Rio Governor Leonel Brizola, a longtime political
rival.  If he can use similar influence to woo Fleury, he would appear
better positioned to confront Quercia openly.  That would mark a major
shift from Collor's recent dependence on Quercia for critical support,
notably in the recent battle to end the computer market reserve.  An open
war between Collor and Quercia would match two of Brazil's most
skilled political infighters -- and it would be a drama worth watching
closely.

MORE BANKS, MORE LOSSES

Bank earnings reports for the first five months of the year show an
industry that has grown in numbers -- and deteriorated in profitability.
The number of banks in Brazil has reached 239, and 116 -- nearly half
--reported losses for the January-May period.

In good part, this negative performance reflects the fallout from an
excessive expansion of the industry in 1990, spurred by a flurry of
incorporations of small and medium-size institutions.  Liberalization of
rules for bank incorporation under the 1988 constitution and subsequent
regulations issued by the Sarney administration set the stage for last
year's expansion.  The result was a surge in institutions from 153 in
1989 to 239.

The irony is that the expansion occurred even as the draconian freeze of
investment funds implemented under the original Collor Plan in March
1990 drained liquidity from the system.  Total liquidity in the banking
system shrunk by nearly 50%, from US$116.5 billion in 1989 to US$59
billion in 1990.  In other words, the new banking ventures came
precisely as prospects for industry profits reached low ebb.

Many of the new banks were not well prepared to face the adversities of
1990.  Most were founded by industrial and retail groups, restructured
brokerages and distributors seeking to profit from lucrative margins of
as much as 50% that prevailed in the last months of the Sarney
administration.  Then came the liquidity crunch, followed by a wave of
bankruptcies in the second half of 1990 and a continued monetary
squeeze that put additional pressure on industry profit margins.

Few of the new banks thus far have failed as a result of these financial
pressures.  But industry executives believe that many will eventually
have to seek mergers to avoid going under, which could reduce the total
number of banks by as much as 40% over the next year.

State banks remain a continuing source of trouble for the state and
federal governments, with most reporting spectacular losses in the first
semester.  Even foreign banks with Brazilian operations suffered
setbacks; Mitsubishi and Bank of Montreal ranked among the poorest
performers in the first half.

PRIVATIZATION: NEXT TARGETS

With the debut selloff of the state-owned steelmaker Usiminas set for
September, the Collor government is preparing to launch its second
privatization with sale of the jet-turbine maintenance firm Companhia
Eletro-mecanica.  Celma, with assets officially valued at US$84 million,
will be privatized in several stages.  An initial tender of up to 10% of
total Celma shares will be offered to the company's 2,000 employees
from August 1 to September 13, supported by financing from the
BNDES.  United Technology, which currently owns a 13% shareholding
in Celma, will be offered the option to increase its stake up to the 40%
maximum established for foreign shareholders in the privatization
process.  Remaining Celma stock will go on the block for public offer
on October 22.

One problem that has held back privatization of Celma is the fact that it
is the only domestic company qualified to service Brazilian Air Force
jets.  This issue was resolved through inclusion of a clause in
privatization terms guaranteeing such maintenance will be continued.
Though the Celma selloff is on a much smaller scale than the Usiminas
deal, its sale breaks a number of nationalistic taboos and paves the way
for a much more significant privatization: Brazil's biggest aircraft maker,
Embraer.  The recent surprise appointment of former Infrastructure
Minister Ozires Silva as president of Embraer -- the company he headed
from its founding until he assumed the Petrobras presidency in 1986 --
has been widely interpreted as a mission to get the parastatal ready for
privatization.  Silva was a strong proponent of privatization even before
he assumed a central role in drafting the Collor government's program
for parastatal selloffs as infrastructure minister.  He has openly
recommended that the aircraft company be transferred as soon as possible
to private interests.

GENERAL OVERVIEW

State bank rollovers of debt obligations to the Central Bank have kept the
financial system under pressure in July.    The financial markets  have
responded with a gradual backup in interest rates, though liquidity has
remained adequate to prevent a more dramatic surge.  In this
environment, CDs and fixed-rate mutual funds have ranked among the
leading fixed-income perfomers. The rise in interest rates has dampened
demand for the dollar, and should also slow improvement in gold prices
in the second half of the month.  The stock market has shown surprising
strength despite the interest rate trend, bolstered by privatization
progress, foreign capital inflows and growing optimism over the
economic outlook and pending debt negotiations.  Stocks have maintained
their position in July as the strongest performer among major investment
vehicles. The influx of foreign funds, coupled with share sales in the
privatization process, is critical to sustaining the rally on the Sao Paulo
and Rio exchanges.  Market analysts anticipate a new market surge if
inflation remains moderate this month and Economy Minister Moreira
can make headway in debt negotiations with the IMF and the banks.  The
rally should be reinforced as interest rates level off in the second half of
July.

FINANCIAL INVESTMENT FUNDS

Overview: Financial investment funds turned in a reasonable showing in
the first half of July, with the 10 leading funds averaging a net gain of
3.9%.  Top performers for the period were the Fundo Azul of the
Federal Savings Bank and the Fundo Real.  But the range in returns
among the leading funds narrowed to just 18 basis points, from 4.04%
for Fundo Azul to 3.86% for Citiconta.

Prospects: Leading funds should average a monthly gain of around
10.5% in July.  That would put the fundao roughly on a par with
monthly inflation, and marginally above the pre-fixed TR of 10.05%.

CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT

Overview: CDs have continued to rank among the top investment
performers in July.  Rates for large-lot investments moved up from
260% to 330% annualized in the first half of the month, with interbank
rates rising from 15% to 17% monthly.  The rising trend has been
reinforced by the market impact as state banks roll over debts with the
Central Bank.

Over the longer term, CD returns have been more modest, with nominal
gains on large lots of 81.84% in the first six months of the year and
340.32% over the past 12 months.  These returns lagged inflation for the
periods, though still outperforming cadernetas.  The tax disadvantage for
smaller lots makes CDs a less attractive vehicle for small or middle-scale
investors.

Prospects: The money markets will continue to be pressured by the
problems of the state financial institutions, which will keep rates high in
the near term.  But interest rate pressure should begin to ease by the end
of the month, and CD yields should also begin to fall by early August.
GOLD

Overview: In the first half of July, gold prices rose by 4.39%, ranking
third-highest amont investment vehicles and moderately above the official
TR index for the comparable period.  Over the longer term, however,
gold remains a lackluster performer, with gains of 77.47% in the first
half and 322.51% over the past 12 months.  Though it has outperformed
the black dollar in July, gold price gains have trailed the dollar for the
year to date.

Prospects: Market operators expect gold prices to track the government's
TR at least so long as interest rates stay high and international gold
prices remain stable.  That implies a price advance of around 10% for
July -- but gains in August could be lower as interest rates stabilize or
fall.

BLACK DOLLAR

Overview: The black dollar recovered from stagnation at the start of the
month to post a 4.01% gain for the first half of July, at a rough parity
with inflation and the TR for the period.  The commercial dollar
improved by 4.33% in the first two weeks of July, while the tourist
dollar lagged with a gain of 3.45%.  The premium of the black over the
commercial dollar widened to 11.44% by the end of the second week,
after narrowing to a low of 10.31% in the first.

For the first half of 1991, gains have reached 87.63% for the black
dollar, 83.91% for the commercial, and 85.80% for the tourist.  Over
the past 12 months, the commercial dollar returned 412.52%, compared
with 295.45% for the tourist and 294.35% for the black.

Prospects: The black dollar appears likely to stagnate in the second half
of July.  With interest rates moving up, exporters have grown more
anxious to accelerate exchange of dollars for cruzeiros, boosting dollar
supply.  The Central Bank also has signaled that it plans to intervene to
sell dollars if the exchange rate against the local currency appreciates
sharply.

S&L ACCOUNTS

Overview: With the TR pre-fixed at 10.05% for July, gains on a
caderneta investment held during July will reach 10.60%.  That offers
a sufficiently wide spread over estimated July inflation to make this
instrument attractive.

Over the longer term, the caderneta has not done so well.  In the first six
months of the year, gains reached just 69.85%, more than 25 points
behind inflation for the period.  Gains for the past 12 months reached
243.25%, making the caderneta the worst performer among investment
vehicles.  The paltry gain -- directly attributable to past government
manipulation of the official correction rate -- exposes the administration's
dismal failure to date in enhancing the attraction of savings and thus
diminishing pressures for immediate consumption.

Prospects: July returns for the caderneta should be positive in real terms.
So long as the government continues to fix the TR at a rate close to
inflationary expectations, this investment will not be a losing proposition.
The risk is that inflation might surge above forecast, leaving investors in
savings accounts vulnerable to a hard blow.  Government plans to
sweeten terms for caderneta investment appear to have been set aside for
now; the economic team appears confident that most of the new liquidity
produced when the government begins release of blocked NCz$ funds in
September will move into financial investments, without need for new
inducements.

STOCK MARKET

Overview: BOVESPA staged a rally in the second week of July,
returning the stock market to the head of the pack in investment yields
for the first half of the month.  The market rally was triggered in
significant part by heavy share purchases by futures index financing
agents, reinforced by continued strong foreign capital inflows.  On July
12, BOVESPA closed with a net gain of 10.6% for the week and 6.32%
for the first half of July.  The BVRJ also rallied to post a 7.5% gain in
the second week of July.  But heavier losses in the previous week left the
Rio exchange with a net gain of just 2.64% for the first half of the
month.

In the first six months of the year, BOVESPA showed a vigorous gain
of 438.01%, with BVRJ staging a healthy 394.7% advance.  That
compares very favorably with inflation of around 95% for the period.
In the past 12 months, gains were less spectacular but still well above
inflation, at 668.02% for BOVESPA and 627.63% for BVRJ.

Prospects: Stock prices could stabilize or drop in the second half of July.
The factors pointing to a correction are largely technical: Finance from
agents to guarantee new credit and roll over existing lines for stock
purchases has temporarily dried up as agents struggle to meet
requirements for large deposits with the Central Bank.  Many investors
will be forced to sell to keep liquid, and this may pressure prices lower.

Over the medium and long term, however, the market outlook remains
favorable -- and stands to improve further with interest rate stabilization,
continued moderation in inflation and progress on debt renegotiation and
privatization.  As a result, investors should view a near-term correction
as an opportunity to buy.

MUTUAL FUNDS

Overview: Mutual stock funds continued to lag other investment vehicles
with a net loss averaging 4.09% in the first half of July, repeating the
poor performance of June.  Despite their recent reverses, however, stock
funds have provided a net return of 296.07% for the first half of the
year.  Gains over the most recent 12-month period were less impressive
at 328.34%, breaking even with inflation. Leading fixed-rate mutual
funds ranked as the second-best investment in the first half of July with
a gain averaging 4.45%.  Fixed-rate funds also did moderately well over
the longer term, breaking even with inflation with gains of 95.23% in the
first six months of 1991 and 387.34% over the 12-month period.  Fixed-
rate funds for companies fared modestly better with gains of 103.29% in
the first half and 436.14% over 12 months.

Prospects: Stock funds could continue doing poorly in the second half of
July, but should rebound smartly to make up for lost ground -- possibly
in August.  Fixed-rate funds should continue their moderately good
showing, which has made them one of the more dependable investments
in the financial markets. The Brazil Service table of leading mutual funds
appears on page 10.

MOVING INTO RECOVERY?

The second half has begun amid emerging signals that the economy is
moving gradually out of the recession that has gripped Brazil for the past
year.  Industrial production and consumer sales in key sectors have risen
in two consecutive months for the first time this year, and businesses are
cautiously optimistic that the trends can be sustained in the second
semester.  Other economic indicators show modest improvement as well
-- but not all Brazilian analysts are convinced that the recovery has taken
firm root.

One factor that could give impetus to a second-half recovery is the
incipient revival in the consumer economy.  Consumer credit requests
are increasing for the first time in six months.  Employment numbers are
rising slowly but steadily in the industrial hub of Sao Paulo, and wages
in the region have improved this year in real terms.  The latter
improvement has been preserved in part by the success of the Collor
government thus far in preventing a new explosion in inflation as price
controls are gradually lifted.

The revival in consumer expenditures should gain further momentum in
mid-September, when the government is committed to release the first of
12 equal instalments from new cruzado accounts blocked in the Central
Bank since launch of the original Collor Plan in March 1990.
Consumers already have stepped up instalment purchases in anticipation
of receipt of funds now blocked at the CB.  Liquidity has expanded
modestly and the credit squeeze has begun to ease for some industrial
and agribusiness sectors, further bolstering prospects for sustained
recovery.

External developments on the trade and debt fronts also would appear to
support the recovery scenario.  Major industrial and agricultural
exporters have continued to thrive despite a persistent overvaluation of
the cruzeiro against the US$.  International trade credit lines, while
diminished, have remained adequate despite slow progress in the bank
debt talks.  And with prospects for an IMF agreement this summer
increasingly favorable, the government should be in position to achieve
a comprehensive renegotiation of the bank debt in the second half --
which would brighten hopes for greater availability of foreign credit to
finance Brazilian trade.

Not all economic portents for the second half are favorable, however.
Analysts in Brazil are divided as to whether Economy Minister Marcilio
Marques Moreira can prevent inflation from moving well above 10%
monthly in the third quarter, which would heighten the odds of a new
shock plan to arrest the price surge.  In fact, some critics of the new
economic team suggest that it already has implemented its first shock in
the form of Emergency Measure 297, issued in late June.  That measure
shortens the grace period for corporate payment of the industrial tax,
which some business leaders view as a de facto confiscation of funds that
could fuel private sector recovery.  The emergency measure also
authorizes longer credit terms for export financing and use of new
cruzado funds blocked at the CB for settlement of debts with the
government.  Overall, critics view the sharp tightening in industrial tax
collection terms as negating the reflationary impact of other aspects of
the measure.

On balance, Brazil Service finds the weight of economic evidence
pointing toward an incipient recovery.  But both domestic and foreign
investors should be asking whether this is the beginning of a sustainable
long-term recovery, or merely a temporary rebound induced in part by
short-term government measures.  This SPOTLIGHT report gauges the
general economic scenario and specific factors that could influence the
recovery outlook.

RECOVERY OR ILLUSION?

Is the recovery for real, or does the apparent economic upturn mask
gathering momentum for a new economic shock?  Opposition economist
Cesar Maia, the former top adviser to PDT presidential nominee and Rio
Governor Leonel Brizola who recently bolted to join the PMDB,
enthusiastically supported Collor Plans I and II -- but now has emerged
as a leading critic of economic policy under Moreira.  Maia contends
that the Moreira team remains stuck in the "heterodox shock rut" that has
plagued government anti-inflation policy since launch of the Cruzado
Plan in early 1986.  He argues that Moreira already has fallen victim to
the recurring cycle of initial success yielding to subsequent economic
distortions that must be corrected by a new shock plan.  In fact, Maia
views Emergency Measure 297, which combines tightened corporate tax
collection with expanded trade finance options and release of blocked
new cruzado funds for internal debt payments, as the effective launch of
"Collor Plan III."

Economist and PUC/Rio professor Edmar Bacha, a member of the
economic team who engineered launch of the Cruzado Plan and now an
informal adviser to Moreira, agrees that previous shocks have introduced
economic distortions, particularly in the public/private sector
relationship.  But whereas past price/wage freezes have fostered the
unsustainable illusion of lasting inflation control and economic recovery
-- and ultimately paved the way for the next shock as collapsing
confidence drove businesses to drive up prices --Bacha is less pessimistic
this time round.  He credits the present economic team for managing the
price decontrol process thus far without provoking a new inflationary
surge or undermining private sector confidence in the government.  That
success has laid the groundwork for slow but steady recovery -- and
improved prospects that a new shock can be avoided.

Former Planning Minister Joao Paulo dos Reis Velloso endorses Bacha's
positive assessment of progress on price decontrol.  He notes that -- in
contrast to widespread private sector expectations in the wake of previous
shocks that price decontrol would be temporary -- the Moreira team thus
far has managed to retain the confidence of the business community in
its capacity to curb inflation without a new shock.

The rub is that the government has maintained such confidence in part
by maintaining a generally tight monetary policy designed to prevent the
economy from moving into a premature and accelerated recovery that
would revive price pressures.  The economic team in Brasilia has grown
increasingly concerned in recent months that an excessively swift and
strong recovery could produce a consumer spending boom, triggering a
price surge reinforced by markups driven by renewed business fears of
an imminent shock.

The Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA), the Economy
Ministry think tank, gives some insight into the reasons behind the
present concern of the economic team over the pace of recovery.  A
newly released IPEA study shows that industrial production in the first
four months of 1991 was up by 14.5% from the year-ago period -- well
above levels for comparable periods in previous economic stabilization
plans.  In fact, however, the increase is exaggerated by the comparison
with the depressed level of industrial activity in the January-April 1990
period, devastated by the impact of the massive confiscation of corporate
capital at the start of the Collor Plan.

The IPEA recommends that the government maintain a generally tight
monetary policy as the most effective means to assure sustained recovery
without a new inflationary surge.  That implies that Brasilia will be
cautious to take measures that might accelerate the recovery, with a stop-
and-go monetary policy not unlike that applied in recent months by the
Federal Reserve in the US.

THE INDUSTRIAL TAX SHOCK

Since his appointment as economy minister in early May, Marcilio
Marques Moreira has succeeded in repairing government relations with
business badly strained by recurring confrontations during the tenure of
his predecessor, Zelia Cardoso de Mello.  Moreira has consciously taken
a more conciliatory line in reopening lines of communication with
business leaders and offering assurances that he plans no new
interventions in the private sector.  The end result has been a gradual
resurgence in business confidence in the government -- but these gains
could be squandered by Moreira's quiet move to tighten corporate tax
collection rules under Emergency Measure 297.

At first glance, the emergency measure's more obvious fiscal policy
change -- elimination of TR use for tax indexation to comply with
constitutional constraints established by the Supreme Court -- appeared
of little relevance to the economic outlook.  But buried in the bureacratic
language of EM 297 was a bombshell with powerfully negative
implications for the private sector: a dramatic reduction of the grace
period for corporate deposit of receipts from the Industrial Production
Tax (IPI), the most important federal tax source, from 40 days to just
five.  The implication is that companies are now required to remit tax
payments in most cases before they have even received payments from
clients, since few sales are made for cash and most carry a standard 30-
to 60-day payment lag.  As a result, industries already strapped for cash
suddenly confront a major new drain on operating capital -- which
threatens to cut short the nascent recovery.

An element of EM 297 with a less predictable impact on recovery
prospects is the authorization for immediate release of new cruzado funds
to pay tax and debt obligations to the government incurred through
end-1990.  Moreira's motivation is obvious: Designation of a substantial
portion of blocked NCz$ funds for tax and debt settlements stands to
bolster the federal treasury, even as it diminishes the money supply
impact as release of blocked funds into the general economy begins in
September.  The impact on corporate spending would appear a wash,
since the funds are not currently available for other purposes.

Moreover, the authorization for holders of blocked accounts to transfer
funds to another party for the latter's use in meeting tax and debt
payments to the government has effectively created a market for new
cruzados.  In theory, such exchange of new cruzados for cruzeiros could
have a reflationary impact in bolstering consumer spending power.  In
practice, however, the capital gains tax on NCz$ transfers (currently
under challenge in the courts) and the 15/25% discount currently applied
by companies and institutions to payments for new cruzados will lead
most small and middle-scale deposits to wait for disbursement of blocked
funds to begin two months hence.

In any event, the abrupt narrowing of the grace period for IPI collection
appears likely to offset any positive economic impact from the measure
in the near term.  Moreira retains the option of increasing the grace
period for IPI deposit by industries should the economy slip back toward
recession, however -- and that could prove a convenient mechanism for
extending the stop-and-go strategy to fiscal policy.

INDUSTRIAL OUTLOOK

Much of the apparent recovery in June was concentrated in a single
sector -- the auto industry.  Automakers reported a surge in production
in June of 18.06% from the previous month, and 73.53% from June
1990.  The government's authorization of a temporary 10-point cut in the
IPI applied to car sales -- a concession to gain the industry's
acquiescence in a sectoral pact holding new-car price increases to the
general inflation level -- significantly widened profit margins, providing
a powerful inducement for expanded production.

It would be premature, however, to interpret the impressive June
performance as proof of a definitive turnaround for the industry, in part
because the government is committed to extend the temporary IPI cut
only through August.  Over a longer timeframe, the industry's
performance has been lackluster, with production in the first half up by
just 1.2% from year-ago levels.  Moreover, monthly production figures
to yearend close to the 67,000-unit average for the first semester would
put 1991 output at around 700,000 vehicles -- 7.5% below the 1990
total.

Still, a comprehensive breakdown of auto industry results shows a
substantial improvement in domestic sales during the first semester.  That
trend compensated for a 25.85% year-on-year fall in auto exports during
the same period.  The government's extension of the IPI reduction for
another 60 days to end-August should keep auto production stable and
prevent layoffs -- but the extraordinary gains seen in June are unlikely
to be repeated.

Autoparts suppliers are cautiously optimistic that the recovery in vehicle
production also will translate into a substantial rise in orders from
carmakers.  Autoparts sales fell by 20% year-on-year in the first five
months of 1991, but a reversal in the trend in May has bolstered industry
hopes that sales will return to year-ago levels by August.  The industry
currently reports capacity utilization in a range of 82-85%.

Some durable goods manufacturers have suffered from rushing
prematurely to step up production on the basis of a sharp but
unsustainable pickup in sales.  Tractor makers, for instance, responded
to improved sales in May by boosting output by 20.9% the following
month, only to see June sales fall by 4.2%.  The reversal reflected the
broader trend in the agricultural equipment sector, where production
increased by 22.9% while sales slumped by 5.8% in June.

Despite falling sales in May, the food industry interpreted signs of
gradual improvement in the consumer economy -- including a rise in
supermarket turnover -- as sufficient justification to rehire workers and
push up production in June.  The industry's optimism on recovery
prospects is also rooted in the impetus that release of blocked new
cruzado funds beginning in September is expected to give to consumer
spending.

Manufacturers of capital goods, steel, petrochemicals and other industrial
products generally appear poised for a sustained recovery.  If the
recovery in these core industries takes firm hold, it can be attributed in
significant part to long-term government measures undertaken to improve
productivity and profitability of these sectors.

The risk -- notably in the capital goods sector -- is that the decade-long
pattern of recurring recession interrupted by brief spasms of recovery
will be repeated.  Capital goods production in April rose by 5.7% from
March; the 7% rise in inflation-adjusted April sales from the year-ago
level marked the first year-on-year improvement in monthly sales
performance in three years.  But after steady if gradual industry
improvement during the first four months of the year, production fell by
2.3% and sales by 1.1% in May from April levels.

Luiz Carlos Delben Leite, president of the Association of Machinery and
Equipment (ABIMAQ), cautions that a genuine recovery would imply at
least 10 consecutive months of production growth.  Despite the
ambiguous indicators through May, however, most capital goods makers
view the outlook for industry recovery with cautious optimism.  Sales
and production of machinery in 1991 could still fall below the industry's
worst-ever performance last year.  But over the longer term, the capital
goods industry hopes to reap the benefits of new exemptions from IPI
and ICMS assessments at the federal and state levels, as well as new
facilities for technology import and credit lines for this purpose.

Steel production this year has recovered in relation to 1990.  In the first
half, steel output rose by 8.4% from the year-ago period to 10.9 million
tons.  June production at 1.7 million tons was 12.5% above the June
1990 total, though down by 11.6% from the previous month.  The
Brazilian Steel Institute (IBS) discounted the monthly decline in June as
an aberration due to operational problems at the big state mills that
provide all basic flat steel.  The IBS prognosis is for continued recovery
in the second half, with annual production expected to hit 22.8 millon
tons -- up 11% from 1990.  The industry association attributes the gains
to both the nascent domestic market recovery and continued expansion
in key export markets.

AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK

One major restraining influence on the overall economic recovery has
been the poor performance of the farm sector in Brazil this year.  During
the troubled 1980s -- commonly called the "lost decade" by Brazilian
economists -- agriculture was one of the few economic sectors that
prospered.  In the keystone producing state of Sao Paulo, for example,
the economy as a whole grew by just 0.64% from 1981 to 1990, but
agricultural sector growth was nearly four times as high at 2.28%.
Regions in upstate Sao Paulo and other southern states where production
of top agricultural exports such as soybeans, chicken, beef and oranges
is concentrated became islands of prosperity in the midst of recession.

But that situation has reversed in the wake of the third consecutive poor
grain harvest this year, compounded by the recent fall in soy product
exports and a softening in international prices for orange juice exports.
These factors have brought the full force of recession to the farm sector,
and producers in most areas show no signs of moving into recovery
before yearend.  The dampening impact of the agricultural recession has
restrained consumer expenditures and slowed recovery in related
industries.

While the near-term agricultural outlook remains grim, prospects for
recovery in 1992 appear more favorable.  The new farm package
announced by the Collor government in mid-July reduces taxes on farm
equipment, expands farm credit facilities and establishes a more rational
market-based system of price supports.  The government has also
promised to accelerate decontrol of prices for agricultural products.  At
the same time, key farm states such as Sao Paulo have reduced taxes on
agricultural exports and production inputs such as fertilizer and
pesticides.

These positive steps should pave the way for a robust recovery in the
agricultural sector next year.  But so long as the sector remains
depressed, it is bound to slow the general economy's movement into
recovery given the farm sector's continued importance as both a major
purchaser of durables and other inputs and a source of consumer
spending power.

RETAIL OUTLOOK

The June surge in new car sales by 25% from the previous month and
18% from year-ago levels gave a big boost to overall retail sales
performance.  A preliminary study by the Sao Paulo State Retail
Federation estimated June gains in retail sales in the state of 6% from
May, and 9% from June 1990.  Excluding car sales, however, retail
business actually fell by 1% in June from the previous month.  For the
entire first semester, retail sales showed moderate improvement with a
2% gain from the year-ago level.

Final statistics through May confirm the sectoral trend toward recovery.
Overall retail sales in May improved by 4.4% from the previous month,
the largest gain for the January-May period.  Supermarket sales in May
posted a robust 13.7% advance from the previous month, though sales
for the first five months of 1991 fell by 23% from 1990 levels.
Department store sales in May rose by 22.5% from the April total.

Greater demand for credit purchases appears to indicate that the present
momentum of the retail sector recovery should carry at least through
August.  In the first half of July, consumer credit inquiries in Sao Paulo
were reported up by 8.5% from a year ago.  That indicator is significant
given the virtual disappearance of credit purchases in the past two years
because of prohibitively high interest rate charges.  As inflation has
stabilized, retail stores have begun to offer more reasonable rates,
whetting consumer appetite for credit.

Recovery in the consumer economy should get a new push in September
as the government begins disburse-ments in 12 monthly instalments of
new cruzado funds blocked at the CB.  Many consumers already are
counting on use of this money to finance purchases on credit, and the
retail sector is beginning to introduce special promotions aimed at
exploiting this emerging source of demand.

PROSPECTS FOR RECOVERY

At this early turning point in the recovery, Brazilian businesses still show
considerable confusion over the near- and middle-range economic
outlook.  Some industries are gambling heavily on recovery: Processed-
food companies, for instance, are proceeding with productive expansion
despite present softness in sales performance, in expectation that the
consumer economy will move firmly into recovery in the second half.

By contrast, most capital goods manufacturers have been slow to expand
capacity and investment despite promising signals of gradual market
improvement.  Similarly, foreign investors face a difficult call in
determining whether recovery indeed has taken firm root in Brazil -- and
the answer in many cases will be decisive in determining whether and
when to enter or expand commitments to the Brazilian market. Moreira's
stop-and-go fiscal and monetary strategy -- encouraging recovery to an
extent, but also restraining its pace so as to maintain control of inflation
-- will keep prospective investors guessing for some time to come.

Despite the apparent contradictions in present policy, notably in EM 297,
Moreira has shown considerable skill thus far in lifting price controls and
nudging the economy toward recovery without triggering a new
inflationary surge.  The next challenge is to fulfill Collor Plan
commitments to commence disbursements from blocked new cruzado
accounts in September while maintaining control over money supply
expansion.  The mere prospect already is heating up the consumer
economy, which poses an immediate inflation risk.  Moreira's move to
tighten industrial tax collection terms, though clearly recessionary, could
also provide a useful brake in preventing the economy from overheating.

Brazil Service views prospects for sustained recovery in key industrial
and retail sectors as favorable, though a revival in the agricultural
economy appears unlikely until 1992.  Moreira's action to maintain a
measure of fiscal and monetary restraint on the pace of recovery could
provide a more solid base for long-term recovery by preventing a
resurgence of inflation, and thus a return to the shock-plan therapy that
has distorted the general economy over the past five years.  It appears
that the present economic team is less concerned with short-term political
expediency than responsible fiscal and monetary management -- and that
must be regarded as good news for prospective investors.

INDIA: Strong buying interest fuels Thermax and affects performance at
other companies

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by T.B. Kapali & Krishnan Thiagarajan

THE Bombay Stock Exchange failed to shake off the bear hug as the
30-share Sensitive Index plummeted further by around 13 points to
close the day at 3,226.80. The value of  business  transacted  at
the exchange dropped sharply from Rs. 349.95 crores to Rs. 297.58
crores. With 1,276 stocks appreciating  in  value  against  1,061
declining in value, the advances to decline ratio stood at 1.20.

Thermax hogged the limelight during the day's trading.  The  trad
ing volumes in the stock shot up from  7,000  shares  during  Mon
day's trading to 50,900 shares on Tuesday. The stock  price  rose
by Rs. 0.50 to settle for the day at Rs. 415.

Indian Petrochemicals  Corporation  (IPCL)  marginally  recovered
some lost ground to appreciate by Rs. 2.25 to settle for the  day
at Rs. 113.50 on the back of strong trading volumes. The  trading
volumes spiralled from 4,54,060  shares  on  Monday  to  4,60,420
shares during the day.

Recent news reports reveal that the company, besides being hit by
an unfavourable Budget, has also closed down its xylene plant for
the past three to four months due to poor offtake  from  domestic
producers. The bottomline is likely to be  affected  as  a  conse
quence. Over the last  week,  the  stock  had  consistently  shed
value.

The Modern Threads stock registered a gain of Rs. 1 to settle for
the day at Rs. 76.50 accompanied by a surge in  trading  volumes.
The trading volumes soared from 3,355 shares  to  21,262  shares.
Modern Threads is coming out with a rights/public issue of 18 per
cent fixed  convertible  debentures  (FCD)  to  part-finance  its
paraxylene-purified terepthalic acid project.

The Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) stock  gained  Rs.  6  to
close for the day at Rs.  287.50.  The  trading  volumes  in  the
stock, however, declined from 1,89,300 shares to  99,200  shares.
The company has  deferred  its  Rs.  412.50-crore  maiden  equity
issue, which was to expected to open for subscription  late  next
month, on account of the poor market sentiment.

The Himachal  Futuristic  Communication  (HFCL)  stock  attracted
heavy trading volumes, which soared from

1,400 shares to 1,00,700 shares. The stock price moved up by  Rs.
1.15 to rest for the day at Rs. 14.65.

The ACC stock ended the day at Rs. 1,760,  down  Rs.  19.75  from
Monday's close of Rs. 1,779.75. The volume of  shares  traded  in
this counter rose from 15,636 to 36,161 shares. This stock, which
had been ruling at around Rs. 2,025 about a month and a half ago,
rose to around Rs. 2,160 towards August-end and  early-September.
But, it moved back to the Rs. 2,025-level in mid-September.

Since then, it has been on a steady decline, and  closed  at  Rs.
1,779.75 on Monday. The trading  volumes  have  also  been  quite
heavy in the last month and a half with an average  daily  volume
being about 18,000 shares.

The Sesa Goa stock  also  moved  southwards  as  trading  volumes
increased sharply,  indicating  intense  selling  pressure.  From
1,350 shares traded on Monday, the quantity of business  in  this
counter rose substantially to 25,345 shares on Tuesday.

The scrip shed Rs. 9.25 to close the day  at  Rs.  180.25.  Price
movements in this scrip also fall into two distinct periods  over
the last month and a half. From the Rs. 329-level  in  the  third
week of August, the scrip gained initially to  touch  around  Rs.
360-370 in the second week of September. But there  was  a  sharp
drop in values in the subsequent period, when it fell  to  around
Rs. 310 and then to around Rs. 290.  The  plunge  continued  with
about Rs. 70 lost in a single day's trading on  September  18  as
the scrip ended that day at Rs. 221. It has since moved  down  to
the current levels.

Sterlite Industries also  continued  its  downward  journey.  The
scrip ended the day at Rs. 177, down Rs. 8.75 from Monday's close
of Rs. 185.75. From 47,832 shares  that  changed  hands  in  this
counter on Monday, the number of shares traded almost doubled  to
Rs. 91,945 shares in the day's trading.

INDIA: National Panasonic launching new products

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Staff Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

NATIONAL Panasonic is launching  a  whole  new  range  of  colour
television sets and audio systems in the Indian market.  The  new
products, to be introduced next month, include 11  colour  televi
sion (CTV) models and three audio systems.

Announcing the launch, Mr. Toshi Nakajima, Managing  Director  of
National Panasonic India Pvt Ltd, said at the core of Panasonic's
technology was the realisation that picture quality was the  most
important element influencing purchases even in the case  of  the
Indian consumer. Every Panasonic TV was a multi-system  with  106
receivable channels and hyper band, he said. No other  colour  TV
brand in India offered hyper band in all models.

The new TV models include a 47' wide projection TV, to be  priced
at approximately Rs. 2.40 lakhs, a model in the 32'  width  range
to be priced at about Rs. 1.25 lakhs and two models in the `GAOO'
series priced at Rs. 65,000 and Rs. 59,000 each.  This  would  be
the first time in the Indian consumer electronics market that  11
CTV models are being launched simultaneously by any company.

The new audio systems being  launched  include  two  mini  stereo
compos with 5-CD changers and a premium  segment  60+1CD  changer
with 1,600 watts PMPO. All these models are equipped with  patent
ed Panasonic MASH  technology  for  noise  reduction  and  V-Bass
circuitry for ensuring deep bass.

Panasonic launched its products in the Capital in  December  1994
and later all over the country.  The  company  sold  as  many  as
60,000 CTVs last year, which represented  3.5  per  cent  of  the
Indian market. It expects to sell about 1,00,000 sets,  represent
ing 5 per cent of the projected market size, this year.

Currently, the company is importing four out of the 11 CTV models
and the other seven models are being produced indigenously.

A company statement said the  commitment  to  excellence  in  all
spheres such as manufacturing, marketing,  research  and  develop
ment and customer  care  of  Matsushita  Electric  worldwide  was
sought to be incorporated in the operations of National Panasonic
India too. Worldwide, Panasonic hopes to manufacture and sell  10
million CTVs this year. It would represent about nine per cent of
the total international demand for CTVs.

Indian Oil Corp unveils Rs. 35,000-cr. investment plans

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Principal Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

EVEN as Indian  Oil  Corporation  unveiled  long-term  investment
plans of Rs. 35,000 crores here on Tuesday,  officials  indicated
the company would tap the market only in the next fiscal. Neither
a public issue nor a bonds offering was envisaged in the  current
fiscal.

The IOC CMD, Mr. R. K. Narang, said the corporation was  revising
the size of its Paradeep refinery, being  set  up  in  consortium
with Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, to 12 MMTPA from 6 MMTPA.

Official sources said the corporation  would  meet  its  resource
requirements through  internal  accruals  in  1996-97  and  might
launch its initial public offering in the next fiscal. The  bonds
offering, too, would materialise only next year,  said  the  offi
cials. They also said the  corporation  was  considering  issuing
bonus shares before the Government disinvestment. (The Centre  is
disinvesting 5 per cent stake).

Profits are expected to rise to Rs. 1,800 crores in 1996-97.  The
four focus areas for the corporation are upgradation of  existing
facilities, expansion of infrastructure and customer  facilities,
entry into new segments and globalisation of  operations,  includ
ing consultancy.

The corporation has projects of Rs. 10,000  crores  on  hand  and
investments of Rs. 25,000 crores have been identified.  The  Para
deep refinery, expected to go on stream by 2001, would involve an
investment to the tune of Rs. 10,085 crores, Mr. Narang at a news
conference.

Although IOC has obtained approval for only a 6 MMTPA refinery at
Paradeep, it now plans to move a proposal for a 12 MMTPA unit  on
the basis of the recommendation  of  the  recently  completed  de
tailed feasibility report. A product pipeline, linking  the  Para
deep refinery to high consumption  centres  such  as  Ranchi,  is
envisaged as an add-on.

Mr. Narang also  officially  confirmed  that  the  memorandum  of
understanding between IOC and the Saudi  giant  Aramco  was  off,
since the latter was setting up a refinery in Punjab  with  Hindu
stan Petroleum Corporation. The  IOC-Aramco  venture  was  for  a
refinery project in the same region.

Mr. Narang said the company had been intimated that it could  set
up power plants based on residual fuels,  such  as  furnace  oil,
near its refineries. Naptha, as a base, however, was  ruled  out.
The company's memorandum of understanding with the Punjab  Govern
ment for a power plant at Bhatinda still stood.

Projects for production of  MTBE  and  butene-I  at  Gujarat  and
propylene in Panipat were already in progress.  LNG  imports  and
production of paraxylene, linear alkyl benzene and ACN were  also
on the anvil, he said.

The corporation is prioritising globalisation of its  consultancy
services, R&D activities and lubricants marketing. It  has  envis
aged an investment of over Rs. 8,000 crores marketing  infrastruc
ture. Expansion of capacity at various refineries has  also  been
planned.

Securities & Exchange Board of India insists stock exchanges verify payment
of all commissions & brokerages

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

MUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of  India  (SEBI)  will
insist  that  the  stock  exchanges  verify   whether   all   the
commissions  and  brokerages  have  been  paid  before   allowing
companies to use the proceeds of a public issue. The  Association
of Merchant Bankers of India (AMBI) had presented a  proposal  to
SEBI for the creation of a separate account in which the all  the
proceeds due to the intermediaries would be deposited. SEBI is of
the view that as a regulatory body, it should not involve  itself
with the  enforcement  of  commercial  transactions  between  the
intermediary and the  issuer,  as  the  company  is  not  in  its
jurisdiction.

Indian Petrochemicals Corp hikes DMT price

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

MUMBAI: Indian Petrochemical Corporation Ltd has hiked its  price
for DMT to Rs. 25,500 per tonne for October from  Rs  22,000  per
tonne. The hike follows the uptrend in  international  prices  of
DMT. The company has, however, cut its price for acrylonitrile to
Rs. 32,000 per  tonne  from  Rs.  42,000  per  tonne,  to  remain
competitive against cheaper imports of the material and  expedite
liquidation of stocks. Prices of heavy alkalites have dropped  to
Rs. 15,000 per tonne from Rs. 17,000 per tonne. The hike  in  the
prices of DMT by IPCL follows the increase by  Bombay  Dyeing  by
Rs. 3,500 per tonne to Rs. 28,500 per tonne.

INDIA: Guarantee for Cogentrix "close on line"

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

BANGALORE: Mangalore Power Company, the joint venture promoted by
Cogentrix and China Light to set  up  a  1000  MW  thermal  power
project in Mangalore,  will  get  its  counter  guarantee  "very
soon". It may be recalled that the Power  Ministry  had  earlier
issued a deadline for granting the counter guarantees for all the
eight fast track projects pending  before  it  for  approval,  by
September  30.  Mr.  P.  Abraham,  Union  Power  Secretary,  told
Business Line: "It was a self imposed  deadline...an  optimistic
deadline. You (the media) have already  been  penalising  me  for
that, so now I don't want to  give  you  any  date  (as  to  when
Cogentrix  would  get  its  counter  guarantee)."  He,  however,
stated, "it is close on line."

INDIA: PAL-Peugeot lifts lock-out, workers yet to report

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

MUMBAI: The management of PAL-Peugeot Ltd lifted the lock-out  at
its Kalyan  plant  today  but  workers  refused  to  oblige.  The
company's  executive  cadre,  including   its   Deputy   Managing
Director, attended office. But none of the 1,750 workers  entered
factory premises for work. The Kalyan plant has been  under  lock
out since August 16. Mr.  Ratnakar  V.  Welling,  Vice  President
(Personnel),  told  Business  Line  that  the  company   expected
normalcy to return in a  few  days  time.  The  workers'  written
undertaking to maintain discipline and  normal  production  would
remain a pre-requisite for entry into the factory.

crores of  the  previous  year.  But  the  company's  net  profit
declined by 11 per cent to Rs. 25.20  crores  from  the  previous
year's Rs. 28.33 crores. Profit before tax  stood  at  Rs.  47.20

for the last eight years in a row. Gross profit  which  stood  at

cotton, Mr. M.B. Lal, Chairman and Managing Director,  CCI,  said
at the company's 26th annual general meeting held here.

capital goods, according to officials here.  The  loan  agreement

INDIA: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone develops WebDeFax

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

TOKYO: Now, you can easily view faxed documents on your  personal
computer hooked up to the local-area networks (LANs),  thanks  to
the WebDeFax, a new system  developed  by  Nippon  Telegraph  and
Telephone    Corporation    (NTT),    the     country's     major
telecommunications  giant.  According  to  NTT,  the  new  system
converts the fax into a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) document
and then stores it on a World Wide Web (WWW) server. WWW  browser
software is used to view the fax on a PC. In other words,  a  fax
can be received by simply hooking a PC to the Internet and a  fax
machine can transmit to a PC that is connected to  the  Internet.
The Web browser provides an interface at the  receiving  end  and
the system can be integrated with other groupware  products  that
use a Web  browser  for  the  user  interface,  such  as  a  time
management programme. NTT said the  system  was  also  compatible
with the Media Agent/GW system, which allows electronic  mail  to
be forwarded to fax machines and pagers using the same  procedure
as sending e-mail. NTT plans to put the WebDeFax on the  Japanese
market before the end of the year.

INDIA: STOCK MARKET, 10-02-96

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

DALAL STREET: Equities on the Bombay Stock Exchange  (BSE)  moved
in a narrow range on Tuesday on account of lack of  support  from
institutions, both foreign and domestic. The BSE sensitive  index
moved down by around 13 points to end the day at 3226.80  points.
The market opened at 3249.15 and touched the day's low of 3220.05
points. The BSE National index ended at  1447.43  points,  losing
over two points over the previous close. The  total  turnover  on
the exchange was 1.98 crore shares worth Rs. 297.57 crores. While
the market moved listlessly, heavy short-covering  was  witnessed
in ITC towards the end of the session on the  NSE.  According  to
brokers, operators in Calcutta had huge short  positions  in  ITC
with the scrip gaining Rs. 2 over the previous close  to  end  at
Rs. 302.25. Foreign funds were once again selling  SBI  with  the
stock touching the day's low of Rs. 248.50 before closing at  Rs.
249.75, down Rs. 3  over  the  previous  close.  There  was  some
interest in IPCL as well with the stock moving up by Rs. 2.25  to
end at Rs. 113.50. Tata Tea ended at Rs.  237.  HDFC  once  again
touched a 52-week  low  of  Rs.  2,200  while  Grasim  Industries
recorded a 52-week low of Rs. 381.25. In the cash  group,  shares
which were active included ABB,  Thermax,  IFCI,  Thermax,  Bajaj
Tempo, Sesa Goa, NIIT, BHEL, HDFC  Bank,  Dr.  Reddy's  Labs  and
Punjab Wireless.

NSE: Political uncertainty continued to dampen  market  sentiment
and share prices on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) ended lower
in end-account trade. The 50-share NSE index  touched  a  low  of
933.56 points before closing at 936.27, losing 7.69  points  over
the previous close. The net traded value was  Rs.  987.87  crores
and the net traded quantity was 521.11 lakh shares. Shares of ITC
were in the limelight on  account  of  hectic  short-covering  by
speculators. The share gained Rs. 4 to end at Rs. 306 with shares
worth Rs. 163.40 crores traded. State Bank of India edged down to
Rs. 251 from the previous Rs. 252 in moderate  trade  with  deals
aggregating Rs. 468.58 crores. IPCL also moved up by Rs. 4 to Rs.
116 on short-covering. Shares worth Rs. 24.80 crores were traded.
The other active shares include Reliance,  Bajaj  Auto,  Bank  of
Rajasthan, NIIT, BHEL, Tata  Tea,  Hindalco,  Oriental  Bank  and
Brooke Bond Lipton. The National bourse is closed on Wednesday on
account of Gandhi Jayanti.

LYONS RANGE: ITC remained at the  centre-stage  at  the  Calcutta
Stock Exchange on Tuesday. In an otherwise dull market, the scrip
improved as a result of concerted buying in all the  major  stock
exchanges.  Among  the  other  pivotals,   while   Reliance   was
unchanged, Tisco and SBI declined. The CSE Sensitive Index  eased
to 423.38 points from the previous close of  424.61  points.  The
overall volume was poor. ITC opened higher at Rs. 303 against the
previous closing of Rs. 302, then  shot  up  to  Rs.  306.25  but
declined on profit-taking to close at Rs.  303.  Tisco  lost  Rs.
1.50 at Rs. 173. Reliance, moving on a very thin groove, returned
to the previous close of Rs. 192. SBI surrendered Rs.  3  at  Rs.
250.50. ACC was down by Rs. 10 at Rs. 1,775 and L&T at close sold
at Rs. 232, a rupee down from the previous level. CESC,  however,
inched ahead by 25 paise to Rs. 63.75 and Hind Motor improved  by
10 paise to Rs. 18.80. Bata was down by Rs. 3 at Rs. 62.

MADRAS: Sentiment at the Madras Stock Exchange (MSE) continued to
remain weak,  with  prices  of  most  scrips  maintained  at  the
previous close. The market, which opened  weak,  dropped  further
during close. The  MSE  share  price  index  closed  at  3373.27,
reflecting a  loss  of  1.44  points  over  the  previous  close.
Pivotals Reliance and Tisco witnessed some  buying  interest  but
prices moved in a narrow band. Going against the trend,  however,
was ITC which closed at better levels than Monday. Market sources
said the weak trend was reflective of the trend in bourses across
the country. Tuesday being settlement day,  there  was  a  slight
improvement  in  volumes.  FIIs  continued  to   maintain   their
wait-and-watch attitude. Low-priced counters also did not witness
much activity. The exchange will remain closed  on  Wednesday  on
account of Gandhi Jayanti.

DELHI: The stock market showed a mixed trend when  select  scrips
continued to forge ahead on persistent speculative-cum-investment
buying while a few others  lacked  the  necessary  follow-up  and
declined. Institutional  support  was  negligible  and  upcountry
advices were weak. The market opened on a steady  note  and  soon
some scrips met with fresh offerings  and  declined,  while  some
others continued to attract speculative  support  and  rose.  The
Delhi Stock Exchange sensitive  index,  however,  eased  by  2.50
points to settle at 719.74 points. In the specified section, ACC,
Asian Hotels, Bajaj Auto, BSES, Hind Lever, ITC  Hotels  and  ITC
improved on increased speculative buying. On the other hand, DCM,
Apollo Tyres, ICICI, IPCL, L&T, MTNL,  Reliance  Industries,  SBI
and Telco declined on profit selling. In the cash  section,  Bank
of Rajasthan, Dewan Rubber, Modern Syntex, Monnet Industries  and
Reliance Capital rose on brisk  investment  support  while  Dewan
Tyres, Dr. Wellman's Homeopathic  Labs,  Escorts  Finance,  Hotel
Leela, Jindal Iron, Jindal  Strips,  Kuber  Auto,  Padmini  Poly,
Ramanuj Leasing and Saw  Pipes  met  with  selling  pressure  and
declined.

BANGALORE: A dull trend prevailed on the Bangalore Stock Exchange
with most of the counters failing to receive buying support.  The
volumes were low during the day. After a  bearish  trend  in  the
previous session, the market commenced on  a  dull  note.  Though
there was no fresh selling pressure  in  the  opening  hour,  the
volumes were low and the operators were unwilling to  take  fresh
positions. According to market sources, the general sentiment has
been hesitant in the last  couple  of  weeks.  With  the  primary
markets being active, the investor funds have been minimal in the
secondary markets. Despite the low volumes, most of the  pivotals
ruled firm in Tuesday's  trading.  Reliance,  for  instance,  was
steady at around Rs. 191 and SBI moved up to Rs. 255  during  the
day. The activity in local shares was limited.

HYDERABAD: The near total absence of financial  institutions  and
FIIs from the stock market had a lot to do with  the  decline  in
select scrips. As such, the lowest turnover of Rs.  48  lakhs  in
the last three decades was registered  on  Tuesday.  Brokers  say
that unless some sops  are  given  to  the  capital  market,  the
sentiment is not likely to improve. The Hyderabad Stock  Exchange
(HSE) authorities should take some remedial measures to  gear  up
the trading process. The HSE recorded a meagre turnover of Rs. 48
lakhs in 188 transactions involving 1,71,826 shares of 86 scrips.
The scrips which remained  dormant  were  Ashok  Polymers,  Asian
Polymers, Kreb's Bio,  Livewell  Home,  Nath  Securities,  Sanghi
Polyesters, Sri Krishna Drugs, Sri Vasavi Steels,  Sujana  Steels
and V.R. Mathur Mass Comm. Among the losers were H.G.  Portfolio,
Indo-Asian Housing Corporation, Northeast  Securities,  Sharpscan
and Prints, V.B.C. Ferro Alloys and Vini Metaspin.  However,  the
scrips of Amar Raja Batteries, L.N. Polyesters and Sibar  Finance
were among the gainers.

INDIA: COMMODITIES, 10-02-96: Precious metals decline

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Both the  precious  metals  declined  moderately  on  the  Mumbai
bullion market on Tuesday. Silver  declined  in  the  absence  of
industrial demand and in the wake of  increased  arrivals.  Lower
international advices dampened the sentiment. Gold prices dropped
on account of increased stockists offerings in the wake of  fresh
arrivals as against poor local buying interest. Silver ready .999
fineness and tenderable silver both declined by Rs.  25  each  to
Rs. 6,900 and Rs. 6,905 respectively. Raw  silver  .916  fineness
dropped by Rs. 30 to Rs. 6,800. Standard gold eased by Rs. 10  to
Rs. 5,105. 22-carat gold was nominally quoted lower by Rs. 10  to
Rs. 4,720. Ten-tola gold bar .999 purity moved down by Rs. 100 to
Rs. 59,700.

INDIA: Costly amputation: Ponni Sugars

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Ponni Sugars' decision to sell its 2,500 TCD (tonnes crushed  per
day) sugar unit at Erode to a  group  company,  Seshasayee  Paper
Boards, may not augur well for its share price.  The  Erode  unit
has been the mainstay of the company's operations, being its only
unit with an established command area. With the sale of the Erode
unit, business volumes  will  have  to  come  entirely  from  the
company's units at Bolangir and Bargarh  in  Orissa,  where  cane
availability has posed frequent problems for the company  in  the
past. Both these units have been operating at less  than  50  per
cent capacity utilisation over the past two years. As the sale of
the Erode unit creates considerable uncertainties about the  near
term business prospects of  Ponni  Sugars,  the  share  price  is
likely to remain under selling pressure.

INDIA: Strained margins: Non-disbursal of ad hoc subsidies due to
di-ammonium phosphate producers

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

The reported non-disbursal of the ad  hoc  subsidies  due  to  di
ammonium phosphate (DAP) producers since December 1995, is likely
to adversely impact the first half financial results (1996-97) of
companies such as Godavari Fertilisers, Zuari Agro and FACT.  The
subsidies have not been disbursed on  account  of  the  delay  by
respective State Governments in certifying the sales, which is  a
prerequisite for disbursement. Delays in realisation of  revenues
at a time  when  the  industry  is  already  facing  considerable
pressure on the profit margins on  account  of  spiralling  input
costs, could strain the finances of DAP producers.

HDFC: The share price has been on a steady  decline  having  lost
Rs. 398.75, moving down from Rs. 2,697.50 to  Rs.  2,298.75  over
the last fortnight. HDFC is a  premier  finance  housing  finance
company and is also credited with  the  creation  of  the  retail
housing finance industry. It has the largest retail network.  The
company has widened its span of activities to encompass,  besides
its core lending business, property-related  services,  training,
consultancy and lease  finance.  It  has  also  assisted  in  the
setting up of housing finance companies in  joint  ventures  with
various banks and General Insurance Co. The company has put in an
impressive financial performance in 1995 -96 in  the  face  of  a
tough financial environment. The total income registered a 26 per
cent increase to Rs. 982.18 crores. It  was  fully  supported  by
loan approvals and disbursements which were Rs. 2,071 crores  and
Rs.  1,683  crores  respectively.  Despite  the  rocky  financial
situation, the company managed to raise deposits from  Rs.  1,853
crores to Rs. 2,513 crores which is likely to help it enlarge its
presence in both the retail and wholesale segment of the  housing
finance business.

INDIA-FAST TRACK: Apollo Tyres

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Apollo Tyres: The share price declined by Rs.  52,  shedding  Rs.
167 to Rs. 115 over the last 15 trading days.  Apollo  Tyres,  an
established player in the truck  and  bus  tyre  segment,  has  a
market share of 10.90 per cent by weight and  7.30  per  cent  in
numbers. Work on the modernisation and expansion plant at  Baroda
has been successfully  completed  and  the  benefit  of  enhanced
production will accrue to the bottomline from the  current  year.
The  modernisation  plant  at  Perambra  plant  is   also   under
implementation.  It  has  also  commissioned  a  new   plant   to
manufacture tubes and flaps with a capital cost of Rs. 32  crores
at Ranjangaon near at Pune for captive consumption. It  has  also
drawn up a detailed modernisation plan for Premier Tyres  (sought
to be revived through a BIFR revival package) at  Kalamassery  in
Kerala at a capital outlay of Rs. 8 crores. In order to meet  the
demand arising from the new generation technology  radial  tyres,
it  has  recently  entered  into  a  50:50  joint  venture   with
Continental AG of Germany to make a foray into the passenger  car
radial tyre segment at Pune. The capital outlay is expected to be
Rs. 400 crores and the initial production capacity would  be  4.7
million  passenger  car  radial  tyres  per   annum.   Commercial
production is slated to commence by mid-1998. For the year  ended
March 31, 1996, it has recorded a turnover of Rs. 1,237.69 crores
and post-tax earnings of Rs. 35.31 crores. On an equity  base  of
Rs. 29.46 crores, the EPS works out to Rs. 11.98. On the  current
market price, the stock trades at a price earnings multiple of 10
times its 1995 -96 earnings.

INDIA: Cane diversion may increase in "96-97

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

CALCUTTA:  Diversion  of   sugarcane   to   khandsari   and   gur
manufacturers during the 1996-97 sugar season is expected  to  be
larger than what it was during the 1995-96 season,  according  to
estimates. It may also lead to lower production of  sugar  during
the 1996-97 season at 155 lakh tonnes (as per industry estimates)
compared to 164.02 lakh tonnes in 1995-96. The total availability
for 1996-97 is, however, expected to be 235 lakh  tonnes  against
220 lakh tonnes in  1995-96,  largely  because  the  industry  is
overburdened on account of heavy stocks (with an aggregate  stock
of 80 lakh tonnes lying with all sugar factories) to the tune  of
Rs. 600 crores.  The  decrease  in  production  over  1995-96  is
expected to  be  11  lakh  tonnes  in  Maharashtra  (the  largest
producer), 5.8 lakh tonnes in Gujarat, 4.7 lakh tonnes in Central
UP and 4 lakh tonnes in Madhya Pradesh. Mr. O. P. Dhanuka, former
President of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), said  the
industry, due to high production, was holding  stocks  equivalent
to 7 months' consumption. Another factor adding to the  indstry's
woes was the plunge in alcohol prices, from Rs. 28 per  litre  in
1993-94 to Rs. 4 per litre as on  date,  with  demand  still  not
picking up. This led to a huge pile-up of  molasses  stocks  with
sugar mills, which are having inventory problems, he said.

EDITORIAL: Anti-dumping blues: Major hurdle in the way of India"s exports
to Europe

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Anti-dumping action by the European Union has  the  potential  of
developing into a major hurdle in the way of India's  exports  to
Europe. Currently, as was made clear at a recent seminar  by  Mr.
Harold Wenig, head of the anti-dumping unit of the EU,  ``only  a
minuscule 0.05 per cent of Indian exports is  covered  under  the
anti-dumping provisions of the  European  Commission''.  But  the
fact remains that since the beginning of the current  year  there
has been  an  increasing  trend  of  anti-dumping  charges  being
slapped on India's exports. This has been linked  to  efforts  on
the part of the European industry trying to protect itself in the
face of WTO-regulated moves to lower trade barriers all over  the
world.

As is to be expected, it is not only European importers  who  are
moving to make the entry of cheap  imports  from  the  developing
world more difficult. In the course of  a  single  month  earlier
this  year,   the   US   International   Trade   Council   levied
countervailing duties on 15 Indian exporters of  iron  and  steel
products and anti-dumping duties on as many as 25  exporters.  In
the  case  of  the  US,  this  is  an  election   year   and   no
administration can  afford  to  alienate  the  powerful  domestic
industrial lobbies whose support is  crucial  for  a  re-election
bid. The EU has begun more than 10 investigations  against  India
alone, two of which  have  ended  with  the  imposition  of  anti
dumping  duties  on  oxalic  acid,  polyester  blended  yarn  and
polyester staple fibre. In March, reports indicated that  the  EU
had taken up  a  fresh  investigation  into  dumping  allegations
relating to grey cotton unbleached fabric against India and other
textile-exporting  countries  such  as  Pakistan,  China,  Egypt,
Turkey and Indonesia. The specific allegation made by  Eurocoton,
a European trade lobby, was that the exporters (around 265 Indian
producers are involved) were underpricing their  products  by  36
per cent resulting in a decline in the market share  of  European
textile manufacturers to 25 per cent from 33  per  cent.  Despite
the fact that an earlier investigation into  the  same  complaint
was, according to Indian officials, ``on the  verge  of  collapse
when it was withdrawn'', there is now every indication that  anti
dumping duties will  be  slapped  on  the  exporters,  the  rates
varying between 3.3 per cent and 27.5  per  cent.  In  fact,  the
Union Textiles Ministry is already reported to have taken up  the
matter with Brussels since this specific product category forms a
sizeable chunk of the country's total textile exports.

The argument that the EU should desist from slapping anti-dumping
duties of this magnitude  because  of  their  serious  impact  on
Indian exports will, of course, not be effective because Brussels
can argue, equally effectively, that it cannot allow the European
industry to be hurt by  such  cheap  imports.  The  point  is  to
convince the EU authorities that the prices of textile and  other
products currently being investigated are not  artificially  low.
This can be done only with effective legal support. Indeed,  this
need has been recognised  to  the  extent  that  a  proposal  has
already  been  made  to  the  Commerce  Ministry  (when   Mr   P.
Chidambaram was the Commerce Minister) to set  up  a  fund  which
could be utilised by exporters to challenge the levy of  punitive
duties in appropriate courts. The fund could also be used  mainly
by small and medium-size exporters to represent their case before
the EU for a reduction in the  rates  of  anti-dumping  duty  (as
reflected in the varying rates imposed on exports of grey  cotton
unbleached fabric). Such consultations  were  encouraged  by  Mr.
Wenig  at  the  New  Delhi  seminar,   his   entirely   justified
apprehension being that in the absence of such cooperation the EU
would be forced to rely on ``estimates which (are) not always  in
the best interests of the exporters''.

In short, there is nothing wrong with the  levy  of  anti-dumping
duties as such. India too has slapped similar charges  on  select
imports such as theophylline and caffeine from China.  The  point
is that the imposition should not be perceived as arbitrary,  the
latest example being the duty slapped by the  EU  on  exports  of
plastic woven sacks. The Government has an important role to play
in helping exporters in this specific sphere, a task which it has
not performed satisfactorily till now.

INDIA: Ramar claim dubbed "dishonest": Herbal fuel

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Science Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

MR. Ramar Pillai's claim of a successful  process  for  producing
`herbal fuel' has been dubbed `dishonest' by  the  Department  of
Science and Technology (DST), which ostensibly tried its best  to
help him obtain a patent and prove his method.

The DST Secretary, Dr. V. S.  Ramamurthy,  today  said  when  the
experiment at the Chennai IIT  failed  to  produce  any  fuel  on
September 26, Mr. Ramar used a hollow metallic stirrer from which
oil flowed into the boiling concoction of herbs, chemicals, etc.

The scientists carrying out the test had to stop  the  experiment
and were convinced beyond doubt that the wonder fuel  was  not  a
result of the reaction of the herbs  and  chemicals  mixing  with
water, but an external source, Dr.  Ramamurthy  explained  to  re
porters.

An extensive analysis of samples of the end product generated  by
Mr. Ramar in the demonstrations conducted at  the  Delhi  IIT  on
September 3 clearly indicated that it was a mixture of  kerosene,
diesel, gasoline and naphtha which matched with that available in
the country.

The Indian Institute of Petroleum  (IIP),  Dehradun,  Indian  Oil
Corporation's Research and Development Centre, Faridabad and  the
National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune carried out  the  tests.
In fact, the IIP said the sample, with a high content of  60  per
cent kerosene, naphtha, diesel and petrol, matched with  products
manufactured using crude oil available in India.

The DST was forced to react aggressively because  Mr.  Ramar  had
not only thrown an open challenge but  had  been  accusing  scien
tists of not being fair, when in fact all-out efforts were  being
made to help him get a patent, Dr. Ramamurthy said.

"Even today, we are open if he comes back with a request to help
him scientifically. Our effort had been limited  to  helping  him
file a strong patent and, since we did not find  scientific  vali
dation for the process, we decided not to proceed further, " the
DST Secretary said.

`No political pressures':  Denying any political pressures in the
entire episode right from the beginning, the DST  Secretary  said
what had prompted him to seriously process  the  matter  was  the
claim that herbs were the source for the  petrol,  and  that  too
from the Western Ghats, and positive  certificates  had  been  re
ceived from three Chennai-based organisations.

He said the story of Mr. Ramar, as far as the DST was  concerned,
began in December 1995 when he wrote to the  Government  that  he
had discovered a herbal fuel that could run vehicles.  The  claim
was attested by three test certificates from the Chennai IIT, the
Pollution Control Board and the Chemical  Testing  Laboratory  in
Chennai.

In July, Mr. Ramar came to the DST and demonstrated his  process.
A sample of the product was then tested at  the  NCL,  Pune.  The
report said it was pure hydrocarbon. Based on  this  feedback,  a
demonstration was organised at the Delhi IIT on September 3  with
a full log kept on whatever happened.

According to Dr. Ramamurthy, in the IIT test, Mr. Ramar used 1.05
litres water, 55 gm leaves and wood, 10 gm common salt, one slice
of lemon, a pinch of ash, 1 ml of secret chemical A, a few  drops
of petrol and a small quantity of secret chemical B.

After the experiment was done in a stainless steel vessel and the
boiling matter transferred into a bucket and covered with a white
cloth, the resultant product contained 900 ml water,  400  gm  of
the herbal fuel and 110 gm of other material.

Puzzling questions:  The puzzling questions that arose were:  How
did the clear mass increase of  400  gm  in  excess  weight  come
about? How did lead, sulphur, which  are  used  in  the  refining
process, olefins -- a consequence  of  the  cracking  process  in
refinery -- find their presence in the natural crude product that
was supposedly produced?

Armed with these doubts, the DST got together a  10-member  scien
tists' team (DST-3, DRDO-2,  IOC-1,  and  IIT  Chennai-4)  and  a
patent lawyer and went to Chennai with an open mind to  help  Mr.
Ramar file a patent if he could demonstrate his  process  success
fully, Dr. Ramamurthy said. The experiment  was  conducted  using
glass equipment provided by the IIT and as directed by Mr.  Ramar
in the presence of Ms. Poonkini and her  father,  two  other  key
players in the fuel drama. Mr. Ramar, however, could not  produce
any fuel. He later told the media  in  Chennai  that  the  entire
thing was done on too short a notice and  that  his  leaves  were
contaminated.

Southern India Mills Association for strong action to avert European Union
anti-dumping duty

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Special Correspondent

COIMBATORE, Oct. 1

THE Southern India Mills Association (SIMA) has urged the  Govern
ment to caution the European Union (EU) that  any  levy  of  anti
dumping duty on grey  cotton  fabrics  from  India  would  invite
retaliatory action from it.

In a memorandum to the Union Commerce Minister, Dr. B.  B.  Ramai
ah, the SIMA Chairman, Mr. B. K. Patodia, said it was stated that
the EU was planning to slap anti-dumping levies  on  grey  cotton
fabrics imported from India. The levy ranged from 3.3 per cent to
25 per cent, the average duty being  around  17.8  per  cent.  If
levied, it may come into force from next month.

He said there was no justification for the EU to resort  to  this
step and urged the Minister to persuade the EU through  all  chan
nels to desist from its move.

Mr. Patodia pointed out that it was not as  if  the  EU  did  not
benefit from trade with India. In 1995, India  imported  430  mil
lion-ECU worth of textile machinery from the it. Airbus Industrie
was a major supplier of aircraft to Indian airlines.

He wanted the Government to send clear signals to the EU that any
unreasonable anti-dumping levy on grey cotton fabric sourced from
India would invite reciprocal action.

He also wanted the Minister to remove the ceiling on cotton  yarn
exports and to link the export of cotton yarn to  the  fulfilment
of hank yarn obligation. He said the annual quantitative  restric
tions on cotton yarn exports was based on the wrong premise  that
unlimited yarn export would hit domestic users.

While an additional 31.66 million kg of yarn  was  exported  last
year, the additional quantity supplied  within  the  country  was
136.86 million kg.

Mr. Patodia said the  hank  yarn  obligation  was  an  artificial
restriction as there was no shortage of it. In 1995-96, hank yarn
production had been put at 580 million kg but mills were  saddled
with unsold stocks.

The SIMA Chairman said the insistence  of  the  DGFT  that  mills
given EPCG licences should export cotton yarn of  counts  of  41s
and above or they should import cotton if  they  were  to  export
lower count yarn was a  retrograde  step,  which  would  hit  the
modernisation process.

He said the international demand for cotton yarn  of  counts  41s
and above was limited. In 1995-96, counts 41s  and  above  consti
tuted barely 16 per cent of the total cotton yarn  exported.  The
restriction on the counts of cotton yarn exported would deny  the
mills the facility of importing machinery availing of  concession
al duty.

He also wanted the threshold limit of Rs. 20 crores on  the  duty
free import of capital goods under the EPCG scheme to be  altered
in so far as the textile industry was concerned and  a  limit  of
Rs. 5 crores fixed.

Mr. Patodia said Bangladesh was the largest  importer  of  Indian
cotton yarn, importing to the tune of Rs. 700 crores to  Rs.  800
crores, which  were  routed  through  Petrapole.  Infrastructural
bottlenecks there had caused a delay of 30 to 60 days in clearing
the goods. Of the Rs. 250 crores sanctioned by  the  Centre  last
year to improve facilities, only Rs. 5 crores had been disbursed.

He also opposed any move to permit the  export  of  cotton  under
open general licence (OGL) as it would erode the  competitiveness
of the cotton textile industry. He said concrete  efforts  should
be made to increase the yield of cotton,  which  at  300  kg  per
hectare was one of the lowest in the world.

He urged the Centre to permit the import of viscose staple  fibre
(VSF) under OGL on a duty-free basis to check  the  price  of  in
digenously manufactured VSF. Mr. Patodia said though VSF was  the
nearest complement to cotton as a raw material and  fabrics  made
from it met the needs of the poorer sections, there were only two
indigenous producers of VSF and its price was raised frequently.

He said the import of VSF under OGL was being allowed  even  now,
but it attracted a duty of 56.21 per cent. He wanted  imports  to
be allowed on a duty-free basis, as in the case of  cotton.  This
would help the mills obtain raw materials  at  reasonable  prices
and also steady the  price of indigenously produced VSF.

Mr. Patodia said if they  were  to  remain  cost  effective,  the
garment/knitting industry had to use sophisticated machines. But,
these industries were reserved for the SSI sector with an  invest
ment cap of Rs. 60 lakhs. He suggested that in view of  the  need
for the latest technology, the investment limit be  scrapped.  De
reservation would attract large-scale industries  to  enter  this
field.

INDIA: Contest likely for top slot in Catholic Syrian Bank

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Special Correspondent

KOCHI, Oct. 1

WITH the term of the present Chairman of  Catholic  Syrian  Bank,
Mr. Alfred Solomon, drawing to a close  on  October  30,  a  keen
contest is likely for the top slot. At the recent annual  general
body meeting, the by-laws were amended for creating the post of a
part-time Chairman. Two contenders have emerged  from  among  the
existing directors.

Mr. George Chemmanur, one of the directors in the  race  for  the
top post, said several others in the board had been urging him to
throw his hat into the ring. He said that he would be a candidate
for the post.

Meanwhile, Mr. Jose Pulikken,  another  director,  told  Business
Line that the board would come out with  a  consensus  candidate,
emphasising that there would be no contest.

Being the seniormost director of the bank, Mr. Pulikken  did  not
envisage any contest from his junior colleagues on the board.  He
was optimistic that the board  would  forward  his  name  as  the
consensus candidate for the post of part-time Chairman. He evaded
questions on whether he would withdraw  his  candidature  in  the
case of a contest.

The contest for the Chairman's post will come out into  the  open
on October 1, when the Board of Directors meet  to  consider  the
names for the post. Once the Board's choice is finalised, it will
then have to be intimated to the RBI for ratification.

Though no outcome is expected at today's (Tuesday)  meeting,  the
issue is likely to exercise the minds of board members and figure
in board meetings in future.

The possibility of appointing a part-time Chairman arose once the
Banking Regulations Act was suitably amended to create the  post.
The Thrissur-based Dhanalakshmi  Bank  already  has  a  part-time
Chairman, Mr. T. S. Pattabhiraman.

Though the part-time Chairman is not entitled  to  exercise  much
executive powers, he is supposed to convene  and  coordinate  the
board meetings of the bank.

Meanwhile, the Catholic Syrian Bank is likely to remain  headless
once Mr. Solomon reverts to his parent organisation,  State  Bank
of India as Chief General Manager.

The bank is still in the process of short-listing applicants  for
the post of Managing  Director  from  among  the  respondents  to
newspaper advertisements. The respondents have to be at the level
of a Deputy General Manager in a nationalised bank. The Board  of
Directors will have to select three candidates  and  forward  the
list to the RBI for the final choice and approval.

Several directors conceded that this was a time-consuming process
and the slot was likely to be filled well after the exit  of  the
present Chairman. Even in the  event  of  a  consensus  candidate
emerging, the process of selecting a new part-time Chairman would
be delayed since the final seal of approval has to come from  the
RBI. In the interim period, when the present Chairman leaves till
a new Managing Director or a part-time Chairman is appointed, the
RBI is likely to ask a committee comprising  three  directors  to
discharge the duties of the head of the institution.

Some of the directors expressed apprehension  over  the  emerging
contest for the Chairman's post. They conceded that the  takeover
controversy in which all the existing directors played a part had
taken a toll on the fortunes of the bank. It was an arduous  task
re-building the bank from that crisis, they said.

Uncertainty continues to persist over the 39 per cent  equity  of
the bank, which had been purchased by the  Bangkok-based  Surchan
ChansriChawla. The request to transfer  the  shares  to  the  new
purchaser is still pending clearance from the RBI.

In the absence of a clear-cut  status  on  this  large  chunk  of
equity, the bank had written to the RBI stating its inability  to
abide by the stipulated capital adequacy norms.

The move to go in for a rights issue to shore up its capital  was
stalled on account of the uncertainty over the ownership of these
shares.

INDIA: Best and Crompton impasse: Mallya blames financial institutions"
"intransigence"

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by M. Ramesh

MADRAS, Oct. 1

Mr. Vijay Mallya, Chairman of the UB group, blamed  the  intransi
gence of the financial institutions for the continued impasse  in
reviving Best and Crompton Ltd.

Talking informally to this correspondent  at  the  extra-ordinary
general meeting of McDowell and Co. Ltd here  today,  Mr.  Mallya
said in just four days after the Best and Crompton AGM  (held  on
March 27, he had deposited the Rs. 5 crores with the bank  in  an
escrow account.

The rehabilitation package  was  contingent  upon  the  promoters
bringing in their initial contribution of Rs. 5  crores.  At  the
AGM, shareholders demanded an explanation as to  why  Mr.  Mallya
had not brought in the money. To which, he replied at  that  time
that any money brought in by the promoters would be taken away by
the financial institutions against the dues to them, and Best and
Crompton would not derive any benefit out of it.

"The financial institutions (ICICI) are just  not  interested",
Mr. Mallya said today. He said that within "just 96  hours"  of
the AGM, he had deposited the required  money  "in  cold  liquid
cash". He had also given a commitment in writing  that  the  pro
moters would bring in Rs.  20  crores,  once  the  rehabilitation
package is signed, he said.

"It is six months since  I  have  deposited  the  money  (Rs.  5
crores). Where is the rehabilitation package?", he asked.

Asked what were the  events  that  followed  his  depositing  the
money, Mr. Mallya  said  financial  institutions  said  that  the
company's building on Cenatoph Road (in Madras) would have to  be
sold. For this, there were several  permissions  to  be  obtained
from the State Government. Besides,  the  financial  institutions
wanted the Rs. 20 crores to be also deposited before the  rehabil
itation package was finalised.

"I am fed up with the whole thing", Mr.  Mallya  said.  "Every
body is blaming me for what happened, but Best and Crompton is  a
100-year old company", he said, implying that  the  reasons  for
its being in a shambles were historical.

At the Best and Crompton's AGM, Mr. Mallya had said that when  he
took over the company, he was  misled  by  the  fudged  accounts.
Therefore, he had not realised the extent to  which  the  company
had gone down. When he attended the first board meeting  of  Best
and Crompton (as soon as the UB group took it over) in  1989,  he
was forced to approve the transfer of funds from the reserves  to
the profit and loss account so that  the  company  could  show  a
profit and pay a 10 per cent dividend. Further, no provision  was
made for liabilities of Rs. 30 crores, which was against  account
ing norms, he told the shareholders, in front of Mr.  V.  Sriniva
san, senior partner, Fraser and Ross, which is the auditor of the
company.

He was equally unhappy with the way things were proceeding in the
matter of Mangalore Chemicals and  Fertilisers  Ltd  (MCF).  Here
again, Mr. Mallya  blamed  the  financial  institutions  for  not
agreeing to any meaningful rehabilitation package.

Indian Statistical Institute to conduct survey on co.s awarded ISO
certification

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Principal Correspondent

CALCUTTA, Oct. 1

THE Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) has decided to  conduct  a
national survey of the 1,260 companies which  have  been  awarded
the International Standards Organisation (ISO) certification.

The exercise was to be carried  out  from  Bangalore,  under  the
leadership of Mr. U. H. Acharya and Mr. Sanjit Ray, senior  advis
ers to the statistical quality control  and  operations  research
division of the ISI.

The head of the SQC and OR  division,  Professor  Anup  Majumdar,
told Business Line that the exercise was to find  whether,  since
the rush for the ISO 9000 certification began  fours  years  ago,
the Indian industry had really achieved a improvement in  quality
or was it just a status symbol that had remained on paper.

"We also want to evaluate the degree of competitive  edge  which
the certified companies have been able to gain for themselves, "
he said.

"We plan to assimilate  through  an  independent  analysis,  the
experiences of the big, small,  private  and  the  public  sector
companies which went through the certification process, "  Prof.
Majumdar said, adding that the exercise to be  conducted  through
client contacts, personal interviews and  questionnaires  to  the
ISO companies, had already been launched on  an  informal  basis.
The entire exercise was expected to be completed in three months.

Pointing out that the three year validity period of  the  certifi
cates would now have matured for around 100  companies,  he  said
the survey would also reveal whether the corporates had opted for
decertification or had in any way lost their certification due to
non-compliance.

Referring to the UK experience in this regard, he  said  the  ISO
9000 family of certifications had more followers in the  UK  than
in any other country, even as uncertainty remained about the real
benefits from certification.

An in-depth survey of British  companies,  however,  showed  that
only those which saw certification as an integral part  of  their
management strategies were able to push the quality benchmark  to
the full extent of its possibilities.

Stressing that certification did reward investment, he said  this
was borne out by almost  12,000  UK-based  businesses  which  had
opted for ISO 900  certification.  Their  sales  were  more  than
double the UK average between  1993-94  and  1994-95,  and  these
companies were four times more likely to have survived the recent
recession. Certified companies had a failure rate of 1.1 per cent
a year, compared with the national average of 5.2 per cent.

INDIA: Iomega unruffled by LS-120 drive entry

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Arun Natarajan

MADRAS, Oct. 1

IOMEGA Corp.,  the  US-based  maker  of  removable  data  storage
products, has dismissed any threat to its best-selling Zip  drive
from the recent entry of  the  LS-120  drive.  According  to  the
company's Senior Vice President (Europe),  Mr.  Srini  Nageshwar,
the technological superiority of the Zip drive  and  its  one-and
half year lead over the new product  will  ensure  its  continued
success over its competition.

The LS-120 has emerged as a potential threat to  the  Zip  drive,
with the world's leading PC maker, Compaq  Computers,  announcing
that it will include the LS-120 `flopptical' drive in  select  PC
models. Mr. Nageshwar, however, downplayed  the  significance  of
Compaq's move and said  the  Zip  continued  to  receive  growing
support from the rest of the industry.

"In any other industry, the  market  leader  commands  something
like 30 to 40 per cent of the market, and has a lot of clout.  In
the PC industry, however, where  the  leading  players  typically
have 10 to 15 per cent share, the influence of  just  one  player
like Compaq is not as important, " he said in an interview.

The LS-120 disks can store 120 MB of data, as against the 100  MB
capacity of the Zip disks. Mr. Nageshwar said though it would  be
"quite simple" for Iomega to increase the capacity of the  Zip,
the 20 MB difference would not warrant a change.

While the Zip drive uses a purely magnetic technology to read and
write data, the LS-120, which was developed jointly by 3M,  Matsu
shita and Compaq, uses a  combination  of  optical  and  magnetic
technology. (The `LS' in LS-120 stands  for  `laser-servo'  mecha
nism). While optical storage techniques -- like those used in  CD
drives -- provide higher storage capacities, the per  unit  costs
of optical media are much higher than those of  magnetic  storage
products. The flopptical technology attempts to  incorporate  the
best of both.

"We considered the use of a 21 MB  flopptical  as  far  back  as
1990. While in terms of performance it was slightly  faster  than
the floppy disk, the cost did not come down to  less  than  $100.
Companies like IBM and other  PC  makers  said  the  cost  should
approach something like $50. That is why we  decided  to  abandon
the flopptical technology, " Mr. Nageshwar said. While the costs
of the LS-120 and Zip drives are approximately the  same  ($200),
the LS-120 disks are expected to  cost  thrice  as  much  as  Zip
disks.

"In fact -- and this is not very well known -- it is we who sold
the flopptical to 3M and Matsushita. And it was some of our  guys
who moved to those  companies,  who  developed  it  further.  The
specifications (of the LS-120) are in fact still almost the same,
" he added.

The LS-120 enjoys an edge in the fact that  it  provides  compati
bility with the  currently  used  3.5-inch  (1.44  MB)  floppies.
Iomega is, however, confident that the  Zip  will  soon  overcome
even this handicap.

Mr. Nageshwar said the company closely analysed the importance of
compatibility before deciding to go ahead with a new format.  For
support, he pointed to the example of how the 3.5-inch floppy has
almost completely replaced its predecessor, the 5.25-inch  floppy
despite the incompatibility of their drives.

Since it began shipping in March last year,  Iomega's  Zip  drive
has become one of the hottest-selling data storage products.  The
company has sold more than two million drives in  a  little  more
than one year. It also sold about 10 million Zip disks. In  fact,
last year, it could not meet demand and has  since  licensed  out
the manufacture of drives and disks.

Iomega says the Zip  is  more  user-friendly.  According  to  Mr.
Nageshwar, the drive was created after a lot of  market  research
to identify user requirements and the problems  they  face  while
using existing storage devices. It comes with a  built-in  backup
system and the `Zip Tools' software,  which  makes  it  easy  for
users to manage, share and save data.

Iomega claims increasing  support  from  major  PC  and  consumer
electronics companies. The list includes IBM, HP,  Unisys,  Power
Computing, Micron Electronics, Acer, Packard Bell  and  NEC.  The
Zip is also supported by several of the world's leading drive and
media manufacturers, including TDK, Fuji, Sony, Maxell, and Seiko
Epson.

Recently Acer Corp. chose the Zip drive as the storage device for
its `AcerBasic' line of low-cost PCs. Also, Bandai Digital  Equip
ment Corp., one of the  licensees  for  Apple  Computer's  Pippin
Internet and gaming terminal, has announced that it will make the
Zip drive an option for its product.

Iomega's other storage products include the 1-gigabyte (GB) `Jaz'
drives and disks, the `Ditto' tape backup drives and  cartridges,
and the `Bernoulli' line of removable  drives  and  disks.  These
products are targeted at home and business PC  users.  The  educa
tion and  the  creative  professionals  (animators  and  graphics
specialists) segments were especially important to  the  company,
Mr. Nageshwar said.

Iomega has nearly 2,000 employees at its offices  worldwide.  The
company's products are available in India through TVSE's  Indmark
Infocom division.

The Zip drive was introduced in India two months ago.  The  drive
is priced at Rs. 11,500 and the disks at Rs. 1,200. Mr. Nageshwar
said the late launch here was primarily due to Iomega's inability
to provide enough units to countries  outside  the  Americas  and
Europe. He said the entire range  of  Iomega  products  would  be
available in India by the first quarter of 1997.

Mr. Nageshwar, who heads Iomega's European operations from  Germa
ny, also oversees the Indian market. Hailing from Tamil Nadu,  he
had a long stint at HP in the US before joining Iomega. While  at
HP, he was also involved in the development of the standards  for
the 3.5-inch floppy drive.

INDIA: National Thermal Power Corp posts record sales despite outstandings

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Senior Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

NATIONAL Thermal  Power  Corporation  Ltd  (NTPC),  has  reported
record sales of Rs. 8,387 crores during  1995-96  despite  having
outstandings in excess of Rs. 4,955 crores owed  to  the  corpora
tion by various agencies.

Addressing a press conference, the  NTPC  Chairman  and  Managing
Director, Mr. Rajendra Singh, said that the World  Bank  had  cau
tioned NTPC to take steps to recover its outstandings or the Bank
would stop the sanction of future loans.

He added that total dues, which stood at Rs. 4,047.96  crores  on
March 1996, increased to Rs.  4,944.4  crores  till  the  end  of
August, which is about 4.2 months of billing.

"This is against the World Bank norm  of  two  months.  We  have
geared our commercial activities and power supply  was  regulated
to major defaulters which include the State electricity boards of
Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. When  the  Railways
do not allow people to travel without tickets, why should we keep
on providing electricity without payment?" Mr. Singh asked.

Among the States which owed huge amounts to NTPC  include  Delhi,
which owes the corporation Rs. 743.89  crores,  UP  with  an  out
standing of Rs. 1,006.5 crores, Bihar Rs.  533.63  crores,  Jammu
and Kashmir Rs. 334.02 crores, Rajasthan Rs. 353.45 crores,  West
Bengal Rs. 186.85 crores and Maharashtra Rs. 239.37  crores.  Mr.
Singh added that the corporation was facing  less  problems  from
the States of the southern and western India.

He said that the corporation had entered into a tripartite  agree
ment with the Haryana electricity board for non-payment of  dues.
"The agreement which is legally binding  will  ensure  that  the
Reserve Bank of India pays us in case the SEB defaults."

However, despite such setbacks NTPC has been able to  register  a
net profit of Rs. 1,352.61 crores and has declared a dividend  of
Rs. 195 crores for the financial year 1995-96, up  from  Rs.  130
crores paid as dividend  last  year.  The  corporation  generated
93,155 million units of electricity at a  plant  load  factor  of
78.80 per cent, Mr. Singh said. He added that  the  total  commer
cial realisation during the year was 84.54 per cent amounting  to
Rs. 7,171.59 crores.

During the year, NTPC commissioned an additional capacity of  710
MW by synchronising one 500 MW unit in Talcher, Orissa,  and  one
unit of 210 MW in Kahalgaon, Bihar. Besides, the corporation also
acquired 460 MW of Talcher Thermal Power station  of  the  Orissa
State Electricity Board. "The total installed  capacity  of  the
corporation rose to 16,795 MW on  March  31,  1996,"  Mr.  Singh
said.

He added that during 1995-96, NTPC generated 93,155  MU  of  elec
tricity and contributed more than  31  per  cent  of  the  entire
thermal generation and 24.6 per cent of the total  generation  in
the country. "The availability factor  of  NTPC  coal-based  sta
tions for the year was 85.32 per cent, " he said.

He added that the corporation's total approved investment  up  to
March 1996 was Rs. 27,873.28 crores corresponding to an  approved
capacity of 19,115 MW.

Turning his attention to external assistance, Mr. Singh said that
work on the second stage of Unchahar project had  commenced  with
an assistance of $ 160 millions from the Asian Development  Bank.
He added that the Japanese  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund
(OECF) had agreed to give a financial assistance  of  19.817  bil
lion Yen for the proposed 1,000 MW coal-based  project  in  Simha
dri, Andhra Pradesh.

INDIA: Pradeshiya Industrial & Investment Corporation of UP taking tips
from ground realities

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Rabindra Nath Sinha

LUCKNOW, Oct. 1

THE Pradeshiya Industrial &  Investment  Corporation  of  UP  Ltd
(PICUP), which is among the top three promotional agencies in the
country, has sought to strike a balance between  its  promotional
role and the ground realities in the capital and money markets.

With bank and institutional  funds  costly,  the  capital  market
showing no signs of a sustained pick-up and ICD rates fluctuating
on the higher side, the PICUP top brass found some deviation from
usual practices unavoidable if it were to ensure  that  its  rela
tively cheap funds were  effectively  utilised  for  the  State's
industrialisation.

Thus, in its fine-tuned scheme of things, term-lending, equipment
refinance and equipment finance have been  accorded  the  highest
priority, which, in turn, means drastically  reduced  commitments
for short-term loans. Also, PICUP has taken the view that working
capital must be the responsibility of commercial banks.

Finally, PICUP, considering ground realities, has  chosen  to  de
emphasise the joint sector concept. As it is,  entrepreneurs  are
not showing much interest in the joint  sector  concept.  On  its
part, PICUP has lost interest as subsequent disinvestment  hardly
ever takes place and, therefore, the  objective  of  re-deploying
funds in the equity of new ventures is  not  realised.  Moreover,
disinvestment in the  present  depressed  state  of  the  capital
market is ruled out.

PICUP has also minimised the earlier practice of back-loading  as
a result of which bulk of the disbursals used to be made  in  the
last four months of project implementation. A strategy of  evenly
spread disbursals is already in place to the benefit of  entrepre
neurs who, in the prevailing circumstances, are finding it  tough
to raise funds from the capital market.

The PICUP Chairman, Mr. Brijendra Sahay, and the  Managing  Direc
tor, Mr. Atul Chaturvedi, are optimistic  that  despite  the  pre
vailing political uncertainties, 1996-97 will prove to be another
successful year for the organisation "which  has  been  able  to
earn the confidence of entrepreneurs because of its  professional
ism and expertise in  project  formulation  and  appraisal".  It
enjoys `A' rating of IDBI and SIDBI, they point out with a  sense
of satisfaction.

Against the targeted Rs. 185 crores for 1996-97, sanctions in the
six months to September are placed  at  around  Rs.  134  crores,
which is 90 per cent higher on Rs. 72 crores for the  first  half
of 1995-96. Disbursements between April and September are  placed
at Rs. 64 crores, against Rs. 63 crores for the  same  period  of
1995-96. The mismatch, according to Mr.  Chaturvedi,  is  due  to
fact that this year  August  and  September  accounted  for  many
sanctions. PICUP's MD feels sanctions for the  current  financial
year may exceed the target if buoyancy  returns  to  the  capital
market.

Recoveries at around 85 per cent of the target should  be  consid
ered "good", says Mr. Chaturvedi. NPA,  at  9.92  per  cent  in
1995-96, was lower on 9.99 per cent of 1994-95 and the aim is  to
bring it down to around nine per cent at the end of  the  current
financial year. PICUP makes 100 per cent provision  against  NPA,
he points out.

According to estimates, its net profit in 1995-96  stood  at  Rs.
2.87 crores. The net profit for 1994-95 was higher  at  Rs.  5.54
crores. A pronounced downtrend in its merchant  banking  activity
during the whole of 1995-96 is a major factor to cause a  dip  in
the net profit. For the  current  financial  year,  expecting  an
improvement in the  overall  situation,  PICUP  has  projected  a
substantially higher profit of around Rs.  10  crores.  "We  fer
vently hope buoyancy will return to the capital  market  and  our
merchant banking activity will pick up, " says PICUP's MD.

An overwhelming majority of the proposals that it  receives  from
entrepreneurs are for setting up units in western and central UP.
The western UP areas -- Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater  Noida,  Meerut
-- contiguous to New Delhi are  naturally  the  investors'  first
preference because  of  excellent  communication  facilities  and
proximity to markets. Central UP is the next choice of investors;
a good number of units are already there and more are  likely  to
come up. Of the new proposals received and being processed by the
organisation, many are for setting up units for auto  components,
steel fabrication, castings, bulk drugs and pharmaceuticals.

In eastern UP, sugar and by-products continue to be the  mainstay
of the economy. PICUP hardly receives any investment proposal  of
the kind it gets for western and central UP. Mr. Sahay says  that
efforts are being made  to  generate  investments  in  agro-based
industries including food processing units.

While time alone will show to what extent the  efforts  have  suc
ceeded, it is clear that in eastern UP, further breakthrough will
be possible only with integrated sugar  complexes  having  within
their purview paper making facility, distillery, chemicals  units
and cogeneration of power.

The success of PICUP in its rather limited sphere  does  not  war
rant an inference that UP is set to emerge industrially stronger.
Because of political instability and socio-political tensions  in
the past five years, the State could not derive benefits from the
liberalisation process, despite the fact that its incentives  for
new industries compare  favourably  with  those  offered  by  the
industrially-advanced States of Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Much will hinge on the outcome of the ongoing electoral  process.
The State's industrialisation prospects will certainly look up if
the electoral process paves the way for political stability.

INDIA: Chennai housing property still dear

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Deeptha Rajkumar

CHENNAI, Oct. 1

WHILE commercial property prices in Chennai have  plateaued  over
the past 5-6 months after a distinct fall, the prices of  residen
tial property in the city, though not exactly  untouched  by  the
slide, continue to rule high.

Builders, promoters and surveyors alike  insist  that  there  has
been no great slide in residential property prices in  the  city.
There are instances where residential properties within the  city
and even in the suburbs have defied the trend.

Of late, with a burgeoning middle class, there  has  been  a  con
scious shift on the part  of  reputed  builders  to  exploit  the
hitherto untapped potential in the suburbs. As such,  the  market
only anticipates an increase in the supply of housing stock.

While conceding that land value in Chennai has  appreciated,  Mr.
C. H. Gopinatha Rao, a valuer, however, feels that it is  more  a
seller's market. The rules and regulations are more in favour  of
the promoter.

According to Mr. P. Viswanathan, president, Sanmar Properties and
Investment Ltd, the residential property market  is  dictated  by
peripheral sentiment. His argument is that any difference can  be
attributed to the attitude of the end-user. "I conceive the real
estate market as a standard industrial product. As such, I market
a unit apartment as an industrial and emotional product. You  may
buy it as a perception product."

Mr. Ravikumar, General Manager, Chaitanya  Builders  and  Leasing
Pvt. Ltd, agrees that the effect is not so much in terms of money
as in terms of perception. He is of the  view  that  there  is  a
"tendency of late on the part of the end-user  to  postpone  his
decision".

Mr. Viswanathan said, "There is  a  difference  today  in  that,
deals which six months ago would have  been  concluded  within  a
week are taking longer to transact and  at  a  slower  pace.  But
there are transactions taking  place  and  not  at  lower  quotes
either." A tight money market,  a  dull  stock  market  and  the
effects of other financial sectors, are factors that  go  towards
slowing the pace.

Flats in Tambaram and Velachery quote at Rs. 800-1,200 a sq.  ft.
and in Mogappair around Rs. 1,100 a sq. ft. Flats in  residential
areas like Mylapore and T. Nagar go  for  upwards  of  Rs.  2,500
2,900 a sq. ft. and in areas such as Chamiers Road, Landons  Road
and Victoria Crescent, anywhere between Rs. 3,000-3,500 a sq. ft.

One reason for the comparative stability is the fact that Chennai
is predominantly an end-users' market, where in most  cases  hous
ing is an investment for life rather  than  for  speculative  pur
poses. Hence, the degree of  volatility  witnessed  elsewhere  is
absent.

Reiterating this factor is Alacrity Housing Ltd, which says  that
it is into housing as a basic need and not into real  estate  per
se. With ongoing projects in the city as well as in the  suburbs,
the company claims to have remained  untouched  by  the  apparent
lull. The company, which has branched out into the suburbs, feels
that there is a substantial market for housing there. Sales,  the
company asserts, have in no way gone down.

Mr. Navratan Lunawat, Chairman  and  Managing  Director,  Arihant
Foundations and Housing Ltd, is of the opinion  that  residential
property prices have gone up. In its  forthcoming  projects,  the
company has targeted the upper segment of the residential  proper
ty market. He reiterates that sales were never  a  problem.  "It
all depends on the credibility and repute of the builder."

Another point of view is that the lull in the real estate  market
today is more a process of  technical  correction  than  anything
else. What follows is swift reassurance that  given  the  current
scenario in the residential property market, neither the end-user
nor the long-term investor need worry. Only those  in  for  quick
returns may be affected.

Sources in the industry maintain that for the real estate  market
in the city to recoup its former gloss, it  could  take  anywhere
from nine to 12 months. Meanwhile, builders continue to look  for
customers. There are hoardings across the city  advertising  easy
credit. And the response to advertisements shows that not only is
the broker network active, the enthusiasm of  the  landowner  too
has not flagged.

INDIA: New rubber tapping system

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Aravindan

UNLIKE most plantation crops, harvesting is a complicated process
in rubber. Latex is obtained from the  bark  of  the  tree  by  a
process of `controlled-wounding' when the shavings  of  bark  are
removed.

The response to different tapping systems varies from  one  clone
to another. In general, budded trees are to  be  tapped  on  half
spiral alternate daily (1/2Sd/2) system  and  seedlings  on  half
spiral third daily (1/2Sd/3) system. There are, however,  certain
clones such as RRII 105, PB 235 and PB 28/59 which are  prone  to
tapping panel dryness under alternate daily system.

To ward off the incidence of panel dryness, it is recommended  to
adopt d/3 tapping system where a high incidence of panel  dryness
is encountered. It is preferable to resort to d/3 system at  BO-1
and BO-2 stages if high incidence of dry trees is encountered  in
new high-yielding clones. Daily tapping will  lead  to  increased
incidence of panel dryness.

For high-yielding varieties d/3 systems  can  be  adopted  during
tapping on the virgin bark. Though the yield per hectare  may  be
less during the initial period, the return  per  tapper  will  be
higher. The difference between d/2 and d/3  system  will  be  nar
rowed in due course and there will be saving in  the  cost  under
d/3 system.

The yield from trees varies with clone, age of tree, fertility of
soil, climatic conditions, tapping system followed and  skill  of
the tapper.

Intensive tapping is generally done on old rubber trees for a few
years prior to their removal. The methods  of  intensive  tapping
depend on the  condition  of  trees,  previous  tapping  systems,
availability of bark and the period  available  for  exploitation
before felling.

When tapping of renewed bark on basal panels becomes  uneconomic,
new cuts are opened at higher levels, 180 cm from  bud  union  or
even higher. The tapper uses a small ladder  to  reach  the  cut.
Since ladder tapping is more  strenuous  and  time-consuming,  re
duced tapping tasks are done.

Controlled upward tapping (CUT) is of recent origin.  It  can  be
practiced for longer exploitation of the virgin  bark  above  the
base panel. In the CUT system, instead of using a ladder, a  long
handled modified gouge knife is used for upward tapping from  the
ground and bark consumption is minimised.  Higher  yield  can  be
obtained as there is no bark island effect.

In the CUT system, monthly bark consumption is about  3-4  cm  in
the lower half of the panel and 4-5 cm in  the  upper  half.  The
support cut may be cleaned 3-4 times a  month  to  prevent  spill
over. Since it is difficult to rainguard the panel it is  advised
to rest the panel during the  rainy  season.  With  tapping  rest
during rainy season, one panel can be tapped for  more  than  two
years. Efforts are on to evaluate methods to tap the  high  panel
during rainy season.

Special training is required to use the modified gouge knife  and
to tap without raising the hands  above  the  shoulder.  As  rain
guarding is not a normal practice in  Kanyakumari  district,  CUT
can be practised by small growers and estates. About 50 per  cent
increase in yield can be achieved by adopting this method.

Trees can be puncture-tapped when they attain 40-45 cm girth  one
year before normal opening of the tree. But, this  is  restricted
to large estates on an observational basis.

INDIA: Campco to make, sell arecanut products

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by R. Mohan

MANGALORE, Oct. 1

THE buzz word at the Rs. 175-crore Campco, Mangalore is to  diver
sify. The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing  Co
operative Ltd, has wiped off its modest losses and emerged with a
profit of Rs. 1 crore in 1995-96.

"The figures are yet being audited.  We  will  improve  our  net
profits this year again, " Mr. K. Ram Bhat, Chairman  of  Campco
said. Talking to Business Line,  he said it had  already  decided
to reintroduce Campco chocolates in the market as early as  possi
ble.

At present, the Rs.  20-crore  chocolate  manufacturing  unit  at
Puttur is utilised by Nestle. This agreement will end in 2000 and
attractive terms are offered to Campco to let it out on lease for
30 years. However, Campco now wants to go it alone.

The aim of Campco is to ensure a fair price for arecanut  farmers
in Karnataka and Kerala. It  has  been  holding  the  price  line
favourably since 1990. It had bought 25,000  tonnes  of  arecanut
from farmers last year and this year the target was three  lakhs,
he said.

There are 64,000 farmer members of Campco in Karnataka  and  Kera
la, 465 co-operative members and 129 branches all over  the  coun
try. Though Campco's market share is only about 15 per  cent,  it
influences the market price.

One of the diversification is to make baskets and trays through a
technology developed by the Central Food  Technological  Research
Institute (CFTRI) in Mysore. The other is  to  sell  arecanut  in
small pouches of different sizes.

Mr. Pramod Kumar Rai, Managing Director of Campco, said  the  Rs.
50-lakh facility to produce such pouches was  ready  at  Yeyyadi,
near Mangalore. Trial production had commenced and Campco  expect
ed a good domestic market and demand in places such as  Singapore
and the Gulf countries, he said.

About 68,000 ha producing 1,00,000 tonnes is  under  arecanut  in
Karnataka and 69,000 ha in Kerala producing 80,000 tonnes. Campco
has already signed a tripartite agreement with the CFTRI and  the
Next Paradigm in Singapore to manufacture and sell articles  such
as baskets and trays from the arecanut  sheath  and  leaves.  The
supari pouches will  be  of  scented  and  non-scented  varieties
priced between Re. 1 and Rs.  1.50,  according  to  current  esti
mates, Mr. Rai said.

For years it was manufacturing `Winner' comparable to  Bournvita.
"From this year onwards we want to repackage it  and  market  it
aggressively, " Mr. Rai said.

The co-operative approach has helped tackle  pests  and  diseases
which affected Indian cash crops. The latest  is  the  `Kole'  or
`Mahale' disease, which has affected arecanut  trees  in  Puttur,
Sullia and Bantwal areas.

Mr. Ram Bhat and Mr. Rai were confident of tackling this  disease
and have decided to set up a research and development  unit.  The
endosulfan pesticide used killed  the  milibug  and  its  natural
predator. Further research will concentrate on a cure that  would
spare the natural predator of these ant-like pests.

Campco has invited experts from the Bangalore-based University of
Agricultural Sciences, Horticultural Department  and  Plantations
Research Institute to tackle the disease which has affected about
50 acres this year.
