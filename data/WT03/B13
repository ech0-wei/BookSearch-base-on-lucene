LARGE AND SMALL SMR OPERATORS JOIN HANDS...
  ...And Other Possible Headlines To Watch for in 1996

     The headline above is not as unlikely as it may seem, according
to Bob Foosaner, senior vice president-government affairs, Nextel
Communications Inc..  True, small and large specialized mobile radio
(SMR) operators seemed irreconcilable in 1995, as they clashed over
how the FCC should change the regulatory landscape at 800 MHz (LMRN,
Dec. 22).
     But SMRs big and small should be able to see eye to eye on many
regulatory issues that the commission will address this year, Foosaner
said.  
     "We [in] the SMR industry are going to become common carriers on
Aug. 10, 1996," said Foosaner.  "And there are eight to 10 outstanding
rulemakings that can ... either allow us to move our businesses
forward or adversely impact our businesses.  We should have common
interests in these proceedings, which may hurt the law firms, but
would help the industry."  
     It is in the interest of all SMRs, for example, to get an
exemption from the requirement of having to offer enhanced "911"
service (LMRN, Oct. 13). 
     Among the other questions the commission has yet to decide:  
     *  Should all CMRS providers be required to resell airtime, as
cellular companies must do today (LMRN, Sept. 29)?
     *  How should local exchange carriers and CMRS providers be
compensated for terminating one another's calls (LMRN, Dec. 22)?
     *  Should CMRS providers be required to provide interconnections
to one another (LMRN, Sept. 29)?                                      

  ...SMR Operators Drop Interconnect Service

     Depending on the rules the FCC imposes on CMRS providers, some
SMR operators may find it too onerous to offer interconnect service,
said Alan Shark, president and CEO of the American Mobile
Telecommunications Association (AMTA).  Shark pointed to the possible
requirement that CMRS providers may have to offer enhanced 911
services--as well as pay fees to help subsidize telephone service in
underserved areas.  In addition, they may have to modify their
networks to allow for wiretapping by the FBI, he said.
     "If you're interconnected, you may find that there are certain
responsibi-lities that come with that ... that may not be worth it."
     Another story still unfolding, Shark said, is how the commission
will define CMRS providers.  Such providers will be subject to certain
common carrier rules, unlike private mobile radio service providers,
which will be exempt.

  ...Commission Begins Licensing New Narrowband Channels

     This story is about the hope of private land mobile radio (PLMR)
users below 512 MHz, who face an ongoing freeze on new narrowband
channels created by the commission's June refarming decision (LMRN,
June 16).
     "We're waiting for the development of technical standards," said
Fred Day, executive director, government relations of the Industrial
Telecommunications Association (ITA).  Such standards, under
development by the Telecommunications Industry Association (Working
Group 8.8), should be available before March 1.  The standards are one
of three requirements for a successful refarming effort, according to
the Land Mobile Communications Council, a confederation of frequency
coordinators and other associations, including ITA.  
     The second requirement is that the FCC protect low-power offset
systems at 450-470 MHz from full-power systems.  The third is that the
FCC establish deadlines for the transition to more efficient
technologies.

  ...FCC Allocates New Spectrum for Public Safety

     The work of the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee
promises to be the major story for public safety radio users this
year, according to Bob Gurss, legal counsel, Association of Public-
Safety Communications Officials-International Inc.  The committee, a
joint venture of the FCC and the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration, is charged with determining the spectrum
requirements of public safety users through the year 2010.  
     "We feel that it is important that the FCC take some action in
the very near term before all the spectrum gets auctioned off," said
Gurss.  "That's our biggest concern."   The committee plans to issue a
final report by September.  Gurss said the FCC may adopt a rulemaking
proposal allocating new public safety spectrum and then fold in the
report as comments on the rulemaking.
     Another headline to watch for, "FCC Creates New Public Safety
Division."  Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Chief Michelle Farquhar
mentioned this possibility in a speech last month.

  ...Strong Partnerships Separate Winners and Losers in Paging

     It is not enough to be able to sell one-way pagers on your own
anymore, said Scott Baradell, director, corporate communications,
Paging Network Inc.. New services that carriers are offering to break
out of the pack require that they invest in alliances to succeed, he
said.  Voice paging, two-way paging, wireless e-mail:  all require
strong support from software and hardware developers, such as
manufacturers of personal organizers.  Carriers also will need to find
resellers with the expertise to market these products.

MOTOROLA SYSTEM OUTAGE LEADS TO STORM OF BAD PUBLICITY
Vendor Tried To Warn Portland of Potential Problem

     A failure by a 3-year-old public safety radio system promoted as
a showcase by Motorola Inc. whipped up resentment last month in
Portland, Ore., and generated press that is every publicist's
nightmare.
     Motorola had tried to warn the city:  Two months before the
outage, it sent a bulletin explaining how to reset the SmartZone
manager of the 800 MHz trunked system to prevent overloading.  But
Dennis Quail, communications services division director, said his
staff has no record of receiving it.  
     He added, "My question is, why wasn't [this parameter] set by
Motorola to start with? ... And if Motorola was aware of [the problem]
and they've got engineers locally in town, why didn't they come over
and make sure it was set [properly]?"
     LMRN was unable to contact Motorola executives in time to comment
on this article.  
     But one of Motorola's largest customers said that public safety
agencies must take a measure of responsibility for system failures.  
     "I would be less critical of the vendor [than Portland is]," said
David Held, deputy director-communications division of the Michigan
State Police.  "[That's] because a vendor, we must remember, is in
business to make money. ... A lot of people put their complete trust
in them and figure they'll do everything for them, not thinking what
their motives are."
     Quail responded:  "It's interesting that he might say that.  We
received the system from Motorola. ...
[The setting] was something that was supposed to have been in place. 
It's [wrong] that the customer had to find out about it the hard way."
     Regardless of who was responsible for the five-hour outage on
Dec. 12, city public safety officials put Motorola on the grill,
speaking out through the city's daily newspaper, The Oregonian.  
     "Here we have this multimillion-dollar system that allows us to
talk to everyone but the Lord himself, and when we need it most, it's
gone," Sgt. Bob Baxter of the Portland Police Bureau was quoted saying
in the Dec. 20 article.  Oregonian reporters were not able to get a
detailed response from Motorola.
     The Oregonian's editorial page took its own shot:  "Portland
ought to be the most cantankerous customer in the country until
Illinois-based Motorola delivers on the city's $8.5 million investment
in an emergency radio system that failed for 5-1/2 hours during last
week's big windstorm."                                                

  ...Director Calls Motorola Responsive

     But in an interview this week, David Kish, Portland general
services director, said that "to be fair, [Motorola] has worked very
hard in the past couple of weeks to fix the problem."  He said that
Motorola has sent roughly a dozen top corporate and engineering staff
to investigate the failure, and has placed an engineer on call.  
     Kish said Motorola believes it has fixed the problem (see side
bar, page 2); later this month, the company plans to test the system
to make sure.  
     Motorola also plans to upgrade the system's software, which
should eliminate some "mysterious events" that occurred last summer. 
One of these caused a "minor outage," Kish said.  "We've had minor
problems from time to time, but Motorola has been reasonably
responsive," Kish said.  
     "In any new system like this, you go though a period where you
have bugs."  But, he added, "This was the first big test of the
system, and it didn't do what it was supposed to do.  It was the first
citywide emergency that would create this kind of traffic."  The city
plans to run a disaster drill in February to try to rebuild confidence
among users.
     Kish confirmed that the city is withholding $500,000 of the $8.5
million system until the city is happy with the system.  The city also
has suspended visits by prospective customers; more than 100 agencies
from China, Japan, Spain, New York City and elsewhere have seen the
Portland system.  

  ...Should Portland Have Taken More Responsibility?

     Portland and Motorola collaborated on system design and
construction, and the city handles ongoing maintenance, according to
Quail.  He said the city devotes six full-time technicians to the 800
MHz trunked radio system.
     Michigan State Police's Held, also a Motorola customer, was
unaware of how much expertise Portland devotes to the system.  But he
believes that at least some agencies do "fail to have a resident
electrical engineer ... to design and look out for their own needs or
to hire a consultant."
     When LMRN described Portland's outage, Held said, "I would not be
too critical of Motorola in the scenario you described. ... It's
pretty standard in the industry, for example, that you don't mix data
and voice on the same channel.  I would say that that's more the
responsibility of the customer."  Quail responded that there was no
way for the city to have realized that the control channel was set for
both voice and data.  "My thinking is, if [Motorola] knew that, why
didn't they come over here, as we still have not accepted the system. 
And until we believe everything is performing properly, we will not do
a final sign-off."  (Dennis Quail, 503/823-6971; David Kish, 503/823-
5252; David Held, 517/336-6616; Pat Shod, Motorola, 708/576-6612.)

WHAT HAPPENED

     During a windstorm in Portland, Ore., on Dec. 12, roughly half of
the emergency workers using a Motorola 800 MHz trunking system were
unable to hear their dispatchers, according to David Kish, Portland
general services director.  The system failure lasted roughly five
hours.  Kish said the problem has been traced to a control channel
that was set for both voice and data, when it should have been set
only for data.  
     When the system was flooded with calls during the windstorm, it
was unable to assign channels quickly enough.  According to Kish, the
problem was exasperated by workers who kept clicking their units,
rather than clicking them once, then waiting for a call-back. 
     Kish said that nothing bad happened as a result of the outage. 
Emergency workers were able to talk to one another using simplex
channels, and they improvised communications with the dispatchers
using data channels and cellular phones.  Some police and firefighters
also used a backup land mobile radio system.
     Communications services division Director Dennis Quail said that
Motorola plans to rewrite the link protocol between the SmartZone
manager and the 6809 controller to permanently fix the setting on
data.

**********************************************************************

     At press time, the FCC announced that round 14 of the 900 MHz SMR
auction took in $61.7 million, excluding withdrawal payments.  There
were 81 new bids placed, down from 86 in the previous round.

TOP 10 STORIES OF 1995

1. FCC Begins Refarming of Private Land Mobile Radio Spectrum Below
512 MHz: The commission adopted the latest in a series of refarming
orders to increase spectrum efficiency.  The fallout in equipment
choices, channel availability and frequency coordination will be felt
for years (LMRN, June 16, Oct. 20, Dec. 1).

2. FCC Tries To Please Big and Small With 800 MHz SMR Order:  The
commission walked a narrow tightrope--some might call it a plank--in
trying to balance the interests of large and small specialized mobile
radio companies in its December order.  Barring delays, look for
auctions in late spring or early summer.  Small companies mounted one
of the largest land mobile lobbying campaigns in recent memory to
protect their interests (LMRN, Sept. 22, Dec. 22). 

3. AT&T, MCI and Sprint Enter the Paging Marketplace:  The big-three
long-distance companies all got into paging this year in a big way: 
MCI Communications Corp. through resale agreements with SkyTel Corp.
and Paging Network Inc.; Sprint Corp. through a resale agreement with
Paging Network Inc.; and AT&T through its purchase of McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc. (LMRN, Jan. 6, Sept. 29, Dec. 15).

4. FCC Issues 'Wish List' To Improve FCC Procedures:  A 32-page FCC
report on reinventing government provided the foundation for several
far-reaching initiatives, including the proposed expansion of the
FCC's auction authority--now proposed as part of the 1996 budget bill-
-and the simplifying of application procedures (LMRN, Feb. 3).

5. SMR Industry Growth Kept on Ice:  MTA-EMCI Inc. this fall predicted
that the number of specialized mobile radio (SMR) subscribers would
grow 13 percent this year.  Observers blamed part of the lackluster
growth on regulatory uncertainty at 800 MHz, including an application
freeze dating from the summer of 1994.

6. Public Safety Advisory Committee Formed: The Public Safety Wireless
Advisory Committee was formed this summer to determine public safety
spectrum requirements to the year 2010.  Hearing complaints that the
FCC and National Telecommunications and Information Administration
sometimes worked at cross-purposes, the House Subcommittee on
Appropriations (Commerce) asked the two to jointly sponsor the public
safety committee (LMRN, Aug. 4).

7. Congress Proposes Uniform Antenna Tower Rules:  The House version
of the telecommunications deregulation bill (H.R. 1555) would direct
the FCC to adopt policies regarding state and local regulation of
towers for commercial mobile radio services providers.  A compromise
version between the House and Senate versions of the bill still is
being worked out (LMRN, May 19).

8. 220 MHz Players May Be Forced To Return Money to Arizona Investors:
Specialized mobile radio (SMR) companies sat up this summer when we
reported that the Arizona Corporation Commission had accused SMR
Advisory Group, L. C. and several affiliated companies and executives
of running afoul of securities laws.  The case reflects efforts to
crack down on the sale of unregistered securities to ill-informed
investors (LMRN, July 21).  The case may be decided in early 1996.

9. APCO 25 Celebrates Incomplete Standard:  Although the Association
of Public Safety Communications Officials International Inc.
celebrated completion of the APCO 25 digital standard, critics were
quick to point out that the association still had work to do on the
trunking protocols (LMRN, Aug. 18).

10. SkyTel Launches Two-way Paging:  SkyTel Corp. got the jump on
rival paging carriers this fall by becoming the first company to
launch two-way paging service over narrowband personal communications
services (PCS) channels.  Although Motorola Inc. was forced to take
back an early batch of defective units, by December SkyTel executives
said that several thousand units were in the hands of paying customers
(LMRN, Sept. 22, Dec. 1).

NEW DEFINITIONS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC SERVICES

     The next meeting of the Public Safety Wireless Advisory
Committee-slated for Jan. 7-9 in Berkeley, Calif.--will take place,
even if the FCC and National Telecommunications and Information
Administration remain shut down.  The committee approved the following
definitions at its mid-December meeting.  
Public Safety:  The public's right, exercised through federal, state
or local government as prescribed by law, to protect and preserve
life, property, and natural resources and to serve the public welfare.
Public Safety Services: Those services rendered by or through federal,
state, or local government entities in support of public safety
duties.  (Don Speights, 202/482-1652; http://www.pcia.com.)

AMTA TO ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION OF 800 MHZ ORDER

     The American Mobile Telecommunications Association plans to ask
the FCC to reconsider its decision not to offer bidding credits to
small businesses in the 800 MHz SMR auctions slated for the middle of
this year (LMRN, Dec. 22).  The request likely will be filed by mid-
February in a petition for reconsideration and clarification.  The
association also plans to ask for an extension of the 800 MHz
rulemaking proposal's comment period.
     AMTA will decide what else to ask for in a meeting of its small
business council, regulatory forum and board of directors later this
month, Lyon said.       Along with bidding credits, AMTA likely will
ask the FCC to reconsider its plan to partly base the upfront payment
on how incumbered a license is.  Lyon called this equation burdensome
both for the commission and for bidders.  AMTA also will ask the FCC
to clarify how it plans to allow early nego-tiations between
incumbents and prospective auction winners.  What if these companies
do not win? asked Lyon.  Will they still have to pay the costs of
retuning the incumbents?  (AMTA, 202/331-7773.)

MOTOROLA HAVING TROUBLE MEETING DEMAND FOR PAGERS

     Motorola Inc.'s factories have not been keeping up with the
orders for pagers placed by at least one key customer.  A Motorola
spokesperson said that supply is expected to catch up with demand in
the next couple of months.  She attributed the shortfall to the fast
growth of the U.S. paging market, which took Motorola by surprise.
     During an analysts' teleconference Jan. 3, Steven Jacoby, chief
operating officer of Metrocall Inc., said that since the beginning of
August, Motorola has not been able to fill its pager orders on time.  
     The situation has improved "tremendously" in the last few weeks,
to the point where Motorola fills roughly 90 percent of any particular
Metrocall order on time, he said.  On time means four to six weeks,
Jacoby said. 
     However, Metrocall still is having difficulty getting enough
Ultra Express and Encore numeric pagers and Advisor alphanumeric
pagers to meet demand.  
     Jacoby said that the entire industry has felt the pager
shortfall.  Indeed, a spokesman for Paging Network Inc., the country's
largest paging carrier, acknowledged "periodic" shortages at Motorola. 
However, they have had no impact on the company's subscriber growth,
he said.
     Vincent Kelly, Metrocall chief financial officer, told analysts
that the company logged its strongest subscriber growth ever in the
fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.  It added more than 60,000 paging units
in service.  That is a leap over the third quarter's 42,000 gain, when
pager delays were at their worst.  
     "The problem that we had [that] quarter ... was [that] we
couldn't get our hands on product--period," said Kelly.   
     Metrocall's stock had dropped 39 percent from $29 on Sept. 21 to
$17.75 the day of the conference (Jan. 3).  Yesterday (Jan. 4), the
stock fell another $1.25 to $16.50.  Here are some other facts that
emerged in the analysts's meeting, in which company officials
attempted to shore up investor confidence.  
     *  Metrocall has its eye on several possible acquisition targets,
which together have more than 700,000 subscribers.  Currently the
company, the country's sixth-largest carrier, has an estimated 940,000
subscribers.
     *  Metrocall is talking with five paging carriers about reselling
their advanced paging services over narrowband PCS channels.  
     *  More than 41 percent of the company's subscriber base has been
won by indirect distribution channels.  Metrocall recently signed
distribution agreements with nationwide retailer Ritz Camera Centers
Inc., Beltsville, Md., and catalog sales company Crutchfield Corp.,
Charlottesville, Va.
     *  The company recently increased its direct sales force by 100
people.

IN BRIEF

     Glenayre Technologies Inc.  has introduced new network standards
designed to increase paging network capacity by nearly 100 times.  The
new protocols are called Wireless Messaging transfer protocol (WMtp)
and the Wireless Messaging application programming interface (WMapi). 
WMtp, which can coexist with the Telocator Network Paging Protocol
(TNPP).  It is based on the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) used in the Internet and allows operators to
transmit Internet mail to pagers.  WMapi lets service providers create
two-way messaging applications for narrowband personal communications
services (PCS) networks, including those supporting Telocator Message
Entry (TME) standard.  (Irene Moore, 770/623-2449.)

     MobileMedia Corp. (MBLM) plans to introduce single-frequency
pagers in the second quarter of 1996.   Company officials said the
switch to one frequency will allow consumers to upgrade their paging
services or to relocate without changing their pager.  Separately,
yesterday (Jan. 4) MobileMedia completed its purchase of BellSouth
MobileComm for roughly $930 million.  (Jean Coppenbarger, MobileComm,
601/977-1648.)

     At press time, Mobile Telecommunication Technologies Corp.
announced that it had added 135,600 paging and voice messaging units
in service in the fourth quarter, ended Dec. 31.  All told last year,
the company added 561,900 units, to break the million-units-in-service
mark.  Separately, the company named John Palmer, Mtel Chairman, as
acting CEO.  Bernard Puckett will step down to become a company
consultant.  The company expects to name a replacement for Pucket in
the near future.  (Scott Hamilton, Mtel, 601/944-3800.)

PAGING INDUSTRY BRACES FOR AUCTIONS OF 931 MHz LICENSES

     The paging industry is facing the prospect of competitive bidding
of one-way paging licenses for the first time.  Well over half of the
FCC's backlog of 8,000 931-MHz paging applications are mutually
exclusive, and those applications are likely to be awarded by
auctions, industry sources said.  
     According to Don Vasek, senior issues manager-industry affairs
for the Personal Communications Industry Association, the commission
since June 1995 has talked about adopting a rulemaking proposal to
resolve the mutually exclusive licenses.  However, we were unable to
contact FCC officials to comment on an expected release date due to
the partial government shutdown.  
     Vasek's talks with FCC officials suggest that the commission will
select major trading areas (MTAs) and basic trading areas (BTAs) as
the geographic boundaries for the licenses.  It also will choose
auctions to award them, he believes.

  ...Other Applications Also Pending 

     The FCC essentially has had an application freeze in place at 931
MHz since December 1994, Vasek said.  Part of the holdup stems from
the lack of a spectrum-sharing treaty with Mexico.  
     The commission had planned to meet with Mexican officials late
last month to decide how to share paging frequencies in border areas. 
At press time, we were unable to find out whether an agreement had
been reached.  The commission has been reluctant to grant new
applications for fear that the treaty--or lack of one--would have a
"daisy-chain" effect on existing and pending licenses, Vasek said.
     In addition, over the past six months the FCC has been developing
software and improving its data base to automate the processing of 931
MHz applications.  That software has just been completed, Vasek said. 
     According to Vasek, several dozen paging carriers, from small
local operators up to nationwide carriers, have 931 MHz applications
pending.  He said the expected rulemaking may ask the industry to
comment on whether the new regulatory framework at 931 MHz should also
be applied to 929 MHz, UHF and VHF bands.  
     Vasek said that there is "probably little chance of that
happening," however, because those frequencies have been used heavily
for "years and years and years."

'96 WILL BE A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR COMPETITIVE PROVIDERS

The new year is always a time to dream of endless possibilities,
but for competitive providers, 1996 could offer both the best
and the worst of times.

New entrants in the local exchange have an abundance of capital
available to them and will continue to forge ahead with
expansion plans.  But money must be spent wisely so that returns
on investment improve and profits grow.

Federal legislation - if it indeed passes - as well as number
portability and universal service trials, will play a key role
in hastening local competition's development.  But if a federal
law doesn't make it onto the books this year, and permanent
solutions for the technical details are not resolved, then it
could take almost two years for competition to become
widespread.

Pundits have said that if federal legislation doesn't pass this
year, it may not have another shot until 1997 or 1998 because
'96 is a politically charged presidential election year.

But as long as key congressional legislators make it known to
the industry that reform will come to the forefront again, it's
expected development of competitive markets will continue,
albeit slowly.

"As long as we have the impending threat, it will force
companies to strategize and negotiate a market position that is
good for us all," D. Craig Young, president of Brooks Fiber
Properties Inc., told Local Competition Report.

The industry is discouraged about the progress with federal
legislation.

"I'd like to say we're going to have legislation, but I don't
think so," said Heather Gold, president of the Association for
Local Telecommunications Services (ALTS).

Conferees still are trying to iron out a compromise that won't
get vetoed by the White House.

Top industry executives seem to agree on the odds of federal
legislation passing this session:  about 50-50.

It won't be the end of the world, though, if Congress fails in
its bid to reform the outdated 1934 telecom law.

"A national policy will speed things up...it would provide a
road map," Royce Holland, president and COO of MFS
Communications Co., told LCR.  "But from our standpoint, it's
not essential.  Things are happening so quickly in the states
and gaining momentum."

But without federal legislation, competitive providers will have
to continue fighting a state-by-state legislative and regulatory
battle.

States, however, will continue to advance telecom competition.
Even less progressive states, such as North Dakota and Montana,
may get caught up in the reform momentum.

States also will play a key role in developing permanent
interconnection rules and number portability, and will work to
establish a universal service funding mechanism appropriate for
competitive markets.

There are several active trials for number portability and a
permanent solution should be decided on by year's end.

"Policies may be in place [by '96], but implementation will take
until 1997," said Rick Kozak, president and COO of American
Communications Services Inc. (ACSI).

There will be a domino effect for instituting number portability
when permanent solutions exist.

"Once we get [number portability] in place in one state, the
others will fall," MFS's Holland said.

The issue needs to be forced through by regulators, Brooks'
Young, told LCR.  If not, "the local exchange companies will
keep trying to roll out number portability and pass unwarranted
costs to competitors."

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) now is exploring
number portability in a notice of proposed rulemaking, but it is
doubtful the commission will devise more than an outline for
implementation.

The FCC needs to be more proactive in the development of local
competition, industry leaders believe.

"We need a higher awareness from the FCC" in order to establish
fair interconnection rates and slow down premature lifting of
RBOC regulation, said Robert Annunziata, chairman, president and
CEO of Teleport Communications Group.

1996 and beyond will see former competitive access providers
(CAPs) continue to layer on new services and add switches to
become new and improved local exchange companies - but that may
be costly.

"It's somewhat facetious for CAPs to say they will be one-stop
shops," said ACSI's Kozak.

Kozak believes CAPs should focus on their core strengths - such
as circumventing the RBOCs networks for long-distance providers
- rather than spreading themselves thin as a local exchange
company.

"More companies die from indigestion than starvation," Kozak
said.

But other companies believe their game plan must include
switches in order to become truly competitive.

"CAPs will have to offer switched services" to gain a
competitive edge, said J. Shelby Bryan, president and CEO of
IntelCom Group Inc.

IntelCom and others plan to move into the switched mode in '96
and beyond.

"All of our switched services will not be put on by 1997," said
Brooks' Young.

It's likely today's budding local exchange companies will be
swallowed up by some of the market's big fish.

For instance, there has been speculation as to whether MCI will
buyout companies such as ACSI to help jumpstart it's local
subsidiary MCImetro with existing operations.

And MFS long has been touted as a prize to be acquired - but it
could be MFS that does the buying.

The first move in this direction already has been made by Brooks
Fiber Communications, which bought City Signal early last week.

BROOKS FIBER SHARPENS ITS TEETH WITH CITY SIGNAL ACQUISITION

Brooks Fiber Properties is starting its new year off with a bang
- with acquisitions, co-carrier agreements and hitting a
milestone in number of networks.

Local Competition Report has learned that Brooks has signed a
letter of intent to buy City Signal.

At press time, no details had been released about the price
Brooks paid for the Grand Rapids, Mich.-based competitive
provider, which operates a 25-route-mile Michigan network
extending through Grand Rapids, Holland, Zeeland and Traverse
City.

Speculation has run high through the industry about what would
become of City Signal since its parent company, US Signal, sold
its long-distance subsidiary Teledial last fall (LCR, Oct. 30,
1995).

At the time of the $115 million sale, City Signal said it was
planning to use the proceeds to fuel its expansion throughout
western Michigan and possibly beyond state borders.

The Brooks/City Signal deal is only the beginning of a trendy
shakeup in the competitive access industry, analysts believe.

"There's going to be a definite wave of consolidation," Darrell
J. Edmonds, associate managing director of Bear, Stearns & Co.,
told Local Competition Report last week.  Edmonds sees Brooks,
as well as other competitors such as MFS, swallowing up the
smaller guys in order to enter a market more quickly.

This move is definitely in line with Brooks' strategy, according
to Stuart Conrad, vice president of C.J. Lawrence/Deutsche Bank
Securities.

Brooks will continue to swallow up smaller competitive access
providers (CAPs) on their way to becoming one of the largest
providers in second- and third-tier markets.

The company has an aggressive game plan and met its goals for
1995.

Just under the wire, Brooks Fiber Properties captured the last
two cities to reach its goal of being in 20 cities by the end of
the year.  Brooks plans to invest more than $20 million to build
and operate fiber-optic networks in Stockton, Calif., and
Jackson, Miss.

And with the purchase of City Signal, Brooks brings the tally of
cities it's in up to 24 after the first week of 1996.  By the
end of this year, Brooks expects to be in more than 30 markets.

A co-carrier agreement Brooks made with Nynex last week removed
the last hurdle for providing local service in Massachusetts.
Brooks will install a switch in Springfield, Mass., and plans to
offer competitive dialtone services in the first quarter of '96.

In other acquisition moves, Brooks Fiber merged with its parent
company, Brooks Telecommunications, and the parent company's
primary operating company GLA International.  The move was
designed to bring GLA's capabilities of telecom engineering and
consulting activities to Brooks Fiber.

"Our new relationship will allow us to leverage the technical
expertise and industry experience of GLA in all areas of
telecommunications to facilitate the rapid expansion plans of
Brooks Fiber," said Jim Moffit, GLA's managing director.

The surviving company will be Brooks Fiber Properties.

TIME WARNER SEEKS PUCO AID IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH AMERITECH

Time Warner Communications sent out an SOS to the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for help in finalizing an
interconnection agreement with  local incumbent Ameritech.

But Ameritech claims that the cable company-turned-competitive
phone provider is engaging in a war of words intended to keep
the telco out of the cable business.

Time Warner had hoped to have a deal sealed by Dec. 31, 1995,
but the deadline passed without one.

With the PUCO's help, Time Warner hopes the last few economic
details can be worked out by Jan. 15.  If a deal can't be
reached, Time Warner said it will have to delay its plans to be
a competitor in the local switched service arena.

In its second required 60-day report to the commission on the
status of negotiations, Time Warner said all the technical
details of interconnection have been fleshed out in the good-
faith negotiations, but now comes the sticky part.

There are costs, for things such as interim number portability
and other items that neither company would comment on, that must
be ironed out before Time Warner can begin providing service.

The PUCO's staff most likely will sit in on final negotiations
between the competitors.  "We haven't made an offer yet," Kerry
Stroup, assistant directors of the PUCO's utility department,
told Local Competition Report at its deadline.  But he said that
doesn't mean one isn't in the making.

Time Warner could have filed a complaint with the PUCO, but has
not yet done so because it felt a compromise could be reached
with the commission's assistance.

"We didn't file a complaint because we're trying to keep this
below the level of a nuclear war," Marsha Schermer, regulatory
vice president for Time Warner's mid-West region, told LCR.

But the A-bomb may drop anyway.

Ameritech vehemently believes Time Warner is engaging in a
negative publicity campaign that will sway Columbus, Ohio, city
officials to delay or deny a cable franchise to the telco.

Time Warner's Schermer calls that "fascinating speculation."

In November, Ameritech and Time Warner apparently reached an
agreement on several key points.  But, in mid-December, Time
Warner came back with a new list of demands, according to James
C. Smith, Ameritech Ohio vice president.

These new demands are what has caused the delay, Smith told LCR.

"We didn't put on the table anything that looked new late in the
game," Schermer said.

Schermer said Ameritech has willingly negotiated the details
thus far, but believes Ameritech Information Industry Services
(AIIS) - the unit involved in negotiations - may not able to
make the final decision.

It is possible that another of Ameritech's seven business units
will have to get involved before all is said and done.

Smith noted that AIIS has been the lead negotiator for several
interconnection deals in Illinois and Michigan.  AIIS has final
authority to approve all aspects of the deal.

"It is especially ironic that Time Warner has chosen to use this
tactic when their own representatives have admitted that
Ameritech's cooperation has gone beyond what they have
experienced in other non-Ameritech states," Smith said.

Optimism remains that a deal can beworked out by Time Warner's
Jan. 15 deadline.

"If Time Warner is serious, one can be worked out," said
Ameritech's Smith.  "The question is do they want one."

Ameritech's Smith said he feels that Time Warner believes lack
of an interconnection agreement may keep the telco out of Ohio's
cable market.

Time Warner is seeking a regional agreement so it can hook up
with the incumbent local exchange company (LEC)  in the three
Ameritech states it has operations:  Ohio, Wisconsin and
Indiana.

Unfortunately for competitors in these three states, Ameritech
does not have the same willingness to interconnect as it does in
Illinois and Michigan.

In these two states, Ameritech is seeking acceptance of its
Customers First plan, which would allow the local provider into
the long-distance market.

"Does Ameritech want to be the leader  in supporting local phone
competition, like their ads say?" Schermer said.  "If it is such
a good idea [in Illinois and Michigan], why not in Ohio,
Wisconsin or Indiana?"

MFS Communications, one of the other certified competitors in
Ohio, just entered into negotiations with Ameritech Ohio.  And
though progress is being made, MFS predicts it will not have an
easy time of it.

"Ameritech has different motivation there than in Chicago," said
Dan Caruso, vice president of MFS's local services
implementation group.

MFS already has an interconnection deal with Ameritech in
Illinois and hopes it can transcend state boundaries.

"Some aspects can be regionalized, but for others it will be
necessary to treat them on a state-by-state basis," Caruso said.

IntelCom Group, which has an application pending in the state,
also said it expected to initiate interconnection talks with
Ameritech this week.

MCImetro, which has been approved by state regulators, has yet
to seek out an interconnection deal, Ameritech said.

MARYLAND PUTS PERMANENT RULES IN PLACE & RATES ARE BEST AROUND

Maryland's got a good deal on interconnection rates.

In its permanent rules regarding local competition adopted last
week, the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) has set up
interconnection rates of .5 cents a minute - lower than even
those rates of between .5 cents and .75 cents a minute set up by
trendsetting states like Illinois.

"This was a dramatic improvement over the interim rates (2.1
cents a minute)," Gary Ball, MFS Communications' director of
regulatory affairs for the Eastern Region, told Local
Competition Report.  "This sends a strong signal that the
commission is looking for companies to come in and compete."

Issues such as number portability and universal service will
have to be addressed in additional rulemakings, said Larry
Bugden, vice president of Teleport Communications Group's
Maryland network.

Development of universal service is one of Bell Atlantic's
primary concerns.

In addition to setting interconnection rates, the PSC set forth
the terms by which new local exchange companies can buy dialtone
lines from Bell Atlantic, either whole or in part.

The commission's order also ensured customers will have access
to "911" services and, thanks to an interim number portability
plan, they will be able to keep their current phone number even
if they switch providers.

Under the ruling, new competitors will be able to establish
their own local calling areas or use the same area set up by
Bell Atlantic.

FAILED COMPETITION BILLS IN ARK. AND MO., LEAD LEGISLATIVE
LOSSES

Among the unsuccessful legislative initiatives in 1995 were
legislative attempts in Arkansas and Missouri to open all local
services to competition and allow price-based alternative
regulation systems.

In both states, Southwestern Bell and GTE mounted a successful
lobbying campaign that squashed all attempts from moving
forward.  Southwestern Bell reportedly spent more than $5
million on its lobbying just in Missouri to stop the state's
local competition bill.

Other unsuccessful legislation included a Washington state bill
that would have prohibited intraLATA toll dialing parity until
1998.  Although the bill passed the legislature, Washington Gov.
Mike Lowry vetoed it as being contrary to the general pro-
competition direction of state telecom policy.

Another casualty included an Indiana bill that would have
required state certification of any provider of two-way video
services.

This seemingly-simple bill was withdrawn by sponsors in the face
of massive lobbying by cable TV interests that claimed it would
require them to obtain state territorial certificates in order
to provide interactive video services to schools or libraries,
and would give telcos a way to thwart commercial development of
interactive cable TV services until the telcos were able to
enter that market.

Nebraska was unable to pass a bill that would have given the
Public Service Commission jurisdiction over cable TV video
service quality and the power to resolve certain types of
consumer complaints involving cable TV video services.

Telephone companies, eyeing eventual entry into video services,
had pushed for the bill in hopes of consolidating handling of
video quality issues and customer video-service complaints at
the state level, rather than leaving these with scores of local
governments.

A North Dakota Senate bill to raise the maximum size for a
deregulated small telco to 50,000 lines failed to win passage,
although backers managed to push through a House bill raising
the size limit for deregulated status from 3,000 lines to 8,000
lines.

CABLE & WIRELESS ONE-STOP SHOP UP-AND-RUNNING IN NEW YORK CITY

Add Cable & Wireless Inc. (CWI) to the growing list of long-
distance providers getting their fingers in the local service
cookie jar.

But according to industry watchdogs, CWI may not be as
formidable of an opponent as the big three interexchange
carriers.

"I would be more concerned if companies said they weren't
getting into new markets," said Brian Adamik, an analyst at The
Yankee Group.  "Now we're going to see solely communications
services companies rather than local telephone and long-distance
carriers."

Although CWI is the first long-distance provider to offer resold
local service to customers in New York City, it seems that its
initial scope will be limited.

CWI will market its UniLink package of local and long-distance
service to its current business customers, which total more than
100,000 nationwide.

But the company plans an aggressive attack on the market.

CWI received authority in November to be a local exchange
provider in Connecticut and awaits word from commissioners in
California, Illinois and Texas.

"Our intent is to go national, [but] driving that is the
regulatory environment," Alan Stiffler, director of strategic
operations at CWI, told LCR last week.

CWI initially will resell local service from the networks of
incumbent LECs, competitive access providers or cable companies,
depending on what's available in various markets.

"Once we reach critical mass, we intend to be a facilities-based
provider," Stiffler said.

UniLink is up and running in New York City now after a nine-
month beta test ended last month.  The company would not say how
many customers currently use the package of services in the Big
Apple.

The long-distance giant could enter the local loop to challenge
Ameritech and GTE this year, depending on the speed with which
the PSC finishes its work on local competition rules.

RESELLERS CAN SIGN UP WITH AMERITECH MICHIGAN FEB. 1

Ameritech filed a resale and network interconnection plan in
Michigan, similar to the one it debuted in the Chicago area in
November (LCR, Nov. 13, 1995).

If approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission, the plan
will offer a host of Ameritech services and basic local exchange
components to companies licensed as local phone companies in the
state.

Enhanced features such as Caller ID, voice mail, Centrex and
ISDN also will be offered, discounted on a term and volume
basis.

Ameritech expects to have the resale options available Feb. 1.

GST Revenue Up 211% In 1995

GST Telecommunications reported revenue of $18.7 million for the
year ended Sept. 30, 1995, up from $6 million the previous year.

The Vancouver, Wash.-based telecom provider experienced a net
loss of $11.3 million (78 cents a share) for the year, up from a
loss of $3.5 million (33 cents a share) in 1994.

Losses are attributed to the significant number of sales,
marketing and management employees added to handle expansion of
networks.

NEBRASKA BEGINS HEARINGS ON IMPLEMENTING LOCAL COMPETITION

The Nebraska Public Service Commission will hold hearings
throughout the state in late January and early February to
receive testimony on opening the state to local competition.

Local exchange competition is set to begin in the state July 1,
1997. Interested providers will be able to file applications for
local authority Jan. 1, 1997.

A few of the issues to be discussed in the hearings will be
intraLATA dialing parity, number portability and the definition
of basic service.

For more information on hearing locations, dates and times,
contact the PSC at (402) 471-3101.

BELLSOUTH FIGHTS RATE CUT

BellSouth wants the South Carolina Public Service Commission
(PSC) to reconsider a recent order requiring the telco to cut
its rates by $42.2 million

In what could be the last Bell rate case decision in the state,
the commission set the company's return on equity at 12.75
percent instead of the previous 13 percent.

The PSC told BellSouth to reduce carrier access charges by $12
million, and cut rates for line hunting and PBX trunking
services by a total $15.8 million.

The order also requires BellSouth to reduce intraLATA toll rates
by $5 million, and lop $1.3 million from rates for direct
inward-dialing service.

The remaining $8 million must be applied to basic exchange
service rates, according to the rate design plan to be submitted
by the company later.

BellSouth said the ordered rate cut is more than twice as large
as is supported by the rate case evidence.  The company said
it could support a rate reduction of about $17 million.

BellSouth has proposed adoption of an indexed price cap plan as
a permanent replacement for earning-based regulation in South
Carolina.  A decision on that plan is expected soon.

U S WEST PROPOSES RATE REBALANCING

U S West has asked the Arizona Corporation Commission to approve
a revenue-neutral rate rebalancing plan that would shift about
$20 million in revenue away from intraLATA toll and onto local
exchange service.

The company estimated the change would increase local service
rates by an average of $1 a month.  U S West said it needs to
rebalance rates to cost in order to meet the expanded toll
competition expected this year following the April 1 date to
begin implementation of intraLATA toll dialing parity in
Arizona.

RHCs PLAN 1990 GRASSROOTS EFFORT TO RELAX MFJ RULES

     The 7 regional holding companies (RHCs) are preparing
expensive lobbying campaigns for this spring to urge local
telephone users to contact their Washington representatives and
demand legislation that will relax the hold U.S. District Judge
Harold Greene has over the modified final judgment (MFJ).
     The RHCs, however, are opposed by powerful informational
services and consumer lobbies that for years have been telling
the American public that if the restrictions are relaxed, the
RHCs may increase rates for voice services to subsidize the new
services.
     This year's campaign will claim through published articles,
mailings and print advertisements that 80% of the American public
supports the holding companies and wants the sophisticated
informational services the local Bell operating companies (BOCs)
want to provide, but--because of the restrictions--legally
cannot.
     The RHCs know that they must excite the American public into
action so Congress will be compelled to address what amounts to
the formation of a national telecommunications policy, THE LONG-
DISTANCE LETTER has been told.  If the issue is swept under a rug
once again, America's role as a telecommunications leader in the
global market may be threatened.
     Legislation that will revise Greene's oversight of the MFJ
is among high-priority items on the House telecommunications
subcommittee list, we are told, and will be pushed early in the
legislative session by subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey (D-
Mass.)
      Greene's restrictions to keep the holding companies out of
the manufacturing, long-distance and informational services
businesses have kept half of the nation's telecommunications
industry idle, the RHCs complain and may reduce America's future
in the telecommunications explosion to that of a buyer of
foreign-made goods and services.

Again, RHCs Say That the Situation Has Changed in Last 6 Years

     Conditions that existed 6 years ago when divestiture was
ordered have been outdistanced by changing world conditions, the
RHCs claim.  Located and oriented to regional markets, the
companies claim they do not have the capability any longer of
developing the monopoly that was foreseen in Greene's ruling.
     The RHCs also say that America already has fallen behind
other countries where such services as electronic mail delivery,
data inquiry, shopping, banking, hotel reservations, cable
television and others are being provided by telephone companies.
     France's Minitel has offered videotex and electronic
services since the mid-1980s, building a customer base of 5
million by providing free terminals.  Today the government-
subsidized company adds 10,000 customers per month and no longer
provides free terminals.
     Minitel's customers can use their videotex terminals to make
airplane reservations, trade in stock, buy from a catalog or find
out about weather conditions,employment opportunities, local road
conditions, and telephone and address listings from a database
inquiry service that accounts for 20% of the system's traffic.
     According to a study commissioned by the RHCs late last
year, 3 out of 4 Americans believe that "it is absolutely
critical" that this country provide services offered by other
countries.  Four out of every 5 people in the survey said they
would use a telephone computer to make appointments, review
supermarket "specials," communicate with government or school
officials or scan community "bulletin boards" if those services
were available on their telephone lines.

Public Pretty Much in the Dark About Strictures, Study Finds

      Amazingly, according to Dr. Harold E. Quinley, a senior
vice president for Yankelovick, Clancy and Shulman, the Westport,
Conn., research firm that conducted the survey for the RHCs, of
the 17,000 who participated in the survey, few knew that local
telephone companies could not provide the services described in
the survey, and most were surprised to learn that the reason the
services were unavailable was because of restrictions by the
federal government!
     "We are sure that the people we talked to did not know
(about the restrictions),"  Quinley told us.  He said surveyors
provided partial explanations of the restrictions to each person
taking part in the survey.  Some RHC lobbyists reported "victory"
in the last Congress with 2 anti-divestiture bills--one in the
House and one in the Senate--and see an early introduction of
revised bills this session.  However, even though members
described last session's bills as "highly charged" with "strong
interest on all sides,"  the bills did not get out of committees
because members were not compelled by their constituents to take
action, observers said.
     One House member, sympathetic to the RHCs' cause, said last
year that divestiture was "very esoteric" and not a subject that
was often discussed "at the dinner tables of middle America."
But the telephone companies hope that much will be changed this
session, said Sam Simon, a Washington-based telecommunications
consultant who heads Issue Dynamics Inc.  He said RHC lobbyists
"are already jockeying" to be in position when divestiture
legislation is revived.
     Simon said the holding companies--whose revenues were cut
when they were severed by the court from the parent company 6
years ago--"crucially" need the added incomes the restricted
services would provide.  But, Simon said, they may be content to
accept compromise legislation from Congress if a Court of Appeals
decision expected in the spring alters rulings Greene made
recently to uphold the 1984 restrictions.  "If for instance, the
court lifts restrictions against information services, the BOCs
might be satisfied with legislation that retains the other
restrictions," Simon said.
     But other observers aren't so sure. Catherine Sloan, who
monitors legislation for the Competitive Telecommunications
Association (CompTel), told us the RHCs would not likely be
satisfied with a compromise.  "They need the long-distance
service to provide the information services, and they need the
ability to research, develop and manufacture new technology to
support all their services," she said.

Legislation Could Result in New National Policy

     Mike Brand, a spokesman in Chicago for American Information
Technologies Corp. (Ameritech), one of the 7 RHCs, told us the
RHCs were "set up" to push for legislation that will eventually
result in a new national telecommunications policy.  He said the
holding companies rely on "substantial contacts" with Washington
legislators and "grassroots" campaigns in congressional districts
that urge telephone users to tell their Washington
representatives that they do not favor the restrictions.
     In past years, Ameritech has stuffed dividend envelopes with
bulletins urging its shareholders to write their congressmen
about the divestiture restrictions, involved educational and
public-policy organizations that rely on Ameritech research
grants and received unexpected help from well-known radio
commentator Paul Harvey, for its cause.
      Harvey, whose daily broadcasts reach a vast national
audience, told listeners "the Congress must be made to realize
that information is the lifeblood of contemporary commerce and
industry."  He said,  "The Baby Bells, although orphaned by Ma
Bell, have picked themselves up, dusted themselves off and
continue to serve the public and to profit and prosper."
      Brand said the endorsement--while appreciated--"was
completely Harvey's own doing" and that his dinner appearance
before Ameritech managers 6 days before the broadcast, for which
he received his normal $30,000 fee, did not influence the content
of Harvey's radio broadcast.

Lobbyists Should Seize on Association Opinions

     Simon, who presents seminars to Congress about issues facing
the telecommunications industry in behalf of Bell clients, said
the RHCs must gain support from national consumer organizations
such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) if
they are going to gain favorable legislation.
     But the AARP does not make up its official mind until later
this month, when the membership will be polled on the
telecommunications issue, said AARP senior policy analyst Larry
Fenster.  AARP--whose members are retired and live on fixed
incomes--is one of Washington's strongest consumer lobbies.  It
planned to reveal a "new in-depth telecommunications study on the
expanding information services and their impact on consumers and
policy choices at a press conference [Jan. 11].
     The Consumer Federation of America, which joined AARP in
that press conference, has been on record to oppose the relaxing
of restrictions, stating that the new services will mean higher
costs for basic voice services and the possibility of another
monopoly.
     But the major opposition comes from the American Newspaper
Publishers Association (ANPA), whose members have feared
competition from electronic classified and directory inquiry
services from phone companies for more than a decade.
     Not only have ANPA members appeared before Congress'
committees to speak against loosening the restrictions, but
editorials in members' newspapers consistently remind readers
(and members of Congress) that relaxing the restrictions might
well mean a move toward government control of the information-
generating process and a violation of the First Amendment.
     While the players align themselves for the legislative
kickoff, a smaller game--played at the U.S. Court of Appeals
where the RHCs are seeking legal relief from Greene's
restrictions--has produced strange teammates.
     The Justice Department--the same federal agency that carried
the burden of the government's year-long trial that shattered
AT&T's 100-year monopoly in 1983 and created the restrictions--
filed briefs recently stating the time may be ripe to relax those
restrictions.

In the End, MFJ Impacts Nation's Bottom Line, Justice Says

      Justice said in the brief that continuing Greene's
restrictions could be harmful to the telecommunications industry
that, Justice said, "measures in the billions dollars."  Justice
said that continuing the restrictions concerns the well-being of
the "country's entire national welfare and security."
     The brief justifies relaxing the restrictions because of
technological advances, developing global markets and the
corporate health of competitors that precludes one firm attaining
a monopoly position.
     Although not the major concern, the Justice Department cites
the administrative "burden" caused by more than 200 waivers the
RHCs have filed since 1984, creating heavy workloads for both the
Justice Department and the court system.
     Before the Court of Appeals can make a decision, 3 judges
must review thousands of pages of testimony and examine hundreds
of exhibits submitted during the lengthy court process.
Testimony taken in the 1987 triennial review alone--which is the
subject of the appeal--has created a document containing more
than 6,000 pages.
     Early last fall, hundreds of typewritten pages written by
dozens of attorneys representing many of the 80 different parties
interested in the appeal--along with exhibits--were submitted to
the court simply to request that each side present 2 hours of
oral argument to the court.  Those briefs took several months to
file and filled several folders in the clerk's office.  But those
arguments--granted after the court presumably reviewed the briefs
and examined the exhibits--were heard Dec. 6.
      They lasted exactly 4 hours.
     (Editor's note: The preceding article is second in a planned
series docu-menting proposed changes in the modified final
judgment and how such changes will impact the long-distance
industry.)

CONGRESS, BUREAUCRACY HAVE HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE WITH NEW PHONE
SYSTEMS

     While Congress and its bureaucracy may be wrangling over
national telecommunications policies later this year (see
preceding story), it is hoped that Hill and agency staffers will
be making clearer and more efficient long-distance and local
calls thanks to multi-billion-dollar technology now being
installed in Washington and 1,200 other government locales.
     When the final cutover from the old FTS long-distance system
is completed in May, nearly 1 million federal employees will be
using up-to-date fiber optics and the new FTS 2000 system.
     Two of the major suppliers, AT&T and US Sprint, were awarded
the 10-year contract by the General Services Administration (GSA)
in mid-1989 over the protest of MCI, a late-bidder that claimed
AT&T's prices did not reflect true costs.  MCI subsequently
threatened legal action.
      AT&T was given 60% of the contract and US Sprint the
remaining 40%.  Both vendors will have an opportunity to re-bid
the contract in its fourth and seventh year.
     The contract was awarded to supply basic voice service to
the agencies but allows the vendors to offer added voice services
(such as 800), video switched data services and digital
integrated services as needed that potentially raise the
contract's value to $25 BILLION over the 10-year life of the
contract, making it the largest federal civilian contract ever
awarded!
     Not only is the government's long-distance service being
improved, but 34 U.S. agencies and 130,000 federal employees
scattered throughout the Washington area have new desktop
telephones, switchboards, wiring and switches as a result of a
$282 million contract awarded last January to the Washington,
D.C.-based C&P Telephone Co.
     The goal of that new system--known as Washington Interagency
Telecommunications Service (WITS)--is to update government
offices with advanced technology and services available to the
private sector and the military. Complete installation will take
3 years.

Watchdog Agencies Keep Eye on Costs of New Systems

     While still in the hands of technicians and installers, the
systems nevertheless have the attention of the GAO [Congress'
investigative arm] that is overseeing the work to see that it is
done on time and according to the specifications of the contract,
and a Senate investigating committee that is concerned that the
contract's huge dollar value could generate waste and possible
irregularities.
     Ron Famous, a GAO evaluator, assures us that the first four
FTS switchovers--which started in October--have been on schedule
and on-site work problems, minimal, so far.  GAO also regularly
observes work progress being made by AT&T and US Sprint
technicians who--possibly for the first time--work side by side,
bringing the agencies on line.
     Jack Brock, a GAO spokesman, said a comprehensive breakdown
of the complicated FTS 2000 contract is being prepared for
members of Congress "so they will have an understanding of what
they bought."
     Investigators from Sen. John Glenn's (D-Ohio) Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee also are observing FTS' progress,
mostly  because of a 1988 investigation the committee conducted
that resulted in the resignation of a GSA executive who admitted
to contract irregularities with bidders for FTS service
contracts.

Investigation Tightened Contract Procedures

     That investigation--involving AT&T and BellSouth, both of
which were bidders on a dozen federal service contracts worth
about $55 million--tightened contract award procedures used by
GSA in awarding the new FTS and WITS contracts, THE LONG-DISTANCE
LETTER was told.
     Sureshar Lal Soni, the $60,000-a-year GSA executive,
allegedly "slipped" confidential AT&T bid information to
competitor BellSouth, where his daughter was employed while
contracts were being bid.  Soni later pled guilty to criminal
charges of accepting $400 in meals from BellSouth while BellSouth
and AT&T competed for contracts to service electronic tandem
network switches on the FTS system.
     Soni, who faced up to a year in prison and fines up to
$100,000, was fined $2,000 and placed on one year's probation
last April by a federal magistrate. Under terms of his plea
agreement, Soni resigned as director of GSA's Office of Network
Services, where he supervised the review of technical and cost
evaluations submitted by vendors seeking FTS contracts and is now
believed to be working for a private telecommunications company.
     Michael Corrigan, an investigator for the Governmental
Affairs Committee, said the committee's investigation turned up a
number of problems associated with telephone service contracts
and changes have been made in the agency's telephone contracting
procedures.
     He said that, so far, nothing appears irregular about the
new contracts, but the committee plans periodic reviews of the
projects.  "There's just too much money involved not to,"
Corrigan told us.

NATIONAL AUDIENCE FOR 900 SERVICE DOESN'T MATERIALIZE DURING
DECEMBER

     900's debut as a prime-time television attraction (TLDL,
November 1989, pp. 1-4) was less than successful last month with
only 21,000 viewers--out of an expected 175,000--paying $2 on
their telephone bill to participate in a national volunteer
recruiting drive backed by the White House, THE LONG-DISTANCE
LETTER has learned.
     Participants in the mid-December test that exposed 900
numbers to 290 million primetime viewers of 6 of America's most
popular television shows are meeting in California Jan. 20 to
determine--among other things--if the 900 telephone number is a
viable national marketing tool.
     The 900 numbers were flashed on the screen near the
conclusion of such popular programs as "Cheers," "Designing
Women" and "The Cosby Show," urging viewers to dial the number
and obtain the list.  The project's organizers criticized the
networks for not giving the number more exposure and not
providing storylines that gave the messages more impact.
     But while far short of the expected response, Jerry Michaud,
executive director for Prime Time to End Hunger, the project's
sponsor, said the project lost no money because the $2 telephone
charge covered by the caller's long-distance bill.  He said the
printing order was reduced when it became apparent to sponsors
that the response would not be high, we were told.
     Michaud said the project will be thoroughly critiqued at the
January meeting.  He expected network and telephone company
executives to attend.
     While the primary purpose was to determine if television
networks were effective ways to recruit volunteers, Michaud said
a "secondary" consideration was the effectiveness of the 900
number as a response media.

Long-Distance Carriers Disappointed in Response

     Long-distance carriers--including the Big 3 and Telesphere
Network Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill.--who participated, viewed the
project as a field test for a national 900 services and a way to
elevate the often-maligned 900 service to respectibility.
     "I think the telephone companies were disappointed that we
didn't have millions and millions of responses," said Glenn
Lebowitz, president of Optima Direct, a Washington-based
technical consulting firm that designed the 900 "hunger" network.
     Lebowitz, who said the network's technology lived up to
expectations, criticized the television networks for not exposing
the 900 number longer than 15 seconds and giving the message
"more impact" with viewers.  "I don't think 15 seconds gives
people enough time to absorb a telephone number," Lebowitiz said.
     Spokesmen for the long-distance suppliers had no comments
prepared about the project when they were queried just before
presstime.

NEW COMPANIES FIND INFO PHONES NOT MONEY MAKERS

     Neil Sleevi of Weston, Mo., and J. Russell Leatherman of Los
Angeles share something in common--they want to give telephone
calls away.  But the 2 entrepreneurs are in the embryonic stages
of developing telephone information services, and their give-away
schemes have--so far--been less than profitable.
     Sleevi told us he has not made "a single nickel" with Phone
Spots Inc., a plan he has to provide free, one-minute long-
distance or 3-minute local telephone calls to patrons at
airports, hotels or bus terminals.
     Leatherman and his partners have lost almost $1 million in
PromoFone Inc., a service for Los Angeles moviegoers seeking
accurate movie listings and starting times.  A New York City
PromoFone service also is available.
     Sleevi's free airport telephone call and Leatherman's movie
service also are similar in that they offer paid advertising
messages--pitched quickly and professionally between rings and
lasting less than 4 seconds--to pay the phone bills that make the
free call possible.
     Sleevi said in an interview with The LONG-DISTANCE LETTER
that he hopes to sell advertising on Phone Spots to businesses
located within a few feet of his free-call phone booth--an
airport florist, a newsstand or restaurant, for instance.

Pay Phones Being Offered as Marketing Ploy

     But Sleevi also is thinking big.  He is trying to interest
one of the country's Big 3 long-distance carriers to place a
Phone Spot payphone in an airport and offer free one-minute calls
home to patrons so they can assure families of a safe arrival or
deliver a similar message.
     Between rings and while the caller awaits his connection, a
message would remind the patron that the sponsor's long-distance
service is available for longer calls at other airport locations.
     Sleevi, who is discussing an airport market test this summer
with the phone giants, said surveys show 9 out of 10 people will
take advantage of a free telephone.  He said the advertising
message "in no way" delays the call and does not interrupt
conversation.
     Leatherman--a former rock musician--seeks rock stations or
show-business publications to welcome PromoFone users to his
movie service.  The short advertising message makes what
Leatherman calls "a needed public service" (movie information)
available to vast amounts of people.  So far, however, it only
pays the phone bills and some of the overhead.
     Leatherman said in an interview that for his service to be
profitable, it must attract "millions" of users.  He uses
billboards, small local circulation newspapers and television to
get PromoFone's telephone number (777-FILM) known, but was
dependent on the Los Angeles Times for its massive circulation.
He said he was caught off guard when the Times declared PromoFone
a "competitor" and refused his advertising.

GTE AHEAD OF THE GAME IN GETTING PHONE SERVICE ON BOARD FOR BOWL

     The upcoming NFL Super Bowl--scheduled for Sunday, Jan. 28
in New Orleans--is labeled a sporting event, but to GTE
technicians who have been wiring the mammoth Superdome for Super
Bowl XXIV since Jan. 4, it is a major telecommunications event.
     For the sixth consecutive year, GTE is providing all the
telecommunications service to the entire "Super Bowl community"
of participating teams, league personnel, the media, corporate
sponsors and fans.  A giant communications net that will cover 8
different official NFL locations in and near the stadium that
will be connected by 275 private telephone lines will also
include 6 consoles, 24 cellular telephones and a high-speed data
link to the NFL's New York headquarters.
     GTE also will provide telecommunications services to the
participating AFC and NFC team, 100 lines for the major
television and radio networks, approximately 430 telephone lines
for domestic reporters and another 30 lines for the foreign press
covering the game.
     Glen Miller, GTE Telecom's director of East Coast
operations, said planning for telecommunications services in the
giant Superdome began 15 months ago.  Preliminary budget work,
site surveys, ordering of dial-tone services, the hiring and
selecting of contract personnel, the setting up of offices,
transportation and hotel accommodations will be done long before
crews arrive on the game site.
     Last October, when the 1989 NFL season was in its infancy,
GTE had opened a 800 line that began taking service orders from
television and print reporters who plan to cover the upcoming
championship.  Miller said orders ranged from a simple private
telephone line to the complex, multiple-location telephone line
that includes multi-button sets and other special services.

Technicians on the Job a Month Early

     When technicians arrived in New Orleans Jan. 4, their first
duties were to test all the wiring, cables, telephone connectors,
common control equipment and other miscellaneous equipment in the
stadium.  Another function scheduled to be performed before
gametime is the training of on-site workers, management people
and others.  Miller said that while many GTE technicians have
worked the Super Bowl and other special events, their
responsibilities change each year or technology has changed to
require constant retraining and updating.
     GTE's Special Events Division provided telecommunications
services to such events as the 1988 Republican and Democratic
national conventions for the major networks, the Miss America
Beauty pageant, remote broadcasts for the "Today" show and
numerous sporting events.  The NFL's management service contract
with GTE is in effect through the 1993 Super Bowl.

NTIA INQUIRY SEEKS DATA FOR MAJOR TELECOM LEGISLATION

     What could turn out to be the nation's first total
telecommunications policy may be written from comments now being
sought by the Department of Commerce's National Telecommu-
nications and Information Adminsitration (NTIA); NTIA is the
principal telecommunications policy advisor to President Bush.
     NTIA published and released a 99-page notice of inquiry
(NOI) Jan. 9 in the Federal Register seeking comments from
industry sources and other parties on subjects ranging from rural
telephones to global competition.  Comments must be filed by
March 19; reply comments are due April 23.
     Janice Obuchowski, assistant secretary for the Commerce
Department and head of NTIA, said recommendations will be drafted
for Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher's approval and then
forwarded to the White House for consideration as the nation's
first total telecommunications policy.
     According to Obuchowski, NTIA's inquiry will:
      Examine the nation's telecommunications infrastructure;
      Consider the technological and market trends that determine
the industry's growth in this country and elsewhere;
      Evaluate ways in which telecommunications affects
international competition; and
      Assess government's role in promoting the development of a
telecommunications infrastructure.
     Industry observers are saying that telecommunications is as
important to the nation's production as transportation once was.
NTIA's study will determine the importance of telecommunicationas
to the country's economy and social welfare, Obuchowski said.
     Besides examining the importance of telecommunications as a
factor of production in the national economy, the inquiry raises
for discussion the links between telecommunications and economic
development in local, urban and rural areas.  It also will
examine the industry's role in such services as education, health
care and public safety.  The inquiry also seeks comment on
regulatory changes that might encourage improvements in the
industry, including modifications to the rate-of-return
regulation, depreciation practices, the AT&T consent decree,
cable TV/telephone company cross-ownership restrictions and open
network architecture.
     Further, the inquiry asks advice on ways of encouraging
competition to the local exchange companies while maintaining
current price levels for residential

THE CHANGING WORLD OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS

by William G. McGowan, chairman and CEO, MCI Communications Corp.
     Whether you want to talk about geo-political developments,
the economy, technology, science, social attitudes, business
management, careers, the arts or education--everything important
these days seems to be in a perpetual state of never-ending flux.
There can be little doubt that the times we inhabit are, indeed,
changing...and changing at breakneck speed.
     I would suggest to you that the communications technologies
we take for granted--radio, television, telephones, fax machines,
everything--really are revolutionary in nature.  They force
change in business and politics and throughout society.
     The old adage, "The more things change the more they stay
the same," just isn't true any more--if it ever was.  Nowadays,
it seems, the more things change, the more things change.
     Technology propels change.  And the world's ability to
innovate technologically is at an all-time high.  It's been
estimated, for instance, that 85% of all the scientists who ever
lived in human history are alive today.  Significantly,
imagination and technology have changed the way business views
the world.  What we're seeing today is a powerful trend toward
globalization of business and the erosion of geography, time
zones and national boundaries as stumbling blocks to economic
activity.
     Whether we like it or not, the future IS global.  Nothing
attests to this more than EC '92.  As you all know, this drive
toward a single market of 325 million people and a grossnational
product (GNP) of $4.5 trillion--about the same as the United
States--will "harmonize" major sectors of the European economy.
     The telecommunications sector in the EC is expected to more
than double in size over the next 10 years, growing from 3-7% of
the gross domestic product (GDP) among the 12 EC countries.  The
EC plan calls for public voice service and control of the
telecommunications infrastructure to remain in the hands of the
national monopolies, while value-added services are supposed to
be totally deregulated.

Admit It--There are no Domestic Markets Anymore

     One aspect of globalization that all businesses--especially,
I think, American businesses--need to learn very quickly is that
there are no entirely domestic markets anymore--anywhere.  For
any business that means, in effect, that you can run, but you
can't hide, from foreign competitors.
     Since I'm in the business, I'm proud to point out that
telecommunications service.
     Obuchowski said America does not have a "coherent"  national
telecommunications policy "because of the court situation," a
reference to U.S. District Judge Harold Greene's oversight of the
MFJ restrictions.
     Original comments and 7 copies should be sent to: Office of
Policy Analysis and Development, NTIA, U.S. Department of
Commerce, 14th St. and Constitution Ave., NW, Rm. 4725,
Washington, DC 20230. For further information, contact Alfred Lee
or Timothy Sloan, NTIA Office of Policy Analysis and Development,
202/377-1880.
     The notice of inquiry was announced at a press conference
Jan. 9. as a global economic force truly has come of age.
Foreign investments, international banking, cross-border mergers
and acquisitions--all have become commonplace and increasingly
vital elements of the global economy.  And telecommunications
provides the electronic infrastructure that allows it all to
happen.
     Economists recognize telecommunications as a strategic
industry because it meets the 3 basic criteria required to be so
designated.  First, a strategic industry must be important to a
country's national security.  Telecommunications clearly is.
Second, it must be R&D intensive.  Again, telecommunications
clearly is that.  And third, a strategic industry must have--I
love this phrase--positive externalities, meaning that a
strategic industry must produce spill-over economic benefits to
other industries.  It's clear that other industries derive
enormous benefits by using telecommunications.
     I believe the biggest future advantages of information
technology will come in the form of organizational health--
increased productivity, better decisionmaking, improved operating
efficiencies, enhanced responsiveness and reduced bureaucracy.
To compete against global competitors, companies everywhere need
to organize leaner, decide quicker, produce smarter and market
better.
     Recent events in China, in the Soviet Union, in Hungary, in
Czechoslovakia and, most dramatically perhaps, in Berlin, should
be seen as part of the political "whiplash" that occurs when
information is distributed widely and without official
censorship.

Today's Telecommunications Precludes the Rise of a New Stalin

     Glasnost may be a Russian word, but it is fundamentally a
concept born of the Information Age.  During his recent visit to
the United States, Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa admitted
as much.  He was asked how all of these reforms in Eastern Europe
came about.
     His reply was insightful.  He said, "That's a result of
civilization--of computers and satellite TV and other innovations
which present alternative solutions...Is it possible for a new
Stalin to appear today who could murder people?  It's
impossible."
     Information technologies are inherently democratic.  They
force decentralization and individualism.  They are designed for
expansion, for interconnection, for networking.  They have no
respect for barriers and roadblocks.
     Nothing as flimsy and porous as a concrete wall stands a
chance against information traveling at the speed of light across
a multitude of media--from radio and television to the
increasingly ubiquitous fax machine.
     Information technologies help people to absorb and put to
effective use vast amounts of information that would otherwise be
wasted.  Because of that, I couldn't think of a more interesting
time to be alive, or a more exciting industry to be a part of.

THE LONG-DISTANCE LETTER via NewsNet
January, 1990

TELECOM*USA, ALC SIGN LETTER OF INTENT TO MERGE OPERATIONS

     Telecom*USA Inc. and ALC Communications Corp, the fourth and
the seventh largest long-distance interexchange carriers
respectively, have signed a letter of intent to merge in April,
according to announcements made simultaneously this week by both
companies.  Telecom*USA, based in Atlanta, Ga., and ALC in
Birmingham, Mich., will merge into an unnamed subsidiary of
Telecom*USA, the announcements stated.
     Under terms of the letter, all outstanding capital stock of
ALC would be converted into units of Telecom*USA common stock and
cash.  Holders of ALC common stock and series B and C preferred
stock would receive units valued at $3 for each share.  Holders
of ALC series A preferred stock would receive units valued at $20
per share plus accrued unpaid dividends.
     O. Gene Gabbard, chairman and CEO of Telecom*USA, and John
Zrno, president and CEO for ALC, both expressed optimism about
the merger although Gabbard said he expected the move may have
"some dilutive effect" on Telecom*USA earnings this year.
     "However, we believe that the combination of Telecom*USA and
ALC will enhance our position in a rapidly-growing industry and
provide significant opportunities for network and cost
efficiencies," he said.  "Over the longer term, we expect these
efficiencies to add to earnings and create additional value for
shareholers, as has been the case with past mergers and
acquisitions."
     Zrno said that ALC's "strong presence" in the northeast and
upper midwest "complements Telecom*USA's existing strengths in
the southeast and midwest.
     "Through this combination, we anticipate offering a wide
range of Telecom*USA enhanced products and services to our
customers," he said.
     The proposed merger gives Telecom*USA access to ALC's 900
service, where it has staked a strong market.  Telecom*USA
already markets 700 and 800 services, a spokesman said.

Deal Contingent Upon Amending Previous Agreement

     The merger is contingent upon execution of a definite
agreement, and regulatory and shareholder approvals.  In
addition, the merger requires amending an existing 10-year
telecommunications agreement between ALC and Communications
Transmission Inc. (CTI), of Austin, Texas, which controls 55% of
ALC.  The amendment would permit the purchase of additional
transmission capacity from CTI at a fixed price in exchange for a
payment to CTI of $8.5 million.
     The proposed merger will bring 400,000 new subscribers to
Telecom*USA, more than doubling its subscriber base.  Spokesmen
would not confirm some trade press reports that claimed
Telecom*USA is expected to dissolve ALC and drop the name of its
long-distance company, Allnet, following the merger.

The United States remains deeply concerned about the
ongoing violence and killing in Burundi. Too many
people have lost their lives because extremist forces
have chosen to settle their differences through
violence rather than dialogue.

We continue to call on all Burundians to reject
extremism and to resolve their differences through
peaceful means. A constructive dialogue involving all
key political leaders is necessary to begin the
process of ending the violence in Burundi and
fostering national reconciliation.

The United States is watching events in Burundi
closely and will continue to work with the
international community to defuse tensions in Burundi
and prevent further violence. As we approach the new
year, the United States calls on the people of
Burundi to renounce violence and demand peace from
all parties.

The President is disappointed that the Congress has
chosen to override the veto of H.R. 1058, the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As he said
in his veto message, he supports the goals of
securities litigation reform and believes that there
should be an end to frivolous lawsuits, but is
concerned about how this legislation might affect
small investors with legitimate complaints. The
President hopes that the unintended consequences of
the legislation do not materialize, but if they do,
he will work for administrative and/or legislative
rememdies to protect small investors.

Middle District of North Carolina. Before assuming
his present position, Beaty spent thirteen years as a
judge on the North Carolina Superior Court. Prior to

Winston-Salem where he maintained a general civil and
criminal litigation practice. 

Beaty has remained active in community service
throughout his legal career. Over the years he has

Court. He held both positions until his appointment
to the bankruptcy court in 1992. 

During his tenure as Clerk of the Court, Leonard was
a nationally recognized expert on issues involving
judicial administration, and he has written and
lectured widely on the subject. In addition, Leonard
has served as an adjunct professor of law at North

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office of the Press Secretary --
Remarks by the President at Congressional Meeting

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President at
Congressional Meeting
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295 12:52 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: I hope -- as you see, we're running a
little behind today, so I hope you'll forgive us if
we don't do a lot of questions; we have a lot of work
to do. But let me just say from my point of view, I
am pleased that our representatives met yesterday.
They did make some progress. Obviously, a lot of the
biggest issues remain. But the process seems to be
working and I'm encouraged, and I want to continue to
do it until we reach agreement on a balanced budget.
That's what I think clearly we all want. 

I would say here that two days before Christmas I
hope some way can be found to get the check for the
three and a half million veterans and the aid to the
8 million children who need it just to exist. And
there are almost half a million federal workers who
have been working who won't get their paychecks today
that they would otherwise get. So I think those
problems need to be addressed. 

But on the other issue, I at least believe that we
made some good progress yesterday and I'm looking
forward to the report today and continuing this
process until we succeed, until we get this job done.
 
Q Can we ask the leaders, Mr. President, if they will
get the checks out and --
 
Q Do you think the Congress should go home when
millions are denied subsistence checks over
Christmas?
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, let me just say, if I could
for a second, Mr. President, I think both the House
and Senate hope to get those bills down here today so
that the -- the AFTC and the -- as the President
mentioned the other day on television.
 
Q What are the chances of reopening the government,
Mr. Speaker?
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: I think we're going to talk about
that now.
 
Q Mr. Speaker, do you feel like a dog being wagged by
its tail? (Laughter.)
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: It's amazing you guys get paid for
some of these questions, on the eve of Christmas.
Merry Christmas. 

Q No, it's not my expression, it's the President's
analysis.
 
THE PRESIDENT: I never called the Speaker a dog.
(Laughter.)
 
Q No, I know you didn't.
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: And I'm deeply grateful.
(Laughter.) 

Q Mr. President, do you think you can get a framework
of a deal by Christmas?
 
THE PRESIDENT: I'm prepared to -- let me just say,
I'm prepared to just keep working. I think all of us
want to have Christmas with our families, but beyond
that, I'm prepared to keep working, and I'm going to
do everything I can to succeed, and that's what we're
going to talk about.
 
Q Mr. Speaker --
 
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. We really need to go to
work.
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

Remarks by the President in photo opportunity with

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President in
photo opportunity with congressional leaders
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295 9:50 A.M. EST

Q Mr. President, are you close to a deal today? 

THE PRESIDENT: Let me tell you where we are today. We
had a very long discussion yesterday. We discussed
almost all the issues where we had differences on our
plans financially, in terms of the dollars. And this
morning we're going to have an extensive discussion
of the Medicare policy. And then we're going to give
our staffs some instruction. We're going to meet
again on Tuesday and we're going to do our best to
work through this and come to an accord. 
 
My New Year's wish is that we'll get this balanced
budget plan and we'll do it in a way that protects
the things that we care about -- the Medicare, the
Medicaid, the education and environment, the other
issues, and we've been working at it. I've been very
well pleased and I think we've been somewhat
successful because we haven't said very much about
it. We've just got to keep working until we reach an
accord.
 
Q Mr. President, will you touch on -- negotiations -- 

Q Will you leave town today without reopening the
government, of the three --
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: I'm sure we'll be talking about
that, that's one of the things we want to get done
and get agreed to. So we're trying to work out how to
get the federal employees back to work -- we'd also
like to get them paid, I think that's an integral
part of getting them back to work. But as the
President said, I think, frankly, most of our success
so far has been that we've been in this room talking
with each other and not getting involved in
negotiating in public, and I think we've made a lot
of progress. 

Q To follow on that, sir, is it healthy to have the
House speakers talking on CNN yesterday on the --
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: Oh, that is nonsense. I told the
President on Friday that I was so favorable about him
in answering their big question on Evans & Novak that
I thought he'd want to see it. The fact is we're
working very well together. I was asked a question
about the campaign next year, and I suspect if you
ask Mr. Gephardt or Vice President Gore about how
they'll campaign next year, they'll give you similar
answers. We're negotiating very well from a
government standpoint in here and I think we have a
lot to be proud of. Our New Year's wish ought to be
that we get this done and give the American people a
balanced budget and the government paid for and back
to work.
 
SENATOR DOLE: The Senate is going to meet at noon,
we'll try to pass something to help the federal
employees. 

Q Are you closer?
 
SENATOR DOLE: Oh, we're about six feet apart.
(Laughter.)
 
SENATOR DASCHLE: We'll be a lot closer in a couple of
hours. (Laughter.)
 
THE PRESIDENT: We're working at it steady. Happy New
Year everybody.
 
THE PRESS: Happy New Year.

upon arrival -- The Pentagon

RDATE:221295 9:25 A.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. 
 
Q Mr. President, do you hope to go to Bosnia in the
next month or so?
 
THE PRESIDENT: I want to go when the Secretary of
Defense and General Shalikashvili tell me it's an
appropriate thing to do. I don't want to interrupt
the deployment in any way. You know, we've had a few
weather delays, but I'm here to get a briefing on the
deployment and what's going on and how we're doing.
I've got a few questions I want to ask. If it were
solely up to me, I would go tomorrow -- literally
tomorrow. But I think it's very important that I not
do anything which interrupts the deployment. I can go
as soon as it's consistent with the military mission,
and I will do that. 
 
Q What have you heard so far, even before this
briefing, on how the operation is going in Bosnia? 
 
THE PRESIDENT: I think our people are doing a very
good job. I think the others in IFOR are doing a good
job, and I think the people there, so far, are
receiving them well. But I've got some specific
questions, and that's why I want this briefing.
 
Q Do you think Senator Dole should go if you can't
go?
 
THE PRESIDENT: I think that all of us should consult
with the military leaders and do what is consistent
with the interest of our troops and the mission. 
 
Q That means no?
 
Q Mr. President, do you worry about casualties? 

THE PRESIDENT: Every day I worry about that, but I
think they're doing a very good job. They're showing
their training and their discipline and the integrity
of the plan in the way that they are working to
minimize casualties and maximize the effectiveness of
the mission.
 
Q Do you think the American people understand that,
understand the risks that are involved?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Interview of the President
by armed forces radio
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

THE PRESIDENT: First let me say that I have just come
from a briefing here at the Pentagon with our senior
military officials who are working on the mission in
Bosnia. We've also had a teleconference with General
Joulwan, getting the latest up-to-date briefing on
the conditions of the deployment. And I would say --
I should emphasize to you two things.
 
One is that notwithstanding some weather problems and
a few delays occasioned by Christmas traffic on the
rails in Germany, we're pretty much on schedule. And
secondly, and even more important, the attitude
toward compliance thus far in Bosnia by all parties
has been quite good. Now, it's early in the mission,
but so far the attitude toward compliance has been
very good and we're encouraged by that. And we think
we can stay on schedule for the separation of the
forces and the other elements of it.
 
And also, in this Christmas season, I'd like to
remind the people who serve our country that we are
doing this essentially for three reasons. First of
all, because we can do it, and when we can do
something like this it's consistent with our values
to stop suffering and slaughter on the scale we've
seen it in Bosnia. 

Second, because it's very much in our interest to
contain and end this war, to prevent it from
spreading in a way that can involve our NATO allies
on opposite sides and many other countries that are
critical to the stability of Europe. It's also
important for us to do what we can to promote a
stable and democratic and free Europe. We, after all,
have fought two world wars because we did not have
such a Europe; we had a long Cold War because we did
not have such a Europe. So it's in our interest.
 
And finally, it is critical to our ability to lead
the world for the next 10 or 20 years as we sort out
what the security arrangements of the post-Cold War
era will be. I can tell you that our leadership of
NATO specifically, and in general, our ability to
lead in the world toward peace and democracy is very
much tied to our willingness to assume a leadership
role in this Bosnia mission. 

I could see it on my recent trip to Europe -- whether
it was talking to prime ministers in Great Britain or
Ireland or Germany or Spain, or just to people on the
street. It means a lot to them to know that the
United States is still there working and leading and
being a good partner.
 
So, for all these reasons, I think this is a very,
very important mission to our country.
 
Q Thank you, sir. Mr. President -- after Operation
Joint Endeavor, what do you see as the U.S. role in
that area, formerly known as Yugoslavia? What will be
our role there? 

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think, first of all, we'll
still be there through NATO and whatever role that
NATO assumes in the general area beyond our NATO
member nations. But more importantly, I would expect
after this mission is over we will continue to have
American citizens, both people who work for and
represent our government, and people in the private
sector, going in and out of there helping in the
reconstruction effort, contributing to that,
supporting the political process in whatever way we
can.
 
But I think it is quite important that the NATO force
not become an occupying army. We're not dealing with
Berlin here. We're not -- all we're trying to do is
to give this peace agreement a chance to take hold.
And we have a very clear and limited mission. In
fact, I want to make sure that all of our folks know
that, as far as I know, this peace agreement is the
first one ever where the military annex to the
agreement was actually written by the military
commanders who were going to be expected to implement
it.
 
That is, the parties actually ask our military people
to fashion the military annex to the agreement that
was initialed in Dayton so that there would be a
limited, defined, strictly military mission.
 
Q Mr. President, do you agree with the premise that
Bosnia is really the first test of post-Cold War
policy?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it's been tested in
other ways, but it's certainly the most significant
military test of our post-Cold War policy if you
accept the premise that what happened in the Gulf at
the Gulf War could have occurred during the Cold War
as well as afterward; that this is literally a
post-Cold War problem. Then it is the biggest
military test.
 
Q Does that mean that -- what is the success or
failure of this then mean to American foreign policy
10, 15 years down the line?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me just say I think the most
important thing here is that the United States was
prepared to lead and to work with our NATO allies. If
you remember, in the beginning when the Bosnian War
broke out, a lot of our European allies said, well,
we ought to take the leadership role here, we'll do
this; we'll do it through the United Nations. And
we've played a very strong supporting role through
NATO. After all, it's important that the United
States never forget that during these last four,
tough years we led in the conduct of the largest
humanitarian airlift in history; we led in enforcing
the no-fly zone, keeping the war out of the air, and
a lot of other things that were done, including
NATO's willingness to use air strikes to, first of
all, bring about a relatively peaceful 1994, and then
to bring about the conditions in which a peace
agreement could be made in 1995.
 
But what I believe this means, if we make this effort
and if we succeed in our military mission, even if,
God forbid, after we're all gone the thing should
come apart, at least we will be united in doing what
we can do to promote stability in Europe and to take
a stand for peace in the post-Cold War era.
 
If you remember when I sent our troops into Haiti
with a U.N.-led mission, and then when I left a
smaller number there when the United Nations took
over on schedule, I always said that we could not
guarantee the people of Haiti a future, they would
have to do that for themselves. The same is true for
the Bosnians. We cannot guarantee for them a future
without war. What we can guarantee for them is a year
without war, during which they can implement their
own agreement and in which time they can have
elections, they can begin the economic
reconstruction, they can begin to see the benefits of
peace, and then some equilibrium within the country
can be established from a security point of view.
 
But think it would be a mistake for the United States
or for NATO to believe that we should be going around
anywhere guaranteeing the results of peace agreements
which have to be guaranteed in the minds and hearts
of the people who are making them. 

So this will be a success for our alliance, for our
leadership, just by doing the mission. Obviously, it
will be a much, much greater success if the
humanitarian relief, the refugee relocation, the
economic reconstruction all are completely successful
and Bosnia has a permanent peace. That is the real
measure of success. But the main thing is we have to
define together where we must try and where we must
stand against chaos. And I think we've done a good
job of that here.

Q Mr. President, under what circumstances would you
order the U.S. forces to withdraw from Bosnia within
the next year, before the one-year mark?
 
THE PRESIDENT: The only circumstance that I can
imagine doing that is if the mission no longer
existed. That is, keep in mind, we are there not to
fight a war, we are there not to stop a war, we are
there to implement a peace agreement. We anticipate
that there will be violations of this agreement, but
that the leaders will not abandon it and that the
vast bulk of the people will not abandon it. So we
have to be prepared for some violations; we even have
to be prepared for some casualties, although I think
our people have trained and planned as hard against
problems for this mission as they ever have for any.
 
But that would not cause me to withdraw. If -- I
believe that NATO would determine, if all the
factions decided they wanted to go fight again, that
there was no longer a mission to perform.
 
Q Switching a little bit to the defense authorization
bill -- you have said you are going to veto it. The
bill includes a pay raise and a housing allowance
increase for military people. Since some of them are
headed off to Bosnia, are you concerned that not
getting the pay raise, not getting the housing
allowance increase would be detrimental to morale?
And is there some alternative? 

THE PRESIDENT: Very much. Yes, there is an
alternative. The Congress could send me a separate
bill with the pay raise and the allowances in it and
I would sign it in a heartbeat. I think, indeed I
hope that they will do one of two things -- I hope
they will either do that, or when I veto this bill,
assuming my veto would be sustained, which I believe
it would because there are some unconstitutional
restrictions on the President's authority as
Commander in Chief in this bill which compels me to
veto it -- so they can either send me the pay raise
and the allowance increase in a separate bill, or
they could delete the offending portions of the
defense authorization bill and send it right back to
me. They can do either one of those things. And I
would hope the Congress would promptly act to do
that.
 
I do not want any erosion of morale and spirit among
not only our people in uniform, but their family
members. I believe that we are completely united in
supporting the full pay raise and the allowance
increase. And I have done my best to budget for these
things over a period of several years.
 
I have visited a large number of our military
facilities, both in the United States and beyond our
borders. I have talked to a lot of people in uniform
about this. And I think it is a very important issue.
If we want to keep the very best people in our
military, we're going to have to see to the
quality-of-life issues. We've allocated a lot of
money for it over the next budget cycle, and I want
to release it, starting with these two issues.
 
Q Mr. President, on a slightly longer-term budget
issue, the Republican seven-year budget plan, while
it has more money for defense in the first couple of
years, actually targets less money towards defense
spending in the out-years 2000 and beyond. Secretary
Perry said earlier this week that that would force
him into the difficult decision of actually cutting
force structure to pay for modernization.
 
You've talked a lot about social spending in the
budget debate, but I haven't heard you talk much
about defending defense spending. Is that something
you're willing to give away to get a deal?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me say that I still hope
that I can work with Congress in a way that that
choice won't be necessary. It is true that they
front-loaded more defense spending than we did, which
made it very attractive to all the people who wanted
it in these years. But what we tried to do was to
have a balanced commitment. 
 
I think the worst thing that can happen to the
military is to be jerked around with these up and
down budgets and unpredictability. What we tried to
do is to get our folks together here and to say,
okay, what do we need over the next five years; what
do we need over the next seven years. The only thing
I can say to you, and I would say with some sense of
assurance is that our political system has shown a
willingness now to respond if there's a problem
created for our forces in uniform and for our
national defense.
 
I mean, I think -- one of the things you see that in
the last three years is we've had a remarkable
bipartisan ability to maintain a strong defense as a
part of our continuing engagement in the post-Cold
War world. And I think that everyone knows that the
military went through a significant downsizing with a
remarkable maintenance of excellence and morale, and
that now we have to sustain the system that we have
created. 
 
And so I would say to our forces, I'm going to get
the very best budget agreement I can. I hope we can
get an agreement. But if there is an alarming tailoff
in years six and seven I think it can be corrected in
the future. And I believe if we balance the budget,
get interest rates down, the economy will grow more
quickly. And one of the big differences between me
and the Republican Congress is that they have now
given me an economic plan which says if we do
everything they want, at the end of six or seven
years, interest rates and unemployment will be higher
than they are now. I find that very hard to believe.
I think that we're going to be better off, not worse
off if we do this, and we'll have more money,
therefore, to invest in defense.
 
So I would not worry too much about the out-years.
Whatever happens in this budget agreement, at least
as long as I am here -- and I can't conceive of
anyone else coming into this job, or anyone coming
into control of the Congress that would not try to
sustain a long-term plan for the military, because
that's what we've learned -- that if the military has
a plan they can do nearly anything, but we can't jack
around the plan. And we don't want to play games with
people's lives or with the national security. 

Q Mr. President, can I jump back to Bosnia for a
second and politics? How important do you consider
the success of the Bosnia operation to your own
political prospects? Is it a defining moment for you?
And secondly, from a tactical point of view, would
you mind if Senator Dole was the first senior
political presence in Bosnia on Christmas?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me answer the first
question. If you look at recent American history, the
evidence is that the success of the Bosnia operation
may not have much to do with the election in 1996,
but the failure of the Bosnia operation or the
sustaining of significant casualties could have a
great deal to do with it in a negative way. And
that's all. The conventional political wisdom is why
would the President do this; there's no up side and
tons of down side?
 
But I have to say, when you take a job, you have to
do what you -- you have to do the job. And to be
President at the edge of the 21st century, in a time
of dramatic, dramatic change in the way we work and
live and relate to each other, means that you can't
predict the future, and you just have to do what you
think is right. So for me, this was not -- once I
became convinced we could train for this mission,
that we could define the mission in the peace
agreement, that we could minimize the risks to our
troops, then the decision to me was not so difficult,
no matter what the political down side, because I
believe, in a time like this, you have to ask
yourself which decision would your rather defend 10
years from now when you're not in office if it goes
wrong? 
 
I would much rather explain to my child and my
grandchildren why the United States tried to stop
slaughter, prevent the spread of the war, maintain
NATO instead of destroy it, maintain the leadership
of the United States in the world for peace and
freedom. I would much rather explain why we tried to
do that than why, because of the short-term political
problems, we permitted the war to resume, it
expanded, NATO's alliance was destroyed, and the
influence of the United States was compromised for 10
years. 

I think it's obvious if you look at it that way --
what do you want to tell your grandchildren 10 years
from now -- that the United States is doing the right
thing. And the political risk is part of the price
you pay for being President. Anybody who doesn't want
to take any political risk at a time like this should
not run for the job.
 
Now, in terms of who goes to Bosnia when, I don't
think we should politicize it. Senator Dole and I
worked together to get the support that the Senate
gave to this mission. He expressed his reservations
about it, but he supported my decision as
Commander-in-Chief. I appreciated that. And
obviously, at the appropriate time, I have no
objection to either Senator Dole or anyone else, for
that matter, going to Bosnia.
 
The question is, when is the appropriate time. If I
had my way I would be spending Christmas Eve and
Christmas morning there. That's what I wanted to do.
But our commanders made it clear that when a
President comes into Bosnia, if I fly into that
airport at Tuzla, and then I go down to Sarajevo when
they're in the middle of this deployment, it would be
exceedingly disruptive. So even though I wanted to go
there to say to the American people I believe this
mission is on the right track, and most importantly,
to support the troops and to reassure their families,
I'm taking the advice of the military commanders. I
do not want to interrupt this mission. 

The mission's success is the most important thing.
And that's what I believe should guide everyone. I
think everyone -- there are different levels of
disruption that different trips would cause, and I
think we ought to try to just keep it nonpolitical. I
hope anybody that wants to go there that has a reason
to go, including Senator Dole, will be able to go at
the appropriate time. And that's the determination
that needs to be made.
 
Q Mr. President, you mentioned the safety of the
troops as being part of your decision a couple times
in that last answer. We're sending quite a large
force involved in the Bosnia mission. Some might say,
awfully large for a peaceful mission. How extensive
do you think the danger is to our troops there?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think there is -- let's look
at what the sources are. No one can -- the extent of
the danger depends on factors that we can't fully
predict. But I believe that we have minimized the
risks -- what are the possible problems. First of
all, if you look at what the United Nations went
through over the last four years, I think something
over 200 people lost their lives in Bosnia. But more
than half of them lost their lives in accidents. So
we have really worked hard to train against
accidents, to prepare -- to look at the roadways, to
look at the railways, to look at the airfields. We've
worked hard to minimize the loss of life or serious
injury due to accidents.
 
Then we know there are a lot of land mines there. I
got a very encouraging report today that the parties
themselves in many places are assisting us in
removing the mines. But there are a lot of places
where there are a lot of mines laid where the land
was first in one hands and then another, where we
don't have records of the mines, where people don't
have memories of them. So we have trained very hard
to deal with land mines. I think that's the next
biggest danger after accidents.
 
Then the third problem is people who fought in that
war who are either from the country or who came in
from without the country who may have either a
specific grudge against the United States or, more
likely, will just be frustrated because they don't
agree with the peace agreement that the leaders made,
and therefore, some -- and then, fourthly, there is
just the possibility of encounters that go wrong. The
only casualty we sustained in Haiti had nothing to do
with opposition to our being there. It was a man who
was literally a common criminal who ran through a
barrier, and there was an incident and he shot one of
our soldiers dead. 

So I would say that those are the dangers in order. 

Q Mr. President, I think that's all the time we have. 

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you and merry Christmas. I
appreciate what you do.

Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295 6:10 P.M. EST

MR. MCCURRY: Hi. I wanted to appear briefly with my
colleagues here and give you a very short update
based on the guidance that we just got from the
budget principals, who obviously continue their hard
work in the Cabinet Room, sleeves rolled up, sheets
of paper flying back and forth, and coffee being
produced in copious quantities. I'm doing my color
since I don't have much substance to report.
 
Q How many --

Q Was it being consumed in copious quantities? 

MR. MCCURRY: The President, the Majority Leader, the
Speaker, the minority leaders and the others
participating agreed that they would work about
another hour tonight. They are working through a
series of difficult budget issues, but they clearly
are very serious about addressing those issues that
are on the table. They expect to work about another
hour tonight, take a break. 

The budget advisors group, which consists of Mr.
Panetta, Chairman Domenici, Chairman Kasich, and the
two ranking members -- Mr. Sabo and Mr. Exon -- will
reconvene on the Hill at approximately 8:00 p.m. or
roughly a half hour after they conclude here. They
will continue to do the type of work that they did
today, working through some of the issues that
they're attempting to analyze for the benefit of the
principals. And then, according to the President and
the others, they expect to reconvene tomorrow as
early as possible based on the advice they get from
the budget advisors who will meet later this evening.
We don't have a time or --
 
Q The principals?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The principals will meet again tomorrow.
We don't have a time set, although the preference is
to begin as early in the morning as they can based on
however late the advisors group works tonight. 
 
That's about all I am afraid I can report at this
point. By agreement, we're not going to attempt to
summarize any of the substance. As one participant
said, we obviously wouldn't be continuing to meet if
we thought it was going poorly. But other than that,
I don't want to characterize any --
 
Q -- no chance that the House or Senate would take up
the proposals that they mentioned in --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I really don't want to speak to that. I
think it would be more appropriate for you to direct
that to either the Speaker's or the Majority Leader's
-- but if you want -- 

Q Are there any plans for the --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think you know the President's view.
The President's view is that it would be good to get
the federal government up and running, federal
workers back at their desk. 

Q But what about back pay?
 
Q But wait a minute, wait a minute. Can we get them
to answer the question of whether the House or Senate
will take up the issue tonight of --
 
MR. BLANKLEY: It has to be taken up in the Senate
first -- 
 
Q Could you go to the mike?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: Sure. I like that. (Laughter.)
 
MR. MCCURRY: Don't get used to it. (Laughter.) 

MR. BLANKLEY: It would have to be taken up in the
Senate first, and it's not clear whether the Senate
Democrats would be supportive. So we have to be
checking on that before we can move it --
 
Q Why wouldn't they?
 
Q They voted for it last time.
 
Q Why wouldn't they?
 
Q Is this because of the expedited --
 
MR. BLANKLEY: Well, it's not clear. That may be an
issue. So we're still checking.
 
Q What about the House?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: It will have to start in the Senate, so
we can't get out of the Senate.
 
Q But as of now, it is still the plan of the
leadership to try to push it through both chambers --
 
Q Tonight?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: We're trying to, but as I said, it
would have to start with the Senate. You need
unanimous support on both sides of the aisle there.
 
Q The Senate is still --
 
Q What is it that you would try --
 
Q I don't get this --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Would you guys calm down? One of you at
a time will ask a question.
 
Q What are you trying to put through tonight in the
Senate?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: What the Speaker mentioned earlier at
the photo op, which is to have basically the
provision that passed in the Senate last week, which
is attached to the Middle East act, that would bring
-- designate all government employees essential and
would not pay them, but would guarantee their pay
once there is a government up and running again, and
would also have an expedited procedure rule for the
Senate so that we could get whatever agreement we get
out of here moved to the Senate with alacrity. And
there's some speculation that the Senate Democrats
may not want to consent to unanimity on that point.
 
Q Do you know what the state of play in the Senate
is?
 
MR. HINE: The Senate is still in session, prepared to
deal with it, and Senator Dole may have more to say
on the floor once we're done here.
 
Q Logistically, Mike, what would you anticipate that
will happen at the end of the principals meeting?
Would you come out and say something or will they
return to the Hill, have -- 

Q Yes, what happens in an hour?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We did not cover that point. We will
either provide another brief readout which will not
be much different from this readout, or
alternatively, have some type of joint statement as
we did at the conclusion of the meeting last Friday. 

Q You wouldn't expect an appearance by the principals
here?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't expect an appearance by them
here, and I'm not aware of any plans by the
Republican leaders or the Democratic leaders to
attempt to do any type of readout tonight on meetings
or make any type of comment. There obviously -- this
is a work in progress, and the work will continue
tomorrow.
 
MR. HALLEY: On the continuing resolution -- I work
for Senator Daschle -- when this bill comes up, the
Democrats will object because of the fast track
procedures that are being attached to it that would
affect consideration of any budget bill. But at the
same time, we will offer a clean continuing
resolution to fully open the government, as we've
been trying to do for days. So the one that is being
considered by the Republicans, we will object to that
because of the expedited procedures that have been
attached to it. But we will offer a clean continuing
--
 
Q Does that mean you won't give unanimous consent
tonight to that?
 
MR. HALLEY: That's correct.
 
Q What's wrong with the expedited procedure? 

MR. HALLEY: It violates basically most of the
procedures of the Senate in terms of amendments and
debate, et cetera.
 
Q But hold on for a second. Didn't you vote for
something just like this before Christmas --
 
MR. HALLEY: No, that was the Middle East part of it.
There's three parts to this thing that's being put --
 
Q No, we're talking about just calling all the
workers essential. Do you have an objection to that?
 
Q That passed last Friday evening.
 
MR. HALLEY: No. There are three pieces to the thing
that are being put together by the Republicans. One
is deeming workers to be essential, which we agree
with that. Two is the Middle East initiative, which
we agree with that. What we will be objecting to is
the legislating of expedited procedures to -- that
would harm our ability to both amend and debate the
budget bill. And so we will object to that vehicle,
but then we will offer a clean continuing resolution
to open the government.
 
Q Well, when you mean a clean continuing resolution
do you mean to --
 
Q -- what the prospects for that?
 
Q Michael, what's the White House position on this
legislation with the three parts? Do you support the
Senate Democrats or the House --

MR. MCCURRY: The President indicated that, earlier
today, he wants federal workers back at their desks
and working. He wants the services of the government
available to the American people. And we understand
that there will have to be discussions on Capitol
Hill to make that happen quickly. We hope that that
will happen as quickly as possible.
 
Q In other words, he sides with the Republicans, not
the Democrats on this?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No. In other words, I very artfully
ducked the question. (Laughter.) 
 
MR. BLANKLEY: Let me just point out that the
provision that apparently the Senate Democrats are
going to block is the same expedited procedure that
you have on a reconciliation bill. And, obviously,
their concern would be that they wouldn't -- it would
get an agreement here that certain Democratic
senators might not be able to destroy the agreement
by a filibuster on the floor after the members here
have worked it out. So there's -- that's a procedural
question.
 
Q Tony, the Speaker is still against a clean CR, is
that not correct?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Listen, I want John to do -- and this is
-- our purpose here is -- my colleagues are here to
give you an update on the meeting that's going on
here. I think if they want to talk about the
procedural issues, which are important, and the
rights of individual senators to raise points, which
the White House acknowledges is a very important part
of the procedure on Capitol Hill, they should really
brief you up on Capitol Hill about those procedures.
 
Q But he has the right of rebuttal.
 
MR. HALLEY: Yes, thank you. But to restate, the
Democrats, as we've tried to do for weeks, are fully
supportive of opening the government and fully
supportive of that -- the piece of this, which is to
deem workers as essential. And so that's not the
issue.
 
The reason we'd be objecting to this procedural
notion is, again, because it would deny the ability
to amend and debate fully. And as we did in 1990,
there is a way to reestablish a reconciliation bill.
As you may recall, in 1990 after the agreement was
reached, we did another budget resolution that would
then trigger a reconciliation bill under the full
procedures of reconciliation. And so that option is
open to us. And we felt that, therefore, we did not
need to run around completely the entire budget
process with something that we'd do this evening.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Okay, anything more on the meeting going
on now before we exit?
 
Q Yes, Mike. Does the President intend or feel he
will need to before Senator Daschle and Senator Exon
leave the White House tonight, make the point to them
that apparently if everything is so close to
reopening the government, they should set aside --
does he intend to have a separate thing with them,
saying set aside your objection to this; I really
want you to do it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, he has such good working relations
with them that I don't think he feels that there's a
need to cover that point.
 
Q There were briefings on the Hill earlier about the
areas that were covered at the budget advisory
report, or whatever it's called. Can you say whether
the leaders here essentially worked within that
framework? Did they go in it or out of it or -- 

MR. MCCURRY: Based on what I know -- I don't have a
complete readout of their entire discussions tonight.
They did review some of those issues that the
advisers dealt with today. They also moved into what
are referred to in their argot now as the tier three
issues, which are more difficult issues that are --
where the differences are more fundamental between
the sides.
 
Q Which one? Medicaid --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm just not -- we're not authorized to
get into the substance of their dialogue.
 
Q Mike, can you explain what the benefit would be of
this piece of legislation that's having its
difficulties this evening? It sounds as though what
you're talking about doing is essentially bringing
260,000 people back who then will join a bunch of
other people who aren't getting paychecks. They'll
all be getting their paychecks, there still will be
money for their designated agencies to --
 
MR. MCCURRY: We would prefer, obviously, any type of
continuing resolution that would reopen the
government. That's been the President's view all
along. We believe the government should be open. We
have believed for a long time there should be a clean
CR that would do so. But we're dealing, and we have
to be realistic about the environment we're dealing
with. And these gentlemen can speak better than I can
on the attitudes on the Hill. 
 
On the other hand, the effective legislation that
would except federal employees who are currently
furloughed from the furlough would be to incur a
legal obligation to pay them. That legal obligation
would be very useful to federal workers that need any
type of short-term loan to make mortgage payments or
who can produce that as evidence to a creditor that
they got the ability to pay bills that are due. I
think that would be at least some comfort to federal
workers. It would be far better for them to get a
paycheck, far better for them to go back to work, far
better for them to provide services to the American
people. That at least it's something, and something
is better than nothing.
 
Q So you don't mind if they try to amend -- they
block the ability to amend the --
 
MR. MCCURRY: As I just heard, that -- I could tell
from their discussion, that's way over my head. I
think there is some work, clearly, that Congress will
have to do on this. The President's view he stated
very clearly earlier; he would like to see those
federal workers back to work as quickly as possible. 

Q Any guidance beyond talks tomorrow?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I don't have anything for the days
beyond that or what time they might finish tomorrow,
or would they finish in time for various people to
make travel plans. I don't have any guidance on that.
 
Q How are you going to let us know, Mike, if they're
going to meet and what time in the morning? All-call
or -- 

MR. MCCURRY: We will do an all-call tomorrow and also
put in on the recording as soon as we know what the
time is. But I would check in here. I think the
President still plans to do the radio address live
tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m., so you will -- at
least at that point --
 
Q Live from the talks?
 
Q You wouldn't expect it before the radio address,
would you, Mike?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm sorry, let me amend that. Just in
case they want to start earlier, if they end up
deciding they want to start earlier, there's some
chance that we might have to pretape the radio
address earlier in the morning. So check here
tomorrow morning.
 
Q What is it going to be on?
 
Q If Senator Dole give the rebuttal, will he do that
live --
 
Q Pass the mike around the table.
 
Q Is he going to do that from here?
 
MR. HINE: I think we're operating under the same
conditions that Mike on that. It's entirely possible
--
 
Q Mike, just to clarify -- you're not suggesting that
this measure that's being conducted this evening
would restore the government to full functioning.
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, it would -- our understanding is it
would allow federal workers to return to their work,
it would allow them to do certain accepted activity
that would be authorized by their individual
agencies. That would be some progress. It would allow
in some cases, my understanding is, for applications
to be processed. For example, one example is it's
conceivable to me under this legislation, unless my
colleagues disagree, that they might be able to begin
issuing passports again for people who wish to
travel, just as one example. 
 
Now, that's an activity that doesn't incur any
additional obligation to spend money on the part of
the government, but it allows some measure of
government services to be restored to the American
people. And that would be better than nothing, as I
said earlier.
 
Q Can you open the national parks under this? 

MR. MCCURRY: I don't know the answer to that. I don't
know the answer.
 
Q Sometime this evening could you get us a reaction
to -- the President's reaction to the Senate
Democrats stopping that process that you just
outlined?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think I commented on that already.
They didn't say they were stopping it --
 
MR. HALLEY: We're not. We're -- 
 
MR. MCCURRY: They've got a plan to reopen the
government by a clean continuing resolution, which is
something, as you know, the President is strongly
supportive of.
 
Q What's the chance of getting a clean CR? 

Q Do you have any idea what the mood is in the room? 

MR. MCCURRY: Unless my colleagues would dispute this
characterization, they clearly are very serious in
purpose. As I said, many of them have their coats
off, they've got their sleeves rolled up, they've got
pens out and --
 
Q Why didn't they do that before?
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- they're working very seriously on the
relevant issues.
 
Q Is the Senate essentially in town?
 
MR. HINE: Yes, we're in session. We're in recess
subject to the call of the chair. 
 
Q So if there had to be a roll call -- you don't
expect a roll-call vote tomorrow, for example? If the
majority found it necessary to have a roll-call vote
to tamp down the Democrats thinking --
 
MR. HINE: I'm not certain that that's how events are
going to unfold.
 
Q Mike, why couldn't all of this have been done
Tuesday or Wednesday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Tuesday or Wednesday -- you mean earlier
in this week? The process that was defined by the
principals last Friday, a week ago today, called for
the staff-level discussions and analysis to begin on
Tuesday and Wednesday, which occurred. It clearly was
very useful for that to happen because it's been the
premise for a lot of the work that occurred today,
and that the principals are doing now.
 
There was an alternative procedure that had been
discussed a while back. That was not available to the
President or the principals for reasons everyone in
this room knows. This is the process that was
available. This is the process that at the moment
appears to be working. 
 
Q A question for John, just to clear up the Senate
action. Does the Senate action -- say, it happened
tonight or tomorrow -- does that have to be by
unanimous consent, or can there be a vote on it,
which presumably could override the Democrats'
objection? And then could the Democrats, say,
filibuster to prevent a vote?
 
MR. HALLEY: No -- I mean, our intent is to -- I mean,
you would need consent at this time of day. Again,
our intent -- we've tried I'd say 10 times in the
last two weeks to pass a continuing resolution that
would open the government, and that's our position.
 
Q A continuing resolution, not just this deeming
measure? 
 
MR. HALLEY: Right.
 
Q You're talking about a real, live CR?
 
MR. HALLEY: Right, a complete opening. A real, live
put-people-back-to-work and pay them, and open the
agencies. 

MR. MCCURRY: This meeting will be over before the
briefing ends if we don't move on.
 
Q John, can you spell your last name?
 
MR. HALLEY: H-a-l-l-e-y.
 
Q Any idea when you might be able to give us some
guidance about Hilton Head?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It won't be tonight, and it will be late
in the day tomorrow. I just don't have any way to
give you any guidance.
 
Q Can you say how early could these talks -- 7:00
a.m.-8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I believe that will depend entirely on
how late Mr. Panetta, the chairman and the
congressional group works this evening. I think their
intent is to work rather late and that might make the
start not at the crack of dawn, but somewhat around
mid-morning tomorrow.
 
Q At 8:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m.?
 
MR. MCCURRY: And then I would suspect that the
President and the other principals would commence
shortly after that. So I don't -- my guess is around
mid-morning, but we'll wait and see and give you
guidance as we've got it.
 
Q Tomorrow the principals meeting would be back here,
not at the Capitol?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It sounded to me like the intent is to
meet here.
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Letter from Pres. to Speaker of
House of Reps & Pres. pro tempore of Senate

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Text of a letter from the
President to the Speaker of the House of
Representatives and the President pro tempore of the
Senate
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

December 21, 1995

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Mr. President:)

I last reported to the Congress on December 6, 1995,
concerning U.S. support for the United Nations and
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) efforts to
bring peace to the former Yugoslavia. In that report
I noted the success of our diplomatic efforts at
Dayton, Ohio, to assist the parties to reach a
negotiated settlement to the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia and reported the deployment of a NATO
"enabling force" and U.S. support forces in order to
lay the groundwork for the deployment of the main
body of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR). I
am now able to report that on December 14, 1995, the
peace agreement that was initialed in Dayton was
formally signed in Paris.
 
Following the formal signing of the peace agreement
by all the parties, and consistent with our
consultations with the Congress, United Nations
Security Council Resolution 1031, and the North
Atlantic Council (NAC) decision of December 16, 1995,
I have ordered the deployment of approximately 20,000
U.S. military personnel to participate in the IFOR in
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, principally
in a sector surrounding Tuzla. Approximately 5,000
U.S. military personnel will also deploy as part of
the IFOR in other states of the former Yugoslavia,
principally Croatia. The IFOR, including U.S. forces
assigned to it, will be under NATO operational
control and will operate under NATO rules of
engagement. In addition, a total of approximately
7,000 U.S. support forces, under U.S. command and
control and rules of engagement, will deploy in
Hungary, Croatia, Italy, and other states in the
region in support of IFOR. These force levels are
those stated by U.S. commanders to be appropriate for
the missions assigned to them. 

The IFOR's mission, as outlined in more detail in the
summary of the operation plan (OPLAN), which I sent
to the Congress on December 11, 1995, is to monitor
and help ensure compliance by all parties with the
military aspects of the peace agreement. In
particular, IFOR will ensure withdrawal of the forces
of the parties to the agreed inter-entity borders
within an agreed period and enforce establishment of
agreed zones of separation between forces of the
parties. IFOR will also create secure conditions for
the safe, orderly, and speedy withdrawal from the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of those elements
of the U.N. Protection Force not assigned to NATO.
Finally, within the strict limits of its key military
tasks, IFOR will endeavor to create secure conditions
for the conduct by other agencies and organizations
of tasks associated with the peace agreement. NATO
and U.S. military commanders believe, and I expect,
that the military mission can be accomplished in
about a year. 

Many of the U.S. forces that will deploy to the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be drawn from
the U.S. Army's lst Armored Division stationed in
Germany, including two mechanized brigades and an
aviation brigade. Other participating U.S. forces
include special operations forces, airfield
operations support forces, naval and air forces
previously assigned to support NATO's Operations
Sharp Guard and Deny Flight, and an amphibious force
in reserve in the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, a
carrier battle group will provide support for IFOR's
air operations.
 
All of our NATO allies are contributing forces as
well (except for Iceland, which has no military).
Non-NATO nations whose offers to provide forces to
IFOR are under consideration include Austria, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia,
Slovakia, Sweden, and Ukraine. These forces also will
be under NATO operational control and rules of
engagement. In total, approximately 60,000 military
personnel are expected to be deployed by IFOR to the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As in the U.S.
case, the non-U.S. contingents in Bosnia will in most
cases be supported by forces of their respective
countries at home and in nearby countries and waters.
 
I authorized these deployments and U.S. participation
in IFOR in conjunction with our NATO allies and other
troop contributing nations following the relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions and NAC decisions
and as part of our commitment to secure the peace and
halt the tragic loss of life in the former
Yugoslavia. I have directed the participation of U.S.
forces pursuant to my constitutional authority to
conduct the foreign relations of the United States
and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. 

I am providing this report as part of my effort to
keep the Congress fully informed about developments
in the former Yugoslavia, consistent with the War
Powers Resolution. I remain committed to consulting
closely with the Congress and I will continue to keep
the Congress fully informed regarding these important
deployments of our forces.
 
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office of the Press Secretary --
Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295 7:25 P.M. EST
 
MR. MCCURRY: Second verse, same as the first. Bye.
(Laughter.)
 
Q Do you know now how the President feels about the
Democratic move in the Senate?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President believes that we'll able
to work -- given the cooperation shown today, we can
work something out that will allow federal workers to
resume their diligent service to the American people.
 
Q Tonight?
 
Q What's that mean?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It will be up to senators and leaders on
the Hill to resolve those issues, but we hope they
will.
 
Q Well, does he agree that the Democrats have a
point?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He understands the concerns the senators
have to make sure they've got the right protected to
debate very important budget matters and the very few
hours of hearings and debate devoted to aspects of
the Republican budget. And he well understands why
people are protecting the right to have further
debate. At the same time, he will encourage all
members of Congress from both parties to act quickly
to allow federal workers to return to their posts.
 
Q Mike, when you say work something out, does the
President -- is the President given to understand
that there will be something done today or tomorrow
to work something out to return furloughed federal
employees back to the job -- to their jobs? 

MR. MCCURRY: The sense the President got is that
congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle are
working urgently to solve the matter.
 
Q -- conciliatory to me.
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- let me tell you what I know about
tonight. They're taking a break. Mr. Panetta and his
group from the White House will return to Capitol
Hill, begin meeting with the so-called budget
advisers group, approximately 8:00 p.m. It's my
understanding they do not plan any further readouts
this evening. They are continuing to work through
issues that they then prepare for discussion by the
budget advisers. I anticipate that staffs are going
to be working throughout the evening and into the
morning to prepare discussion documents that will be
used by the principals tomorrow. They've agreed to
reconvene here at the White House at 10:30 a.m.
tomorrow. That's the principals group.
 
Q How does that affect the radio address? Still be
done live?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The radio address is going to be done
taped just to protect -- make sure we don't have any
-- because the President may be involved in
pre-briefs prior to the meeting. 

Q What's the subject?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It will be about the budget.
 
Q When will that be available, Mike?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He's taping it tomorrow morning, and we
expect it will be available just shortly before air
time.
 
Q Mike, the Republicans all left tonight without
comment. Did the meeting end in an atmosphere of --
 
MR. MCCURRY: It ended very amicably. And the
President, the Speaker, the Majority Leader and the
Democratic leaders agreed that the readout that you
heard earlier this evening would suffice for the work
that they did between roughly 6:00 p.m. and 7:20 p.m.
 
Q -- resolution tomorrow, Mike? What does it look
like?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Say again.
 
Q For the prospects of a resolution tomorrow. 

MR. MCCURRY: A resolution -- you mean a resolution of
issues or --
 
Q Yes.
 
MR. MCCURRY: They will make progress tomorrow, but I
don't -- the work they're doing, it would be very
hard at this point to predict that they would arrive
at any final agreements tomorrow. They've got a lot
of work to do tomorrow.
 
Q Do you this going, then, into Sunday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Conceivably, yes. But that's not been
decided yet.
 
Q Do you have a reaction from the President to the
Daschle blocking this plan that --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Yes, we talked about that earlier. 

Q Is there a meeting with Panetta and the budget
advisers tomorrow morning before the principals
meeting? There was some talk about a 9:00 a.m.
meeting on the Hill before the principals came down
here. Was there any talk about that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They may -- the budget advisers group
may reconvene tomorrow morning, but they -- that
would be prior to the 10:30 a.m. meeting --
 
Q Why did the President cut off a reporter from
asking Gingrich whether he had caved?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President -- (inaudible) -- felt
that there had been any indication by the Speaker
that he had, quote, unquote, caved -- (inaudible) --
the President also thought he might give a better
answer than the Speaker might. (Laughter.)
 
Q What?
 
Q He wants peace to reign.
 
Q -- single issue was set aside as agreed upon or
anything narrowed substantially --
 
MR. MCCURRY: The procedure they've been using for
these discussions is that any element discussed and
any element that they reach consensus upon would not
change the admonition that nothing is finally agreed
until everything is agreed.
 
Q Your sense, Mike, about any travel plans the
President may have that could be tomorrow or more
likely Sunday now? 

MR. MCCURRY: I have no sense, but the President
seemed to be enjoying himself here as much as he
would in South Carolina. (Laughter.)
 
Q You have no sense of that?
 
Q -- answer to that question that nothing is agreed
until everything is agreed -- what you're saying is,
whatever differences they narrow today have no
permanent status because everything has to be agreed
to or--
 
MR. MCCURRY: As a common negotiating device, they
usually -- even as they work through complicated
issues, that they reserve the right at the end of the
discussion to go back and look at the entire package.
And they have done so here, and I suspect they will
continue to do so -- that they will go back and look
at the final package that they get, if they in fact
get one, before they agree that they've got a final
agreement.
 
Q But you -- as you agree, you guys are just checking
it off and moving on to the next one, and then --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Yes, but what they're doing -- they're
doing -- I mean, without getting into the substance,
because I'm not authorized to get into the substance,
they are working through a set of issues that have
been identified. The budget advisers today met, dealt
with a series of budget issues, not all of them, but
many of them. They were analyzed in some detail,
discussions papers were prepared. They were reviewed
today. The budget advisers will now go back up to the
Hill, continue to address elements of the budget
discussion. They will be analyzed, discussion drafts
will be prepared, and they'll work again on it
tomorrow. They're taking these issues serially as
they work through a series of contentious issues that
range from the -- starting with the less
controversial and moving to the more controversial.
And they clearly now are moving into areas that are
more controversial.
 
Q On the Hill tonight do you think there will be
action to get the workers back to work?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I cannot predict that. You've heard the
discussion of the representatives and the
congressional leadership earlier, and it will be up
to them to --
 
Q Mike, are there going to be simultaneous meetings
with the budget leaders up on the Hill, meeting at
the same time that the meetings down here are taking
place, or do they complete -- 

Q I think Tony Blankley said --
 
Q He did indicate -- Tony indicated that they'd be up
on the Hill, you know, working on churning stuff out
even for future issues -- even as --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Oh, yes, they have -- well, we have --
there have been staff -- staff work has continued
even while the principals are meeting, yes. In fact,
there's some -- staff has been available in the
Roosevelt Room in case there is a need for expert
advice on budget related issues, and they continue.
 
Q With Cabinet-level people? Will they be meeting
also at the same --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I wouldn't rule it out, but mostly the
people who are there are more staff level experts.
 
Q -- radio address subject?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It will be the budget situation
generally. It will also be, because it's the last
radio address of the year, it will be a review of
1995.
 
Q Mike, unrelated, is the policy out here changed at
all, or was that just a mis --
 
MR. MCCURRY: That was a regrettable misunderstanding,
and I believe we have got meetings going on right now
to straighten out --
 
Q That's not the first time it's happened today. It's
happened several times. 
 
MR. MCCURRY: I understand, and there's --
 
Q Some people decided not to provoke a fight and -- 

MR. MCCURRY: Right. They're working to clarify what
the ground rules are on -- (inaudible) -- because
they obviously -- 

Q Is the President going out tonight?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Say again.
 
Q Is the President going out tonight?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Not that I'm aware of. Is he? He is?
Pool alert -- that he may go out for dinner
apparently. 
 
Q Where?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Okay, see you all tomorrow.
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

Statement by Press Secretary

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Statement by Press
Secretary
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

President Clinton today announced that he has named
Victoria L. Radd to be Deputy Assistant to the
President and Deputy Director of Communications.

Since December 1993, Radd has served as Associate
Counsel to the President, with responsibility for
coordinating the selection and confirmation process
for Federal judges.

Previously, she was a partner at the Washington, D.C.
law firm of Williams & Connolly. In 1992, she was
co-coordinator of presidential debates preparation
for the Clinton-Gore campaign. She served as senior
policy adviser to Senator Lloyd Bentsen's Vice
Presidential campaign in 1988, and as communications
and policy advisor to the Dukakis for President
campaign and the Mondale-Ferraro campaign.

A native of Greenfield, Massachusetts, Radd is a
graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School.
She also has a masters degree from the London School
of Economics. She served as a law clerk to Judge J.
Skelly Wright on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the

-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE: Agricultural income
and finance

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE: Agricultural income and finance
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:271295

Net Farm Income May Rise in 1996, While Net Cash
Income Declines 
Net farm income is forecast at $37-$47 billion for
1996, compared with the $39 billion forecast for
1995. Both forecasts are below the 1990-94 average of
$44 billion. Expected high crop cash receipts and a
forecast increase in inventories of unsold feed
grains underpin the 1996 forecast. Net cash income is
forecast at $43-$53 billion, compared with $51
billion forecast for 1995. An important reason why
the net farm income forecast is generally upward and
the forecast for net cash income is generally
downward is that, in contrast to net farm income, net
cash income excludes changes in inventory. The degree
and direction by which inventories change can swing
widely depending on production and marketing
patterns.

Cash receipts from farm marketings are projected at
$184-$192 billion in 1996, up from the $184 billion
forecast for 1995. Both forecasts would be a record;
the previous high was $180 billion in 1994. Expected
large feed grain production and strong feed grain
prices stemming from tight world supplies explain
much of the higher 1996 forecast. Livestock receipts
are expected to remain flat.

Direct government payments for 1996 are forecast at
$3-$5 billion, while the 1995 forecast is for $6
billion. Expected high feed grain prices are the main
reason for the reduced forecast. Projected government
payments for both 1995 and 1996 would be the lowest
in the 1990's.

Total production expense, used to calculate net farm
income, is forecast at $169-$177 billion in 1996, up
from $168 billion in 1995. Part of the forecast
increase is tied to the expected rise in planted
acres. High forecast feed grain prices and fewer
requirements to idle acreage in order to be eligible
for government farm program benefits should encourage
heavy plantings. High feed grain prices could
increase feed expense for livestock producers, which
is of special importance because U.S. cattle numbers
in 1996 could approach the large levels last seen in
the mid-1980's. Higher nitrogen fertilizer prices
could increase costs for crop producers.

The value of agricultural assets is forecast at
$985-$995 billion for 1996, up 3 to 4 percent from
1995. About four-fifths of the increase is due to
rising real estate values. Expanding cash receipts,
generally good returns to assets, and favorable
interest rates are supporting continued growth in
farm sector capital investments. Farm business debt
could rise above $155 billion by the end of 1996, the
highest level since 1986. However, interest expense
could decline, as lower rates offset the rise in
debt. Overall farm debt in 1996 should be about 60
percent of what farm income can support, also the
highest level since 1986.

Given trends developing for 1996--higher crop cash
receipts, flat livestock receipts, smaller government
payments, and slightly lower net cash income: 
* Net cash income could decline proportionally more
on the smallest farms than on the largest ones. The
smallest farms traditionally earn a larger proportion
of their income from livestock sales and government
payments. 

* Farms that specialize in red meat production could
have proportionally larger dips in their net cash
income than other types of farms. Because they depend
on livestock for about 90 percent of their income,
farms specializing in red meat likely will face
higher feed expenses.

* Midwestern farms could have proportionally smaller
declines in their net cash income compared with farms
in other parts of the country. The Midwest is by far
the Nation's largest producer of corn and soybeans,
the crops for which cash receipts are forecast to
increase the most.

A special article in this issue looks at the
financial performance of U.S. farm business in 1994.
USDA's latest Farm Costs and Returns Survey, shows
that even though 1994 saw none of the adverse weather
that decreased production the year before, net income
from farming for the average commercial farm business
was up less than 1 percent. While the year-to-year
variation in average income was not statistically
significant, the composition of net income did
change. Government payments were down significantly.
The reduction in cash expenses offset the decline in
gross cash income and was enough for income to rise
from an average of $37,997 per farm in 1993 to an
average of $38,284 in 1994. In 1994, 6 percent of
commercial farm businesses were in a vulnerable
financial position based on their combined net farm
income and debt-to-asset ratios.

A second special article outlines the issues involved
in accounting for forestry product sales in farm
income estimates.

-ANC: ANC Secretary General's Christmas message

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-ANC: ANC Secretary
General's Christmas message
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:231295

We are now approaching the end of what has been a
very important year. It is during this year that we
observed the first anniversary of the birth of our
new democracy - an occasion marked by both
celebration and reflection.

1995 was no less significant a year for all our
people. It give us a glimpse of what the future holds
in store. This years achievements have provided us
with insight into the opportunities that await South
Africa in the coming years. It has at the same-time
given us a better understanding of the magnitude of
the task of reconstruction and development that still
lie ahead.

The African National Congress has always admitted
that no major transformation process can ever succeed
without the solid support of the majority of our
people in their organised formations and sectors. We
shall continue to ensure the constructive involvement
of all these in the reconstruction and development
programme. 

For indeed without their involvement the
reconstruction and development programme will lack
the mass content critical to its realization.

The single issue uppermost in people's minds, which
will continue to impede the effective implementation
of the RDP, and generates a negative perception of
our country in the outside world - is that of crime.
Antisocial behaviour - be it murder, both political
and criminal; car-hijackings; rape; robbery; child
molestation; or some other - must be seriously
addressed and eliminated. The sheer size of the
problem dictates that piecemeal methods will be
ineffective. It requires a comprehensive national
strategy for the prevention of crime. At the core of
such an approach is addressing the root causes of
crime.

The ANC, in government and outside government,
remains firmly committed to creating a safe and
secure environment in which families can bring up
their children; mothers can feel safe in their homes
and on the streets; and breadwinners can go about
their business without fear.

The Government of National Unity has already set in
motion a National Crime Prevention Strategy, linked
to the Community Safety Plan initiated by President
Nelson Mandela. These and other initiatives must
continue to draw the unequivocal support of all our
communities if we are to uproot.

On the economic front, we draw inspiration from the
economic growth and development hitherto unknown in
our country in the past twenty - three years. The
economy is now geared towards servicing the needs,
not of a section but all our people.

The constitution is being shaped by the need to move
from the inequities of the past and towards a climate
of peace, reconciliation and nation - building -
issues so close to our President's heart.

Our country, has effectively been transformed from a
pariah to a darling of nations of the world. We have
now taken our rightful place in all international
platforms: socially, economically, sporting,
cultural, diplomatic and in all other forms of
international relations.

The African National Congress, extends its heartfelt
congratulations to all South Africans who helped
shape the destiny of our country into the envy of the
world. In this season of goodwill we express our
condolences to those who lost their loved ones
throughout this year.

The ANC extends a message of peace and harmony, a
Happy Christmas and Prosperous New Year!

-BELL ATLANTIC: Maryland files rate plan to address
competetion -- Plan caps prices until 1998

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-BELL ATLANTIC: Maryland
files rate plan to address competetion -- Plan caps
prices until 1998
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

BALTIMORE, MD -- Bell Atlantic today proposed an
alternative regulatory plan that would regulate Bell
Atlantic's prices rather than the company's earnings.
The plan was filed with the Maryland Public Service
Commission and comes on the heels of legislation
passed earlier this year by the General Assembly
giving the Commission the power to adopt such a
regulatory approach.
 
"Our plan is a logical next step to replace
Maryland's current incentive regulation plan," said
Dan Whelan, president and CEO of Bell Atlantic -
Maryland. "It recognizes the competitive nature of
our industry today. It is pro-consumer,
pro-competition and pro-economic development."
 
Under the plan, services would be divided into five
categories: Access, Basic-Residential, Basic-Other,
Discretionary and Competitive. The Access category
includes services that provide connections to
long-distance networks. Basic-Residential includes
residential dial-tone lines, while Basic-Other
includes business services. Discretionary includes
optional services like Call Waiting, and Competitive
includes services provided by other vendors, such as
Speed Dialing.
 
Under the Bell Atlantic proposal, the rates for
Basic-Residential services would be capped for a
period of two years, and many business services for
one year. After that, rates for these services could
be increased or decreased annually, under a formula
that is based on changes in the Gross Domestic
Product-Price Index. 
 
"Our residential rates have been stable since 1985,
and this plan ensures that this stability will be
maintained," Whelan said. 

The plan is also designed to give Bell Atlantic
additional flexibility in pricing Discretionary and
Competitive services categories. For example, rates
for discretionary services, such as Call Waiting and
Caller ID, could be increased up to 25% annually or
could be reduced at any time, provided rates are not
reduced below costs. Competitive services such as
Speed Dialing, which compete with services offered by
Bell Atlantic's competitors, would be subject to full
pricing flexibility.
 
"This plan preserves the PSC's regulatory authority
to oversee telecommunications in Maryland, and
focuses on prices paid by customers, rather than
regulation of Bell Atlantic's earnings," Whelan said.
"The plan also guarantees that we will follow the
commission's service quality standards and maintains
relevant safeguards, such as pricing services above
costs to prevent anti-competitive behavior." 

Whelan said that Bell Atlantic's plan is also aimed
at keeping Maryland competitive with neighboring
states. Numerous studies have shown that regulatory
policies which allow a company to retain its earnings
can lead to a more aggressive deployment of new
telecommunications services--services that would
support Maryland's economic development goal of
attracting and retaining businesses and jobs. 
 
"Although Maryland is leading the nation in
introducing telecommunications competition, we are
the only state in our region that has not adopted a
more modern regulatory structure. It is therefore
important that we move forward prudently, but
quickly," he added.
 
Bell Atlantic Corporation (NYSE: BEL) is at the
forefront of the new communications, entertainment
and information industry. In the mid-Atlantic region,
the company is the premier provider of local
telecommunications and advanced services. Globally,
it is one of the largest investors in the high-growth
wireless communications marketplace. Bell Atlantic
also owns a substantial interest in Telecom
Corporation of New Zealand and is actively developing
high-growth national and international business
opportunities in all phases of the industry.

Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:
Section 1511 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (hereinafter the "Act"),
requires that the sanctions imposed on Serbia and
Montenegro, as described in that section, shall
remain in effect until changed by law. Section
1511(e) of the Act authorizes the President to waive
or modify the application of such sanctions upon
certification to the Congress that the President has
determined that the waiver or modification is
necessary to achieve a negotiated settlement of the
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina that is acceptable to
the parties.
 
In accordance with this provision, I have issued the
attached Presidential Determination stating that the
suspension of the sanctions described in section
1511(a)(1-5) and (7-8) and in conformity with the
provisions of United Nations Security Council
Resolutions 1021 and 1022 is necessary to achieve a
negotiated settlement of the conflict. As described
in the attached Memorandum of Justification, this
sanctions relief was an essential factor motivating
Serbia and Montenegro's acceptance of the General
Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and
Herzegovina initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on November
21, 1995 (hereinafter the "Peace Agreement").
 
I have directed the Secretaries of the Treasury and
Transportation to suspend immediately the application
of these sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro and have
authorized the Secretary of State to suspend the arms
embargo at appropriate stages consistent with United
Nations Security Council Resolution 1021. The first
stage would be 91 days after the United Nations
Secretary General reports to the United Nations
Security Council that all parties have formally
signed the Peace Agreement.
 
The measures taken to suspend these sanctions may be
revoked if the Implementation Force (IFOR) commander
or High Representative determines that Serbia and
Montenegro or the Bosnian Serbs are not meeting their
obligations under the Peace Agreement.

-THE TENAGRA CORPORATION: New year could usher in big
computing problems

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE TENAGRA CORPORATION:
New year could usher in big computing problems
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

Brampton, Ontario, Canada -- Peter de Jager is one of
a growing number of computer experts that isn't
looking forward to New Year's day in the year 2000.

That is because 12:00:01 AM, January 1, 2000 could
mark the beginning of a serious problem for many of
the world's computer systems.

Most computers track the date by using a two-digit
notation system. The date January 1, 1996, for
example, would be recorded by a computer as:
01/01/96. This notation system, according to de
Jager, is the problem. 

"The two-digit date notation affects data
manipulation, primarily subtractions and
comparisons," explains de Jager. "For instance, I was
born in 1955. If I ask the computer to calculate how
old I am today, it subtracts 55 from 93 and announces
that I'm 38.

"So far so good. But what happens in the year 2000?
The computer will subtract 55 from 00 and will state
that I am minus 55 years old. This error will affect
any calculation that produces or uses time spans,
such as an interest calculation."

De Jager believes a number of Year 2000 related
problems may well manifest themselves in 1996.

"A large number of business processes, such as credit
cards, operate on a four year cycle. In 1996, it will
be interesting to see if any banks issue credit cards
with '00' as an expiration year. What could happen is
that ATM machines may think that the card expired in
1900 if only '00' is used to signify the year 2000."

While year 2000 problems are often associated with
large computing systems, it will affect desktop
computers as well. Many people that shut off their
personal computers on December 31, 1999 could be
surprised when they turn them on the next day to find
their computer's clock set at January 4, 1980 -
another strange error that experts predict will occur
because of the way internal clocks in computers
handle the rollover to a new year. 

Some experts estimate that the costs of reprogramming
computers to rid them of this flaw in the next four
years could total hundreds of billions of dollars.

Peter de Jager is an industry speaker on the topics
of managing the impact of technological change. He
was the first to actively speak about on the Year
2000 computer crisis to those outside the computer
industry. 

In April, 1995, de Jager partnered with The Tenagra
Corporation to develop the Year 2000 Internet
Information Center (http://www.year2000.com/) - an
Internet web site devoted to raising awareness of the
Year 2000 computer crisis. The web site contains
extensive information on the impending crisis,
including 10 white papers and nine vendors providing
Year 2000 solutions. Individuals visiting the site
can also download a free software patch to help PCs
cope with the date transition.

Founded in 1993, The Tenagra Corporation
(http://arganet.tenagra.com/) is Houston, Texas
company providing Internet marketing, public
relations, consulting and web site development
services.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295 3:55 P.M. EST
 
MR. MCCURRY: Okay. All clear, right?
 
Q Yeah, right.
 
Q How come there's no meeting until next Friday? What
happened?
 
MR. MCCURRY: As you can tell from our statement, as
--in fact, can I have a copy in my statement so I can
just keep repeating what's in the statement?
(Laughter.)
 
Q We heard the President say that he's willing to
stay every day, work hard and so forth to get an
agreement. What happened?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He is. The key thing -- I'll do an
exegetical of reading this statement for you. The
good meetings that they had today refers to the two
meetings they had. They had a larger meeting in the
Cabinet Room and then the private meeting that the
President had with the Speaker, the Majority Leader,
the two Minority Leaders and Mr. Armey, too, I
believe -- George? Armey was there -- in the Oval
Office.
 
They build on the progress in yesterday's
discussions. That's an important observation because
you will recall that Mr. Panetta and Mr. Domenici and
Mr. Kasich designed a process yesterday by which we
dealt with some of the less controversial issues in
this budget dispute. That generated over a seven-year
period some $40 billion in savings in some of these
secondary areas. That was presented to the principals
today, and I think there was agreement that while
there's nothing agreed until everything is agreed,
that represented some progress and served as a useful
model of how we might resolve some of the larger
issues.
 
So the President and the other leaders agreed that
that process by which staff develops an analysis,
presents it to the budget advisors -- which is the
Panetta, Domenici, Kasich, Sabo, Exon group -- they
ought to work through this analysis beginning right
after the holiday and then present that back to the
principals a week from today, as they just did
yesterday in looking at the issues that they looked
at. And I think that's useful. 
 
There have been different ideas on how we might
advance this discussion, ranging from face-to-face
meetings to whatever, but they had a process, they
designed a process yesterday. It seemed to be
working. I think there was agreement, as you can tell
from this statement, that they ought to continue to
use that process to see if they could make progress
on these other issues.
 
Q No sense of urgency at all?
 
MR. MCCURRY: A great deal of urgency.
 
Q How can you say that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: A great deal of a sense of urgency. This
President would, above all else, like to see the full
services of the American government restored to the
American people. But everybody in this room knows
that's not going to happen because you've been
following -- presumably, you've been following the
debate in the House and the Senate today. So you just
know where we are on that. 

Now what we are going to do, since we can't get the
full services of the government restored, they are
going to deal with the most urgent situations that
exist. Those range from benefits checks for veterans
to income support checks for children who are
dependent on AFDC, to federal workers who are not
getting their pay. That was an area of very great
concern raised by the President and agreed to by most
of the leaders in the room.
 
And they are looking now at ways in which they might
be able to address that situation, despite the fact
that there doesn't seem to be agreement on Capitol
Hill for a CR that would be fully fund the
government. Everyone here knows that Democrats today
have offered on Capitol Hill clean versions of the CR
that would re-open this government. And you all know
what's happened to those measures. 

Q Well, would it come to a vote at all?
 
Q Mike, at the very least, does this mean that
there's no end in sight for the shutdown, at least
not until next Friday when the next meeting takes
place?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, there are ways in which we will
attempt to address the consequences of the shutdown.
We will continue our work day by day at OMB to
address the consequences of the shutdown. I believe
you will see as a result of this meeting today on
Capitol Hill efforts by the leaders to address some
of the specific consequences.
 
It certainly appears that there will be some
agreement on trying to get veterans' checks out on
time and trying to get income support payments to
children out on time. But we'll have to deal with the
most urgent consequences of the shutdown on a
day-by-day basis, doing what we can, working with the
Hill and getting legislation passed and doing what we
can do administratively under law as we did in the
last shutdown to address the consequences that
threaten life and health of the American people.
 
Q Well, so, the President -- this is a club over the
President which he is accepting, basically?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No. The club over the President that
they tried to swing was to insist upon him tabling a
seven-year balanced budget proposal scored by the CBO
in order to have exactly this type of discussion. And
that did not happen.
 
Q But, Mike, he has repeatedly said he would not
negotiate with a gun to his head, this sort of threat
of shutting down the government. But now he's doing
exactly that.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, it's the result of this
conversation today, while not removed, the gun was
clearly uncocked. 
 
Q Huh?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they've taken some of -- whether
it's veterans' benefits or welfare payments or now
we've got some forward movement as a result of this
meeting on the issue of payments to workers who are
furloughed -- they're going to try to work through
some of these issues, and they've instructed staff to
look at ways that they could deal with that.
 
Q -- half-cocked, right?
 
Q Mike, was there a definite agreement that this
meeting today from the Republicans to go ahead and
move through on a limited CR basis all these urgent
matters as they come up? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, it would be better given the
agreement that we've reached not to try to
characterize or spin the results of this meeting, for
you to direct that question to the Republicans.
 
Q And was there agreement to continue to -- 

MR. MCCURRY: The President was encouraged -- the
President raised those as urgent issues, and the
President was encouraged by the response.
 
Q What was the tone of the meeting?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Workman-like. Workperson-like.
 
Q What is the President going to be doing this
weekend?
 
Q Were there any women there?
 
MR. MCCURRY: In other words, they rolled up their --
they did, this was, in fact, exactly a meeting where
they rolled up their sleeves and went to work.
 
Q Did he ask them to open the government and they
refused?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He has done that repeatedly.
 
Q I take it the House is going to go into recess, but
there are different versions of this very narrow --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I cannot help you sort out what's
happening in the House and the Senate. We're
following that and trying to make heads or tails out
of that ourselves, but it's a very fluid situation.
I'd ask your congressional correspondents. 

Q What does the President do this weekend? How does
he advance it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, he's confident that those who will
be working through some of the analysis of the issues
will be at work. There will be some staff level work,
but to be candid about it, the budget staffs at both
the CBO and the OMB have been working 24-hour days
for several weeks, and the President is going to give
our OMB staff and economists the Christmas holiday
off. They'll come back after Monday beginning working
on this analysis of issues. They'll present that to
the budget advisors group. That's the Panetta,
Kasich, Domenici, Exon, Sabo group. I expect they
will meet late next week and prepare the agenda and
the discussion for the principals a week from today.
 
Q What is the guidance on what he's going to do? Is
he still going to go to Camp David next week?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Since this is just developing, he
probably was looking for an opportunity to talk to
the First Lady about their plans. His plans are still
to be here through the 26th at least, and then the
option of going to Camp David from the 27th he'll
have to explore. I don't have an answer for you.
 
Q Is Hilton Head out?
 
MR. MCCURRY: If he goes down, I think -- he still has
an interest in going down and having a party with his
friends on New Year's Eve. But I don't know whether
he's going to be able to do that, or not.
 
Q Mike, in today's meeting, did the President ask
them to put the government back to work?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He addressed his concern as he did
publicly for all of you at the -- I mean, the answer
to that, obviously, is yes, because he did it with
all of you present at the beginning of the meeting. I
mean, he stressed that concern, he raised that
concern. They talked about it during the meeting. 

Q And they said no still?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The no came from the action on Capitol
Hill today, as you know.
 
Q Mike, the $40 billion that you talked about, did
the principals all agree to where that was coming
from and did they reach any agreement about where to
put it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they -- again, I would stress,
because I don't want anyone to misunderstand what the
White House is saying that nothing is agreed until
everything is agreed. They were satisfied they made
some progress on those roughly $40 billion worth of
savings generated by discussions they had on the wide
range of things they dealt with yesterday from
spectrum to banking, to financial, to transportation
issues, some of the other issues that they've dealt
with. That's a useful model. And then that goes into
further discussions. I don't have any detail breakout
of that. I can't specify that, and I won't specify
that.
 
Q Mike, is the President --
 
Q -- there's no Medicaid agreement?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Santa?
 
SANTA CLAUS: Ho-ho-ho-ho.
 
MR. MCCURRY: It's very good to see you.
 
SANTA CLAUS: Merry Christmas.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Merry Christmas. Let's do a couple more
questions, and then I'll turn the podium over to
Santa.
 
Q Is the President comfortable with the way this
thing ended? Would he have preferred more talks
tonight, obviously, on the weekend? Is it just done
now until next Friday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President would prefer to see the
government open, prefer to see the balance -- the
budget balanced now. But we are into a process that
we hope will resolve some of these issues and resolve
some of the differences that exist. These differences
still exist. It's not possible to achieve either of
those objectives today.
 
Q But this timetable is to give everybody a Christmas
at home, isn't it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: This timetable is to allow people to
work through issues that are deeply divided at the
moment and that apparently were not reconcilable
today.
 
Q Was the President willing to work --
 
Q Just one other thing, Mike, on another matter. As
you know, as a result of the compromise, those
Whitewater notes were released, went to the Hill.
Senator D'Amato and others have reacted. What's the
sense here about what the effect of this is? Does it
make things better, make things worse, prolong the
controversy, end it --what?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I concur fully on Mr. Fabiani's
statement. 

Q Mike, just to be clear here, are you saying that
the President was willing to work, but the members of
Congress wanted to go back home? I mean, who was it
who said we shouldn't -- 

MR. MCCURRY: The issue was not the desire to go back
home. The issue was the desire to try to make some
progress on these issues. And they clearly were not
going to write a seven-year balanced budget plan at
this meeting today. That was not in the expectations
for the meeting.
 
Q Well, how about next week?
 
MR. MCCURRY: What they have done is designed a
process by which we can get to that objective. 
 
Let me just take one or two more.
 
Q So the President was unwilling to work on Tuesday.
I just want to find out --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Look, that is not the case. The
President is more than -- would have been willing if
it was some prospect that this would have led to a
successful result to have worked all through the
holiday. That's not going to happen. It was clear in
this meeting that they're not going to bridge these
--
 
Q Well, did they tell him, we won't do it? 

MR. MCCURRY: It's clear that they weren't going to
bridge all the differences that exist and write a
budget that is a very complex document in the course
of a weekend.
 
Q Mike, explain what is the goal here now? Is the
goal to produce, as the Republicans want, as Armey
has said repeatedly, a bill -- a bill in the end that
they send to him that puts the government back to
work and it's a done deal? Or is the goal to get far
enough along to where the Republicans finally give in
and pass a CR? What's -- I mean, it's got to be one
or the other. 

MR. MCCURRY: The goal we have is to see the services
of the government fully restored. We can't achieve
that goal right now. What we can do right now is to
address the most urgent consequences of the
government shutdown. And we will do that, and we
believe today we've got some sense of cooperation
from the leaders in trying to address those most
urgent issues. I cannot predict for you now when the
continuing resolution or full funding or full
appropriations measures will pass that will fully
restore government. But I do know the President is
committed to working towards satisfactory solutions
that deal with the most urgent consequences of the
shutdown. 

Q But does the President believe that a CR will be
passed before there is a final agreement on the
budget deal? 

MR. MCCURRY: The President doesn't rule out that
possibility.
 
Q Mike, a follow-up --
 
Q Why?
 
Q -- do you think that federal workers will get paid?
Some of them have been told to start filing for
unemployment next week.
 
MR. MCCURRY: The one positive thing that came out of
the meeting is it was very clearly on the part of
everyone in the room concern about the status of
federal workers who are furloughed, federal workers
who are working as excepted employees who are not
going to get paid until there is funding. And also --
well, those are the two categories. And they -- in
both categories, there seems to be willingness on the
part of the leadership to explore remedies that would
allow them to be paid despite the shutdown. And that
was encouraging. We don't have an answer to that
problem yet, but there is some agreement that they
will look for ways to try to get paychecks to those
people, especially during this holiday season. 

Q Armey has said that they're not going to have any
votes at least until Wednesday evening, as they were
shutting down on the House floor. Given that you
wouldn't quarrel with the notion that the government
is going to stay shut down at a minimum, at least
until Wednesday night, or at least until Thursday
morning? 

MR. MCCURRY: I would not quarrel with that. I mean,
and he knows the House schedule better. That's
exactly the situation we're in. They're not going to,
despite the efforts by Democrats on the Hill to pass
a continuing resolution today, that's not going to
happen.
 
Q Mike, to follow on, do they go ahead, though, and
apply for unemployment, which will cost the
government even more? 

MR. MCCURRY: They will have to take the best advice
they can get from the Office of Personnel Management,
and they will know best the situation. Federal
workers should contact personnel advisers at their
agencies or look for notices from OPM on how to
handle those circumstances.
 
Q But are they all furloughed? I mean, how do they --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, there are 470,000 federal workers
who are working now. The federal government is
incurring a legal obligation to pay them. And what we
agree at the very least is that we ought to figure
out how to get paychecks to those people since we are
legally obligated to pay them one way or another. We
also are very concerned about people who are
furloughed. And we encourage that the Republican
leadership on the Hill have pledged to make sure
those people do get their pay restored. And we will
look for ways that we can do that, even advance full
appropriations or a continuing. There's no -- there
was no answer or solution to that problem today, but
there is some willingness to explore a way to deal
with that situation.
 
Q I don't want to go over old ground, but what you
may be hearing from us is you say there's a very
discernable sense of urgency, and yet here both sides
are taking several days off, and no meeting scheduled
until next Friday. And that's hard for us to put the
two and two together and --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, there clearly are some divisions
that exist here. You've been hearing them expressed
publicly all day. And having meetings throughout the
weekend that weren't going to resolve those
differences wouldn't be a fruitful exercise. But
they've designed a process here that they believe
will work. This is the one that worked yesterday, and
they believe it will work now. 

Q Were there any food fights?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't think they served any beverages
or refreshments.
 
Q When you say they believe, do you mean the
principals believe?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Yes, as they say in their statement,
they believe that the process that they used
yesterday to reconcile some of these issues worked.
And they believe that if they try to employ it for
the larger issues, they might get somewhere.
 
Q Mike, what's next up on the table? I mean, I assume
you're moving from the easiest or least controversial
issues to the tougher --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Substantively, I can't -- I can't answer
that question substantively.
 
Q Just one final process question. Did the form of
the discussions that have occurred so far suggest
that there's a kind of a component-by-component,
issue-by-issue approach to this budget in which,
while everybody may have a complete budget on the
table, those complete budgets become less relevant as
this process goes forward?
 
MR. MCCURRY: That's a very good question, Brit. I
can't -- since I did not participate in all of the
meetings and especially the Oval Office one, I can't
answer that completely. I can tell you that the
central elements of this budget discussion are now so
well-known to the participants in these discussions
that they can look at individual elements from some
of the different proposals out there -- whether it's
Breaux-Chafee, whether it's coalition, whether it's
Senate Democrat, whether it's the President's plan,
whether it's the original congressional resolution --
and know, based on what they -- take the element,
look at it, know, based on whatever the number is how
it would fit into an overall final agreement. 

So it's an interesting question and it probably is a
useful observation. There may be, if there's a final
agreement to be made, it's going to draw on a lot of
the different ideas that are out there.
 
Q Can I follow up on that Mike?
 
Q Is the President still going to pre-tape the radio
address?
 
Q There was a sense at the beginning of the week that
if this was bumped up to the principals --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Radio? We're going to do it live now. Do
we know the subject yet? Budget. 
 
Q If I could ask you a question to follow on Brit --
There was a sense at the beginning of the week that
if this was bumped up to the principals -- the
President, congressional leaders -- they took over,
they might be able to resolve it faster. Is it the
feeling now that the process you're talking about
would -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I don't know that I accept that
characterization. I don't believe that I've ever said
that. I don't know that anyone here at the White
House has ever said that. I believe it's been said
elsewhere that if the principals would get involved,
they might be able to resolve these issues quicker.
But that was always --
 
Q Well, they said --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think that's correct. But I don't know
that that's ever been entirely clear.
 
Q Is it your feeling that the process that involves
the Chief of Staff and the chairs of the committees,
the process that they're developing works better?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, the point I'm making is that it
worked yesterday. We had an agreement -- remember, we
had an agreement to conduct some face-to-face talks
without preconditions, and that process failed
because it was not acceptable to a portion of the
House Republican caucus. Now we've got a process.
That process seemed to work yesterday in narrowing
some differences. And it's encouraging that they now
are going to employ this process as they work through
next week and then to prepare for the meeting -- 

Q What's the process?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It's the one that's defined in the
statement. And we've been through that four or five
times already. 

Q One thing you haven't said in the good meeting is
whether or not the principals themselves made any of
the decisions they were talking about having to make
going into the meeting. Everybody talked about making
tough decisions. Did they make any decisions today or
just agree on --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, the toughest decisions are those
that are dealing with the most controversial items in
the budget. And as you know, they didn't attempt to
resolve those today. 

Okay, anything else?
 
Q Yes, there's one more important point on
contractors. Contractors are not getting paid. What
happens -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I can't help you at that level of
detail. 

THE PRESS: Thank you.

-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE: Catfish
processing -- Highlights

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL
STATISTICS SERVICE: Catfish processing -- Highlights
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Estimates refer to November 1994 and 1995. Catfish
Processing Down 5 Percent Farm-raised catfish
processed during November totaled 34.1 million pounds
round weight, down 5 percent from November 1994. The
average price paid to producers was 78 cents per
pound for November 1995, unchanged from the last two
months and 1 cent above a year ago. Net pounds of
processed fish sold during November totaled 16.7
million pounds, an increase of 2 percent from the
comparable month in 1994.

Sales of fresh fish, at 6.91 million pounds, were up
6 percent from November 1994 and represented 41
percent of total sales. Frozen fish sales, at 9.77
million pounds, were down 2 percent from a year ago
and accounted for the remaining 59 percent of total
fish sales. Sales of whole fish represented 24
percent of the total, fillets accounted for 54
percent, and the remaining 22 percent were mostly,
steaks, nuggets, and value added products. The
November 1995 average price received by processors
for total fresh fish was $2.20 per pound, down 5
cents from last year. Prices for fresh whole fish
decreased 7 cents per pound to $1.63.

Prices for fresh fillets decreased 1 cent to $2.90
per pound. Total frozen fish averaged $2.48 per
pound, unchanged from November 1994. Prices for
frozen whole fish decreased 7 cents per pound to
$1.95, while frozen fillets at $2.82 per pound were
down 6 cents from $2.88 a year ago. Freshwater
catfish imports during September 1995 totaled 402
thousand pounds, up 25 percent from the 322 thousand
pounds imported the previous year. Ninety- six
percent of imports were from Brazil, with the
remaining 4 percent coming from Canada and Vietnam.
No exports were reported for September 1995. October
data were not available at the time of this release
due to Government furlough. If available they will be
included in the release on January 23, 1996. Import
and export data are compiled by the U.S. Bureau of
Census.

Catfish Processing Estimates Survey Procedures: 
Survey data for catfish processing are collected from
approximately 30 processors. All participating
processors must meet the minimum criteria of having a
capacity to process at least 2,000 pounds live weight
of catfish per 8-hour shift. The survey is conducted
entirely by NASS Headquarter's staff in Washington,
D.C. NASS field offices, however, are responsible for
keeping Headquarters informed of any new processing
operations in their state to ensure that the survey
coverage is as complete as possible. Processors are
contacted either by mail or telephone. Diligent
effort is made to ensure that all operations are
accounted for in the estimate. Estimation Procedures: 

The "Catfish Processing" report refers strictly to
farm-raised fish and excludes wild, captured fish.
Prior to summarization, questionnaires are compared
with the previous month's reports for comparable
placement of data, reasonable price levels, and
reasonable inventory carryover given the sales and
processing totals reported. Estimates are made for
those processors whose reports are not available in
time to be included in the release. These plants are
identified by an asterisk on page 5 of this release.
Estimates are normally based on the processor's
previous report and current conditions. Published
totals are a straight summation of the individual
reports and estimated data. Price items are weighted
by the associated volumes to compute weighted average
prices.

The published price for total whole fish, however,
reflects an adjustment to the round and gutted only
price to bring it to an equivalent dressed weight
price. If a plant uses a fiscal accounting system,
proration is used to convert reported data to a
calendar month basis. Only national level estimates
are published due to the limited number of plants
involved. Generally, individual items are not
published if there are less than three plants
reporting, or if any one plant has 60 percent or more
of the total.

One unique feature of the "Catfish Processing" report
is the listing of cooperating processors by name on
each month's release. This feature originally was
used to solicit industry cooperation in maintaining
coverage, but it has continued because of the
processors' overall acceptance of this policy. Import
and export data for frozen catfish fillets, which are
compiled by the Department of Commerce, are also
included in this report. Reliability: Catfish
processing estimates are based on a census of all
known active processors and, therefore, have no
sampling variability. However, estimates may be
subject to errors such as omissions, duplication, and
mistakes in reporting, recording, and processing of
the data. These errors are minimized through strict
quality controls in the edit and summarization
process, and a careful review of all reported data
for consistency and reasonableness.

Revision Policy:
Revisions may be necessary following a review of late
reports received from plants. Revisions of less than
2 percent of the existing published levels of any
category will normally not be made.

Definitions Used For Catfish Processing:
Average Price Paid to Producers - Refers to the price
of fish delivered to the processing plant door. Price
includes charges for any services provided by the
processing plant, such as seining and hauling, but
does not include any adjustments based on year-end
settlements.

Fillets - Boned sides of the fish, cut lengthwise
away from the backbone.
Fresh Fish - Fish intended for immediate consumption.
Also referred to as ice-packed.

Frozen Fish - Fish which are individually quick
frozen and glazed (IQF) or individually bagged and
bulk frozen.

Nuggets - Small fillets cut from below the rib
section of the fish. Usually includes breading or
added ingredients.

Round & Gutted Only - Fish with no processing done or
viscera only removed.

Round Weight - A term for fish live weight.

Steaks - Cross-section cuts from larger dressed fish.

Strips - Finger size pieces of fish cut from fillets.
Usually includes breading or added ingredients.

Whole Dressed - Weight of whole fish with only head,
viscera, and skin removed. Generally, 60 percent of
the live weight remains as dressed fish. Processing
data were compiled in cooperation with the following
processors:
* America's Catch Guidry Catfish Processors, Inc.
Amite River Industries Harvest Select Aqua Farm
Catfish, Inc. Lake's Farm Raised Catfish, Inc.
Carolina Classics Catfish, Inc. Pride of the Pond
Confish, Inc. Prime Line Catfish Co. Corbin Fish Farm
Seabrook Seafood, Inc. Delta Pride Catfish, Inc.
Simmons Farm-Raised Dorey Fish Co. Southern Farm Fish
Processors Farm Fresh Catfish Co. Southern Pride Fish
Breeders of Idaho Southfresh Farms Franklin Catfish
Superior Fish Processors Freshwater Farms, Inc.

* Estimated The next "Catfish Processing" report will
be released at 3 p.m. ET on January 23, 1996. The
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
prohibits discrimination in its programs on the basis
of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age,

-COMPUSERVE: CompuServe membership hits 4 million
worldwide

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-COMPUSERVE: CompuServe
membership hits 4 million worldwide -- Heading into
the holidays, online service expects unprecedented
growth to continue
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- CompuServe Incorporated, the
industry s most extensive online information service
provider and the largest Internet access provider in
the world, today announced that its worldwide
membership to the CompuServe Information Service has
surpassed 4 million individuals. With more than
200,000 new members joining the service each month
and local dial-up access in more than 140 countries,
CompuServe officials are optimistic about prospects
in the new year.

New computer owners are realizing the value of the
online service and the Internet, said Bob Massey,
CompuServe s president and chief executive officer. A
computer that is not connected to cyberspace is like
a television without sound and color. People know
they need to be online, and CompuServe offers the
best value in the industry.

We are in an excellent position to continue our
unprecedented growth, Massey said. We have the most
extensive, most reliable global information network
in the world, and we are the world s largest Internet
access provider. We offer the deepest, broadest
content for new computer users and online veterans
alike. Plus, we keep making the service better. We re
adding outstanding content like TIME magazine,
exciting events like Mick Jagger online with voice
and video, and localized information for our members
around the world. 

Traditionally, the holiday season is one of the
biggest times of year for member acquisition in the
online industry. This year, more than 3 million
people are expected to get new computers. Our goal is
to reach 5 million members next spring, and we will
reach that goal, Massey said. For just $9.95 a month,
CompuServe members get 5 hours of access to more than
3,000 services, plus the Internet. Additional hours
are just $2.95 each. This announcement comes just one
day after CompuServe surpassed 500,000 members in
Europe, with 200,000 in the United Kingdom alone.
CompuServe is an H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) company.

Founded in 1955, H&R Block is a diversified services
company and the world's leader in tax preparation and
online information services. H&R Block Tax Services
handled almost one in every seven returns filed with
the Internal Revenue Service in 1995, serving 17.1
million taxpayers in more than 9,500 offices
worldwide. CompuServe operates the most comprehensive
online network in the world, providing services to
nearly 900 corporate accounts and more than 4.0
million users in more than 140 countries.

-NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ETHICS: NIE claim theres no
excuse for not preventing police corruption

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF
ETHICS: NIE claim theres no excuse for not preventing
police corruption -- Biggest problem is city hall,
not bad cops
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295

Orlando - Neal Trautman, Executive Director of The
National Institute of Ethics, states today that there
is no excuse for not preventing police corruption.
The true root cause of most of the scandals seen
throughout the nation today does not even lie within
the police department. In fact, the vast majority of
law enforcement officers are victims, not villains. 

Contrary to what the media has portrayed, the New
Orleans Police Department is not filled with greedy,
corrupt, drug dealing cops. The 100 officers I met
are some of the most sincere, dedicated officers I
have ever had the honor to instruct. The officers
here are not villains. They are victims. 

Political Cause #1 - Pressuring departments to hire
new officers without conducting an effective
background investigation. Many agencies, having had a
scandal, have been forced to hire people without a
thorough background investigation. History has taught
us that this usually becomes a "root cause" for
future corruption.

In addition to forcing the department to hire
officers without an effective background
investigation, other political influences led to the
destruction of their law enforcement. Money is
usually a very poor way to motivate employees. It
ceases to motivate people the moment they receive it
and often results in decreasing levels of dedication.

Political Cause #2 - Not supporting officers with a
fair salary. When officers are not paid enough to
support their families, common sense dictates that a
small percentage of normally good officers will give
in to the stress of being poor and the temptation of
easy drug money being so prevalent.

Political Cause #3 - Officers are understaffed and
overworked. Months and years of such pressure often
means that their original motivation of sincerity
evolves into the feeling that they are being used and
manipulated. 

Political Cause #4 - Politicians take actions that
demoralize officers. Unfair salaries, being
understaffed, not having enough time to provide
effective training, seldom being told that you are
appreciated; all create an internal culture that is
negative, cynical, suspicious and resentful. This, in
turn, leads to employees committing unethical acts. 

Political Cause #5 - Public officials created an
"internal culture" that causes unethical acts. Role
modeling is the greatest way to influence anyone's
behavior. When elected officials role model dirty
politics and hidden agendas, the police department
will usually have the same degree of shamefull
politics and hidden agendas which lead to corruption. 

The Solution:
1. Provide effective leadership training to replace
dirty politics with fair, respectful leadership.

2. Implement state-of-the-art, video and audio tape,
ehtical dilemma simulation training.

3. Implement an administrative process that prevents
unethical acts as opposed to simply reacting after
corruption occurs. 

Training is the vehicle that leads to the prevention
of scandals. The elected officials who created
circumstances that led to these events may have done
so because they didn't appreciate the consequences of
their actions. If so, then their education should
prevent the continued betrayal of integrity.

for Environmental Management, U.S. Dept of Energy

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- President Clinton names
Alvin L. Alm, Assistant Secretary for Environmental
Management, U.S. Department of Energy
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:271295

President Clinton today announced the nomination of
Alvin L. Alm of Virginia, as Assistant Secretary for
Environmental Management at the U.S. Department of
Energy.

Montenegro pursuant to Executive Order No. 12808 of
May 30, 1992, Executive Order No. 12810 of June 5,

WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Memorandum of Justification for Presidential
Certification Regarding the Modification of the
Application of U.S. Sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro

The Serbia and Montenegro sanctions program is a key
element of the President's policy aimed at bringing
about a settlement of the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia. The United States has continued to strive
during the past three years to ensure strong
enforcement of the sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro. This has maintained the effectiveness of
the sanctions program, motivating the Serbian
leadership to come to the negotiating table. 

The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, signed in Paris on December 14,
1995, produced agreement among the warring parties to
establish a single state of Bosnia-Herzegovina within
its pre-1992 borders. Bosnia will be governed by a
central government with constitutionally enumerated
powers over internal and international affairs and
will contain two entities. Along with resolution of
many thorny territorial issues, the parties agreed to
regional stabilization measures as well as to protect
human rights and fundamental freedoms and to hold
elections within the next year.
 
The agreement required more than two weeks of
intensive negotiations in Dayton. During the talks,
all sides were forced to make concessions on a range
of deeply held issues. The likelihood of sanctions
suspension was one of the key factors contributing to
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's agreement at
the talks. As the representative of Bosnian Serb
interests at Dayton, Milosevic's role was crucial in
reaching agreement. Sanctions relief was clearly
anticipated as a consequence of accord, and has
already taken the form of the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions 1021 and 1022, adopted by the
Council on November 22, 1995.
 
Before agreeing to sanctions suspension, we insisted
on a credible reimposition mechanism to ensure no
backsliding on the commitments made by the Serbs. If
the IFOR commander or High Representative determines
that the FRY or the Bosnian Serbs are not meeting
their obligations under the Peace Agreement, economic
sanctions may again go into effect against the Serbs.

Accordingly, we plan to leave the Sanctions
Assistance Mission infrastructure and monitors in
place.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office of the Press Secretary --
Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:311295 12:40 P.M. EST

MR. MCCURRY: Let me just tell you what's going on
right now. The President of the United States is
thanking individually the various members of the
budget staffs that have been supporting the
administration team during these discussions, folks
from Health and Human Services, Treasury, OMB, the
National Economic Council, Mr. Panetta's staff, those
that have done extraordinary work over the last week
and, as you'll be able to tell in a moment, have got
an extraordinary amount of work today and tomorrow.
 
The budget discussions today led to an agreement by
the principals to instruct staff to really summarize
the discussions they've been able to have over the
last several days, which resulted in exploring the
differences that exist in a range of areas from
income support programs to welfare, to tax issues, to
health care finance issues -- to really summarize
those discussions and draw together the places where
there appeared to be some agreement between the
Republican side, the administration and the
congressional Democrats; and then, also set forth in
more precise detail the areas that there clearly are
still differences. 
 
That will lead to a meeting that will happen here at
the White House Tuesday evening, either late
afternoon or early evening -- I suspect more early
evening -- between the budget principals. They will
reconvene, review the discussion document that is
prepared by staff over the next day and a half, and
they will begin, I think they all believe, the more
serious discussions of tradeoffs that exist on the
large issues that will be fundamental to a final
agreement. But they all clearly remain committed to
this process and the process is working. They are
making progress because they are defining the areas
of agreement and disagreement more clearly. And the
President's satisfied that they're making progress. 
 
The President also strongly encouraged the
congressional leaders to find a way to pass some
measure that would restore federal workers to their
rightful places of employment. He also wants them to
be paid, but he understands that those are -- there
are different points of view on that issue. He hopes
they can resolve some of these issues.
 
Q What's his point of view on that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He believes they should be working, they
should be paid, and the government should be fully
open, as he said over and over and over again.
 
Q Any suggestion, any hint that they were close to
working some deal today?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They worked on it a lot. There was
considerable side-bar discussion during this meeting
between House and Senate staffers, and Senate
staffers between the Republican and Democratic side,
and that will lead to whatever action occurs on the
Hill shortly.
 
Q Did Dole and Daschle say they would --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm not going to comment on the business
that they need to do themselves on the Hill.
 
Q Mike, Tony Blankley said that there was one area
that was not covered in the walk-through. What is
that area? He said it was one major area.
 
MR. MCCURRY: I suspect -- can you run and check on
this? I suspect the answer to that is Medicaid. But
Barry will run that down.
 
Q They didn't act on that at all?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They spent a lot of time discussing
Medicare. The almost entire discussion today was
devoted to Medicare and different options. And what
the President and congressional leaders asked for is
something that really defines more clearly what the
policy choices are in Medicare given the respective
positions of the various budget proposals that are
out there.
 
Q Mike, in the event that there is some kind of deal
in the Senate, will there be any briefing here on
what -- the technicalities of what that means for the
government?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, if there's a final agreement in
Congress that would restore federal workers to their
jobs, OMB staff will be available to talk about how
that will affect any restart activities that they
have. But we'll direct that to OMB because they'll be
in the best place to analyze that.
 
Q Mike, can you confirm that as of yesterday they had
an agreement in principle to at least a packet of
savings of $100 billion in social spending?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that would be -- that requires
some rough eyeballing that I don't think you can
really do under the circumstances. There are
different ways that you can look at the categories of
things they've done here. There are some areas where
there are clear agreements and they should be able to
rather quickly write the legislative language that
would lock in some of the things they've agreed to. 
 
There are other areas where it's a little fuzzier,
where there are some different options that exist and
you could get a range of savings depending on how you
calculate it. But my guess is -- I saw that comment
in one of the stories today; I think that was
probably a rough eyeball guess that someone made that
would try to put a numeric value on some of the work
they've done. Frankly, I'd caution people here
against using that kind of calculation because the
ranges are so large when you look at the big ticket
issues. There could be considerably more in savings,
depending on how you judge the progress they made on
some of these discussions. 

Q What are the differences on Medicaid without going
into detail? Are they financial or are they
philosophical? 

MR. MCCURRY: Both. 
 
MR. TOIV: Medicaid is the issue, but it was discussed
in the context of block grants, the whole block grant
issue, but not separately as a --
 
MR. MCCURRY: The fundamental dispute there is the
guarantee of health care coverage and the federal
entitlement and what happens if you block-grant it.
Now, that's a large issue and one of the issues
covered particularly as they dealt with domestic
discretionary spending, which they did both yesterday
afternoon and yesterday evening.
 
So I think that they've touched on that aspect of
Medicaid, but they haven't gone through all the --
they haven't gone through it in the same detail and
precision on that issue as they have some of the
other areas that they've looked at. Now, that will be
covered by some of the staff work. They are going to
take some look at issues related to that as they work
over the next day and a half. They'll be preparing
some side-by-side analyses of how the different
issues play out.
 
Q Are they working from the same base numbers? 

MR. MCCURRY: They're working from the same
calculation of what the budget impact is based on CBO
numbers, yes.
 
Q What's the point of all these hours of walking
through this? It seems to me we all know what the big
differences are.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that's not necessarily true. I
mean, everyone knows what the big differences are and
what the big numbers look like on a single sheet of
paper. But remember, every one of those large numbers
is premised on fundamental policy decisions that have
a great deal of nuance and complexity associated with
them. And I think it's encouraging and the principals
are encouraged at how detailed these discussions have
been. They have looked item by item at these policy
implications of the large numbers. 
 
I think many Americans think, well, gee, you get
together in the room and you split the difference in
a simple arithmetic. That's not policymaking.
Policymaking requires attention to the detail that
underscores each of those numbers. And that's the
work they've been doing. 
 
Now, based on the very intense discussions they've
had, the staff can now summarize in a much more
detailed fashion what the specifics of a legislative
approach to a final budget agreement would look like.
That's encouraging because it means if they do reach
an agreement on a final budget package, the work of
assembling that and putting it in legislative
language would be considerably easier based on the
discussions they've had here. In a sense, one
participant compared this to something like a
conference committee on the Hill; they're doing much
the same thing they would do in a House-Senate
conference committee, looking at big issues,
discussing the policy differences, and then making it
possible for staff to write what amounts to a
conference report.
 
Q Are they getting a sense of how far away they are
from reaching some kind of final agreement? Are they
getting a sense of the kind of time frame they're
looking at?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They could be so near or so far away
because it will depend in part on what types of
tradeoffs they make on the large issues. They have
not attempted to take the big issues, as Hillary just
said that everyone knows are out there, and reconcile
them. They've approached this from saying, let's
narrow as closely as we can the differences that
exist and define better what types of tradeoffs will
exist once you've reached those big decisions. But I
suspect that by Tuesday night when they meet again,
they're going to start moving to those more
fundamental issues that will have to be embraced if
there's going to be a final agreement, which is why
right now it's impossible to say one way or another
whether they will actually reach an agreement.
 
Q -- an agreement in the order in which they'll take
up the big issues? Because, as you've said in the
past, you would prefer that the spending and the
final decisions on spending determine the size of a
tax cut.
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't believe -- they have given a
list of specifics to the staff to address, but I
can't say for certain that the principals will work
through those issues in the same order -- that they
go from income maintenance through health care
finance issues to discretionary spending issues to
revenue issues. But I don't guarantee that that's the
order in which they will be addressed on Tuesday
night.
 
Q Would you say that they have finished stage one,
the walk-through process, then and are getting -- are
heading into stage two, the decision-making process?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They finished the walk-through process
during the course of the day yesterday, with the
exception of the more detailed discussion of Medicare
that they wished to have today. They are now
preparing for what amounts to the tradeoffs that will
have to occur.
 
Q Is the President ready to compromise and trade off? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, the President is ready to continue
to discuss these issues in good faith.
 
Q In what context have they discussed Social
Security?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It has been related to many of their
discussions of health care finance, Medicare in
particular, and related in some respects to their
AFDC discussions since they're all covered by the
various titles of the Social Security Act.
 
Q Did they talk about it in terms of --
 
MR. MCCURRY: They've had -- I believe they had a very
brief discussion of the CPI issue, and there was not
instant resolution of that.
 
Q You said that there's a day-and-a-half discussion
beginning on Tuesday evening that concerns --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm sorry, it was a day and a half for
work now. The staff is going to be working -- one of
the reasons the President wanted to spend some time
with our courageous and noble staffers is they are
now going to work for the rest of the day today and
they're apparently going to start about 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow and they'll be able to work all day long
tomorrow. That's not going to be any -- we're not
going to arrange any press coverage of that, that's
just the work they're going to be doing, both
informal and probably getting together at various
points.
 
Q Going back to -- how would you characterize the
agreement so far money-wise? You won't say $100
billion. How would you characterize it -- issue-wise,
money-wise?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they've made good progress. It's a
large sum of money, but it's not satisfactory --
wouldn't be sufficient to reach the balanced budget
goals. That would require some additional
decision-making that obviously wouldn't happen before
Tuesday night.
 
Q Can you offer any color or anecdotal details of
today's meeting?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they continued -- we do the best
on food more than anything else. (Laughter.) They had
the traditional congressional meeting donuts back
today, for some reason. We were on a health food kick
yesterday, but today -- normally, when the bipartisan
congressional leadership meet with the President they
have wonderful donuts available. And they reappeared
and quickly disappeared during the meeting today.
 
There was a lot of kibitzing. As the result of being
together over the couple of days, there were moments
where the partisan sides are able to tease each other
or get little quips in on each other from time to
time, and there was a fair amount of that going on. I
don't have a specific example of that that I can
think of off my head, but there's some of what I
would describe as general ribbing back and forth.
 
The Speaker was concerned that we all make sure that
--he was concerned about a question he got in the
pool session this morning and he was nervous that we
not over-interpret those -- the appearance on the
Evans and Novak Show. Some of us watched that and
some of us managed to stay awake through it.
(Laughter.)
 
Q As he shouted Ron down -- did they discuss that? As
he shouted Ron down, did he and the President then
discuss that? 

MR. MCCURRY: No, they didn't. They didn't, although
the Speaker reached that with some of us and we
didn't take any offense at his remarks.
 
Q You didn't take any offense at the remarks at all? 

MR. MCCURRY: No. Compared to other things that he
says, they -- (laughter.)
 
Q Dole and Gingrich have said before that they see
Wednesday as sort of a deadline; they're going to be
adjourning Congress and reopening Congress. Is there
any sense that you'll know by Wednesday that you're
going to have a deal or you're not going to have a
deal?
 
MR. MCCURRY: You mean on this question of federal
workers and --
 
Q No, no, no. No, over the budget deal, the budget
negotiations.
 
Q The CR would expire -- I mean, they're saying that
you're supposed to have it finished in the first
session, which is --
 
MR. MCCURRY: In the statutory and in the first
session is on Wednesday, and clearly one reason
they're meeting Tuesday night is with that deadline
in mind. But I wouldn't predict at this point it
would be possible to get an outline of agreement by
Wednesday. Certainly everyone hopes to get an
agreement on a balanced budget as quickly as
possible.
 
Q I watched the back-and-forth there. The money that
we're not supposed to put a numerical figure on
that's not necessarily $100 billion, but is something
-- what does that concern? 

MR. MCCURRY: I made that so absolutely, magnificently
impenetrable, there would be no way you could answer
that. (Laughter.) Look, the reason is as you look
through these issues it could be -- they've got --
$100 billion is a rough estimate of some of the work
that were in the so-called tier two issues that were
being handled at the budget advisors level. That's
where it has come from.
 
Now, if you look at some of the other issue areas --
the so-called tier three issues -- where they've
identified some agreement in policy approaches,
they've got considerably more than that, I would
guess. But I can't put a dollar figure on that, nor
should I, because it's subject to further discussion.
And in any event, as we've said all along again, they
have to get agreement on a whole package before it
all matters.
 
Q Tier two is what? Tier two is nonentitlement,
discretionary --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Tier one -- they've defined issues as
they worked at both the staff and budget advisor
issues as tier one, tier two, tier three issues, as
they rank order some of the policy questions. And
just, for example, in the area of revenues I think
there were, what, Barry -- 70 separate issues that
they needed to examine.
 
Now, they range from -- tier one would be something
which there is a common approach both in the balanced
budget act, in the President's approach on policy
terms that's reflected in some of the other
discussion documents they've looked at, whether it's
Breaux-Chafee, whether it's Daschle, whether it's the
coalition budget, that there's some commonality
approach and they think they can lock in language
that would satisfy everybody. So, in other words, a
done deal; it looks like that will be easy to do. 

Tier two are areas where there are differences, but
they're fairly close. They can be significant policy
issues, but there are ways in which you could bridge
the gaps. And they concentrated a lot of work on the
tier two issues. And I think that's where they found
agreement that would take you beyond this mythical
$100 billion that was reported somewhere today.
 
And then tier three issues are the more fundamental
differences that really are central to getting final
agreement. And as I say, those are ones in which they
agree to sharpen up the discussion by really looking
for how you define and analyze the tradeoffs that
would have to happen in order to reconcile those two
or three issues. But that's work that will have to go
on on Tuesday. 

Q Does it have to be balanced down to a penny? I
mean, it has to be actually -- the numbers have to be
coinciding totally?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they -- it's more -- the more
important issue and then more of these discussions
have been around the policy has to be agreed to, how
do you -- what's the policy going to be.
 
Q Are tax cuts on the table?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Tax relief for working families has
always been on the table.
 
Q I didn't ask that. I asked would tax cuts -- 

Q When this is all finished, for each of the major
topics they talked about will there be a figure for
each of seven fiscal years that will be the limit
leading to a zero deficit? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, when it's all said and done and
they have a final agreement they will have a document
that then can be scored by CBO that could produce
that type of analysis, sure. 

Q Going back to -- can you characterize at all this
-- without the figure, what kind of subject areas
there are agreement? How will you characterize the
areas they have agreement on? You don't want to do it
money-wise. Subject-wise, anything besides --
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, that's a -- I mean, substantively
we're not -- that just is more fuel for a lot of
incorrect speculation. And as the Speaker made the
point today, that it has helped them that they've not
tried to score points in the public discussion of
these deliberations.
 
Q I just want to clarify -- if, for purpose of
discussion the President is talking about CBO
assumptions in all of these discussions, is he then
acquiescing to CBO's growth predictions, its interest
rate predictions?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Not necessarily. I mean, that might be
that the issue of how you define assumption, will
look at assumptions -- and more importantly, how you
decided when certain budget features would trigger on
or trigger off.
 
Q I'm sorry, could you run that past me one more
time? You're saying he is not in agreement with the
CBO -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I said that -- the question is about
assumptions, has he agreed to lock in the CBO
assumptions. I think that's still an area that the
principals could explore as they look at issues like
when certain budget features trigger on, trigger off,
how you measure that and how you look at impact. For
purposes of these discussions they have agreed to a
CBO evaluation on what the budget options are. I'm
not going to get any more specific than what I just
said, although I just gave you a very good hint.
 
Q In talking about Medicare today and trying to talk
about their differences of viewpoint on medical
inflation, what are they -- whose numbers are they
utilizing?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, for an informed discussion they
use -- they were relying on budget experts at CBO, at
HHS, they were looking at different types of
analysis.
 
Q Oh, this is the last tier thing where if you save
money on discretionary in the last years then you
have to trigger off, based on if you beat the CBO
assumptions?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, trigger-on, trigger-off is an
aspect of various budget proposals that are out
there. There are some in the coalitions, there is one
in the President's most recent offer. 

Q What's he going to do at Hilton Head?
 
MR. MCCURRY: In Hilton Head he's looking forward to
seeing his friends, first and foremost; spending time
with his family; having dinner with his friends
tonight and spending some time outdoors tomorrow.
It's been raining --
 
Q What time do you expect --
 
Q Mike, will he say anything on going out to the
helicopter?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I think he wants to just get down
there and see his friends and have New Year's Eve
with people he's spent New Year's Eve with for the
last 12 years.
 
All right, happy New Year, everybody. Have a safe and
prosperous 1996.
 
Q Did they all wish each other a happy New Year? 

MR. MCCURRY: They did. Actually, they said goodbye to
each other, happy New Year to each other. There was a
little bit of discussion about travel plans for
everybody. I think, as you know, Senator Dole after
the senate session is going up to New Hampshire. 

Q Did the President wish him well?
 
MR. MCCURRY: There was some good natured discussion.
He's going for the first eve festivities, or
something like that. I would say that there continues
to be a good atmosphere in these discussions, but
everybody is realistic enough to know that there are
sharp differences that still exist and that there's a
lot of hard work ahead.
 
Q Any idea when they're going to actually be done
with any sort of an agreement on the seven-year plan
-- to they have a time -- can't do it by Wednesday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I think -- I think that everyone
understands -- the President is very cognizant of the
Speaker's concern about doing this within the
statutory calendar of the first session. In fact, the
President, at several points when it was suggested
there's going to be a lot of work that would have to
be done to get this discussion document together,
that it might not be done by Tuesday, the President
admonished everybody again and said it was very hard
to ask people to work on the holiday. But that
because of the Speaker's concern about January 3rd
and that date, that it was important to have a
meeting during the day on Tuesday, even if it had to
be late in the day. So we understand the importance
of that and that's why everyone is committed to
trying to work this through as quickly as they can.
 
Q Do you think there will be meetings between the
principals Wednesday, Thursday -- every day until
there's -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I can't predict. I'm taking it a day at
a day. I'll tell you what I know, they plan to meet
Tuesday night and we'll see where we go from there.
 
Q So they have until midnight Wednesday night,
Thursday morning -- or is that --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that's not -- I want to make it
clear that's not a -- that's a date that's important
to the Speaker, for reasons that the Speaker can tell
you because it relates to the statutory deadline of
the first session, and it also relates to the
continuing resolution issue. But I think we need --
you know, from our point of view we just need to
continue to work to try to resolve the issues and do
it as expeditiously as possible.
 
Q Is it midnight Tuesday or midnight Wednesday -- 

MR. MCCURRY: You should ask the House Speaker. It's
their deadline, not ours. 
 
Thank you.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: The returning without approval of
H.R.1530

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- The returning without
approval of H.R.1530
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

To the House of Representatives:
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R.
1530, the "National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 1996." 

H.R. 1530 would unacceptably restrict my ability to
carry out this country's national security objectives
and substantially interfere with the implementation
of key national defense programs. It would also
restrict the President's authority in the conduct of
foreign affairs and as Commander in Chief, raising
serious constitutional concerns.
 
First, the bill requires deployment by 2003 of a
costly missile defense system able to defend all 50
States from a long-range missile threat that our
Intelligence Community does not foresee in the coming
decade. By forcing such an unwarranted deployment
decision now, the bill would waste tens of billions
of dollars and force us to commit prematurely to a
specific technological option. It would also likely
require a multiple-site architecture that cannot be
accommodated within the terms of the existing ABM
Treaty. By setting U.S. policy on a collision course
with the ABM Treaty, the bill would jeopardize
continued Russian implementation of the START I
Treaty as well as Russian ratification of START II --
two treaties that will significantly lower the threat
to U.S. national security, reducing the number of
U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear warheads by
two-thirds from Cold War levels. The missile defense
provisions would also jeopardize our current efforts
to agree on an ABM/TMD (Theater Missile Defense)
demarcation with the Russian Federation.
 
Second, the bill imposes restrictions on the
President's ability to conduct contingency operations
essential to national security. Its restrictions on
funding of contingency operations and the requirement
to submit a supplemental appropriations request
within a time certain in order to continue a
contingency operation are unwarranted restrictions on
a President's national security and foreign policy
prerogatives. Moreover, by requiring a Presidential
certification to assign U.S. 

Armed Forces under United Nations operational or
tactical control, the bill infringes on the
President's constitutional authority as Commander in
Chief.
 
Third, H.R. 1530 contains other objectionable
provisions that would adversely affect the ability of
the Defense Department to carry out national defense
programs or impede the Department's ability to manage
its day-to-day operations. For example, the bill
includes counterproductive certification requirements
for the use of Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat
Reduction (CTR) funds and restricts use of funds for
individual CTR programs. 
 
Other objectionable provisions eliminate funding for
the Defense Enterprise Fund; restrict the retirement
of U.S. strategic delivery systems; slow the pace of
the Defense Department's environmental cleanup
efforts; and restrict Defense's ability to execute
disaster relief, demining, and military-to-military
contact programs. The bill also directs the
procurement of specific submarines at specific
shipyards although that is not necessary for our
military mission to maintain the Nation's industrial
base.

H.R. 1530 also contains two provisions that would
unfairly affect certain service members. One requires
medically unwarranted discharge procedures for
HIV-positive service members. In addition, I remain
very concerned about provisions that would restrict
service women and female dependents of military
personnel from obtaining privately funded abortions
in military facilities overseas, except in cases of
rape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother. In
many countries, these U.S. facilities provide the
only accessible, safe source for these medical
services. Accordingly, I urge the Congress to repeal
a similar provision that became law in the
"Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1996."
 
In returning H.R. 1530 to the Congress, I recognize
that it contains a number of important authorities
for the Department of Defense, including authority
for Defense's military construction program and the
improvement of housing facilities for our military
personnel and their families. It also contains
provisions that would contribute to the effective and
efficient management of the Department, including
important changes in Federal acquisition law.
 
Finally, H.R. 1530 includes the authorization for an
annual military pay raise of 2.4 percent, which I
strongly support. The Congress should enact this
authorization as soon as possible, in separate
legislation that I will be sending up immediately. In
the meantime, I will today sign an Executive order
raising military pay for the full 2.0 percent
currently authorized by the Congress and will sign an
additional order raising pay by a further 0.4 percent
as soon as the Congress authorizes that increase.
 
I urge the Congress to address the Administration's
objections and pass an acceptable National Defense
Authorization Act promptly. The Department of Defense
must have the full range of authorities that it needs
to perform its critical worldwide missions.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office of the Press Secretary --
Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295 5:20 P.M. EST

MR. MCCURRY: Several people said they needed more
than the paper that you now have available, so have
at me.
 
Q I need something on the budget.
 
MR. MCCURRY: You need something on the budget? Well,
we need a budget, period, so we can put the
government back to work --

Q Gingrich said a little while ago that he thought
that maybe you should negotiate every day until they
got an agreement. Is the President willing to do
that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I thought the idea was that they were
going to lock everyone in a room and --
 
Q That was the freshmen --
 
Q What's your reaction to all that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Whether we would be willing?
 
Q -- marathon talks?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We would be willing to lock the
President and the Speaker, the Majority Leader and
the Democratic leaders in a room until they get a
deal so long as we could lock the House Republican
freshmen out.
 
Q I may need Q-tips, Mike, but I can't hear what
you're saying.
 
Q Can you talk up, Mike?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Their approach has not been
constructive, because they had been insisting on no
compromises. For a negotiation of that nature to work
there has to be a give-and-take attitude and a
good-faith negotiation. We keep getting -- we've got
a particularly interesting idea here from Senator
Dole and from Speaker Gingrich that we just go ahead
and accept unacceptable appropriations bills and we
can talk about it later. That's putting the cart
before the horse and allowing them the opportunity if
they so choose to get up and walk away and leave us
stuck with bills that are not in the interest of the
American people. So there's a lot of -- the President
is concerned that we're getting back into a cycle of
shenanigans here rather than serious, good-faith
negotiations that will move us forward. 
 
The President has been working hard today, as you
know. He's withheld comment on some of these more
boisterous remarks. And he just wants to work
tomorrow, see if we can make progress on budget
issues, achieve the goal of a balanced budget, and
above all else, get our government open so the
American people get their government back. The
President was disappointed today to hear that the
Republican leadership assessment is that they will
force the American people to go at least six more
days with a lack of full government services as we
negotiate these budget issues. The President has
consistently demonstrated that he is conducting these
discussions in good faith. And he believes that
that's reason enough for the Republicans in the House
of Representatives to lift this shutdown of
government services.
 
Q Mike, have you heard back from your officials who
are at the budget talks today?

MR. MCCURRY: I don't -- I believe they're still
working. At last report, they were still working. And
the only thing we've heard is that they continued to
work in a productive environment. And they continue
to focus on how they can help the decision-makers
narrow differences tomorrow.
 
Q What time is the budget advisers meeting set for
tomorrow, and where will it be held?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We believe it's going to be around 10:00
a.m., 10:30 a.m. and on the Hill, we think.
 
The Congress is hosting tomorrow, so it will up to
them to announce. But we're planning for 10:00 a.m.
to 10:30 a.m. on the budget advisers meeting. Then we
intend to host the Democratic leaders here at roughly
2:30 p.m. tomorrow; and the full principals group,
including Representative Armey, the Speaker, the
Majority Leader, who will then be joined by the
Democratic leaders at approximately 3:15 p.m., 3:30
p.m., in that neighborhood.
 
Q And do you have an agenda for those talks? Is it
going to be on narrow items or broad-ranging policy?
 
MR. MCCURRY: What the team of staff people from the
Congress and the White House have been doing are
really shaping those discussions by looking at what
the different proposals are. Remember, this is about
more than dollar figures. It's also about the
policies that underscore those numbers. When you pick
a number and put it in a budget outline, it's not a
number picked out of thin air. There are policy
assumptions that underpin those numbers. And what the
-- what we believe the staff people have been doing
is looking at where those policy differences are and
sharpening up that discussion so the budget advisers
and the principals can have a more enlightened
conversation.
 
Q Are you saying he's going to meet Dole and Gingrich
at 2:30 p.m. and then broaden the meeting?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I'm sorry, he's going to meet with
Senator Daschle and Congressman Gephardt at
approximately 2:30 p.m., and then they'll be joined
by the rest of the group later. 

Q And, excuse me, is there a session with the
President and Panetta here before Panetta goes to the
Hill? 

MR. MCCURRY: They will be talking at some point.
We're not certain when that will happen, but we
expect Mr. Panetta back in town sometime later
tonight.
 
Q Mike, both Gingrich and Dole seem to be talking
about tomorrow's principals talks carrying over until
Saturday and maybe even beyond that. Is that an
expectation the White House has? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, we -- we hope they're right,
because that would reflect and be some sense of
optimism, and that would indicate that they are hard
at work and moving towards the goal of a balanced
budget, which is what the President desires.
 
Q Is it incorrect to say that the President's team,
having reviewed kind of what ought to go on the
table, has some new markers to lay down or has some
new ideas?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I believe that we are prepared to have
good-faith discussions. And, you know, we're willing
to bridge differences that exist as long as there's a
willingness on the other side to reciprocate.
 
Q Has the President done anything himself today to
personally move the process along -- like has he
talked to any of the Republican leaders on the phone?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He's continued to work on this
extensively. And he would prefer that we keep any
conversations that he may have had private.
 
Q So what's he done?
 
MR. MCCURRY: What?
 
Q So what's he done if he's been working so hard? 

MR. MCCURRY: He's been working with Director Rivlin.
He's been having some conversations. He's been
working hard. 

Q Are you denying he -- I mean, how do you say it --I
mean, you prefer not to -- I mean, you're saying he's
had some, but you just won't say who?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I said I would prefer to keep any
conversations that he may have had private, at his
request. 

Q Well, we're not asking you for the -- what the
conversation is; who did he talk to?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, he didn't --
 
Q Did he talk to Dole and Gingrich?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He would prefer that I not say.
 
Q Did he protest the fact that they don't meet again
-- the House doesn't meet again until Wednesday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He's very concerned --
 
Q -- to them?
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- very concerned by the statements from
the Republican leaders today that made it clear that
they don't really have any intention of moving
forward to open the government before next Wednesday.
The President believes the government ought to be
reopened now. And he believes the fact that they are
involved in good-faith negotiations to balance the
budget should be reason enough for Congress to pass
the necessary continuing resolution that would reopen
the government.
 
Q Gingrich says it won't pass the House -- just the
intention.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, the Speaker -- probably a very
candid assessment of the Speaker's read of the
sentiment of some his members. But he also pointed
out that 79 members apparently can hold hostage the
majority of the House, which is unfortunate.
 
Q What was the read here on the freshmen press
conference today where they said -- they sort of took
the stance of we just want to stay and get this done;
everything's on the table and so forth? Is that a
shift in your opinion?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It was a shift from the position they
took after we met with the Speaker and the Majority
Leader and worked through a way that we could both
reopen the government and have good-faith
negotiations and developed a formula to have the
President -- remember, the President agreed with the
Speaker and the Majority Leader to have exactly those
around-the-clock discussions. And that agreement fell
apart when those same House Republican freshmen
objected. So it sounds like it's a change of tune on
their part -- 

Q But what's going on?
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- and if it's a more constructive
attitude on their part, we welcome it.
 
Q Mike, is the President willing or unwilling to
compromise on funding levels for Medicare, Medicaid
and the size of a tax cut?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President has always indicated that
he's willing to have good-faith negotiations. And he
understands that he can't rule out compromises. On
the other hand, he has repeatedly and consistently
made clear his fundamental priorities in this
discussion. They are now a matter of law because
they're in the continuing resolution. They have been
adopted by the Congress presumably. And they include
providing and continuing necessary funding for
Medicare and Medicaid.
 
Q What is the White House expectation tomorrow
afternoon that with Gingrich and Dole saying, you
know, if we can meet for two or three days we get
this hammered out, that tomorrow afternoon will be
the beginning of long negotiations over the weekend?
I mean, what's the White House expectation?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We share their abundant hope that they
can reach that --
 
Q Dole also said he was going to New Hampshire
Sunday, so --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, I noticed that the Speaker of the
House seemed to criticize him for that, but we
certainly wouldn't. 

Q Mike, Senator Dole also talked about bringing the
welfare --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Harold, how am I doing? (Laughter.) 

Q Terrible. (Laughter.)
 
MR. MCCURRY: All right, let's wrap this up -- our
intent is to give you a full lid when we're done
here, right? Have we checked on a full lid?
 
Q Mike, Dole also said that he was thinking about
bringing the welfare bill here tomorrow in the hope
that the President might sign --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Look, welfare reform is now a subject
we've had enormous volumes of discussion about with
this Congress. They know very clearly what the
President considers welfare reform. And they know
very manifestly that this ain't it.
 
Q Mike, why did the President not go ahead and sign
the executive order on the military pay raise today?
Is there's some technical issues he's waiting --
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, he did.
 
MS. TERZANO: -- it may have been signed already. It
wasn't signed immediately because we were changing
the --
 
MR. MCCURRY: We were conforming the text and doing
some other things necessary to make sure they had an
accurate submission. But as our statement earlier
indicated, he intends to put that forward. We should
have the -- we do have the text out now. 

Q Dole started talking about sending the
appropriations back and changing them a little bit.
Is that a -- I mean, he said it before, but he's
never said about changing them. 

MR. MCCURRY: I took that idea on a little bit
earlier, Kevin. I just said that that's not -- that's
not a constructive approach here. They're asking the
President to put the cart before the horse, to accept
unacceptable appropriations bills as a condition for
having discussions -- it seems. And that's not the
environment of good faith discussions that we've had
up to this point. 

Q But if they were willing to take out some of the
provisions in some of these bills that the White
House has objected to --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that -- they need to do a lot to
fix these appropriation bills, and they know that.
And most of what they need to fix are very essential
to the budget discussions that are being held; that's
why the President vetoed these appropriations bills
in the first place.
 
Look, they are feeling -- and rightfully so --
feeling a great deal of heat now for keeping this
government shut for 14 days. And they're trying to
indicate that they're doing something about that and
they're suggesting that, you know, if Clinton had
just signed these appropriations bills -- and I think
the American people know the President cast these
vetoes because he can't accept what he thinks are not
in the best interests of the American people. 

Q Didn't he take the defense appropriation and veto
the authorization?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He vetoed an authorization bill for the
specific reasons that he cited.
 
Q Right, but he took the appropriation bill, even
though it was $7 billion more than he wanted.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, he took a defense appropriations
bill and accepted it and signed it for the reasons
that he set forth. A defense authorization bill
establishes long term national security policy; and,
in this case, very clearly would commit the President
to an unrealistic and unnecessary Star Wars program.
And also, simultaneously, various elements that
infringe on his constitutional responsibilities --
unlike an appropriations bill that provides mirror
funding for programs that have already in many cases
been authorized in law.
 
Q My understanding of the budget negotiation process
was that they were going to deal with technical,
easier to resolve issues first, and then sort of
center in on the big core issues. Is that still the
case? Or are they now going to try to deal with --
because, I guess Dole said the opposite, we need to
get these core issues resolved now, then the rest of
the stuff will fall into place fairly easily.
 
What's the expectation of the order?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't want to dispute the Majority
Leader's interpretation. I mean, there are
fundamental core issues that everybody understands
and they are -- there are differences that exist
there and that's where the bulk of the hard work will
have to occur -- as when they get to the principals
level. 
 
In a sense, they are working through these issues
that we hope the staff has made progress on that
today. We hope the budget advisors can make further
progress to codify some of that work tomorrow. And
then that will have to be considered by the
principals because one agreement that they do have,
based on their prior conversations, is that none of
this package can be agreed to until all the elements
are agreed to.
 
But I think what the Majority Leader was suggesting
-- look, we've got to resolve these other issues and
the other parts of the puzzle fit into the final
agreement.
 
Q What is this business on good faith? Every time
either side opens his mouth they start -- if the
other would only operate or negotiate in good faith.
Is there no good faith at this table?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, we believe there is. We don't like
some of the things that happened today publicly, but
the President chose to withhold his fire and didn't
answer back some of these more boisterous remarks.
 
Q He sent you out --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I've been very temperate.
 
Q Has the President expressed to the White House
staff his strong and irrevocable preference --
everything else being equal -- to go to Hilton Head
for at least New Year's Eve, if he can so do without
being irresponsible in deserting -- ending
negotiations?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No. He said -- you know, he said on
balance he'd like to go and have a party with his
friends on New Year's Eve. But he'll only do that if
it seems like the right thing to do and it makes
sense at the time.
 
Q Does he have --
 
MR. MCCURRY: But he doesn't sound like it's
irrevocable and he has a lust for Hilton Head that is
insatiable and incurable. (Laughter.) I wouldn't be
surprised if he goes, I wouldn't be surprised if he
doesn't go.
 
Q Saturday is he clearing the decks to stay here and
work on budget?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He plans to be here on Saturday, at this
point. He would like -- I mean, his original -- as I
told some of you, his original desire was to try to
go down to South Carolina Saturday night. But he's
willing to delay that or cancel that if it's
conducive to getting a budget agreement.
 
Q But does he expect to spend much of Saturday
working with --
 
MR. MCCURRY: You know, we have no way of knowing. I
don't -- ask me tomorrow, this time tomorrow night
and we might have a better idea.
 
Q Mike, one last one. When you said that the
President chose to withhold his fire, that makes it
sound like he was at least angry at what Dole and
Gingrich were saying?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, he just -- you know, look, they sent
welfare reform down with great fanfare today, but the
world knows where President Clinton is on reforming
welfare. He wants to do it, but he wants to do it the
right way. He doesn't want to do it in a way that
takes it out on kids and makes it harder to get
people back onto work. And everyone knows that the
President's view of welfare reform, as he clearly
stated it to the Congress, does not make it possible
for him to embrace this type of measure. 
 
So they passed this with great fanfare, as if it was
actually going to mean something. And, you know, they
know it doesn't.
 
Q Will he continue to exercise this kind of
discipline about holding his fire by keeping the pool
outside the doors to cover --
 
MR. MCCURRY: When he feels it's the appropriate thing
to do, yes. If you prefer not to have the picture we
can, you know, cancel that kind of opportunity.
 
Q Well, it was humiliating.
 
MR. MCCURRY: We try to make sure everyone doesn't
have to stay cold.
 
Q If there was this goodwill that you talked about on
both sides, is it really a two or three day process
to work this stuff up?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, no. I mean, he -- let's not
misinterpret what the Majority Leader said. He said
we could -- he said we could get an outline by two or
three days. No, there -- because of all the work, we
hope that some of the work the staff is doing will
make it possible to get a final agreement in a form
that can be passed by Congress quicker. But that's a
lot of hard work that goes into just doing that.

And even if the principals agree to the framework of
a budget, there will be -- take some time to draft a
final measure.

Q How long -- what's a more realistic assessment of
how long it would take?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I've heard Dr. Rivlin say it would take,
you know, maybe a week. I don't think anyone has ever
pinned it down. But our hope is that some of the work
that this -- that, you know, what the staff has been
doing in the last day is looking at exactly those
types of questions: What are the policy differences
that exist in that type of measure.
 
Q I'm sorry, when you say a week, do you mean from
the time they have an outline we can expect some sort
of -- 

MR. MCCURRY: Yes, that's a rough -- I mean, that's
not -- that was just a rough estimate at one point,
and she -- you know, it would depend on the
complexity of any agreement they reached or -- you
know, getting a --
 
Q But a week to do what? I didn't quite follow you. 

MR. MCCURRY: To actually draft the bill that would
have to be passed. They just have to be put in
legislative form and -- an outline is not the same
thing as specs they can write a bill off of. But
that's apparently what we think the other folks have
been making some progress on.
 
Q But it's your understanding that once there's a
plan in hand that they'll be willing to go ahead and
do a CR, correct?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We -- based on the Speaker's comments
today, it seemed to me that -- he said that if it was
clear to members of the House that there was an
agreement, that he would be able to proceed on
unanimous consent to get a CR.
 
You know, our view is that they know that when it's
working towards this end then they ought to decouple
the question in keeping the government open. But
that's been our view all along and it's been ignored
by the House of Representatives.
 
Q Do you think their feeling the heat more than you
are?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think everyone is feeling the heat
because this is an outrageous situation. It's been
two weeks worth of government services lost to
Americans who need them. I calculated today, there
are 32,000 American families that have got their -- 

Q Oh, here he goes.
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'll do the whole list for you.
 
Q No, no, no. You can post it. (Laughter.) 

MR. MCCURRY: But just one example: 32,000 American
families who went -- you know, the end of this year,
looking forward to next year -- in many cases
probably giving up leases on apartments because
they're moving into their first homes, don't have
anywhere to go because they can't get their FHA
mortgages closed. That's not a good situation. I
think people in this room have probably been up
against, you know, a mortgage closing before -- and
these people are losing those opportunities.
 
And that's -- you know, that's one more small slice
of life in this shutdown, not to mention all the
federal workers and their families who aren't getting
paid -- all the contractors now who are losing
services, and they'll never regain -- there's no
legislation pending in Congress that restores
contracts or restores economic livelihood to people
who provide services to the government. 

So it's a bad situation and it's -- you know, one
thing that the Speaker said today which is manifestly
true, it was all unnecessary.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: President vetoes defense
authorization bill; Raises pay for military

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- President vetoes defense
authorization bill; Raises pay for military
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

The President today vetoed the fiscal 1996 defense
authorization bill, but took steps to ensure that the
military's uniformed men and women receive the full
2.4 percent pay raise that he had requested.

The bill would have constrained the President's
ability to carry out national security policy; forced
the deployment of a costly and unnecessary ballistic
missile defense system that would threaten the ABM
treaty; and interfered with his management of key
national defense programs. Moreover, certain
provisions would have raised serious constitutional
issues by restricting the President's authority to
conduct foreign affairs and to act as Commander in
Chief.

"I am anxious to have Congress delete the
unacceptable provisions in this bill and to return it
to me for my signature," the President said.

The bill would have provided for a 2.4 percent pay
raise for uniformed men and women. In light of his
veto, the President wanted to ensure that uniformed
men and women were not harmed as he worked to resolve
differences with Congress on the bill. 

Consequently, he is issuing an Executive Order today
that provides for a 2 percent pay raise, the most
that the law allows him to do. He also is sending
legislation to Congress today to implement a full 2.4
percent pay raise, giving the military full
comparability with civilian pay raises since civil
servants benefit from locality pay increases as well.
(The legislation also would increase two pay-related
allowances for uniformed personnel -- one for
housing, the other for food).

"I welcome separate action on the pay raise; I want
it to be effective on January 1 and I will sign it as
soon as I get it," the President stated. "We are
committed to giving the troops a full pay raise and
we ought to do so immediately."

Unacceptable provisions in the authorization bill are
numerous. Among the most important are the
requirement to deploy a costly, unnecessary ballistic
missile defense system in the U.S. by the year 2003,
which would put U.S. policy on a collision course
with the ABM Treaty. Also, the bill would restrict
the President's ability to conduct contingency
operations and require certifications to Congress of
command over such operations that infringe on his
authority as Commander in Chief.

The bill also would unwisely restrict the Nunn-Lugar
Cooperative Threat Reduction programs, direct
procurement to specific contractor facilities, force
unwarranted discharge of HIV-positive service
members, and restrict the ability of female service
members and dependents of military personnel to
obtain privately-funded abortions in military
facilities overseas. 

The President did note that the bill contains
important authorities for military construction,
family housing, acquisition reform, and management of
information technology which he hoped to see return
in an acceptable bill.

Statement by the President

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Statement by the President
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Today I have signed into law House Joint Resolution
136, which ensures that the Government makes
veterans' benefit payments to 3.3 million veterans
and their survivors without further delay. 
 
The resolution also provides funding for several
vitally important programs for children and families.
It continues funding for Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC), ensuring that nearly 9
million children receive benefits vital to their
well-being. It funds child care for about 600,000
children whose parents are trying to work their way
off welfare. And it continues funding for State child
support enforcement agencies to ensure that "deadbeat
dads" do not get a reprieve from supporting their
children.
 
In addition, H.J. Res. 136 provides authority for the
District of Columbia to continue full operations. The
resolution contains an objectionable provision that
would single out poor women by prohibiting the use of
District funds for providing abortion services. I
have opposed including this provision in the regular
fiscal year 1996 District of Columbia appropriations
bill. Nevertheless, H.J. Res. 136 allows the District
government to continue to operate without disruption. 

Although I welcome H.J. Res. 136, it is a poor
substitute for what the Congress should do
immediately -- that is, send me an acceptable
continuing resolution to reopen the departments and
agencies that are at least partially shut down
because they lack fiscal year 1996 appropriations.
Along with the Departments of Veterans Affairs and
Health and Human Services, they include the
Departments of Education, Labor, Housing and Urban
Development, Commerce, Justice, State, and the
Interior; the Environmental Protection Agency; the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and
the Small Business Administration. 

To be sure, H.J. Res. 136 prevents the serious impact
that the partial shutdown could have had on 3.3
million veterans and their survivors as well as
nearly 9 million low-income children. But the
shutdown continues to hurt millions of innocent
Americans -- from the 20,000 parents and students
each day who cannot apply for student aid, to the
2,500 moderate-and low-income working families each
day who cannot get their Federal Housing
Administration (FHA) mortgage loans processed.
 
The shutdown also has forced the affected departments
and agencies to furlough a total of about 280,000
Federal employees, throwing their lives into
disruption and raising their fears just as the
holidays approach. Federal workers, who are already
being asked to do their jobs more efficiently as we
downsize the Government, deserve better.
 
The congressional majority apparently wants to use a
partial Government shutdown to force me into
accepting their extreme budget plan. It did not work
last month, when the majority prompted an earlier
shutdown by not sending me an acceptable continuing
resolution. And it will not work now. 

The Congress should send me an acceptable continuing
resolution to reopen the Government, return to work
the 280,000 Federal employees who were furloughed
through no fault of their own, provide back pay for
these workers, and give the American people the
services they expect from their Government.

-HUMMINGBIRD COMMUNICATIONS LTD: Hummingbird acquires
Intranet solution provider Common Ground Software 

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-HUMMINGBIRD
COMMUNICATIONS LTD: Hummingbird acquires Intranet
solution provider Common Ground Software Inc. --
Acquisition provides Hummingbird with advanced
portable document technologies for building
organizational Intranets and information systems
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

North York, Ontario, Canada -- Hummingbird
Communications Ltd. (TSE: "HUM" and NASDAQ: "HUMCF"),
a worldwide technology and market leader in PC to
UNIX integration software, announces that it has
acquired Common Ground Software Inc., a leading
developer of advanced electronic document
technologies for organizational Intranets (Intranet-
an internetwork of Web servers and clients within the
company firewall). 

The acquisition significantly broadens Hummingbird's
product line by adding Common Ground's premier suite
of document authoring, management, and collaborative
documentation development technologies. The addition
of Common Ground technology further enhances
Hummingbird's ability to service the future needs of
its customer base, many of whom are building
Intranets. 

Hummingbird had previously licensed Common Ground's
technology for inclusion in Columbus, Hummingbird's
Intranet/Internet desktop suite. The combination of
Columbus, an advanced Intranet desktop suite for PCs,
with Common Ground technology and Hummingbird's
existing PC internetworking software products enables
Hummingbird to offer customers a highly functional
suite of tools and applications for building
enterprise-wide information systems and
organizational Intranets. 

"Common Ground technology is the missing link in our
Intranet strategy, and will form an integral
component of our advanced Intranet desktop suite,
Columbus. Common Ground's electronic document
technology offers more than just document authoring
and archiving tools(it provides organizations with a
highly functional platform for information management
and workplace collaboration," stated Fred Sorkin,
Chairman, President, and CEO of Hummingbird.

"The whole context for electronic document technology
has been changed by the explosive growth in
networking. As a leader in internetworking
technology, Hummingbird is ideally suited to the job
of marrying Common Ground's existing technology with
Intranets," said Nick Gault, VP of Engineering and
founder of Common Ground Software.

The total purchase price, payable in cash, is
approximately US $6.0 million. Under terms of the
agreement, Common Ground's key development and other
personnel will continue to be employed by
Hummingbird.

Common Ground's product suite includes a
platform-independent electronic portable document
technology, DigitalPaper, a collaborative document
authoring environment; Intranet/World Wide Web
publishing and archival tools; and utilities that
enable legacy documentation to be easily converted to
a portable electronic document format for
enterprise-wide and/or Intranet/Internet
distribution. 

Collaborative document authoring tools were found to
be highly desirable in a recent report by Zona
Research Inc., of Redwood City California that
surveyed organizations developing Intranets.
According to International Data Corporation, of
Framingham, Massachusetts, the compound annual growth
rate for advanced Internet/Intranet suites is 39.7%,
and is expected to reach US $134.1 million by 1996. 

Hummingbird Communications Ltd. specializes in the
development of PC-to-enterprise internetworking
software products and Intranet software solutions
that provide seamless integration within corporate
networks. Hummingbird products are sold
internationally by authorized resellers in more than
40 countries. The company is headquartered in North
York, Ontario, Canada, with offices in Mountain View,
CA, Raleigh, NC, and Washington, DC in the United
States, and Geneva, Switzerland, Munich, Germany,
Paris, France, and Maidenhead, United Kingdom in
Europe.

Common Ground Software Inc., specializes in the
development of electronic document distribution,
management and collaborative authoring software for
enterprise-wide information systems and
organizational Intranets. Common Ground pioneered the
electronic document technology market with the
release of Common Ground 1.0 in 1993, which featured
DigitalPaper one of the first portable electronic
document formats. The company offers products for

-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE: Livestock, dairy,
and poultry monthly

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE: Livestock, dairy, and poultry monthly
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Dairy Prices To Be Mixed
Average farm milk prices in 1996 are expected to rise
slightly from this year. Skim solids prices are
projected to decline as production outstrips
commercial use, largely offsetting higher milkfat
values. Prices will average above a year earlier in
first-quarter 1996 as prices adjust downward from a
higher seasonal peak this fall. But are projected to
be near a year earlier during the second and third
quarters and are not expected to reach this year's
peak in the fall.
 
The support price for manufacturing grade milk will
rise 25 cents per cwt to $10.35 effective January 1,
1996. The increase was required under current
legislation because projected 1996 net removals,
adjusted for the increase in 1994 imports from the
1986-90 average, fell just under the trigger of 3.5
billion pounds, milk equivalent, total solids basis.
This is the first triggered increase since triggers
became a common feature of dairy legislation in the
early eighties.
 
Strong export demand for butter was the main reason
the projected surplus fell below the trigger level.
However, the support purchase price for butter cannot
legally be increased. Therefore, the support purchase
price for nonfat dry milk must increase 3.1 cents to
$1.065 per pound. The support purchase price for
cheddar cheese will rise 2.5 cents to $1.145 per
pound for 40-pound blocks and $1.115 for barrels. 

The increase in the support price is not expected to
affect average milk prices much, as higher nonfat dry
milk prices are not expected to affect cheese prices
significantly. Milk prices have averaged more than
$1.50 per cwt above the support price each year since
1992.
 
The early December crash in butter prices probably
was much sharper than needed to move surplus butter
into export markets. Aided by domestic stock
building, butter prices already recovered slightly
and are expected to run 20-35 cents per pound below
November's peak. Even though milkfat currently
accounts for less than one-third of the manufacturing
value of milk, potential swings in butter prices
could affect cheese prices.
 
Cheese prices are expected to decline gradually
through early spring but probably will have to remain
high enough to attract milk away from butter-powder
operations. This will make cheese prices particularly
sensitive to butter prices and milk output in cheese
areas. 

Nonfat dry milk prices rose considerably in November,
triggered by seasonally low production and possibly
low user stocks. However, expected expansion in milk
production in 1996 and smaller allowable Dairy Export
Incentive Program (DEIP) exports will keep powder
prices weak during most of the year.
 
Since 1990, retail dairy prices have risen about 1
percent annually, less than half the increase in all
food or all consumer items. This year, prices of
manufactured dairy products rose more than fluid milk
prices, largely because of continued relatively
sizable increases in prices of frozen desserts and
miscellaneous products. Retail dairy prices are
expected to rise 1-3 percent in 1996, following an
increase of less than 1 percent in 1995. Prices of
products containing more milkfat will tend to rise
faster than skim-based products.
 
Moderate Beef Expansion Continues
Preliminary cow slaughter estimates for 1995 strongly
suggest that moderate herd expansion will continue in
1996, resulting in higher beef production at least
through 1997. In spite of the sharp downturn in
lightweight feeder cattle prices this year, cow
slaughter as a percent of the January 1, 1995,
inventory was only 13.6 percent, up only marginally
from 1994 and below the industry liquidation level of
15 percent or higher.
 
Both beef cow and heifer slaughter rose 8 percent
from 1994, indicating a slowdown in the rate of
expansion is underway. Steer slaughter, on the other
hand, was up less than 1 percent, which is somewhat
surprising given the large number of Mexican feeder
steers imported from late 1994 through this past
summer.
 
Calf slaughter increased nearly 12 percent in 1995,
reflecting this year's larger calf crop and the
dramatic decline in lightweight feeder cattle prices.
Heifer calves may have accounted for a sizable
portion of the increased calf slaughter.
 
Beef exports are expected to remain strong in 1996,
insulating the domestic market from larger beef
supplies. However, continued high grain prices,
particularly if exacerbated by drought, would force
larger beef supplies on the market and increase
downward price pressure. 

Higher grain prices and poor winter wheat grazing
prospects are putting additional pressure on lighter
weight stocker-feeder cattle prices. But favorable
forage conditions in most areas and record hay
production are allowing these cattle to remain on
pasture or forage for additional weight gain.
 
Fed cattle prices in December were down about $2 per
cwt from a year earlier, with 750- to 800-pound
feeder cattle prices down $9 and 500- to 550-pound
stocker calves down more than $22. With larger feeder
cattle supplies carried over into 1996, and a larger
expected calf crop, good planting conditions next
spring and favorable crop development next summer
will be critical if lighter stocker cattle prices are
to avoid further declines. 
 
Choice beef supplies remain tight, with retail prices
up 6 cents per pound from a year earlier in November,
reflecting the strong hotel-restaurant and export
demand. All fresh beef prices were up less than 2
cents, with prices for most non-Choice cuts used in
calculating the composite price down from a year
earlier.
 
Pork Prospects Viewed Favorably 
Rising grain and protein meal prices over the past
month will add about $3 per cwt to the cost of
producing hogs. Cash breakeven costs when these
animals are marketed in the spring will approach
$43-$45 per cwt, compared with about $40 in December.
Each 10-cent-per-bushel increase in corn prices adds
about 40 cents per cwt to the cost of producing hogs.
 
Higher grain prices have not curbed recent optimism
in hog futures contracts. In early December, the
April, June, July, and August 1996 hog futures
contract were trading near $50 or above, offering
producers an opportunity to more than cover recent
grain price increases. Corn prices would have to
approach $5 per bushel for producers to view the
current market climate as overly bearish.
 
The premium currently carried on spring futures
assumes pork production is slated to trend lower over
the next 6 months. Using historical price- supply
relationships, estimated production next spring would
have to be held to about 4.175 billion pounds. That
is 275 million pounds or about 1.5 million head below
current production/slaughter projections. This would
have to be accomplished by either reducing
September-November 1995 sow farrowings or the average
number of pigs saved per litter. 

Both cases may be argued. Pig survival rates this
fall may have been lower due to heat stress last
summer. Higher grain prices may have squeezed
operating margins and caused farrowings to fall below
reported intentions for September-November. The
December 1 Hogs and Pigs report will be released on
December 28 and should provide additional insight
into 1996 production.
 
Egg Prices Exceptionally Strong
Lower egg production in the fourth quarter has led to
sharply higher wholesale and retail prices. Wholesale
prices are continuing strong in December. The 2- to
3-percent decline in egg production this quarter
should have caused prices to rise 10-15 percent
rather than 20-25 percent. Seasonal strength during
the holidays has probably contributed to a stronger
than usual increase in prices as retailers strive to
assure supplies will be available.
 
The number of eggs in incubators on November 1 for
egg-producing birds was 13 percent higher than a year
ago. These birds will be ready to enter the laying
flock in April and May, suggesting flocks will
continue expanding next summer. A return to 1995
flock size is expected by spring, with about 1-2
percent more eggs expected to be produced in 1996.
 
Egg exports are projected to increase slightly in
1996, as egg product exports increase more than the
decline in shell egg exports. Decreases in Export
Enhancement Program funds for shell egg exports are
mandated to decline under GATT.
 
Turkey Prices Weakening
Larger cold storage stocks of turkey parts in
November and slower movement of whole birds during
Thanksgiving have contributed to seasonally declining
turkey prices. Prices remain above a year ago, but
the difference has narrowed.
 
December production is projected to decline 2-3
percent from a year earlier based on one less
slaughter day. However, weekly production during the
month will be higher due to heavier slaughter
weights. 

Cumulative placements of turkey poults for
first-quarter 1996 slaughter are fractionally above
last year. Larger increases in poult placements in
early 1996 will be necessary to reach the forecast
4-percent production increase.
 
Broiler Production Forecasts Lowered
Production estimates for early 1996 have been lowered
100 million pounds because of the impact of last
summer's heat stress on the broiler hatchery supply
flock. Production of pullets for placement in the
flock appears to have been affected. Also,
hatchability of eggs continued to lag behind normal
levels into the fall. These factors have limited
pullet placements and are expected to limit
production increases in early 1996. 

U.S. poultry exports to Hong Kong are expected to top
1 billion pounds in 1995, up over 40 percent from a
year earlier. Hong Kong is the second largest market
for U.S. poultry products. Most of these exports were
transhipped to China. However, starting in late
November, the Chinese government cracked down on
poultry imports from Hong Kong, which had been
exported illegally or undervalued to limit tariff
payments. 

U.S. poultry exports to China are growing, but are
only forecast at 80 to 90 million pounds in 1995.
These products also include broiler parts such as
wing tips, feet, and necks, as well as bone-in dark
meat.

-NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR DEMOCRACY IN MEXICO: Concern
grows over  provocation of war in Chiapas'

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR
DEMOCRACY IN MEXICO: Concern grows over  provocation
of war in Chiapas'
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

The National Commission for Democracy in Mexico is
extremely alarmed by the Mexican government's growing
efforts to provoke a war in Chiapas. While the
Zapatista indigenous communities have worked to build
cultural centers to promote the dialogue with the
national and international civil society and to
strengthen the process for peace with dignity and
justice, the Mexican military has mobilized convoys
of armaments and soldiers and sought to provoke the
Zapatistas. 

The position of the Mexican government is that the
mobilizations are maneuvers related to the normal
rotation of deployed troops. However no one in the
area believes this. For example the Congressional
Committee set up by Zedillo and Bishop Samuel Ruiz'
committee, CONAI, have been carrying out marathon
negotiation sessions with the government regarding
its provocations in Chiapas.

The United States government is complicit in what is
happening as it has continued to provide
unquestioning economic and military support to the
Zedillo government in much the same way that it
supported former President Carlos Salinas,--Zedillo's
predecessor and mentor, and who has now been linked
with one of the largest international drug cartels.
This unquestioned support for the Zedillo government
is tantamount to cover-up of serious human rights
abuses, including the lack of any action by the State
Department regarding the attack on Cecilia Rodriguez,
a US citizen who on October 26th was raped by armed
men in Chiapas as a political act of intimidation. In
large part this cover up is to hide the failure of
NAFTA and the resulting profound social and economic
upheaval in Mexico. 

In response to this critical situation, the National
Commission has organized a U.S. delegation to
Chiapas.

Originally set up to participate in the Zapatista New
Year festivities, the delegation will now also serve
as human rights observers to document the Mexican
military's provocations and violations of human
rights laws. The Commission is also preparing a
Freedom of Information Request to bring to light the
extent and nature of US involvement in the
low-intensity war in Chiapas.

Cecilia Rodriguez' New Year Message
CHALLENGE FOR 1996
THE CONSTRUCTION OF CENTERS OF RESISTANCE

"These buildings being raised represent the work of
many people. They will be a place for cultural
events, where different communities can share as
brothers, share their customs. A center where all can
walk freely, as true brothers, sharing their
happiness and their presence. A place which allows
them to have exchanges of their social life,
expressed through a song or a dance.

That is why they are important. They sustain a sense
of community, brotherhood, unity, resistance. They
are also a space where the whole world, no matter
their place of origin can be received as a brother,
regardless of whether or not they are indigenous.
Honest people who wish to participate in the path of
our people.

We have never had a center like this. We did not have
them because each community felt separated, each
followed its own path to find the solution to its
problems. But now, with this new consciousness, the
need to become organized is necessary. We must build
something together. It is the truth that before among
our people, we saw each other as enemies, or as
strangers, without relationship to one another. Now
that barrier has been broken.

There has always been a common condition, but the
circumstances of an unjust social system during so
many years made our communities feel isolated,
destroyed its social base, its values. Now we have
recovered our unity. That is why they come from many
parts, tzotziles, tzeltales, choles and tojolabales,
to collaborate in the construction of a space which
we say is for peace... we do not hide the truth..we
are speaking of peace."

Comandante David
Clandestine Indigenous Revolutionary Committee EZLN
on the construction of the Centers of Resistance,
Chiapas, Mexico, 12-27-95
by Cecilia Rodriguez

It is now the practice of the Zapatista communities
to come together in gigantic democratic assemblies.
To organize themselves into massive human chains of 4
to 500 people to travel to a distant place in order
to construct hope. Together they agree to leave
behind their "personal" lives, because they know that
hope lies in the organization of each other, and the
concentric organization of others. They are
accustomed to walking patiently for ten or twelve
hours to come to a humid, rough-hewn auditorium and
then to sit and listen to one another, without
interruption, without self-destructive emotional
outbursts that sabotage a collective discussion,
without posturing and exaggeration. It is their
practice to wait, and wait and wait until together
they can give birth to a good decision, and then it
is their practice to work together, to surrender
their "individuality" so that it is possible to carry
out that decision.

That is their proposal for a "new democracy", a
living process which has worked well for them for
hundreds of years. They are able to carry it out
because their culture builds and reclaims a set of
common values and a shared belief system. This is not
an argument for cultural superiority, it is an
acknowledgement of the strongest reason for their
success and their continued survival.

It is the dusk of the old year, another small step in
humanity's crawl towards the 21st Century. Most
natural in all of us is to stand still for a moment
and reflect on the days that have slipped through our
fingers, on the decisions and plans and thoughts that
have guided our steps. From this examination should
come wisdom, skills for the good fight in the days
that come, inspiration and strength in order to
confront the difficulties of new undertakings.

For those of us who have worked together for a peace
with dignity in Mexico each day which has passed
since January of 1994 has been filled with
uncertainty, and joy in the midst of simultaneous
pain. The hands of the clock have always spun out of
control ticking off events and changes which slip
past us like objects in the swollen river of history.

We should congratulate one another for our tenacity
in denouncing an invisible war in spite of the
studied indifference of the mass media. We have as
well managed a modicum of faith, because while time
has worn away those driven by sheer emotion and
romanticism, many of us continue to work in the
simple belief that the work itself will teach us
better ways of doing things. Sometimes, by the seat
of our pants we have managed to gather the financial
and human resources necessary in order to fight back,
in order to say to the powers-that-be "We are here!
We reject your global project! We demand, together
with the Zapatistas, the power to decide our own
destiny!"

In spite of these accomplishments; we have failed
miserably at the most important and transcendental
lesson of the Zapatistas, their sense of community,
their willingness to work at one another's and our
side and build a new global project together, their
sovereignty and sense of self and independence in the
face of projects they consider deadly to their human
nature. Our ability to understand this, to undertake
certain tasks with clarity and patience will be the
elements which will determine whether we can move
forward in our struggle for peace with dignity in
Mexico in 1996.

Together, whether we like it or not, we confront this
global economic system where financial capital is
dominant. It is the portion of the economy most
dependent upon speculation, and corruption, it feeds
on mergers, and the concentration of power. It
provokes the elimination of national borders,
identities, spheres of production and governments
creating a global environment where vast financial,
industrial and political power can be concentrated in
the hands of a few. It is a profoundly undemocratic
economic system.

Its parasitic state has deteriorated to the point
where it can no longer afford, the "benevolent
capitalism" inherent in Keynesian economics. It
regresses, returning to the dramatic contradictions
and extreme vacillations dictated by the forces of a
market "liberated" by technocrats who argue that all
this suffering is "temporary", and that, upon the
integration of certain populations into the market
the benefits will befall all who can live that long.

Civil discontent and social change is anathema to
this economic hallucination, so it invests millions
in sustaining armed forces capable of controlling the
kind of discontent inherent in starvation, misery,
and extreme poverty. Financial capital has played a
dominant role for the past 50 years in the world, and
its phenomenal impact is manifest in the pillage of
entire continents in the pursuit of a quick profit
procured through short-term investments. We live in a
world where bankers prey on its resources like hordes
of locusts. We are mostly overwhelmed by its size and
its power.

Not so the Zapatistas. As hundreds of indigenous
communities organize to construct not just one, but
many new Aguascalientes, the government and the
military watch with extraordinary fear. They fear the
continuation of this intense dialogue which they have
maintained with the world since they emerged on
January 1st of 1994. They fear that this strange
disease called dignity, and the euphoric freedom
derived from risking everything in order to find
something new, will spread.

They watch in terror as hundreds of indigenous people
traipse to and from, machete in hand, lumber on their
shoulders, and smiles on their faces. They pace and
wonder as hundreds more prepare food for the
others--they have no inkling of how to explain such
extraordinary movements. Haunted by the spectre of
their own brutality they accuse them of military
preparations--how else does one elicit victory, how
else does one win this slow and silent war? What
could possibly result from a "dialogue", from such a
cultural exchange? They await, terrified that they
will be blown up by a corrido, their skulls crushed
in by hundreds of people dancing to La Valentina--
barracks disguised as cultural centers, unarmed
children brazenly confronting their tanks and
artillery... what a danger to their omnipotence!

They parade in their tanks bristling with their
weaponry, faces scrunched beneath their concave
helmets, yelling and waving their guns "we want war,
we want war now!" --and the Zapatistas continue to
mobilize, to build, to invite people to come and
exchange ideas and hopes and proposals for a new
nation, and indeed a new world. What the hell is to
be done with them anyway?

Follow their example. Take history by the horns and
say "No 70,000 people will die as they did in El
Salvador, no 250,000 as in Bosnia...we will seek the
path of reason until all avenues are exhausted, we
will force the path of reason because there are
millions of us and a few of them, we will disable a
war driven by rage and despair." Respond to their
call, strengthen that path of reason by not leaving
them alone. Help them build these cultural centers,
these Towers of Babel where we can bow and beam at
one another because although we do not share the same
language, we share the same dream, and that makes us
silly with happiness.

The cultural centers that the Zapatistas are now
building can provide us with the opportunities and
examples we need in order to go about a new path for
peace. Some can claim that pieces of this path were
pioneered during the war against Vietnam, and the war
in Central America, but just as we learned so did the
opposition.

We must rise to the challenge of imaginative
strategies. As the first people to rebel against this
global project, the Zapatistas have also pioneered
new strategies. That is why together, we must find a
way to implement them, and allow that experience to
nurture effective international strategies. That is
why these centers of resistance are an important
investment in peace and in the future.

UPON MY RETURN TO CHIAPAS
The success of the strategy of low-intensity warfare
hinges on the continued isolation of the EZLN and its
base communities. It is clear to me that the United
States State department is complicit in this
strategy, that behind the backs of the American
people, this country participates in the preparation
of a war.

In a recent story in the National Catholic Reporter
an anonymous source in the State Department
supposedly stated that they had offered to accompany
me to file a police report with the appropriate
Mexican authorities but that "I had refused". It must
be public knowledge that there has been no such
offer, there has been no communication of any nature
between myself and the State Department in regards to
the rape I was subjected to on October 26th of 1995.
It should also be public knowledge that Todd
Robberson of the Washington Post interviewed me under
the guise of publishing a full report on the
phenomenon of rape in Chiapas a few weeks after my
return. In spite of his continual assurance that a
report would soon appear none has ever materialized.
The latest information is that Robberson's post on
the Mexico City desk has apparently ended.

The advice of books and therapists tells me that a
full year is required to recover from this kind of
trauma. It has always been my theory that the State
Department would like for Mexico to appear serene and
under control until after the next administration is
put into office. Neither party can afford another
Bosnia-like disaster on their hands. I wish it were
possible to afford a full year of recovery. I wish I
could pretend that I am separate and better than
those thousands of indigenous women who labor under
the cruelest of conditions, who hope and dream as
fervently as I do for my own children, who suffer the
continual sexual harassment of military checkpoints,
and the humiliation of body searches.

I wish I could turn my head in indifference upon
learning that the Border Patrol now constructs
"holding pens" in preparation for what they assume to
be "hordes from Mexico" escaping the chaos which the
U.S. Treasury Department itself has created. I wish
pretend the Border Patrol does not chase our people
down the street as though they were animals. I wish I
were unable to feel the deep sense of shame that
comes when I listen to the level of corruption and
the cynicism which reigns in the party-state system
of Mexico.

If there is nothing else I can do with what is left
of me, I can say to this stupidity that rules both
our countries "You have not won. You may use
psychological terror, rape, torture, death, and media
manipulation but your time is limited. Your reign is
coming to an end, its end is inevitable, because it
is illogical, unproductive, contradictary to nature
and to humanity. We have also learned about
low-intensity warfare, and reached deep into our
souls to find the spirit of those who have lived on
this earth for thousands of years, to find that human
spirit that hungers for progress and for freedom,
that values human dignity above possessions.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-ANC: President Mandela's
message on Christmas Day
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:251295

I am delighted to speak to all South Africans on this
Christmas Day.

Just as this period of goodwill is the time to thank
the Lord for the blessings on our nation in this past
year, it is also a moment of deserved relaxation with
our loved ones, especially the children. It is a time
for sharing.

As we enjoy this great moment, we should also
remember the children who do not enjoy the care of
parents or loved ones. There are many citizens, too,
who cannot fend for themselves, confined in hospital
or disadvantaged in many other ways. Let us show them
compassion during this period and beyond.

Each one of us should draw pride from our efforts to
bring sunshine into the hearts of others.

Let this Christmas period be the time for us to renew
our commitment to work together as one nation to
build a better life for all South Africans.

I send a message of love and peace to all fellow
citizens and our friends across the globe. Let us
embrace one another and build on the spirit of
reconciliation that has become the hallmark of our
rainbow nation.

As we rejoice in the wonderful year we were blessed
with, let us pray to be peacemakers and builders of a
harmonious nation. 

Let peace reside in all our hearts!

-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE: Hogs and
pigs -- Highlights

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL
STATISTICS SERVICE: Hogs and pigs -- Highlights
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

U.S. Hog Inventory Up Slightly U.S. inventory of all
hogs and pigs on December 1, 1995, was 60.2 million
head. This was slightly above December 1994 but 1
percent below the September 1, 1995, inventory. This
is the highest December inventory since 1980.
Breeding inventory, at 7.13 million head, was up 1
percent from both December 1, 1994 and September 1,
1995. Market hog inventory, at 53.1 million head was
slightly above last year but 2 percent below last
quarter.

*****

Beginning March 1996 the line up of the quarterly
estimating states will include Arkansas and Oklahoma
but will exclude Tennessee. The report will contain
an estimate for the each of the quarterly states, the
17 state region, the 33 annual state region, and the
U.S. total. Mt An 4 (12-95) The September-November
1995 U.S. pig crop at 24.9 million head was 2 percent
more than 1994 and 4 percent more than 1993. Sows
farrowing during this period totaled 2.99 million
head, only 9,000 head below last year. Litter rate
increases continue at a record level, with an average
of 8.34 pigs saved per litter for the
September-November period.

Last year the litter rate averaged 8.18 pigs per
litter. Hot weather late last summer did not
significantly reduce farrowings or litter rates. This
is largely due to increased production by larger
operations with environmentally controlled facilities
which minimize the affects of adverse weather. In
addition, market hog prices, relative to corn prices,
provided little incentive for herd reduction. Pigs
saved per litter by size of operation ranged from
7.45 for operations with 1-99 hogs to 8.64 for
operations with more than 2,000 hogs and pigs.

U.S. hog producers intend to have 2.92 million sows
farrow during the December 1995-February 1996
quarter, 1 percent more than the actual farrowings
during the same period last year and 1994. Intended
farrowings for March-May 1996, at 3.31 million sows
are 2 percent above 1995 but 2 percent below the 1994
period. The December-May intentions utilize 87.4
percent of the breeding herd, compared to 87.0 for
actual farrowings last year and the 5 year average of
86.7 percent. The number of operations with hogs
totaled 182,700 during 1995, down 12 percent from
last year and 19 percent below 1993. Places with
2,000 or more hogs on hand accounted for 3 percent of
the operations and 43 percent of the inventory. A
year ago 2 percent of the operations had inventories
over 2,000 head and accounted for 37 percent of the
inventory.

Considering all hog operations, currently 6 percent
control 60 percent of the total inventory. Revisions
All inventory and pig crop estimates for 1994 and
1995 were reviewed using final pig crop, official
slaughter, import, and export data in U.S. level
balance sheets. Based on the findings of this review,
no revisions were made to the inventories for June
and September 1995 along with the 1995 March-May pig
crop. This report was approved on December 28, 1995,
by the Acting Secretary of Agriculture and the
National Agricultural Statistics Service's
Agricultural Statistics Board.

opportunity with Congressional leaders

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President in
photo opportunity with Congressional leaders
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:301295 11:35 A.M. EST
 
THE PRESIDENT: I want to be brief today because we're
getting off to a little late start. We've got a lot
to do. I have three things to say. I think we made a
good start yesterday, we're making progress, and I
believe we need to open the government. I hope we can
agree to do all that.
 
Q Sir, do you know any more information on the
soldier who was wounded in Bosnia?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Our reports are sketchy and I have
tried to get an update, but what I do know is that
there were apparently two vehicles and four soldiers
involved. Only one was seriously hurt and he has been
medivacked to Croatia in a hospital there, and we
understand he's in stable condition.
 
But mines have always been our biggest concern and
we're working very hard on it, but that's what
happened. And we'll continue to monitor it and do the
best we can. The mission itself is going very well.
The people have received our soldiers very well and
I'm very well satisfied with the progress. And I'm
obviously very sorry this happened, but they're
making good progress on the mine problem, but it's
going to be difficult to get rid of them all. 

Q -- the measure to get the workers back that's going
to get through Congress?
 
SENATOR DOLE: Well, it passed the House. We hope we
can pass in the Senate today, so make some progress. 
 
SENATOR DASCHLE: We tried to pass a clean CR, one
without any conditions. And that was objected to, but
I hope we can work something out.
 
Q But isn't the fact now that the Democrats are
holding things up?
 
SENATOR DASCHLE: Not at all. As a matter of fact, as
I said, we passed a continuing resolution -- we had
no conditions. It sent people back to work, and that
was objected to. So we're not trying to hold anything
up here. We hope we can get some sort of an agreement
as early as today.
 
Q Well, what's it going to take to get a deal? 

SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, let me just something. I
think the President had a right -- we're glad to have
you all in. We have a lot of work to do. We made, I
thought, real progress last night. It is not easy. We
have very significant areas we have to work on, but I
thought the spirit was very positive. We don't just
want to get the federal workers back, we want to get
them paid. And in order to do that, I think we've got
to get this whole thing worked out. But I thought we
had a great start last night. And with you all's
permission, I think we can get a lot more done in the
next few hours. 

Q Mr. President, is the message from the Democrats
basically that they don't trust you?
 
THE PRESIDENT: We've got to go to work. Thank you
very much. 
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295 3:40 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: I want to welcome the congressional
leaders back here after Christmas. We're going to
have, I think, a good meeting today, based on the
work that has already been done this morning. I
expect us to make further progress.
 
We will begin to deal with some of the difficult
issues today involving how we can balance the budget
and protect things like Medicare and Medicaid and
education and the environment, which I think are very
important. I believe we're proceeding in good faith
and I think we're making progress.
 
I do believe that we ought to move to reopen the
government. As you know, I feel very strongly about
that. The public services will begin to be
significantly curtailed. And, of course, I'm
concerned about the federal employees -- those that
aren't working who want to work, who are going to get
paid regardless, and those who are working who
haven't gotten paid who are going to run into some
very serious financial problems with their mortgages
and other things soon. So I hope we can get some
agreement to reopen the government so that these
problems can be averted.
 
Q Is there some room for compromise now that you've
had a little bit of time to think it over over the
holidays?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're -- I've gotten a
preliminary report. I think we'll have some more
progress this afternoon and then I expect we'll work
all day tomorrow. I'm prepared to spend whatever time
it takes to move as quickly as we can move. But some
of these issues are quite complicated in terms of
their impact on the American people. But I'm ready to
go and I think that all of us are.
 
Q Mr. Speaker, do you see any way of having an
agreement that can reopen the government without the

SPEAKER GINGRICH: We'll discuss it this afternoon.
And I think that Senator Dole and Congressman Armey
and I have been trying to work out a way to both get
the currently nonessential employees deemed
essential, which Senator Dole began to work on last
week after our meeting here, and also to find a way
to possibly get everyone paid. We feel strongly that
federal employees ought to be back -- all the federal
employees ought to be at work. We know they want to
be, and it's not fair to them. And we also feel
strongly we ought to try to find some way to get
everyone paid. We also have an obligation under the
continuing resolution that was adopted about six
weeks ago to get a balanced budget by next Wednesday
morning, at the latest, at the end of the first
session of Congress.
 
So I agree with the President. I think there are
reasons to be cautiously optimistic. I wouldn't
exaggerate them, but I think we've made some progress
over the last few days, and I would hope in the next
two or three days we could basically get this done
and then have everything up and running and everyone
paid for while the staff work was finished out on the
actual technical details. 

Q Let me clarify, though, sir -- is there any way to
get the people back to work without resolving a
balanced budget plan? 

SPEAKER GINGRICH: There might be a way -- yes.
 
SENATOR DOLE: Yes.
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: We're going to explore today some
ways to get that done by unanimous consent over the
next two days. But I think it takes working it out
together, and we haven't done that yet. 

SENATOR DOLE: Just let me add that we're sending --
we're in recess now in the Senate, subject to call of
the chair, and I hope to be able to give Senator
Daschle some language to look at this afternoon. And
I want to congratulate Congressman Armey for his
leadership on the House side with the Speaker,
because if we can work this out it could be done yet
today.
 
Q And have people back to work?
 
SENATOR DOLE: Well, it would go down to the President
as quickly as we could. It's a Middle East peace
facilitation act. It's the same language we passed
last Friday in the Senate deeming people essential.
And the third element of the package would be
expedited procedure, if we get an agreement, so we
can get it through the Senate in less than 60 days, I
guess. We just take the budget reconciliation
language and shorten the time and put that in the
resolution. 

SPEAKER GINGRICH: We'll try to get that down here by
sometime this evening if we can get it all worked
out. It's all got to be done -- our system is
complicated even at best, and it takes a little
while, but we hope to get it worked out today.
 
Q President Clinton, what's your reaction to that,
sir? 

THE PRESIDENT: I think the people ought to go back to
work and I think they ought to be paid. And I think
if we don't do it we're going to see some very
serious consequences that should not -- that neither
the public, nor the public employee should have to
endure. And I think we need to keep working at this
until we get an agreement. I'm prepared to work until
we get an agreement. We've just got to keep working
through it.
 
But these are complex issues. To protect Medicare and
Medicaid, education and the environment, the things
that are at the core of the resolution we adopted,
and get the budget balanced in seven years is not
easy to do. We're going to have to work at it.
 
Q -- the Republicans rejected last time? You thought
you had an agreement on something like this and the
House Republicans rejected it?
 
Q Why did you change your position, Mr. Gingrich? 

THE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, wait. Let's don't ask any
more questions like that. We're trying to work this
out and I think -- give us a chance to meet today and
give them a chance to do their work; let's see what
happens.

Radio address by the President to the Nation

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Radio address by the
President to the Nation
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:301295 10:06 A.M. EST
 
THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Tomorrow is New Year's
Eve, a time for celebration, friendship and hope.
Nineteen ninety-five has been a good year for our
country, and the coming year can be even better.
 
In Washington, we all know this has been a year of
serious differences and profound debate over our
nation's future direction. But if we remain true to
our values, we will prove once again that in America
we can have serious differences without leaving deep
divisions. We know our nation is strongest when we're
true to our fundamental values, giving every American
the opportunity to make the most of their lives,
remembering the duty we owe to our parents and our
children, preserving our families and our
communities, keeping America the strongest force of
peace and freedom in the world.
 
In our effort to advance these values, 1995 has been
a time of real progress and concrete achievement. The
key to our strength is economic opportunity for every
American. In 1995, the ingenuity and hard work of our
people has kept the economy growing, steady and
strong. In the past 12 months the economy created
1.75 million new private sector jobs. In every month
the unemployment rate has been below six percent. All
told, since 1993, we Americans have created nearly
eight million new jobs. The stock market has broken
every record. The deficit dropped for the third year
in a row, for the first time since Mr. Truman was
President. Long-term interest rates continue to fall,
bringing lower mortgage payments for working families
and more affordable credit for small businesses and
consumers.
 
A growing economy and lower interest rates are why a
million new Americans became homeowners for the very
first time in 1995. There were more new businesses
incorporated this year than in any previous year. And
here in Washington, in spite of all of our
differences, we made some real progress on an
important issue -- political reform. At long last,
Congress passed a law which applies to themselves the
same laws they oppose in the private sector. And at
long last, after three years of effort, the Congress
passed lobby reform legislation, banning gifts to
congressmen and requiring extensive disclosure about
the activities of lobbyists.
 
Most important, our communities all over America are
coming together around our values again. In city
after city, in state after state, violent crime is
down; the welfare and food stamp rolls are down; the
poverty rate is down; even the divorce rate is down.
And for two years in a row now, the teen pregnancy
rate has dropped.
 
It hasn't always been an easy year for America. There
have been moments that tested our national community.
In the wake of the terrible bombing in Oklahoma City,
which took the lives of 169 people, our nation
reached out and recognized the bonds that hold us
together. Out of the ashes of that tragedy a new
sense of national spirit took hold. We affirmed once
again that all Americans are in it together. We
recognized once again that we can't love our country
and hate our government.
 
And a strong America has been the world's strongest
force for freedom, peace and democracy in 1995. Our
brave men and women today are in the snows of Bosnia,
helping to uphold the peace agreement to end the
worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II. And
from the cobblestone streets of Northern Ireland to
the sands of the Middle East, a strong America has
helped to bring peace to regions long torn by strife.
 
Yes, 1995 has been a good year for America. Our
people have accomplished a lot. And it goes without
saying, we still have one major task to finish to top
off the accomplishment of this year. We have to
finish the job of balancing the budget and to do it
in the right way.
 
As you know, for the last two weeks the Congress has
refused to pass legislation that would keep the
federal government open to serve the American people.
This has never happened before for this length of
time in the whole history of the republic. And it's
been very hard on three-quarter of a million public
servants who have to pay rent and utilities and
mortgage payments and buy food. And they're losing
pay at holiday time. And it's also cut off services
for millions of Americans who depend upon them.
 
This Tuesday, if the government is not open, clean-up
efforts will be stopped cold at 32 toxic waste sites
in neighborhoods around our country. Next week,
federal funds for unemployment insurance will begin
to run out, forcing states to scramble to find ways
to keep helping workers who have lost their jobs. And
the Meals On Wheels program to our senior citizens
won't go forward. Every day, nine of 10 work place
safety complaints go unanswered. And every day 2,500
people can't get guaranteed home mortgages. Every
day, thousands of young people looking for college
loans can't apply for them. If ever we needed a
reminder that our government is not our enemy, this
is it. 

Let me be clear: I am committed to balancing the
budget. Our administration already has cut the
deficit nearly in half, and I am determined to finish
the job. For weeks I've been working in good faith
with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to find
common ground, to balance the budget in a way that
reflects our values. Yesterday I met well into the
evening with Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader
Dole. And in just a few moments I will sit down with
them again, along with the Democratic congressional
leaders.
 
We are making real progress. We know that our work is
not done. We know we have much to do, so that the
American Dream will remain alive for every citizen,
and so that we can come together as a people, and so
that America can remain the strongest force for peace
the world has ever seen.
 
So on this New Year's, let's resolve that we will
balance the budget, but that we'll do it in a way
that will keep our country growing and that will be
true to our basic values. That is, we'll balance the
budget without gutting Medicare and Medicaid, without
deeply cutting education or the environment, without
raising taxes on working families. Let's resolve to
reopen the government and do it now. And let's
resolve to act without rancor or partisan bitterness
in the spirit of the new year and in the interests of
the American people. 

Nineteen ninety-five has been a year when we've been
true to the best of America. If we'll just work hard
and work together and follow our values, 1996 can be
even better. Hillary and I want to wish you and your
families a happy and health New Year. Thank you for
listening.

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:
On September 21, 1994, I determined and reported to
the Congress that the Russian Federation is in full
compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria of
sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This
action allowed for the continuation of
most-favored-nation (MFN) status for Russia and
certain other activities without the requirement of
an annual waiver.
 
As required by law, I am submitting an updated report
to the Congress concerning the emigration laws and
policies of the Russian Federation. You will find
that the report indicates continued Russian
compliance with U.S. and international standards in
the area of emigration.

Christmas Eve message to the troops in Bosnia

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President in
Christmas Eve message to the troops in Bosnia
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:241295

THE PRESIDENT: Merry Christmas, and best wishes to
all of you on this Christmas Eve. I am honored to
speak today to the men and women of Operation Joint
Endeavor -- in Bosnia, Croatia, Hungary and Italy; on
ships at sea and skies overhead; and those preparing
to deploy. I know that all around the world Americans
who wear our nation's uniform are listening, and I
want to wish all of them well, just as I know they
wish you well as you embark on this historic mission.
 
With me today are the families of seven Americans
serving in and around Bosnia: Lieutenant Colonel Bob
Norman of the 621st Air Mobility Control Squadron in
Tuzla; Command Master Chief Jim Sirles on the USS
America in the Adriatic; Sergeant William LeBright of
the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit on board the USS
Whidbey Island; Warrant Officer Willie Wade with the
586th Assault Bridge Company; Lieutenant Colonel
O'Malley Smith of the 353rd Civil Affairs Group;
Sergeant Mark Ackerman with the 114th Public Affairs
Detachment; and Linda Carsey, an Army Civilian
Contract Specialist on her way to Tuzla.
 
These families here remind us all of the Americans
we're sending to Bosnia. They're leaving their
families behind. And many of them are already far
from their loved ones this Christmas Eve. I want to
extend a special greeting to those families today. I
know that when we call on our troops to protect
America's interests and values, we also call on their
families. Their families' special sacrifice may not
make the headlines, but we could not be successful
without it, for as our troops stand up on America's
behalf, it is their families who stand behind them,
who keep them strong with confidence, support and
love.
 
These thoughts are especially close in our minds this
time of year. As Americans come together in this
season of peace, we know that you, the men and women
of Operation Joint Endeavor, are serving on a mission
of peace, the noblest mission of all. The pride your
families have in each of you is shared by all your
fellow Americans all across our nation. 
 
Ten days ago in Paris, the presidents of Bosnia,
Croatia and Serbia signed an agreement that turns
their troubled region from war to peace. Our nation
has an important interest in seeing that peace take
hold for the people of Bosnia, who have suffered so
much for so long; for the stability of Europe, which
is so crucial to our own stability; and for the
safer, stronger world we want to leave for our
children.
 
There is too much at stake in Bosnia today for our
nation to sit on the sidelines, and that's why we've
turned to you, our men and women in uniform. You
provide us with the power to meet threats to our
security. You have the strength to bring hope and
stability to people exhausted by war. We know, and
the people of Bosnia know, that you will get the job
done and that you will do it right.
 
Each side there wants NATO to help them safeguard the
peace they have agreed to make, and to help them live
up to their commitments to one another. They trust
you to create a secure environment so they can seize
this chance to rebuild their lives and their land.
They see in you how much can be achieved when people
find strength in their diversity. That is the power
of America's example.
 
I know this will be a demanding mission, but I know,
too, that you are up to the task. General Joulwan and
General Nash have assured me of that. And I have seen
it for myself. 

Earlier this month, I visited with the men and women
of Task Force Eagle in Germany. I saw in them the
qualities that all of you share, the qualities that
have earned our nation the respect and trust of the
entire world. Your training, equipment and
preparation are unequalled. Your reputation precedes
you. The most advanced technology protects you. But
just as important, you are strong in your character.
Time and again, without pause or complaint, you step
forward to serve our nation. 
 
In this new era of challenge and change, America's
obligation to lead for peace and human dignity has
remained as important as ever. In Bosnia, you, the
men and women of our Armed Forces, will bear that
charge with great honor. You will make the difference
between horror and hope, between a war that resumes
and a peace that take hold. 
 
I am proud to be your Commander in Chief and to thank
you on behalf of your nation. Your mission of peace
and goodwill in Bosnia reminds us all what this
season is all about for all people everywhere.
 
Tomorrow, on Christmas Day, and as long as you are
there, Hillary and I will have you in our thoughts
and prayers. May God bless and protect you and your
families and bring you success and a very safe
return. And may God bless America, the nation you do
so much to serve.

-RCMS: RCMS adopts DSDM methodology to implement
client/server projects in short time scales

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-RCMS: RCMS adopts DSDM
methodology to implement client/server projects in
short time scales
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

RCMS Computing Services Limited has announced that
its team of consultants has adopted the DSDM
Consortium methodology for the implementation of
Rapid Application Development (RAD) projects. RCMS
was a founder member of the Dynamic Systems
Development ethod (DSDM) Consortium which has laid
down a framework which enables organisations to make
up to 80 per cent time savings on client/server
implementation projects. 

RCMS has carried out several successful DSDM-based
RAD projects involving over 35 consultants. Examples
include projects for BUPA, the UK's leading
independent healthcare provider and Black Horse
Relocation Services, the UK market leader in
relocation anagement.

The DSDM approach to Rapid Application Development
assumes that no implementation project is built
perfectly the first time around but that it is
possible to produce 80 per cent of a solution in a
fraction of the time it takes to produce a whole
soluti n using traditional methods. The approach
takes advantage of an iterative approach which
encourages any previous implementation step to be
revisited as business requirements change at any
stage in the project. The DSDM Consortium was formed
in November 1993 to find a way of using RAD methods
more effectively to deliver business benefits.
Version 1.0 of the DSDM RAD methodology, launched in
February 1995, draws upon the collective development
and implementati n experiences of a large number of
companies involved in IT development projects. In
addition to RCMS, other founder members include
Oracle, IBM, Abbey Life, British Airways, and
Software AG. 

RCMS Computing Services Limited is one of the UK's
fastest growing systems and services integrators. The
company recently acquired the document management
company NBI Information Management Services Limited,
as part of its corporate growth objectives. 

RCMS specialises in developing client/server
enterprise-wide solutions for the corporate
marketplace and has achieved particular success in
the financial, manufacturing, retail and oil sectors,
with customers including The Royal Bank of Scotland,
Macro Group, Eagle Star, Black Horse Relocation
Services, BUPA, Abbey National, Amerada Hess and Bass
Taverns. RCMS is a major UK partner for leading IT
organisations, including Gupta, Thomson Software
Products, Oracle, Lotus, Platinum Technology, and
Micros ft.

Radio address by the President to the Nation

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Radio address by the
President to the Nation
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:231295 10:06 A.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. As you know, I have
spent the last week in intense discussion with
congressional leaders over how to balance the budget
in seven years. It's important to balance the budget
to lift the burden of debt from future generations. 

In the last three years, we've cut our deficit in
half, and we need to finish the job. But we have to
balance the budget in a way that reflects our most
fundamental values: increasing opportunity; asking
everyone to assume responsibility; strengthening our
families and the economy; and recognizing the duty we
owe to each other -- to our parents, our children,
and those who need and deserve our help. That's how
we've reduced the deficit since I took office --
cutting unnecessary programs, reducing the size of
the federal government by 200,000, reducing red tape,
but investing in education, the environment, research
and technology, protecting Medicare and Medicaid,
reducing taxes on the hardest-pressed working
families. It's worked. It's given us more jobs, more
new businesses, low inflation, and record economic
performance in the stock market and in many other
places. 
 
Now, that's how I want to finish the job of balancing
the budget. But even as we continue talking, I hope
Congress will agree to open the government and open
all the agencies that have closed so that we can end
the financial and emotional turmoil for more than
280,000 furloughed federal employees and 460,000
working but not getting paid federal employees.
 
In the spirit of the holidays, we should do
everything we can to put these people back to work
and to resume critical services the American people
need and deserve. Just last night, I signed
legislation that Congress passed yesterday to allow
3.3 million veterans and 13 million needy children
and their mothers to receive their benefits by
January 1st. That's a good start. I hope we can
resume all services as we work together to balance
the budget. 

Our talks are making progress. Yesterday we agreed to
resume our negotiations next week with the goal of
reaching an agreement as soon as possible. I am
confident we can end this impasse and pass a
seven-year balanced budget.
 
As we look back at this year, in this season of hope,
I think we ought to take just a little time to
reflect on the progress and accomplishment of
America. It should give us real optimism that we can
finish this budget job and go on to greater things in
1996. 

Nineteen ninety-five was a year in which our country
had the opportunity and the responsibility to play
our role as the world's premier peacemaker. Our
efforts opened the door to peace in places where only
rancor and war had previously existed. As a
peacemaker, not a policeman, we have helped the peace
process finally begin to take hold in the Middle
East, while we joined the world in mourning the
tragic assassination of Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin. We have done what Prime Minister Rabin
would have wanted us to do -- we've kept moving
forward.
 
And finally, it looks like Israel and Syria will sit
together in the United States to seek a way to
resolve their differences and live together
peacefully. We're also helping to bring peace to
Bosnia. The Dayton agreement and our decision to join
in the international effort to secure the peace in
Bosnia has given the people of the former Yugoslavia
a chance to rebuild their lives. After four long
years of horrible violence, America now has the
opportunity to lead in the effort to bring lasting
peace to that war-torn country and to stabilize
Central Europe as well.
 
In Northern Ireland, I saw thousands and thousands of
children beginning to celebrate their second
Christmas season of peace. And in Haiti, they will
soon celebrate the very first peaceful transfer of
power from one democratically-elected president to
another in the history of the country. And American
leadership helped to make both those celebrations
possible.
 
The seeds of peace are also sinking deeper roots
right here in America. We just learned that last year
our murder rate dropped 12 percent, the largest
decline in 35 years. Violent crime overall is down
five percent. Now, we know our work is far from done
on too many of our mean streets -- too many of our
children still are raising themselves, not being
taught right from wrong. There is still too much
crime and violence, and it's still rising among
teenagers in many parts of the country. But we are
beginning to turn the tide. And we do know what
works.
 
Much of the success is due to efforts in communities
throughout our country to get guns off our streets
and put more police on the streets, and to give our
young people something to say yes to as well as
something to say no to. More importantly it is due to
the outpouring of grass-roots community involvement
in all these efforts in the comprehensive fight
against crime and violence. 

People are getting the message that community
policing works. And it's up to every citizen to rise
up, reach out and link arms with local police to keep
their own neighborhoods safe and their schools safe.
Now, the progress we've seen is cause for hope. We
just have to keep working on it here at home.
 
From the Middle East to Northern Ireland, to our
troops in Bosnia, to our toughest neighborhoods,
America is leading the way to peace and
reconciliation. All around the world billions of
people look to America as a model of democracy and
freedom. And we should see ourselves as others see
us. We should finish the job of balancing the budget
and reopening the government in the spirit of
cooperation and unity so that we can continue to grow
and prosper together and be a force in the world for
peace and freedom. That is the spirit of the season
and the spirit of America.
 
Let each of us resolve to do what we can to be
peacemakers. Let us bring peace to every child who
deserves to be free from violence and full of hope.
And as we celebrate the birth of a child whose only
shelter was the straw of a manger, let us remember
the words of the Prince of Peace who said, "Blessed
are the peacemakers." We ask the blessings of this
peace for everyone. That is our prayer this
Christmas.
 
Thanks for listening.

-DISTINCT: Distinct and Tandem simplify server system
management

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-DISTINCT: Distinct and
Tandem simplify server system management
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:231295

Saratoga, CA -- Distinct Corporation the industry
leader of software development tools in the TCP/IP
and Internet environment announced that Tandem
Computers will be incorporating technology from
Distinct Corporation for their new software product,
Distributed Systems Management/NonStop Operations for
Windows (DSM/NOW). Distinct's TCP/IP Software
Development Kit provides the telnet communication
connectivity in Tandems new endeavor in
software-based systems management under the windows
environment. 

DSM/NOW will make it possible to manage a Nonstop
Himalaya server or a network of servers from a single
workstation using Microsoft Windows. The integration
of Distinct's customized telnet interface allows the
user to seamlessly access the Himalaya server from
any remote attached workstation.

"When we wanted to add a telnet interface to our
product, we turned to Distinct," said Paul Calhoun,
Area Product Manager of Tandem Computers
Incorporated. "By licensing rather than developing

(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:261295

Rockland, MA - Charles River Media announces Internet
WatchDog for PC and Macintosh computers. Designed for
managers, parents and teachers, Internet WatchDog is
a productivity and monitoring tool for the Internet
and personal computers. Internet WatchDog does not
censor what is being displayed, rather it makes a
record for later viewing by authorized individuals.
This multipurpose utility provides detailed
monitoring of any PC or Macintosh. For the first
time, parents, teachers and employers will be able to
view the activities taking place on their computers
without arbitrarily limiting access to the Internet
or creating a false sense of security by simply
"blocking" certain sites or keywords. As new sites
are added to the Internet everyday, it is impossible
to "block" unsuitable Internet activity. Internet
WatchDog allows the parent, teacher or employer to
monitor computer use - much like a telephone bill
enables the caller to see a listing of phone numbers.

Developed by Algorithm Inc., Internet WatchDog
functions by capturing screen and other information
"intelligently" while the computer is running. You
will be able to review a grid-like screen with a
series of thumbnail screen captures. For a closer
look, you can see any screen capture full-size just
by clicking on it. In addition, Internet WatchDog
records usage of all software applications - Internet
related or other computer activity. A password is
required to access the monitoring capabilities of the
program, and any attempt to circumvent or tamper with
the Internet WatchDog is also recorded. 

Features
* Helps you monitor the complete Internet -- Internet
WatchDog shows you all activity, regardless of the
type. Visit the World Wide Web (WWW), e-mail, file
transfer protocol (FTP), gopher, Internet relay chat
(IRC), or the ever popular material in UseNet
Newsgroups -- the Internet WatchDog is alert and
ready to go;

* Compliments existing blocking software -- Internet
WatchDog can monitor your PC computing system for
access to any of the current and/or future Internet
sites containing questionable material; 

* Includes "Tips for Parents" section on children's
use of the Internet;

* Internet WatchDog will "intelligently" determine
when to take snapshots of your screen so that
regardless of the activity (whether on-line to the
Internet or not), you will know how your computer is
being used;
* Runs in the background without interruptions;

* Tamper-evident with password protection monitors
and records any attempt to disable or elude the
program;

* Records which software applications were used and
when - Internet WatchDog can help you to determine
which programs are in use on a particular system.

* Locates graphics files - Internet WatchDog scans
the extent of your hard disk to help you find
suspicious graphics files, whether or not they are
hidden!

* Learning to use Internet WatchDog is simple - the
software includes a guided tour of features and
instructions;

* Free Technical Support - 800 number or e-mail
address.

-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE: Sugar and sweeteners
-- Situation and outlook

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE: Sugar and sweeteners -- Situation and
outlook
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Summary
World sugar production and consumption for 1995/96
are forecast at record levels of 117.9 and 116.6
million metric tons, respectively. The implied
surplus of 1.3 million tons for 1995/96, together
with a somewhat smaller surplus estimated for
1994/95, allows a modest rebuilding of global stocks
and puts downward pressure on world prices. The
surplus in 1994/95 followed 2 years of sugar
deficits.
 
Since the September Sugar and Sweetener Situation and
Outlook report, world sugar production and
consumption were revised downward by 380,000 and
450,000 tons, respectively. The modest downward
adjustment in global production reflects reduced
production prospects for the United States, India,
Pakistan, and the Philippines that more than offset
the improved outlook in Brazil, France, China, and
Thailand. Also, downward revisions in key consuming
countries such as Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia, more
than offset increased consumption prospects by other
leading sugar users, mainly Mexico and Thailand.
 
With world stocks and the stocks-to-consumption ratio
expected to rise, world prices could face downward
pressure. The spot price in late 1995 is more than 2
cents a pound below a year ago. Prices averaged 11.94
cents a pound (Contract No. 11, spot basis) in
October, 11.96 cents in November, and 12.39 cents for
the first 11 market days of December (through
December 15). 

Brazil's sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated at
a record 13.0 million tons, up 5 percent from last
season because more cane is being used for sugar and
less for fuel alcohol. The increase in sugar
production, driven by the demand for exports,
occurred in the Center-South region. Sugar production
in the Northeast is forecast unchanged from last
season. Many processing facilities that had produced
only alcohol have been converted to regular sugar
mills with annexed distilleries for fuel alcohol
production. Brazil now has 370 processing facilities
to produce sugar and/or fuel alcohol from sugarcane.
About 25 produce only sugar, about 145 produce only
fuel alcohol, and 200 produce both sugar and alcohol.
Brazil's sugar consumption is forecast at 8.1 million
tons, the highest in Latin America and the fifth
highest in the world behind only India, the European
Union (EU), the United States and China. Brazil's raw
and refined sugar exports are forecast at a record
4.8 million tons, the world's largest.
 
U.S. sugar production for fiscal 1995/96
(October-September) is forecast at 7.49 million short
tons, raw value, down 5.5 percent from the record
outturn achieved in 1994/95. U.S. sugarbeet
production is expected to total 28.9 million tons, a
decrease of 10 percent from 1994. Area for harvest,
at 1.42 million acres, is 1.2 percent below last
year. The average yield, forecast at 20.3 tons per
acre, is 1.9 tons below last year. A cool, wet spring
got the 1995 sugarbeet crop off to a poor start and
lowered expectations. Yield-reducing disease problems
in Michigan and late season harvest problems in parts
of the Great Plains and in southern Minnesota, have
caused USDA to reduce the beet sugar forecast from
the September estimate by 300,000 tons to 4.1 million
tons, raw value, 393,000 tons less than the record
1994/95 crop. 

The decline in the beet sugar forecast is partially
offset by an increase in the forecast for cane sugar
production to 3.39 million tons, up 140,000 tons from
earlier forecasts due to the improved outlook for
sugarcane yields in Louisiana and Texas. Despite
these upward revisions, the overall outlook for cane
sugar is expected to be down slightly from 1994/95,
reflecting a further contraction in the Hawaiian
sugar industry.
 
The U.S. sugar consumption forecast remains unchanged
at 9.4 million short tons, raw value, up 90,000 tons
or about 1.0 percent from 1994/95. Demand growth
appears to be running only slightly ahead of
population growth, compared with the 1.6 percent
growth rate of recent years. Reduced demand growth is
attributed to encroachment of high fructose corn
syrup (HFCS) into traditional sugar markets and
weaker demand for confectionery and bakery
products--major industrial users of sugar. Sugar use
expanded an average of 164,000 tons per year over the
last decade (fiscal 1985/86-1994/95), following the
major contraction in sugar use in the early 1980's
due to the substitution of HFCS for sugar in soft
drinks.
 
Reacting to a tight supply situation and firm prices,
the Secretary of Agriculture, on November 9,
increased the fiscal 1995/96 tariff-rate-quota (TRQ)
for raw cane sugar by 330,693 short tons (300,000
metric tons). This action raised the TRQ to 1.56
million short tons, and total supply (carryin stocks,
production, and imports) to 11.0 million tons,
comparable with the 11.1 million forecast in
September. 
 
U.S. raw cane sugar prices averaged 23.21 cents a
pound in September and 22.67 cents in October
(Contract No. 14, nearby futures), more than 1 cent
above the level for the same months in 1994. Since
the quota increase, prices have remained firm,
averaging 22.60 cents a pound for November and 22.64
cents for the first 11 market days of December. As
indicated in USDA's press release of November 9
announcing the quota change, USDA will continue
monitoring import requirements and will adjust the
TRQ accordingly. 

Total U.S. corn sweetener use is expected to reach
11.2 million tons in fiscal year 1995/96 of which
U.S. production is expected to supply 98 percent. The
United States supplements domestically produced corn
sweetener supplies with imports, mainly from Canada.
USDA forecasts HFCS consumption at 8.0 million tons,
up 3.9 percent from 1994/95. The consumption forecast
for HFCS is based on projections of deliveries from
domestic production and imports. Using a U.S.
population of 269.2 million (including Puerto Rico),
domestic HFCS use is forecast at 59.3 pounds in
fiscal 1995/96, up from 57.7 pounds for last year,
and 45.2 pounds a decade ago. Per capita sugar
consumption is forecast somewhat higher at 64.6
pounds, refined basis.

HFCS-55 and HFCS-42 list prices averaged 18.96 and
16.92 cents a pound, dry weight basis, respectively,
for the period October 1994 through May 1995. For the
June through September period, prices for HFCS-55
averaged 18.51 cents a pound, and HFCS-42 prices
averaged 16.62 cents. In the past, prices moved up
sharply during the summer due to the high demand for
HFCS from the beverage sector which pushed processing
capacity to the limit. However, this past summer,
while demand was strong due to unusually hot summer
temperatures in many parts of the country, prices did
not move up. This reflects added corn sweetener
processing capacity--as much as 25 percent according
to some estimates--that has come on line in the last
year. With the very sharp downturn in this season's
corn crop, higher HFCS prices have increased. HFCS-55
prices averaged 19.68 cents a pound in October, and
20.84 cents in November and for the first 2 weeks of
December. For fiscal 1994/95, wholesale HFCS-55
averaged 18.81 cents a pound compared with 25.26
cents for refined beet sugar. The 6.45 cent price
spread between HFCS and refined beet sugar for
1994/95 contrasts to the 2.73 cents the year before.
For fiscal 1995/96, it is likely that the price
spread between HFCS-55 and sugar will narrow
somewhat. 
 
World Sugar
Overview
World sugar production and consumption for 1995/96
are forecast at 117.9 and 116.6 million metric tons,
respectively. 1/, 2/ The implied surplus of 1.3
million tons for 1995/96, together with a somewhat
smaller surplus estimated for 1994/95, allows a
modest rebuilding of global stocks. The surplus in
1994/95 followed 2 years of sugar deficits (figure
1). With world stocks expected to be higher coupled
with a higher stocks-to-consumption ratio, world
prices could face downward pressure. Current spot
prices are 12.4 cents a pound, more than 2 cents
below a year ago. 
 
Since the September Sugar and Sweetener Situation and
Outlook report, world sugar production and
consumption were revised downward by 380,000 and
450,000 tons, respectively. The modest downward
adjustment in global production reflects reduced
production prospects for the United States, India,
Pakistan, and the Philippines that more than offset
the improved outlook in Brazil, France, China, and
Thailand. Also, downward revisions in key consuming
countries such as Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia, more
than offset increased consumption prospects by other
leading sugar users, mainly Mexico and Thailand.
 
Production
World Record Production Forecast 
 
The 1995/96 estimate of world sugar production is a
record 117.9 million tons, raw value, 2 percent above
the revised 1994/95 outturn of 115.6 million, and 1
percent above the previous record of 116.4 million
set in 1991/92. This production forecast is less than
many other analysts are forecasting because USDA
expects India's output to decline. Sugar produced
from sugarcane is estimated at a record 81.5 million
tons, up marginally from a year ago. Sugar processed
from sugarbeets is estimated at 36.4 million tons, up
5 percent from last season.
 
Over the past decade cane, sugar production has been
trending up. The expansion from an average of 66.4
million tons annually during the second half of the
1980's, to more than 80 million tons the last 2
years, is largely attributed to growth in harvested
area. In contrast, yields and recovery rates have
been fairly steady at around 60 to 61 tons per
hectare and 10 percent, respectively. For 1995/96,
USDA estimates that a record 12.8 million hectares of
sugarcane for sugar will be harvested around the
globe compared with 10.9 million in the late 1980's
(figure 2). Among the major producing countries
contributing to the global expansion have been
Australia, Brazil, India, Pakistan, and Thailand.
 
Beet sugar area, in contrast, has generally declined
to a decade low of 7.7 million hectares in 1995/96,
compared with 8.6 million in the second half of the
1980's. The downturn was largely in the Russian
Federation and Ukraine. Higher recovery rates
reflecting improved seeds, heightened use of
production inputs, and greater factory efficiencies
somewhat offset the area decline. 

Production Prospects in Selected Countries:
Mexico--Sugar production during 1995/96 is forecast
at 4.3 million tons, down 7 percent from last
season's record output of 4.6 million. The decrease
primarily reflects the return to a more normal cane
yield of 72.5 tons per hectare, following last
season's unusually high yield of 78.4 tons per
hectare.
 
Brazil--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated at
13.0 million tons, up 5 percent from last season
because more cane is being used for sugar and less
for fuel alcohol. The increase in sugar production,
driven by the demand for exports, occurred in the
Center-South region. Sugar production in the
Northeast is forecast unchanged from last season.
Many processing facilities that had produced only
alcohol have been converted to regular sugar mills
with annexed distilleries for fuel alcohol
production. Brazil has 370 processing facilities to
produce sugar and/or fuel alcohol from sugarcane.
About 25 produce only sugar, about 145 produce only
fuel alcohol, and 200 produce both sugar and alcohol.
 
Cuba--The 1995/96 estimate pegs sugar output at 4.0
million tons, up 21 percent from last season's 50
year low of 3.3 million. The turnaround is due to the
increased availability of inputs, such as fuel,
fertilizers, chemicals, and replacement parts for
machinery. The inputs were financed by foreign loans,
secured by the anticipated increase in sugar output. 

European Union (EU)--Sugar production during the
1995/96 season is estimated up 3 percent from last
year, to 17.0 million tons, because of a 2-percent
increase in harvested area and improved yields. In
France, sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated up
5 percent, to 4.6 million tons, accounting for 27
percent of the EU total. The increase is due to a
5-percent increase in harvested area. For the second
consecutive year, France suffered through a hot, dry
summer which hit the sugarbeet growing areas
particularly hard. This limited beet growth and
resulted in a smaller-than-average beet weight.
However, because planting conditions were nearly
ideal, a record number of beets were sown per
hectare. In Germany, the EU's second largest
producer, sugar production during 1995/96 is
estimated at 4.2 million tons, 5 percent above last
year. The upturn reflects a 3-percent increase in
harvested area and a 5-percent increase in the
average beet yield. Although the hot summer weather
throughout the EU did not cause major damage to the
bulk of the beet crop, beets grown in the sandy-soil
regions of northern and eastern Germany were
adversely affected by the heat. Rains during the
latter part of August helped to offset part of the
moisture deficit.
 
Russia--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated at
1.9 million tons, 15 percent above 1994/95. Sugarbeet
production for 1995/96 is forecast at 19.0 million
tons, up 36 percent from a year ago. The increase in
sugarbeet production is due to a 38-percent increase
in beet yield per hectare compared with 1994/95,
which returns Russia's average beet yield to a more
normal level.
 
Ukraine--Sugar production for 1995/96 increased from
last season's drought-reduced crop, but remains well
below pre-independence levels because of a shortage
of farm equipment, low availability and high price
for farm chemicals, and poor maintainence of
sugarbeet factories.
 
China--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated up 8
percent, to 6.5 million tons, because of a
significant expansion in sugarbeet and sugarcane
area. In Guangxi, the province in China that produces
the largest volume of sugarcane, the area planted to
sugarcane increased 53,400 hectares; in Yunnan,
another major producing province, planted area is up
15,400 hectares. In total, the area harvested for
sugarcane is estimated up 8 percent from last season,
and sugar from cane is estimated up 6 percent to 5.3
million tons. China's 1995/96 sugar production from
beets is estimated up 20 percent from last year to
1.2 million tons. Harvested beet area is forecast up
16 percent over last year, to 672,000 hectares. The
increase in sugarbeet area is taking place primarily
in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Provinces. With a per
hectare yield 4 times higher than that of
Heilongjiang Province, Xinjiang is expected to
replace Heilongjiang as the largest producer of
sugarbeets this year. 

India--Sugar output is forecast to decrease in
1995/96 to 15.2 million tons, down 7 percent from the
record 1994/95 sugar crop of 16.3 million tons. A
month delay in the onset of the 1995 monsoon season
in many areas, combined with variable rainfall in key
growing states will likely lower cane yields. Also,
in 1995/96, the Indian government is expected to lift
gur (crude brown non-centrifugal sugar) stock holding
limits, which will likely decrease the volume of cane
diverted to centrifugal sugar production. Moreover,
cane diversion to the production of khandsari (a low
recovery centrifugal sugar) is expected to decrease
again in 1995/96, due to reduced demand for this
product from the alcohol industry. Overall, undefined
market and policy factors, such as those that
determine the diversion of sugarcane between gur and
centrifugal sugar, including khandsari, will play a
significant role in determining the final mill sugar
production level in 1995/96. Despite the expected
downturn, India is forecast to be the world's largest
sugar producer (excluding the EU).
 
Thailand--Sugar production for the 1995/96 season is
estimated at a record 5.7 million tons, up 5 percent
from 1994/95 because beneficial rainfall is likely to
result in a record-breaking sugarcane crop of 54.0
million tons. Additionally, crop quality is improving
in Thailand as growers increasingly switch to new
varieties that have higher sucrose content. The
number of factories in Thailand remains stable at 46
because the Government banned construction of
additional mills. However, the Government has given
permission to expand crushing capacities and to
relocate mills. As a result of this policy,
Thailand's milling capacity has greatly expanded. In
addition, a number of mills have been relocated from
cane-deficit zones in the Central and Eastern regions
to cane-surplus zones in the Northern and
Northeastern regions.
 
Australia--Sugar output for 1995/96 is estimated at
4.9 million tons, down 3 percent from last season's
record of 5.1 million. The area harvested in 1995/96
is pegged at 373,000 hectares, up 9,000 hectares from
last season. However, dry weather in some growing
areas reduced the volume of sugarcane produced. And,
unseasonal rains, which closed more than half of
Australia's mills for nearly 3 weeks midway through
the processing season, reduced the sugar content of
the harvested cane. Nevertheless, the decline in
sugar production in the drought-affected southern
growing regions during 1995/96 will be more than
offset by increased production in the expanding
Burdekin and northern growing areas (figure 3).
 
Consumption
Global Consumption Forecast Lowered
World sugar consumption in 1995/96 has been revised
down to 116.6 million tons, about 450,000 tons below
the September forecast. Slower than expected growth
in domestic sugar demand in Brazil, Russia, and
Indonesia account for most of the revisions.
Nevertheless, the revised record 1995/96 world sugar
consumption forecast is 2.1 million tons or 1.8
percent above the 1994/95 estimate. Increased sugar
consumption is expected in countries in Central and
South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The
rise is due to a mix of factors, including lower
prices, higher consumer incomes, population growth,
and rising demand for sugar containing products such
as soft drinks and processed foods. In Asia, which
today accounts for over 30 percent of world sugar
use, sugar consumption has increased more than 20
percent over the last decade, from 27.8 million tons
in 1985/86 to a forecast of 40.0 million in 1995/96
(figure 4).
 
Over the last decade, global sugar consumption growth
has been about 1.2 percent per year, down from 2
percent from the previous decade. In contrast to the
overall growth in global sugar consumption,
year-to-year growth has been weak or non-existent in
many of the world's industrialized economies in North
America, Europe, and Japan where population growth is
slow, sugar markets are mature, and alternative
caloric sweeteners and high intensity sweeteners are
popular. For 1995/96, sugar consumption growth in the
United States is forecast at only 1 percent, while
Canada's use is expected to decline due to increased
use of lower priced corn sweeteners and a fall-off in
exports of sugar containing products. The EU's sugar
use is relatively stagnant at 14.0 million tons, as
is Japan's at 2.4 million. 
In Central Europe and the countries of the former
Soviet Union, sugar consumption forecasts are
relatively unchanged between 1994/95 and 1995/96, but
are sharply lower compared with the late 1980's or
early 1990's. Many of these formerly centrally
planned economies continue to undergo painful
economic transitions, increased retail sugar prices,
and high unemployment. 

Trade
Trade Forecast Raised
The 1995/96 world sugar trade forecast was revised up
2 percent to 31.3 million tons. Increased export
prospects in Brazil, Ukraine, Thailand, and Cuba
account for most of the higher 1995/96 sugar trade
forecast, which is almost 1 million tons more than
the revised 1994/95 trade estimates. World sugar
trade in 1994/95 was revised due to higher export
availabilities in the EU and India.
 
Larger sugar export supplies in 1995/96 in Brazil,
Thailand, Cuba, Ukraine, and Guatemala will likely
account for most of the increase in world sugar
exports this season. These countries' higher exports
should offset lower forecasts for leading exporters
such as Australia and the EU. Anticipated lower sugar
production in Australia could hamper its export
availabilities, while the need to rebuilt stocks will
limit the EU's sugar shipments. In recent years,
Brazil, Thailand, and Australia have substituted for
decreased Cuban sugar exports in world markets
(figure 5).
 
Increased sugar imports in the United States, Russia,
and the Philippines will be a major factor in the
anticipated increase in world sugar trade in 1995/96.
China will continue to be a major importer.
 
The structure of world sugar trade continues to be
highly concentrated on the export side compared with
imports. The top six exporters for 1990/91-
1994/95--EU, Australia, Brazil, Thailand, Cuba, and
Ukraine--accounted for about 70 percent of world
exports. The top six importers--Russian Federation,
EU, China, United States, Japan, and South
Korea--accounted for about 40 percent of global
imports.
 
Total sugar trade over the past decade has oscillated
within a fairly narrow band between 27 and 33 million
tons. Nonetheless, sugar continues to be among the
world's most heavily traded agricultural commodities.
In 1994/95, about 26 percent of world sugar
production was traded, compared with 5 percent of
paddy rice, 21 percent of wheat, 14 percent of corn,
and 25 percent of soybeans. In contrast, 81 percent
of coffee production was traded. By volume, the 30
million tons of sugar traded in 1994/95 was exceeded
only by wheat (96 million) and corn (58 million), and
was about equal to soybean trade (31 million).
 
Of the roughly 30 million tons of sugar traded last
year about half was raw cane sugar and the other half
refined beet and cane sugar. Major raw cane sugar
exporters are Australia, Brazil, Cuba, South Africa,
and Thailand. Their markets include the United
States, Japan, and the EU and a wide set of other
countries--some of which import raw cane sugar and
reexport refined sugar--such as China, South Korea,
and also the United States. The EU has been the major
supplier of refined sugar, but in recent years
countries such as Brazil and Turkey have become
important sources of supply. Leading markets for
refined sugar continue to be the Middle East and the
Russian Federation. Over the past decade, refined
sugar trade has grown from about 9 million tons or 35
percent of world trade to about 15 million tons or 50
percent of the global sugar market last year.
 
Stocks and Prices
USDA forecasts stocks at the end of 1995/96 at 20.8
million tons, the highest since 1992/93. The
stocks-to-use ratio is forecast at 17.9 percent, up
from a low of 16.4 percent 2 years ago (figure 6).
Prospects of large crops this year will facilitate
the rebuilding of stocks in a number of countries,
including the EU, particularly France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Argentina, Colombia, and Zimbabwe. China
and India's stocks are expected to be large, allowing
China to reduce imports and India to export.
 
World spot prices for raw sugar (f.o.b. Caribbean
contract No. 11) averaged 12.39 cents a pound for the
first 11 market days of December (through December
15), compared with 11.94 and 11.96 cents a pound in
October and November. This compares with prices a
year ago of 14.57 for the first half of December, and
12.75 and 13.88 cents for October and November. 

Prices are likely to weaken into the spring due to
the outlook for a record 1995/96 global sugar crop,
and a further buildup in world sugar stocks. A
forecast record 1995/96 crop in Thailand and reduced
sugar consumption in Russia will make them key
countries to watch. Prospects for record 1995/96
global sugar consumption, relatively low world sugar
carryover stocks, possible higher imports by Russia,
larger 1995/96 imports by the United States, and
strong Middle Eastern import demand, could provide
support to futures prices in the next few months.
 
Analyzing world sugar prices for the past decade,
USDA data indicate years of low prices--6.0 cents a
pound in 1985/86 and 1986/87--coinciding with a
build-up of world stocks and 2 years--1989/90 and
1994/95--when prices moved up to near 14 cents a
pound when stocks were drawn down. However, a major
price spike did not occur, in fact the last major
price increase occurred in 1981/82 when world prices
averaged around 23 cents a pound. USDA believes the
conditions which led to past world sugar price spikes
have been largely removed since 1982. These changes
include:
 
* The bulk of import demand on the world market is no
longer from high-income, price-inelastic countries
but from poorer, price-elastic countries; i.e., they
have to stop buying when the price rises. o Corn
sweeteners now provide a viable substitute to sugar
in many countries (such as the United States, Japan,
and Canada). High intensity sweeteners are also a
factor in the United States, Japan, Western Europe
and China (i.e. unusally high use of saccharin in
recent years in China). The increased availability of
substitutes has greatly increased the price
elasticity of sugar demand; i.e. customers can switch
to the substitute if the prices rise. o Policy reform
has occurred in many countries (such as Australia,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Eastern Europe and
Mexico) which has increased price transmission to
internal markets.
 
Previous world sugar price spikes led to expansion of
global sugar capacity and periods of relatively low
prices. If there are no future world price spikes,
there also will not be the tendency for prices to go
as low. 

Colombia: Growth in Production and Exports
by Nydia R. Suarez*
 
*The author is an agricultural economist in the
Commercial Agriculture Division, Economic Research
Service, USDA.
 
Colombia has displayed strong sugar production growth
in the last 10 years, underpinned by expanded area,
improved yields, and increased use of varieties with
high sucrose content. Production jumped from 1.2
million tons raw value in the mid-1980's to a record
2.04 million tons in 1994/95. USDA's production
forecast for 1995/96 is 2.07 million tons. This
forecast assumes normal weather conditions and
yields, and only 1 percent growth in area. Expansion
may be slowing, as Colombian producers anticipate
lower world prices in the next few years.
 
Colombia's sugar production is concentrated in the
Cauca Valley where cane is planted and harvested year
round and cane milling is spread evenly throughout
the year. Thus, a relatively small cane milling
infrastructure is needed to produce the same amount
of sugar produced in other countries, giving Colombia
a competitive advantage. Colombia, Hawaii, and Peru
are the only places in the world that cultivate
sugarcane year round, Colombia being the largest
producer. Colombian farmers have continued their
efforts to raise yields to boost overall production
with the aid of the Cenicana Research Institute.
Sugar area cannot be expanded much more without a
drop in average yields. This is why the trend toward
greater use of disease-resistant cane varieties
continues. Experts in the field forecast that by the
year 2000 more than 60 percent of the centrifugal
sugarcane area will be planted to a variety that is
highly resistant to both rust and smut diseases.
Also, cane and sugar yield for this variety are
higher than the older varieties, and sugar extraction
yields are reportedly 12 percent higher. Colombia has
one of the highest productivity rates and one of the
lowest costs in the world. Colombia has consistently
been among the world's most efficient producers and
possesses one of the world's most competitive sugar
industries. According to cost data developed by LMC
International, Colombia ranked 6th among 62 world
sugarcane producing countries during the period
1987/88-91/92. From 1979/80 to 1991/92, Colombia
enjoyed total production costs that were nearly 25
percent lower than the global cane average.
Colombia's average factory costs were the lowest in
the world in 1987/88-91/92 due to its year-round
milling. Colombia also performs well at the field
level. Average field costs in 1987/88 to 1991/92 were
the 8th lowest among 62 world sugarcane producing
countries. This compared with a ranking of 26th from
1983/84 to 1987/88.
 
Besides centrifugal sugar, Colombia produces crude,
non-centrifugal sugar called panela. Although area
planted to cane for panela is almost 2 times larger
than the area for centrifugal sugar, panela
production is only two-thirds of the amount of
centrifugal sugar. Cane for panela production is
grown mostly by small farmers using traditional
methods. Their yields cannot compare with those
obtained by large commercial producers of cane for
centrifugal sugar who have access to modern
technology, equipment, and disease resistant
varieties. 
 
Colombia's centrifugal sugar consumption for 1994/95
is estimated at 1.22 million tons, up 3 percent from
the previous year and 6 percent higher than the
1985/86-89/90 average. In addition to the population
growth, sugar use increased because sugar retail
prices increased less than the growth in the consumer
price index. For 1995/96 and the next 3-5 years,
consumption is expected to increase about 2 percent
per year, the same as the population growth rate. In
addition, Colombia consumed more than 1 million tons
of panela. This amount varies with the price of
panela vis-a-vis white sugar. In September 1991,
panela and white sugar prices were the same, but 2
years later, the panela price was 24 percent lower
and by 1995, the difference is forecast at 40
percent. Another factor that affects consumption is
the unemployment rate. As it declines consumption of
white sugar increases as disposable income increases. 
 
Colombian sugar exports currently account for about
one-third of total output. Colombia began exporting
raw sugar in 1961 when world prices were attractive
and the country had plenty of exportable sugar.
Stimulated by favorable world prices, Colombia's
sugar exports grew steadily until 1982, and then
began to fall as world prices dropped. In 1987
exports were only 96,000 tons or 55 percent lower
than the previous year. Sugar exports during 1985-89
averaged a little more than 230,000 tons per year,
with the United States receiving almost two-thirds of
the total.
 
A shift in export distribution occurred in 1991 when
the Andean-Pact countries opened their borders to
certain products, including sugar. Exports to
Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela represent more than 50
percent of Colombia's exports for 1990-94. The United
States dropped to 26 percent. In January 1992,
Colombia and Venezuela established the Andean
region's first binational custom union to apply a
common external tariff. Colombia and Venezuela's
bilateral trade accord for several agricultural
commodities was expanded by the Group of Three (G3)
Agreement to include Mexico. Under this Agreement,
the Colombian Government is negotiating with Mexico
over the possibility of exporting Colombia sugar to
Mexico duty free in exchange for a gradual reduction
of Colombian import tariffs for fruits, vegetables,
pulses, and orange juice imported from Mexico. Major
changes in Colombia's trade policy orientation are
expected from either future NAFTA accession or
participation in a Western Hemisphere Trade
Agreement.
 
U.S. Sweeteners
Overview
U.S. Sweetener Market Expands
 
The U.S. caloric sweetener complex, the world's
largest and most diverse in terms of consumer
products, continues to expand in quantity and
variety. Use of refined sugar, corn sweeteners (HFCS,
glucose, and dextrose), honey, maple syrup, and
edible molasses in 1995, will likely total 19.7
million short tons, compared with 19.3 million last
year, and 15.5 million in 1985. This expansion
reflects growth in the U.S. population (including
Puerto Rico) to over 269 million in 1995, up from 242
million in 1985; increased income; and changes in
consumer lifestyles and tastes.
 
Total per capita use of caloric sweeteners in the
United States is forecast at 148 pounds in 1995,
compared with 146 last year, and 128 in 1985. Refined
sugar use in 1995 is expected to account for 43.7
percent of the total per capita use or 64.6 pounds,
while corn sweeteners should represent 55.3 percent
or 81.8 pounds. Growth of corn sweetener use per
capita continues to outpace the growth of sugar use,
a trend established over the last decade. 

In addition, caloric sweeteners are increasingly
supplemented by high- intensity (low-calorie)
sweeteners, mainly aspartame, saccharin, and
acesulfame-k. This segment of the industry is
changing rapidly because of new uses for high
intensity sweeteners approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), the prospective introduction of
new high intensity sweeteners, and growth in the
number and availability of "light" foods sweetened
with high-intensity sweeteners.
 
Domestic supplies of sweeteners are also supplemented
with imports of sugar, HFCS, honey, maple syrup, and
aspartame. Import levels change from year- to-year,
largely based on weather-related production
conditions, prices, and Government policy. U.S.
sweeteners are also exported in significant
quantities. For calendar 1994, U.S. exports of
refined sugar totaled 480,000 tons, raw value; HFCS,
118,000 tons; honey 8.3 million pounds; and maple
syrup, 569,000 gallons. 
 
The U.S. sweetener industry also generates valuable
byproducts. From the U.S. beet and cane sugar
industry, the key byproducts are molasses, beet pulp,
and bagasse from sugarcane milling. Domestically
produced molasses is used as an animal feed. Imports
supplement domestic supplies. Imports of industrial
or feed molasses were at a record 1.8 million tons
last year, but are expected to fall in 1995 due to
increased demand and higher prices in Asia and
Europe. A large share of beet pulp production is
shipped to Asian markets. Bagasse is mainly used as
mill fuel. The corn wet milling process, in addition
to sweeteners, produces the byproducts of corn oil,
corn gluten meal, and corn gluten feed. Corn gluten
feed, in particular, has a large market in the EU.
 
U.S. Sugar
Production
Beet Sugar Production Lower
U.S. sugar production for fiscal 1995/96
(October-September) is forecast at 7.49 million short
tons, raw value, down 5.5 percent from the record
outturn achieved in 1994/95. U.S. sugarbeet
production is expected to total 28.9 million tons, a
decrease of 10 percent from 1994. Area for harvest,
at 1.42 million acres, is down 1.2 percent from last
year. The average yield, forecast at 20.3 tons per
acre, is 1.9 tons below last year. A cool, wet spring
got the 1995 sugarbeet crop off to a poor start and
lowered expectations. Yield-reducing disease problems
in Michigan and late season harvest problems in parts
of the Great Plains and in southern Minnesota, have
caused USDA to reduce the beet sugar forecast from
the September estimate by 300,000 tons to 4.1 million
tons, raw value, 55 percent of U.S. sugar production
and 393,000 tons less than the record 1994/95 crop. 

The decline in the beet sugar forecast is partially
offset by an increase in the cane sugar forecast to
3.39 million tons, up 140,000 tons from an earlier
forecast due to the improved outlook for sugarcane
yields in Louisiana and Texas. Despite these upward
revisions, the overall outlook for cane sugar is
expected to be down slightly from 1994/95, reflecting
a further contraction in the Hawaiian sugar industry.
 
Over the past decade (fiscal 1985/86 - 1994/95), the
growth trend for U.S. beet sugar production has been
128,000 tons per year, while the growth trend for
cane sugar production has been 20,000 tons per year
(figures 7 and 8). Beet sugar has increased its share
of U.S. sugar production from 49 percent in 1985/86
to a record 57 percent in 1994/95. Growth in beet
acreage in the upper Midwest States of Minnesota and
North Dakota has been a major contributing factor in
the expansion of U.S. beet sugar production (figure
9). Cane sugar's reduced share is largely due to the
sharp contraction in Hawaii's production (figure 10).
 
Developments in the Beet Sugar Producing Region
For the 1995 Crop 3/

3/ The sugarcane harvest is still underway in all
sugarcane producing States. Detailed analysis of the
crop will appear in the March 1996 Sugar and
Sweetener report.

The 1995/96 sugarbeet harvest has been completed with
the exception of the upcoming spring harvest in
California. As of mid-December, beet processors
outside California are continuing their slicing
campaigns largely from piled beets. The major
remaining threat to the crop would be possible
deterioration of sucrose levels in beet piles over
the next several months due to alternating freezing
and thawing of piles which can occur during wide
swings in temperatures. This season's harvested
tonnage and sucrose levels were adversely affected by
weather and crop disease problems. Developments in
the various growing regions are as follows:
 
Great Lakes--Sugarbeet acreage in Michigan and Ohio
for 1995/96 was 204,200 acres, up marginally from
last year due to increased acreage in Michigan that
offsets a decline in Ohio. Yields were expected to
average 16.0 tons per acre, comparable with last
year, but 4 tons below the national average. Industry
sources indicate that sucrose content was 16.4 to
17.5 percent. USDA estimates total tonnage to be
processed at 3.28 million tons. Regional sugarbeet
processing plants concentrated in the Saginaw Valley
of Michigan (five) and Fremont, Ohio (one) began
their slicing campaigns in early October and will run
through the end of January in Michigan and
mid-December in Ohio. 

Agronomically, the 1995 crop proved challenging.
Significant spring rains in April and May delayed
plantings. However, beet emergence was excellent and
combined with closer seed spacing, provided above
average beet populations. Climatic conditions through
the summer months provided below normal precipitation
and above normal temperatures. Coupled with a heavy
infestation of root aphids in the Michigan growing
area, these conditions had a negative effect on
yields and beet quality. Despite wet conditions and
temperatures that were alternately too warm or too
cold, about 80 percent of the harvest was completed
by November 1. Most of the remaining beets were
harvested under wet and freezing conditions during
the first 3 weeks of November.
 
Red River Valley and Southern Minnesota--Sugarbeet
harvested area in Minnesota and North Dakota is
estimated by USDA at a record 625,000 acres for
1995/96, up 2 percent from the previous season and
equal to 44 percent of the national beet acreage.
Yields, however, are down in Minnesota by 10 percent
to 18.5 tons per acre and 9 percent in North Dakota
to 19.3 tons reflecting generally adverse conditions
both at planting and harvest. Total beet tonnage
harvested for the two States is estimated at 11.7
million tons versus 12.7 million tons for 1994/95.
Processing of the crop is underway at six beet
factories in the Red River Valley and one at an
adjacent area in southwestern Minnesota. The last
processing plant in the region is expected to
complete its slicing campaign by mid-April.
 
In the Red River Valley the 1995 planting season
experienced a late start due to excessive soil
moisture and wet spring weather. To offset expected
yield reduction due to late plantings, acreage was
increased 3 percent. After planting was completed in
late May, warm, humid weather with frequent rains
prevailed through August and September. Reflecting
the warm and moist soil conditions, root rot diseases
such as aphanomyces and rhizoctonia were more
prevalent this year. Also, cercospora leafspot
infections were reported to be the most severe since
the early 1980's. Restricted harvest started in
mid-September and full harvest started the first week
of October. Sugar content was negatively influenced
by excessive rainfall during harvest, an early
killing frost (September 23), and heavy cercospora
pressure. 

In the southwestern Minnesota growing area, wet
conditions in the spring delayed plantings. For
example, by May 2 only 13 percent of the crop was
planted versus the normal 52 percent. As a result,
yield expectations were reduced due to a lack of
significant early planted acres. Compounding the slow
start of the crop, heavy rains during late June and
early July caused severe retardation of root
development. In the summer months, temperature and
humidity conditions were ideal for development of
cercospora leafspot. Despite multiple applications of
fungicides, significant leaf damage resulted from the
intense infection which further reduced yield and
sugar accumulation.
 
Harvest was delayed until mid-September to allow the
crop additional time to mature. October was
punctuated with additional rainstorms, and finally
three snowstorms near the final week. Several growers
were unable to complete harvest before the soil froze
to a depth of 4 to 6 inches. This resulted in
additional lost acres and reduced tonnage, not all of
which are reflected in current USDA data.
 
Northwest--The Idaho and Oregon 1995/96 sugarbeet
crops were harvested from 216,000 acres, marginally
lower than 1994/95. Yields are estimated at 25 tons
per acre, down more than 2 tons from last year. USDA
estimates beet tonnage at 4.95 million tons for
Idaho, down 12 percent from last year's record, and
464,000 tons in Oregon, comparable with last year.
The slicing campaigns got underway at the region's
four plants (three in Idaho and one in eastern
Oregon) in mid-September and are expected to be
finished by early February.
 
A wetter-than-normal spring delayed plantings
somewhat. However, the wet conditions were favorable
for germination and crop establishment, resulting in
very good stands and high per-acre populations.
Cooler-than-normal temperatures prevailed throughout
the growing season and resulted in considerably
below-normal heat unit accumulation for the season.
While this retarded crop development, it also reduced
irrigation water demand. In addition, the season's
coolness created conditions less favorable for
yield-reducing rhizomania's development. Weather
during harvest was nearly ideal, facilitating a
relatively smooth harvest season and enabling beets
to go into storage piles for processing in good
condition.
 
In addition to the traditional growing areas, the
Northwest has a relatively new growing area in the
Moses Lake section of central Washington.
Approximately 7,500 acres were harvested in the Moses
Lake area starting in mid-October. Yields are
reported to be over 30 tons per acre, reflecting the
area's highly fertile soil.
 
Since this growing area does not have a mill close
by, beets are shipped by rail to Nampa, Idaho, and
Hamilton City, California, for processing. But a
November 3 industry press release indicated that this
mode of processing will change in the near future.
Columbia River Sugar Company, a grower owned
sugarbeet production cooperative based in the Moses
Lake area, announced that it has completed
negotiations with Holly Sugar Corporation, to
construct and operate a sugarbeet factory in the
Moses Lake area. The factory's initial slicing
capacity when it commences operations in 1998 will be
6,000 tons per day, and its design provides for
incremental expansion should market conditions
warrant. This will represent the first new beet
processing plant to be built in the United States
since 1975. 
 
Great Plains--Sugarbeet production results in the
Great Plains are mixed. Regional sugarbeet area
harvested, including the States of Colorado, Montana,
Nebraska, Texas, and Wyoming, totals 250,600 acres,
down 2.6 percent from last year. Yields are expected
to be somewhat below normal for the region, averaging
19.5 tons per acre. Total sugarbeet tonnage is
estimated by USDA at 4.88 million tons, 17 percent of
the national total, and 9 percent below last year.
The beet slicing campaign began in late September at
the region's 11 processing facilities: Colorado, 2;
Nebraska, 3; Wyoming, 3; Montana, 2; and Texas, 1.
 
In Montana the growing season was marred by a cold,
wet spring which delayed the emergence of the
sugarbeet crop. Hail storms plagued the area during
the summer months and freezing temperatures in late
September kept sugar content from reaching the record
levels of recent years, and yields were 15 percent
below the most recent 5-year average. Total tonnage
for the State is estimated at 1.22 million tons, 6.6
percent below last year. 

The sugarbeet crops in northern and central Wyoming
were subject to similar spring conditions, but the
summer growing season was nearly ideal. However, in
southeast Wyoming poor spring planting conditions,
coupled with adverse weather through the growing
season adversely affected the sugarbeet crop, and
harvesting results were poor. State-wide sugarbeet
production for Wyoming is estimated at 1.30 million
tons, up 18 percent from last year. 

This season proved to be particularly difficult
agronomically in Nebraska and Colorado, with
year-to-year yields falling 19 percent to 16.5 tons
per acre in Nebraska and 17.7 tons in Colorado. In
both States a cold wet spring accented disease
problems with higher incidence of seedling stress,
fusarium, and rhizoctionia. At harvest both areas
were hard hit by frost in late September, especially
to the growing area in western Nebraska. With the
short crop, processing campaigns will wind up during
the first 2 weeks of January in both States. 
 
In the southern part of the Great Plains, very little
moisture was received in the growing area around
Hereford, Texas during the summer months. Yields were
slightly below normal and due to a fall-off in
acreage--19,500 acres this season versus a high of
41,000 in 1990--total sugarbeet production is
expected to be only 429,000 tons compared with nearby
500,000 tons last year and an average of 837,000 tons
for 1990-93.
 
California--Sugarbeet agriculture in California
spreads from the Imperial Valley on the border with
Mexico through the Central Valley and to the Klamath
Basin straddling the Oregon line. Sugarbeet acreage
harvested continues to decline in California and is
estimated at 114,000 this season, compared with
annual averages of 151,000 for the first 5 years of
the 1990's and 201,000 acres during the 1980's. The
downturn this year is explained by heavy rains last
spring which delayed plantings and caused some plant
loss, especially in the Sacramento Valley, and the
availability to growers of more remunerative
alternative crops.
 
The decline in area will be offset somewhat by yields
that are the highest in the nation at 27 tons per
acre. Total harvested tonnage from California grown
beets is estimated by USDA at 3.1 million tons, down
25 percent from 1994. Sugarbeets in California are
processed at six plants, one located in the Imperial
Valley and five others located in the Central Valley.
These plants also process sugarbeets from the Klamath
Basin in Oregon, Central Oregon, and Washington.
 
In the Imperial Valley, the beet crop got off to a
good start as soil temperature remained above average
until early spring. The 1995 April-July harvest was a
record, yielding over 5.5 tons of sugar per acre
compared with a national average of 3.0 tons per
acre. In the Central Valley, the fall tonnage and
sucrose content were slightly below average. Next
spring's crop will be short due to rain delays that
prevented planting. In addition, the State has
experienced its driest fall on record along with
unseasonably warm temperatures, and these
developments could affect yields.
 
Consumption
Sugar Use Growth Slows
The U.S. sugar consumption forecast remains unchanged
at 9.4 million short tons, raw value, up 90,000 tons
or about 1.0 percent from 1994/95. Demand is forecast
to run only slightly ahead of the 0.8 percent annual
population growth, compared with the 1.6 percent
growth rate of recent years. The lower rate of growth
is attributed to encroachment of high fructose corn
syrup into traditional sugar markets and weak demand
for confectionery and bakery products--major
industrial users of sugar. Following the major
contraction in sugar use in the early 1980's due to
the substitution of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)
for sugar in soft drinks, sugar use has expanded an
average of 164,000 tons per year over the last decade
(fiscal 1985/86-1994/95), (figure 11). 
 
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995 sugar
consumption is estimated at 9.34 million tons, about
the same as use in 1993/94. Industrial users' switch
from traditional stocking patterns to just-in-time
delivery systems, which may be causing a one-time
reduction in apparent sugar deliveries. Crystalline
fructose use, while small, also may be taking some
sugar markets. Reduced transfers to sugar-containing
products for export also was a factor in 1994/95.
 
Sugar deliveries for confectionery and cereal/bakery
products in 1994/95 totaled 1.88 and 1.34 million
tons, refined value, respectively. Together these two
categories accounted for 64 percent of industrial use
and were down slightly from the year before. Growth
in sugar use by the bakery/cereal and confectionery
sectors had underpinned the growth in total sugar use
in recent years. The decline in growth in these two
key use categories is attributed to sluggish demand
for cookies, sweet goods, and confectionery,
including lower confectionery exports (figure 12).
 
Trade
Sugar Import Quota Raised
Reacting to a tight supply situation and firm prices,
the Secretary of Agriculture on November 9, increased
the fiscal 1995/96 tariff-rate-quota (TRQ) for
raw-cane sugar by 330,693 short tons (300,000 metric
tons) after the release of the monthly WASDE report.
This action raised the TRQ to 1.56 million short
tons, and raised total supply (carrying stocks,
production, and imports) to 11.0 million tons,
comparable with the 11.1 million forecast in
September as the reduction in the sugar production
forecast largely was offset by the TRQ increase.
 
According to USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, TRQ
imports for the first 2 months of fiscal 1995/96
(October 1-December 1) totaled 91,116 short tons. At
the request of several countries, USDA allowed early
entry of 1995/96 TRQ sugar. These early entries,
arriving before October 1, 1995, totaled 82,960 tons.
As of December 1, 1.395 million tons of TRQ sugar
were available for entry into the United States prior
to September 30, 1996.
 
As of December 1, 1995, all but about 200 tons of the
refined sugar tariff-rate-quota for 1995/96 set at
24,251 short tons (22,000 metric tons) had been
filled. There are also specialty sugar quotas for 23
countries, each allocated 79 tons. These specialty
quotas are not usually all filled. At the present
time several countries, including Japan and United
Kingdom, are not eligible to fill their specialty
sugar import quotas, since they have failed to give
assurance that no Cuban sugar will be transhipped in
their quota.
 
Over the past decade, the United States has remained
a major importer of sugar as growth in consumption
needs has largely offset upward trending domestic
sugar production. Total U.S. sugar imports averaged
2.0 million tons annually from 1985/86-1989/90.
Imports were composed largely of TRQ imports
averaging 1.45 million tons, and 511,000 tons of
quota-exempt imports for reexport as refined sugar or
in sugar-containing products. For the period
1990/91-1994/95, U.S. sugar imports averaged 2.1
million tons of which TRQ imports accounted for 1.6
million and quota-exempt imports 548,000 tons. 

Starting October 1, 1995 the United States has a
commitment, under the Uruguay Round Agreement, to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to allow import access
for at least 1.256 million short tons per year at the
low tariff level of the TRQ.
 
The United States also remains a small, but
consistent exporter of sugar. These exports are
largely refined sugar produced from quota-exempt raw
sugar imported, refined, and reexported. For 1994/95
total exports were 502,000 tons of which reexports
were 445,000 tons. Despite the changes in trade with
Canada, U.S. sugar reexports in 1995/96 are expected
to drop only slightly because of favorable markets
for refined sugar in other countries, and currently a
large differential between raw and refined sugar
prices on the world market. Over the last decade,
(1985/86-1994/95), U.S. sugar exports averaged
494,000 tons annually of which reexports accounted
for over 95 percent of the annual total.
 
U.S. Canada Sugar Trade Developments
On November 6, 1995, the Canadian International Trade
Tribunal (CITT) ruled that sugar imports from the
United States, certain member States of the European
Union (EU), and Korea are being dumped in Canada.
Revenue Canada found dumping and subsidies in a final
ruling in September or October. The CITT ruled in
November that the dumped and subsidized sugar
threatened to injure the Canadian sugar industry. The
CITT also found that sugar imports from the EU are
being subsidized. The investigation was initiated in
March 1995 following a petition from the Canadian
Sugar Institute, and in July, Revenue Canada
announced a preliminary finding of dumping and
subsidizing in the case and imposed provisional
anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The CITT
ruled in November that, although the imports threaten
the livelihood of Canadian sugar refiners, no damage
had yet occurred. Any duties paid since July were
refunded, but the tariffs will apply from November 6. 

The anti-dumping duties on U.S. companies exporting
sugar range from 69 to 85 percent. The duties against
Korea were dropped due to the small volume of trade
involved. It is possible that this ruling may be
appealed by parties in the United States and/or in
Canada. The ruling effectively eliminates U.S. sugar
from the Canadian market. In 1994/95 the United
States exported 158,000 tons, raw value of refined
sugar to Canada including approximately 101,000 Tons
under the reexport program.
 
Stocks and Prices
Stocks Forecast Lower
U.S. sugar stocks at the end of fiscal 1995/96
(September 30, 1996) are forecast at 1.19 million
tons, down about 3 percent from the revised estimate
for fiscal 1994/95. Stocks reflect a projected total
supply of 11.01 million tons and total use of 9.82
million. The fiscal 1995/96 stocks-to-use ratio is
forecast at 12.1 percent, compared with 12.5 percent
for 1994/95. According to USDA's stocks and price
model, a 1-percent drop in the ending stocks-to-use
ratio has historically corresponded to a 0.3-cent a
pound rise in the New York price for domestic raw
cane sugar.
 
For the year ending September 30, 1995, stocks are
estimated at 1.23 million tons. This compares with
1.45 million tons estimated in September. The 217,000
ton decline in the stock estimate can be attributed
to downward revisions in supply variables, such as
production, and upward adjustments to use variables
such as exports. From 1985/86-1994/95, end of year
stocks and the stocks-to-use ratio averaged 1.42
million tons and 15.4 percent, respectively.
 
Sugar Prices Remain Firm
U.S. raw cane prices averaged 23.21 cents a pound in
September and 22.67 cents in October (Contract No.
14, nearby futures), more than 1 cent above the level
for the same months in 1994. Since the quota
increase, prices have remained firm averaging 22.60
cents a pound for November and 22.64 cents for the
first 11 market days of December. As indicated in the
November 9 press release announcing the quota change,
USDA will continue monitoring import requirements and
will adjust the TRQ accordingly.
 
U.S. prices of raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar
have remained relatively stable over the last decade
because of the U.S. sugar program (figures 15 and
16). Raw cane sugar prices averaged 21.96 cents a
pound between 1985/86-1994/95, with a low of 20.46
cents in 1985/86 and a high of 23.29 cents in
1989/90. Wholesale refined beet sugar prices averaged
25.74 cents a pound between 1985/86-1994/95, with a
low and high of 23.30 in 1985/86 and 30.14 cents in
1989/90, respectively. U.S. retail refined sugar
prices averaged 39.31 cents annually over the 10 year
period, ranging from a low of 35.12 cents in 1986/87
to a high of 43.08 cents in 1990/91. The spreads
between the low and high years for raw cane sugar
were 2.45 cents a pound, for wholesale refined beet
sugar 6.85 cents, and for retail refined sugar 7.96
cents.
 
Costs
New USDA Estimates on Processing Costs
In the winter and spring of 1994-95, ERS contacted
all beet and cane sugar processors to collect
processing cost information for the 1992 crops. Based
on these data, processing costs for the 1993 and 1994
crops have been estimated and previously published
processing costs for 1992 have been revised. For
beets, the traditional East (Red River Valley and
eastward) and West (all other) processing regions
have been maintained. For cane, however, Louisiana
and Texas have been combined to prevent disclosure of
confidential accounting data for the one factory in
Texas.
 
In fiscal 1993/94, a record 4.55 million tons of raw
beet sugar were produced, an 11-percent increase over
1993. Costs of processing this sugar rose 3.6
percent, averaging $35.06 per net ton sliced.
However, after accounting for credits for byproducts,
net processing costs averaged $26.50, a 2.7-percent
drop from 1993. This difference is explained by
increased returns from pulp and molasses offsetting
higher, primarily fixed, processing costs. Similar
relationships were found on a cents-per-pound basis.
Total processing costs rose in 1994 but were offset
by higher credits, even with a slight drop in sugar
recovery.
 
Over the 1992-94 period, total costs per ton of beets
sliced were consistently higher in the East than in
the West. However, this can be offset by the higher
sugar recovery rates in the East. On a
cents-per-pound basis, total beet sugar processing
costs were lower in the East. In 1994, recovery rates
narrowed and, while recovery was still higher in the
East, processing costs per pound of sugar were lower
in the West. 

Raw cane sugar production for fiscal 1993/94 was up
nearly 2 percent. U.S. total processing costs for the
1994 sugarcane crop averaged $19.22 per ton, up 2.3
percent from 1993. Most of the increase was due to
increases in the costs of materials and supplies for
cane transportation and factory repairs and
maintenance. On a cents-per-pound basis, costs rose
even more (5.1 percent) due to a 2.7-percent drop in
the average sugar recovery rate. 

There was considerable cost variation across the
major sugarcane regions. Florida is the major
producer and had costs of 6.98 cents per pound,
compared with Louisiana/Texas costs of 8.26 cents and
Hawaii costs of 11.345 cents. On a percentage basis,
Louisiana/Texas had the largest increase for the year
due to a nearly 9 percent drop in recovery rate.

After subtracting credits for molasses and other
byproducts, net processing costs ranged from 6.30
cents in Florida to 9.3 cents in Hawaii, averaging
7.22 cents at the U.S. level.
 
Adjustment to Production Costs
USDA has revised its sugarcane costs and returns
estimates published in the Sugar and Sweetener report
in September to account for yields on a net ton per
harvested acre basis rather than a gross ton basis.
This change will bring the estimates into conformity
with yield estimates published by USDA's National
Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in Crop
Production reports. 

The change has two effects:
* Gross value of production (price times yield) was
revised to reflect the change in yield. This also
affects the returns estimates which are the
difference in gross value of production and either
total cash expenses or total economic costs.
 
* Costs for land were reduced in the Louisiana-Texas
region. This is due to a change in the share rent
cost which is based on the imputed gross value of
production. Per acre cash costs were not affected.
 
The estimates for 1994 still remain preliminary in
that regional sugarcane prices will not be published
by USDA until January, 1996. When 1994 prices are
published, estimates will be revised to reflect the
new estimates. Until then, 1994 prices have been kept
at their 1993 levels.
 
USDA's latest costs of sugar crop production and
processing estimates, as well as sugar crop loan
rates, are provided in tables 31-39. 

U.S. Sugar Import Duties 1/
by Ron Lord*
 
1/ The words duty and tariff are used
interchangeably.

U.S. import duties on sugar agreed to during the
Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) generally became
effective on January 1, 1995. 
 
October 1, 1995, the United States has agreed to set
an access level for sugar imported under the low duty
and the time period of the import quotas is fixed as
of October 1 through the following September 30. The
minimum low-duty tariff-rate-quota (TRQ) for raw cane
sugar is 1.231 million short tons, and for refined
sugar, 24,251 short tons, raw value. With either the
raw or refined sugar quotas, the Secretary of
Agriculture may reserve a TRQ quantity for the
importation of specialty sugars as defined by the
United States Trade Representative. The Secretary of
Agriculture has authority to set a TRQ higher (but
not lower) than the above minimum levels. For
example, on November 9, 1995, the Secretary announced
an increase in the raw cane sugar import TRQ for
1995/96 of 331,000 tons above the minimum level.
 
The low duty for raw cane sugar under quota, as
determined under Additional U.S. Note 5 of Chapter 17
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
States (HTSUS), is 0.625 cents a pound, raw value.
This duty is waived for countries under the
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the
Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and the ANDEAN
trade pact. Thus the low duty on TRQ imports is
waived for all countries currently allocated a share
of the U.S. sugar import quota except Australia,
Brazil, Gabon, and Taiwan. There is a polarization
adjustment (i.e. an adjustment of the duty for
quality differences) on the low duty. For the
purposes of subheadings 1701.11 and 1701.12, "raw
sugar" means sugar whose content of sucrose by
weight, in the dry state, corresponds to a
polarimeter reading of less than 99.5 degrees.
 
The low duty for refined sugar under the quota is
1.66 cents a pound for 100-degree sugar. There is a
polarization adjustment for refined sugar testing
less than 100 degrees.
 
Any amounts of sugar imported in excess of the
announced TRQ levels pay the high duty. The high duty
is based upon a tariff equivalent to the quotas in
place during the period 1986-88, and is scheduled to
decline by 15 percent over 6 years to the year 2000.
For raw cane sugar, the base period duty was
established at 18.08 cents a pound, and the first 2
-percent reduction which took effect January 1, 1995,
resulted in a duty of 17.62 cents a pound for 1995.
The duty will fall to 15.36 cents a pound in the year
2000. The high duty on refined sugar is about 1 cent
higher, and will fall to 16.21 cents a pound in the
year 2000. There is no polarization adjustment for
the duties on sugar imported above the TRQs, but the
United States is considering a technical revision of
the HTSUS to provide for such polarization
adjustments. 

U.S. duties on sugar imports from Mexico are covered
under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
which became effective January 1, 1994. The duty on
Mexican sugar imported under the access provisions of
NAFTA is zero, and the duty for sugar above the
access provisions is 15.20 cents a pound in 1995.
This NAFTA high duty will decline to zero by the year
2008. 

Sugar imports from Canada are composed entirely of
refined beet sugar, since Canada's export control
regime only allows domesically produced sugar to be
exported. Sugar imported from Canada under the
provisions of HTSUS Additional Note 5 faces a duty of
0.20 cents a pound in 1995, and this will fall to
zero in 1998 as agreed to in the U.S.-Canada Free
Trade Agreement which became effective in 1989. The
available TRQ for refined sugar for 1995/96 is 22,426
tons, which is the announced total TRQ for refined
sugar of 24,251 tons minus 1,825 tons set aside for
specialty sugar allocations for 23 countries. In
fiscal 1996, this refined sugar TRQ is available on a
first-come, first-served basis.
 
Duties on HFCS between the United States and Canada
are low and scheduled to decline to zero in 1998. The
Mexican duty on HFCS from the United States is
scheduled to decline from a base of 15 percent (prior
to the implementation of NAFTA in 1994) to zero over
10 years, and in 1995 is 12 percent. Between October
1, 1990 and January 1, 1995 sugar imports from Canada
were not subject to quota. 
 
World and U.S. Corn Sweeteners
World Production
World Production Growing But
Remains Highly Concentrated
The world's leading non-sucrose caloric sweetener is
high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). HFCS is a liquid
sweetener which can be produced from a variety of
feedstocks provided they contain sufficient amounts
of starch. The most prominent source of starch in the
United States is corn, but some producers in Asia use
sweet potatoes or tapioca. In Europe, wheat and
potatoes are also used as starch feedstocks.
 
Globally, HFCS first started to make an economic
impact in the mid-1970's when sugar prices soared and
new technologies became available. The global sugar
price boom of the mid-1970's provided a much needed
protective umbrella for the first attempts to produce
HFCS on an industrial scale. Global sugar prices
boomed again in the early 1980's, at about the same
time that further major technological breakthroughs
occurred and proved that this alternative caloric
sweetener was commercially attractive even when lower
sugar prices prevailed.
 
While sugar prices have historically been the leading
reference value for determining the market
penetration of HFCS, sugar and HFCS are not perfect
substitutes. For example, sugar has a number of
bulking, texture, and browning characteristics which
make it the sweetener of choice for the
confectionery, bakery, and cereal industries.
World-wide, HFCS is competing primarily with liquid
sugar in carbonated soft drinks. The availability of
HFCS in liquid form creates constraints for storage
and trade. Transport of HFCS is costly and therefore
trade has been restricted to short-distance
exchanges.
 
According to leading international sweetener
analysts, some combination of five prerequisites are
usually necessary for successful development of an
HFCS industry.
* Import status for sugar and a high internal price
for sugar o Sufficient supplies of starch at a
reasonable net price o Well developed food production
and consumption infrastructure o Capital for
investment in research and development (R&D) and
plant and equipment
* Favorable government policy
 
A decade ago world HFCS production was estimated at
5.4 million metric tons, dry basis. By 1987,
production had expanded to 6.8 million tons, and for
1995 the forecast is 9.4 million tons, up 22 percent
since 1990. Globally, production remains
concentrated, with the United States accounting for
75 percent (7.1 million metric tons) of the world
total in 1995, Japan 8 percent (750,000 tons), and
the EU 3 percent (303,000 tons), followed by Canada,
Korea, Argentina and Taiwan at between 2 and 3
percent each. Together these seven countries are
expected to account for 96 percent of global HFCS
production this year.
 
While this year-to-year growth in global HFCS
production has been significant, its production and
use remains small compared with sugar. For example,
USDA's global sugar consumption forecast for 1995/96
is 117 million metric tons versus 9.4 million for
HFCS. Moreover, the outlook for the short run is that
the substitution of HFCS for sugar will remain
confined to a small set of countries and largely to
liquid sweetener markets. 

U.S. Production
U.S. Corn Crop Lower;
Corn Sweetener Output Continues To Grow
 
The 1995/96 (September/August) U.S. corn crop is
estimated at 7.37 billion bushels, down 27 percent
from the record high 1994 corn crop, due to reduced
area and lower yields. According to USDA's November
Crop Production report, 1995/96 corn harvested
acreage is estimated at 64.8 million, down 11 percent
from last year. The reduction reflects prolonged wet
conditions in the Midwest this spring which prevented
some plantings and delayed others. Based on
conditions as of November 1, the average corn yield
is forecast at 113.7 bushels per acre compared with a
record 138.6 bushels in 1994/95. The sharp decline is
due to a very hot dry summer in many leading
production States as well as production losses this
fall. For example, yield estimates were reduced in
Kansas due to damage from early frost. In Nebraska
and some other areas, high winds led to reports of
lodging and ear droppage. With generally favorable
conditions, farmers made rapid progress harvesting
corn in October. As of November 5, 87 percent of the
crop was harvested in the 17 major producing States
accounting for 94 percent of estimated production.
This compares with an average of 74 percent.
 
This year is shaping up as one of the tightest ever
for U.S. corn. With importers' buying continuing at a
breakneck pace, limited corn supplies and higher
prices are expected to have a larger impact on
domestic users despite strong potential demand.
 
According to the December World Agriculture Supply -
Demand Estimates (WASDE) report, domestic corn use
for 1995/96 is forecast at 6.28 billion bushels, with
feed and residual use taking 73 percent or 4.58
billion bushels, and food, seed, and industrial (FSI)
use the remainder, 1.70 billion bushels. Within the
FSI use sector, the corn grind for corn sweeteners is
forecast at a record 705 million bushels, 19.7
million short tons, up 1.7 percent from 1994/95. Corn
sweeteners represent about 9.6 percent of the
forecast domestic use of the 1995/96 crop, and 41
percent of FSI use. Over the last decade, corn use
for sweeteners have climbed from around 500 million
bushels annually to a record of over 700 million
expected this year. 

U.S. corn sweetener production in fiscal 1995/96
(October/September) is forecast to total 12.1 million
tons, dry basis, up 3.9 percent from the year that
ended September 30. This forecast reflects expanded
industry capacity and is based on recent growth
trends. Figure 19 provides a detailed flow-chart of
the corn wet-milling process yielding corn
sweeteners. 

HFCS production is forecast at 8.1 million tons, dry
basis, up 4.2 percent from 1994/95 and accounting or
about two-thirds of expected total corn sweetener
production for the coming year. For fiscal 1994/95,
HFCS production totaled 7.8 million tons, up 4.4
percent from the corresponding period in 1993/94.
 
Glucose syrup and dextrose are the other primary corn
sweeteners produced by the U.S. corn wet milling
industry. Combined glucose and dextrose production
for fiscal 1995/96 is forecast at 4.0 million tons.
This is up 125,000 tons from the fiscal 1994/95
estimate and accounts for about a third of total
expected corn sweetener production during fiscal
1995/96.
 
U.S. Consumption
HFCS Use Higher
Total U.S. corn sweetener use is expected to reach
11.2 million tons of which U.S. production is
expected to supply 98 percent. The United States
supplements domestically produced corn sweetener
supplies with imports, mainly from Canada. USDA
forecasts HFCS consumption at 8.0 million tons, up
3.9 percent from 1994/95. The consumption forecast
for HFCS is based on projections of deliveries from
domestic production and imports. On a per capita
basis, and using a U.S. population of 269.2 million
(including Puerto Rico), domestic HFCS use is
forecast at 59.3 pounds in fiscal 1995/96, up from
57.7 pounds for last year, and 45.2 pounds a decade
ago. Glucose syrup and dextrose deliveries are
forecast at 3.3 million tons, up 2.6 percent from
1994/95.
 
HFCS deliveries for fiscal 1994/95 totaled 7.68
million tons, up 3.5 percent from the preceding year.
HFCS-55 use is driven largely by demand by the
nonalcoholic beverage sector which normally accounts
for 90 percent of its total use. Tables 44 and 45
provide a breakout of HFCS-55 and HFCS-42 use by
major food use categories and beverages. For HFCS-55,
there appears to be only small growth in food
categories such as processed foods; with beverages
remaining the leading category of use. HFCS-42
depends on beverages for only about 40 to 45 percent
of its total use. Other food use categories in total
are more important and expanding, especially use in
processed foods, and the cereal and bakery category.
For 1995, soft drink use growth is estimated at 3 to
4 percent, somewhat below increases in recent years.
While summer soft drink use was reported to be
strong, price increases--mainly due to increased
costs for plastic and aluminum packaging--earlier in
the year dampened demand somewhat.

U.S. Prices and Costs
HFCS Prices Remain Low Through Summer
HFCS-55 and HFCS-42 list prices averaged 18.96 and
16.92 cents a pound, dry weight basis respectively,
for the period October 1994 through May 1995. For the
June through September period, prices for HFCS-55
averaged 18.51 cents a pound and for HFCS-42, prices
averaged 16.62 cents. Normally, prices move up
sharply during the summer due to the high demand for
HFCS from the beverage sector and because of tight
processing capacity. However, this past summer, while
demand was strong due to unusually hot summer
temperatures in many parts of the country, prices did
not move up. This reflects added corn sweetener
processing capacity, as much as 25 percent according
to some estimates, that came on line in the last
year. With the very sharp downturn in this season's
corn crop, HFCS prices have increased.
 
HFCS prices are consistently lower than refined sugar
in the U.S. market. For the 10 year period
1985/86-1994/95, wholesale HFCS prices averaged 20.76
cents a pound, dry basis, compared with 25.74 cents
for refined beet sugar. This price spread of nearly 5
cents is one major reason for the substitution of
HFCS for sugar in beverage and certain food markets.
Moreover, these HFCS prices are "list prices" and
likely do not reflect significant price discounts
received by major buyers.
 
Fundamental also to the growth of the corn sweetener
industry in the United States has been the abundant
availability of corn coupled with its relatively low
cost. The cost of corn as a raw material input can be
viewed either on a gross or net basis. The
wet-milling process creates three valuable
byproducts: corn gluten feed, corn gluten meal, and
corn oil. Sale of these byproducts generates revenues
that reduce the gross cost of corn. When corn prices
rise, so usually do the byproduct prices, partly
offsetting the effect of higher corn prices on corn
sweeteners. In the calculation of byproduct credits,
it is assumed 1 bushel of corn weighs 56 pounds and
produces 1.55 pounds of crude corn oil, 13.5 pounds
of corn gluten feed, 2.65 pounds of corn gluten meal,
and 33.33 pounds of corn sweetener, dry weight. Table
51 provides net cost of corn starch data through
November 1995. 

The Midwest price of number 2 yellow dent corn, the
grade used by wet millers, averaged $2.28 per bushel
for the first 9 months of fiscal 1994/95, compared
with $2.67 for the corresponding period in 1993/94.
The lower corn prices in 1994/95 reflected the record
corn crop. But corn prices have been rising in recent
months averaging $2.77 per bushel July-September,
$3.12 in October and $3.22 in November, reflecting
the forecast sharp downturn in corn production in
1995/96. The December WASDE forecast corn prices for
1995/96 to range from $2.95-3.35 a bushel, compared
with $2.26 per bushel for the whole season of
1994/95.
 
Net corn cost averaged $1.67 per bushel in October
1995 versus 1.27 per bushel for the first 9 months of
1995. For the previous decade (1985-1994), net corn
costs averaged 90 cents a bushel.
 
U.S. Honey and Maple Syrup
Production
Honey Output Unchanged
U.S. honey production in 1995 is estimated at 216
million pounds (108,000 short tons), practically
unchanged from 1994. Production of honey in the
United States have been hampered by a continued
decline on bee colonies. The number of commercial bee
colonies in the United States has gradually declined
from a peak of 5.9 million in the late 1940's, to 4.3
million in 1985, and to an estimated 2.7 million in
1995. Declining colony numbers are mainly due to
fewer easily accessible floral sources, increased use
of pesticides, increasing losses from mites, rising
production costs, and declining net income.
 
In addition, the migration of Africanized bees into
the southern United States may have contributed to a
decline in beekeeping, and therefore, reduced bee
colonies. Although the number of producing colonies
has declined over the past years, honey yields per
colony have increased. Yields per colony averaged 35
pounds in 1985, 62 pounds in 1990, and compared with
an estimated 78 pounds in 1994. The lower colony
numbers and higher yields likely reflect structural
adjustments in the U.S. honey industry in which
smaller producers continue to leave the industry,
while larger apiaries continue technological
improvements. More than one-third of all colonies in
the United States are located in California, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Florida. These
States continue to account for over half of U.S.
honey production.
 
Maple Syrup Lower
Maple syrup production for 1995 is estimated at 1.1
million gallons, down 17 percent from 1994. The
downturn is largely attributed to a fall-off in
production in Vermont, the largest producing State,
from 435,000 gallons in 1994 to 365,000 gallons this
year, due to less than optimal weather. To generate
the best sap flows, freezing conditions at night
followed by warm days are required. Production was up
somewhat in Maine, the second largest producer but
down in New York, the third largest producer. In New
York, the first sap run was reported March 4 and the
last April 1, with an average of 47 gallons of sap
per gallon of syrup. In 1994, the first and last run
were March 16 and April 11, respectively, average
yields were 41 gallons of sap per gallon of syrup.
 
Consumption
Honey Use Expected Lower
U.S. honey consumption has been increasing in the
last few years, due to population growth and
increased use by bakery, cereal, and health food
manufacturers. However, U.S. domestic demand for
honey in 1995 is forecast to decrease by 4 percent
based on lower supplies and higher prices. Household
consumption accounts for approximately 40 percent of
total U.S. honey domestic use. Honey for table use is
generally liquid, light color, and with mild flavor.
The United States is also one of the world's largest
markets for industrial honey, which accounts for
about 45 percent of total domestic consumption. The
food manufacturing industry, primarily bakery, health
food, and cereal manufactures, is the major user of
industrial honey. The food service industry, which is
comprised of restaurants, schools, hospitals, and
other institutional operations, accounts for the
remaining 15 percent of the honey consumed annually
in the United States. 

Maple Syrup Demand Trading Up
Maple syrup use continues to grow in popularity.
Total use was estimated at 4.0 million gallons in
1994, compared with 2.5 million in 1985. The upturn
in use can be attributed to wider marketing of
domestic output increasingly supplemented by imports. 
 
Trade
U.S. Net Honey Importer
Exports of U.S. honey in 1994 were 8.3 million pounds
or 4,171 short tons, 2 percent below 1993 shipments,
mainly due to increased competition from low priced
Chinese and Argentine honey in international markets.
U.S. honey exports in 1995 are forecast at 9.3
million pounds or about 12 percent above 1994
shipments. Although U.S. honey supplies are expected
to be lower in 1995, higher international prices,
combined with continued promotion campaigns in
principal U.S. markets, like those in the Middle
East, have improved U.S. honey export prospects this
year. Total U.S. honey shipments during the period
January-August, 1995, reached 5.7 million pounds, up
25 percent from exports during the same period last
year. Moreover, exports to date to important markets
such as Germany, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia are also
running ahead of last year.
 
About 55-60 percent of U.S. honey is exported in bulk
form, with the remaining 40-45 percent directed to
the retail consumer-ready market. Exports of
high-quality, consumer-packed honey have been
increasing in recent years due to increased world
demand and to promotional efforts under the Market
Promotion Program, which is administered by the
National Honey Board. 

U.S. imports of honey in 1994 were 123.2 million
pounds or 61,615 tons, 8 percent less than imports in
1993. Anti-dumping investigations regarding honey
imports from China, the major supplier to the U.S.
market, discouraged exports of Chinese honey to the
United States last year. Still, U.S. honey imports
from Argentina in 1994 increased for the sixth
consecutive year to 40.3 million pounds. 
 
U.S. imports in 1995 are forecast to decrease further
to 84.0 million pounds based on a new agreement
reached this year with China, which will restrict the
amount of Chinese honey imported into the United
States. Moreover, decreased world honey supplies and
higher international prices will likely discourage
U.S. honey imports in 1995. U.S. honey exports during
the period January-August 1995, were 58.6 million
pounds, compared with 85.8 pounds during the same
period last year. Moreover, imports from China and
Argentina, the two top U.S. suppliers, are running
behind last year's pace by 64 and 33 percent,
respectively. China, Argentina, Canada, and Mexico
have been the leading suppliers of honey to the
United States, accounting for nearly 90 percent of
U.S. honey imports. Honey imports account for about
30 to 35 percent of U.S. honey consumption. Over the
past decade (1985-94), U.S. honey imports have
exceeded exports by about 90 million pounds annually. 

Maple Syrup Exports Small,
Imports Growing
U.S. maple syrup exports continue to be small,
totaling only 569,000 gallons in 1994, and averaging
364,000 annually for the previous 5 years. In
contrast, imports of maple syrup, mainly from Canada,
were a record 3.3 million gallons in 1994 with annual
imports averaging 51.5 million gallons for the
previous 5 year average. The upturn in imports
reflects increasing demand for maple syrup in the
United States and the need to supplement domestic
supplies.
 
Programs and Policies
Honey Support Program Changed
The U.S. Honey Price Support Program was amended by
the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1993. The 1993
Act reduced the minimum honey loan rate from 53.8
cents a pound for the 1991-95 crops, to 50 cents a
pound for the 1994 and 1995 crops, 49 cents a pound
for the 1996 crop, 48 cents for the 1997 crop, and 47
cents a pound for the 1998 crop. The 1993 Act also
dropped the 1 percent (0.538 cent) nonrefundable
marketing assessment, which growers paid on each
pound of domestically produced honey. However, the
funding for the price support portion of the honey
program was eliminated for the 1994 and 1995 honey
crops. Also, the loan portion of the program is now
operating as a recourse, interest-charged loan
program. Loans are available for 9 months to provide
interim financing while a producer markets the honey.
Table 62 provides data on loan activity.
 
Chinese Imports Restricted
U.S. honey imports from China expanded steadily from
about 26.5 million pounds in 1989 to 75 million in
1993. In response to a petition from the American
Beekeeping Federation and the American Honey
Producers Association, the U.S. International Trade
Commission (ITC) instituted an anti-dumping
investigation on imports of honey from China in
October 1994. On November 14, 1994, ITC voted
unanimously to pursue a complaint that Chinese honey
was being dumped in the United States and harming
U.S. honey producers. After the ITC decides to accept
a case, the actual anti-dumping investigation is done
by the International Trade Administration, Department
of Commerce. After ITC found that honey from China
had been dumped in the United States, anti-dumping
duties on imports from China were established. 

In August 1995, the U.S. Department of Commerce and
the Government of China reached an agreement, which
suspends punitive U.S. anti-dumping duties and places
quantitative and a price limits on Chinese honey or
shipments to the United States. The agreement, which
covers 5 years beginning in 1995, will allow China to
export 44 million pounds (21,982 short tons 19,942
metric tons) of honey annually to the United States.
The agreement also established that Chinese honey
cannot be sold at a price lower than a reference
price, equivalent to 92 percent of the average unit
value of honey imported by the United States from all
other countries. The reference price will be updated
quarterly. Tables 58-64 provide supply use and price
statistics for honey and maple syrup.
 
World and U.S. High Intensity Sweeteners
World High Intensity Sweetener Use Continues To
Expand
World production and use of high intensity (low
calorie) sweeteners continues to expand around the
globe. While USDA does not have an independent
production survey system for high intensity
sweeteners, a prominent market analyst places
combined production of saccharin, aspartame, and
acesulfame-k at about 37 million pounds (table 65).
No public data are available for the other major high
intensity sweeteners cyclamate, sucralose, and
alitame. The approximate sugar sweetener equivalent
(SSE) to the major high intensity sweeteners is as
follows: cyclamate (30), aspartame (180),
acesulfame-k (200), saccharin (300), sucralose (600),
and alitame (2,000). 

The growth in the use of high intensity sweeteners
reflects their cost economics compared with sugar and
HFCS. One of the most notable features of the world
intense sweetener sector in recent years has been the
growing trend towards the blending of different
sweeteners with one another. From a commercial point
of view, one of the most important advantages of such
blends is their sweetening synergies. The sweetness
intensity delivered by a blend is nearly always far
greater than the sum of the sweetness potencies of
the individual sweeteners, enabling food and drink
manufacturers to realize substantial sweetener cost
savings. Moreover, blending often results in taste
synergies and enhanced stability.
 
For markets to grow, these products must first gain
approval by food safety authorities in various
countries. For example, both sucrolose and alitame
were approved for use in Mexico and Australia this
past year. In contrast, both products are awaiting
approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for use in the United States.
 
Saccharin is one of the most widely used high
intensity sweeteners. It is approved for use in the
EU, Japan, China, Canada (for table top use and
pending approval in soft drinks and food), and the
United States. Saccharin has been low priced
averaging about 1 cent a pound SSE, in the United
States. It is widely used in China and Indonesia as a
substitute for sugar in soft drinks and other foods.
In the United States and Europe, saccharin is also
widely used in non-food uses such as toothpaste and
pharmaceuticals. 

One of the oldest and most widely used blends is that
of saccharin with cyclamate. Used on their own, the
taste profiles of these sweeteners are poor, both
having slight metallic after tastes. However, when
used together, the overall taste profile is much
improved. Moreover, because of sweetening synergies
that exist between the two sweeteners and low costs,
the potential cost savings are significant. However,
in some of the world's largest sweetener markets
regulatory barriers prohibit the use of one or either
of these sweeteners. For example, in the United
States and United Kingdom cyclamate have been banned
for use since 1969.
 
Aspartame has achieved wide-approval in the EU,
Canada, Japan, and the United States. Applications in
the United States include carbonated soft drinks,
refrigerated and non-refrigerated ready-to-drink
beverages, table top use, frozen desserts, yogurt,
and candies. Aspartame gradually loses its sweetness
in liquids as a function of time, temperature, and
pH. It also loses its sweetness when exposed to high
heat, as in baking. A new encapsulated form of
aspartame was recently approved by FDA for baking.
Encapsulation protects aspartame under high heat and
releases the sweetener only during the final stage of
baking.
 
Aspartame's advances in the U.S. market were spurred
largely by growth in demand for "diet" soft drinks,
despite its high cost--in 1989 $60-$70 per pound, or
36 cents a pound SSE. Since NutraSweet's patent on
aspartame expired in December 1992, the price has
fallen and currently is estimated at about $20-$35
dollars a pound, or 17 cents a pound SSE. While most
of the aspartame used in the United States is
produced domestically, dependence on imports is
growing. In 1994, the United States imported a record
5.9 million pounds (2,683 tons) valued at $92.4
million, most of it from Japan. The unit import value
was $15.62 per pound, or 8.68 cent a pound SSE (table
66). 

Acesulfame-k has broad approval for use in food and
beverages in the EU and Canada. It has not been
approved yet in Japan. In the United States it has
been approved for a number of food products such as
baked goods, yogurt, dry drink mixes, and as a table
top sweetener. Approval is pending for its use in
carbonated soft drinks. In the United States, its
price on a sugar equivalent basis is about 17 cents a
pound. In Europe an increasingly popular blend is
acesulfame-k and aspartame.
 
Competition in U.S. Soft Drink Market Between High
Intensity Sweeteners, Sugar, and HFCS
 
During the 1980s, U.S. sweetener analysts generally
believed that aspartame was not having much negative
impact upon the market for caloric sweeteners such as
sugar and HFCS. Instead, aspartame was competing with
saccharin. It was also felt that aspartame had played
a major role in revitalizing the diet beverage
market, but that these extra sales represented a new
form of soft drink demand, which was largely in
addition to the existing large non-diet or regular
soft drink sales. More recently, this view has been
changed. Analysts now believe that there is some
"cannibalisation" or substitution of the regular soft
drink market by diet products--that is, high
intensity sweeteners are competing directly with the
caloric sweeteners, sugar, and HFCS.
 
Ukraine's Sugar Industry: Recent Developments and
Prospects by Peter Buzzanell, Yuri Markish, and Roger
Hoskin

Note: This is the second in a series of three
articles on the republics of the former Soviet Union
that will appear in the Sugar and Sweetener Situation
and Outlook report. The first article, "The Russian
Federation: Sugar Industry in Transition" appeared in
March 1994. 

Abstract: Four years after the end of the Soviet
period, Ukraine remains one of the world's largest
sugar producers despite declines in area, yield, and
production. The processing industry is plagued with
outmoded equipment and production practices which
hamper productivity. To date, government
privatization efforts have meant no real change in
administration. High prices and falling incomes have
lowered Ukrainian sugar consumption. The country
remains self-sufficient in sugar and exports about
half of its production, mostly to other FSU
countries. Current tariff regimens, especially in
Russia, could favor the resurgence of raw sugar
imports for refining and reexport. 
 
Introduction
Ukraine's sugarbeet industry ranks as one of the
world's largest in terms of area harvested,
processing capacity, beet sugar production, and
trade. However, field and factory performance
continues to be constrained by high prices and
shortages of agricultural inputs, fuel, machinery,
spare parts, and low capital investment. The industry
is struggling with policy reforms as it adapts to the
country's shift from state planning to market forces.
The outlook for Ukraine's sugar industry, a key
component of the nation's rural economy and export
earnings, is being shaped by the lack of initiatives
to increase production efficiencies and the slow
reform of the industry's organizational structure.
 
Structure of Production and Processing--
Sugarbeets is a Leading Crop
Ukraine is the world's fourth largest producer of
sugarbeets and beet sugar behind France, the United
States and Germany. For 1995/96, USDA forecasts
Ukraine`s sugarbeet harvest from an estimated 1.43
million hectares, the largest of any country in the
world (table A-1). USDA forecasts Ukraine's 1995/96
sugarbeet production at 33.0 million tons yielding
4.0 million tons of beet sugar, raw value (table
A-2).
 
In recent years, sugarbeets have been processed in 19
of the Ukraine's 25 oblasts (similar to states in the
United States or provinces in Canada). Ukraine's
sugarbeet crop is sown in the spring and harvested in
the fall. Of more than 1.6 million hectares sown to
spring crops in 1995, sugarbeets accounted for about
6 percent. More than half of spring planted area was
devoted to grain crops such as barley, corn, and
fodder crops. Sunflowerseed plantings were also
somewhat larger than sugarbeets at 1.8 million
hectares. Although sugarbeets occupy less than 10
percent of cultivated land, the crop accounts for
about 30 percent of gross farm income and 15 percent
of net farm profits. Moreover, the byproducts of the
sugarbeet crop (beet tops, beet pulp, and molasses)
provide valuable animal feed to supplement fodder
crops.

Sugarbeets are grown on an estimated 7,500 to 8,000
agricultural collectives and farms spread across the
country. Key producing oblasts are located in the
central and western parts of the country, generally
near sugarbeet processing facilities (figure A-1).
Among the leading oblasts in terms of sugarbeet area
are Vinnytsya, Cherkasy, Khmel'nyts'kyy, Kiev, and
Sumy. Together these five oblasts account for over 50
percent of the total area in sugarbeets.
 
The Ukraine has excellent natural advantages for
growing sugarbeets, including fertile soil and a good
climate. Sugarbeets are grown in rotation with other
crops, particularly grains, and year-to-year changes
in beet area planted reflect the relative prices
received by farmers for sugarbeets compared with
other crops. Planted area in 1995 was 11 percent
below the average 1.66 million hectares harvested in
the late 1980's (table A-2). In part the decline
effects the disappearance of Soviet Union's central
planning schemes, under which the Ukraine was
obligated to produce sugar to meet the needs of other
republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU). The lower
acreage also reflects a shift to more profitable
grains or sunflowers, problems between sugarbeet
growers and processors, and removal of subsidies to
sugarbeet processing plants. While some traditional
sugarbeet areas have gone out of production, new
areas have come into production in the Crimea,
Dnipropetrovs'k, Luhans'k, and Kherson oblasts. Only
Zaporizhzhya oblast does not currently grow
sugarbeets.
 
In November, Ukraine's sugarbeet yields for 1995/96
were forecast at 23.2 tons per hectare, up from the
drought-reduced yields of last season but well below
the average 30.4 tons of the late 1980's. Recent
reports indicate the final result may have been
somewhat lower. Yields in the Ukraine in the late
1980's were about 5 tons below the world average of
about 35 tons (figure A-3). France and Germany
typically average yields of 42 to 45 tons per
hectare. Quantity and quality of agrochemicals and
other industrial inputs in these countries
historically have been several times higher than in
Ukraine. However, Ukrainian yields have tended to be
higher than in some neighboring East European
countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, and the Russian
Federation.
 
Ukrainian yields have declined since the end of the
Soviet period because of the declining use of
fertilizers and plant protection products. The end of
government subsidies of these inputs has led to
sharply higher prices and reduction of input use.
This season's production upturn represents a recovery
from 1994's severe drought.
 
In recent years, the productivity of Ukrainian
sugarbeet agriculture has been constrained by
problems with seeds, field equipment, chemicals, and
fuel. For example, sugarbeet seed has not been
available in sufficient quantities. Average annual
sugarbeet seed production is estimated at 17,000
tons, which is enough to plant 1.1 million hectares.
The three sugarbeet seed factories in Ukraine
(Vinnytsya, Lebedyn and Buryn) all are reportedly in
need of modernization. Foreign hybrids were planted
on about 60,000 hectares in the spring of 1995, 4
percent of total plantings.
 
Efforts to modernize the seed industry are underway.
To support breeders, each beet factory has to
contribute to a special breeding fund of the
Ukrainian Sugar Concern (Ukrsakhar), a
quasi-government agency. Five new Ukrainian-developed
hybrid seed varieties are expected to be released
soon. Domestically produced sugarbeet seeds were
given by the government to sugarbeet factories
without advance payment for the 1993-95 planting
seasons, and then distributed to farmers, also
without any advance payment. In 1995, seeds will be
reportedly paid for after the crop harvest at a cost
of 200 kilograms of sugar per hectare. Higher
yielding, foreign hybrid seed costs about three times
as much as Ukrainian varieties.
 
Fertilizer and pesticide applications have fallen
since the Soviet era due to higher prices, and
removal of subsidies to growers to purchase inputs.
Fertilizer applications to sugarbeet fields have
fallen from 300 to 450 kilograms per hectare in the
mid 1980's to 80 to100 kilograms in some areas for
the 1994/95 crop. Pesticide use has fallen to 20 to
30 percent of the amount applied during the Soviet
period. In the future, the rate of fertilizer, and
chemical use will be determined by their economic
benefit. Application rates are unlikely to return to
Soviet-period levels. Like the seed problem, the
reduced use of production-enhancing inputs has shown
up in lower sugarbeet yields.
 
Growers initially were unable to obtain credit for
the spring planting campaign in 1995. However, the
Cabinet of Ministers decided to ignore the Government
anti-inflation guidelines and requested the Ministry
of Industry to give fertilizers to sugarbeet farmers
last spring without prepayment. Final settling is
supposed to be done after growers sell their 1995
harvest, but is unlikely to happen. Given the
inflationary environment in Ukraine, the government
decision to delay payments represents a subsidy to
growers. 

Harvesting of sugarbeets normally begins in September
and lasts about 60 days, while processing can last up
to 100 days. According to Ukrainian government
sources, average losses from the previous five crops
averaged 22.5 percent. This staggering loss estimate
includes beets unharvested and those dug but not
delivered to factories. Despite the agronomic and
capital equipment problems, a return to more normal
weather helped Ukrainian farmers in 1995/96 to
harvest and deliver an estimated 33.0 million tons of
sugarbeets to processing facilities. While more than
20 percent below the 45 million ton average of the
late 1980's, the volume will exceed that of any other
country in the world. Harvests in France, Germany,
and the United States, for example, each are expected
to range around 26 million tons this season.
 
Grower-Processor Relationship
Currently Ukraine regulations presume that all
sugarbeets and byproducts (molasses and beet pulp)
are owned by the growers. Growers pay sugar factories
a processing fee ranging from 19 to 42 percent with
money, beets, or sugar. Sometimes shares of molasses
and pulp also remain with the factories. Payment is
done according to quality and quantity of beets,
taking into account data on sugar content and average
sugar losses at the factory through the entire beet
processing campaign. 
 
This season, for the first time, there appears to be
little or no state or government mandated contract
between growers and processors, and procurements
continue to be scaled back. Growers and factories
have to find their own markets for their output and
have to find supplies of inputs and equipment. The
contracts between farmers and processors are
understood to include pricing alternatives such as:
1) growers pay a fee to cover the processing and
storage costs of sugarbeets, and 2) sugar produced,
as well as molasses and pulp, remains the property of
the grower (after deducting storage losses) and the
factory retains part of the finished sugar as payment
for processing costs.
 
There are major disagreements between beet growers
and processors regarding the amount of sugar
processors should receive under barter agreements.
Processors want to implement a new regulation
stipulating that 51 percent of the sugar processed
belongs to the growers and the remainder to them. The
growers, in contrast, want a 70-30 percent split. As
a point of comparison, in the United States there is
generally a 60-40 percent grower-processor split,
with grower payments based on their individual sugar
content and the market price of sugar received by the
processor. In the western U.S. contract model, the
processor keeps returns generated from byproducts. 

Processing Facilities Need Modernization
Ukraine has one of the world's largest sugarbeet
processing industries. According to the latest
available statistics, there are 195 beet processing
plants located in 19 of the country's oblasts,
although several are not operational this season.

Total daily sugarbeet slicing capacity is about
500,000 tons, and beet sugar production capacity is
about 50,000 tons per day. In addition, Ukraine has
five raw cane sugar refineries strategically located
throughout the country, the largest of which is
situated at the Black Sea port of Odessa.

Sugarbeets are shipped to processing plants generally
located near growing areas. A large share of the
plants are clustered in the central and western part
of the country with the highest concentration in the
oblasts of Vinnytsya (41), Cherkasy (23),
Khmelnytskyy (17), and Kiev (15). By world standards
Ukraine's beet processing plants tend to be small.
For example, in the oblast of Vinnytsya, 9 of the 41
beet plants have a daily capacity under 1,500 tons;
25 have capacities of between 1,500 and 2,500 tons; 7
have capacities of between 2,500 to 5,000 tons; and
only 1 has a capacity of over 5,000 tons per day.
Only 17 plants, 9 percent of the total, have
capacities over 5,000 tons; and the national average
is 2,623 tons per day. In contrast, the U.S. beet
sugar industry's plant capacity averages 5,375 tons,
and 18 of the 34 U.S. plants have capacities over
5,000 tons per day. About 50 of Ukraine's beet
processing plants are characterized as in good
mechanical condition, 50 are in poor condition, and
the remainder are characterized as very poor. 
 
Ukraine's beet processing campaign usually starts in
mid-September and runs through mid-December. The
national average length of the processing campaign is
90 to 100 days, with some regional variation. While
portions of the industry tend to run efficiently,
large segments do not. By western standards
processing losses are high. Capacity utilization
levels during the short processing season tend to be
low due to endemic problems of insufficient beets and
lack of fuel to maintain plant operations. In recent
harvests, increasing transportation delays and lack
of coordination between growers and processors have
contributed to below-optimum throughput in factories.
High energy consumption has became a major problem
for the industry. Ukraine's exports of sugar to
Russia are tied to reciprocal arrangements for oil
imports, so the more oil required for each ton of
sugar, the more sugar that must be bartered to
Russia.
 
According to statements by Ukrsakhar, the Ukrainian
beet processing industry extracts about 72 percent of
the sugar content of sugarbeets entering the factory.
The vintage of equipment, lack of repairs and
maintenance as well as management practices in
handling beets from the field to the factory, all
contribute to lower recovery rates in Ukrainian
plants. While this extraction rate is similar to that
achieved in Soviet times in the late 1980's, it is
well below western standards. For example, in the
United States, plants normally extract over 80
percent of the sugar in beets, and if desugaring of
molasses is added, the figure goes to over 90
percent. However, the sugar content of Ukrainian
harvested sugarbeets is comparable to those of
western countries--over 16 percent. Thus, increased
efficiencies in the factories would reduce losses and
decrease costs. A good index to compare both field
and factory productivity levels is sugar produced per
hectare. As figure A-4 reveals, Ukraine's sugar per
hectare is well below levels achieved in France and
nearby Poland.
 
Yet, the sugar per hectare level in the Red River
Valley of the United States is closer to that of
Poland than France. This highlights the difference
between technical and economic efficiency. If inputs
or outputs are subsidized, then agriculture will
become very technology intensive; this may explain
the high sugar per hectare figure for France. If
product prices and inputs are not subsidized then it
may not be economically profitable to attain a higher
technical level of productivity. Ukraine's industry
is currently undergoing the removal of assets and
inputs that results when subsidies are ended, hence
the value of fixed assets is low, perhaps excessively
so. What the "optimal" use of these inputs is will
depend on costs and returns in a restructured
industry.
 
However, there is no evidence that reported changes
in ownership arrangements have meant any changes in
day-to-day administration. The Ukrainian government
scaled back procurement more out of an inability to
finance the program than out of conviction that it
should be ended. Presently, domestic sugar prices are
high, $700 to $800 a ton, well above world prices,
and stocks are ample. The fact that prices have not
fallen, suggest that growers and processors are
holding stocks because they believe that they will
eventually convince the government to ratify the
industry's high cost structure by some form of
subsidization or renationalization. 

Processing Facilities Privatization
Until 1991 all of Ukraine's processing facilities
were state owned and all the major strategic
decisions concerning plant investment and
modernization were made in Moscow and passed to Kiev
for execution. The state guaranteed a supply of
financial resources, raw material, energy, and
machinery to run the facilities. After the collapse
of the Soviet Union, central planning ceased, but the
state still owned the factories. 
 
To help solve some of the endemic problems of the
processing sector, the Ukrainian government has begun
to privatize plants and seek foreign investment to
help modernize the industry. As of the first half of
1995, 31 beet factories were reportedly privatized,
16 percent of the total. These sugar factories were
first leased, then privatized. An additional 72
factories have been leased.
 
Since early 1995, the Ukrainian Parliament has
shifted away from leasing to a direct
open-joint-stock company privatization method, with
participation of sugarbeet farmers. Regulations
require a 51-percent majority ownership by sugarbeet
farmers. However, there have been some problems with
this approach due to a lack of "farmer privatization
certificates." Moreover, there are some proposals to
renationalize factories already privatized because
the distribution of their shares does not correspond
to the recent regulations set up by the Parliament,
(i.e. farmers should hold at least 51 percent of the
shares). Ukrainian State Certificates are documents
provided by all Ukrainian state, private and
cooperative enterprises to each employee in these
organizations. Certificates are supposed to be able
to be sold for cash or traded for shares in other
enterprises. Some enterprise certificates are worth
more than others depending on the value placed on the
enterprise's assets. Some enterprises and farms are
prohibiting the use of certificates by their
employees for purchase of assets in other than the
employer's enterprise. Also the problem has arisen
that often there are not enough farmers at collective
farms with certificates to cover the required 51
percent of the factory assets. 

A major stumbling block to privatization is that the
government has set the price of these "assets" too
high and producers know it. Consequently, it is their
preference to invest their certificates in paper
assets rather than factories. Moreover, there is no
incentive to own factories that are virtually
bankrupt nor is there any incentive to buy if growers
and workers perceive that the government could be
persuaded to continue subsidization in one form or
another.
 
Foreign companies have shown little interest, to
date, in participating in joint ventures designed to
privatize beet factories. However, Ukraine is getting
some foreign investment for its raw cane sugar
refiners. Tate and Lyle Inc. of the United Kingdom,
has invested $15 million in a joint venture to
upgrade the Odessa refinery. The plan is to increase
sugar output from 750 tons per day to 1,500 tons. One
attraction of the project is that under current
regulations, Tate and Lyle can avoid the Russian
Federation's 25 percent import duty on refined sugar
by supplying refined sugar made in the Ukraine from
imported raw sugar.
 
Lack of foreign interest in Ukrainian processing
plants re-enforces the notion that the asking price
is too high given the uncertainty of the business
climate. Furthermore, given Russia's import duty
schedule for refined sugar, refining raw sugar could
be the most profitable segment of the industry,
depending on domestic sugar prices in Ukraine and
Russia, hence the foreign interest in refineries.
 
Marketing--Domestic Consumption and Exports
Per Capita Use Remains High
 
USDA forecasts 1995/96 sugar consumption in the
Ukraine at 2.25 million tons, raw value, down 50,000
tons from last year and 610,000 tons lower than the
annual average for the late 1980's and early 1990's
(1987/88-1990/91). For 1995/96, Ukraine's sugar
consumption is expected to account for 56 percent of
its production, not unlike the recent trend. Although
Ukraine is consistently a surplus producer, the
downturn in sugar use also has come at a time of
declining production.

Underlying the aggregate estimates are important
changes in per capita use. Ukraine's sugar
consumption averaged over 50 kilograms, refined, per
capita during the late 1980's, compared with 55 in
the EU and 20 worldwide during the period. The high
per capita sugar use reflected heavily subsidized
prices to consumers. Since the early 1990's sugar
consumption has fallen more than 20 percent because
of lower real income, higher prices, and increased
availability of sugar-containing product imports. 

The sources of sugar demand in Ukraine differ from
western countries. Commercial food processing and
other manufacturing account for about one-third of
total sugar use, compared with two-thirds or more in
the United States. In Ukraine, retail sales and
noncommercial home use account for about two-thirds
of total use. For example, a large share of
nonindustrial use goes for home preservation of
fruits, berries, and vegetables. In addition,
Ukrainians traditionally use sugar for homemade vodka
production. Some estimates show that about 5 percent
of the total sugar consumption goes for home
production of alcohol in Kiev, with a higher figure
in the countryside.
 
In 1991, after the demise of the Soviet structure,
the Ukrainian state sugar agency, Ukrsakhar, was
created. Ukrsakhar is responsible for sugar
distribution in domestic and export markets.
Currently, Ukrsakhar issues shipping notices to sugar
factories for sugar to be procured under state
contract.
 
Because both growers and processors are paid in
sugar, the amount remaining for disposal by the state
has been declining. Increasing shares of the sugar
crop are in the hands of farmers or processors on a
free market basis. For example, the volume of free
market sugar handled by farmers totaled nearly
300,000 tons, refined value, in 1992; 600,000 tons in
1993; and around 1.0 million tons in 1994. These
developments have created multiple domestic markets
for sugar.
 
World Ranking Exporter
Despite the downturn in export availability in recent
years, Ukraine remains one of the world's largest
beet sugar exporters, and only the European Union is
larger. For 1995/96, USDA forecasts that Ukraine will
export about 2.0 million tons, up 300,000 tons from
the previous year, but down sharply from the 4.2
million-ton-average achieved during 1987/88-1990/91.
The exports are expected to be composed of about 1.5
million tons of domestically produced beet sugar and
300,000 tons of imported raw sugar refined for
reexported sugar.
 
Sugar exports account for about one-quarter of
Ukraine's total agricultural exports, ranking second
only to grains, which account for about one-half of
total exports. Ukraine's other major agricultural
export commodity is sunflowerseed.
 
Of total beet sugar exports for 1995/96, 1.76 million
tons, or nearly 90 percent, are expected to be
shipped to Russia and other republics of the FSU. The
remaining 10 percent is expected to be exported to
neighboring countries. According to International
Sugar Organization (ISO) statistics for 1994, Ukraine
supplied nearly 40 percent or 1.5 million tons of the
total sugar imports of the FSU-12 and Baltic States.
The Russian Federation, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and
Azerbaijan were the major destinations in terms of
volume. For several FSU republics--Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Moldova, and Tajikistan--Ukraine accounted
for two-thirds or more of their sugar imports.
 
Non-FSU markets for Ukraine in recent years have
included Bulgaria, Romania, and China. With
Turkey--Ukraine's major regional export
competition--shifting from a net exporter to a net
importer position this season due to a fall-off in
production, Ukraine could capture an increased share
of the import markets in Albania, Romania, the former
Yugosolvia, Iran, and Iraq, as well as Turkey. In
1993 and 1994, Turkey exported 90,711 and 62,492
tons, respectively, to the FSU-12 republics of
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russian Federation, Tajikistan,
and Uzbekistan. However, Ukraine likely will be
unable to fill the void left by Turkey in 1995/96
because of insufficient availability. USDA forecasts
1995/96 sugar imports by FSU-12 (excluding Ukraine
and Russian Federation) and Baltic States will total
about 1.8 million tons, raw value.
 
Ukraine's major trading partner has been Russia,
which mainly trades oil for Ukraine's sugar.
Traditionally, Ukraine has exported to Russia, the
world's largest sugar importer, a combination of
domestically produced beet sugar as well as imported
raw cane sugar refined in Ukrainian facilities.
During the 1980's, around 2.0 million tons of
imported raw sugar were refined annually. This raw
cane sugar, mainly of Cuban origin, was tolled in
Ukraine as part of the FSU's barter exchange of Cuban
sugar for Russian oil. In recent years, sugar
refining has been largely a commercial activity, with
volume depending upon the level of the refined
premium--the difference between the prices of refined
and raw sugar. As table A-2 reveals, imports of raw
sugar into Ukraine dropped sharply since the late
1980's, reflecting the fact that the refined premium
has generally not been high enough for toll refining
to be commercially viable.
 
USDA expects Russia's sugar imports to increase from
2.7 million tons in 1994/95 to about 3.0 million in
1995/96. According to Russian Customs Committee data,
in calendar year 1994, Russia imported 2.2 million
tons of sugar, of which Cuba accounted for 911,711
tons or 42 percent and Ukraine 681,502 tons or 31
percent. For the first half of 1995, (January-June),
Russia's raw sugar imports from Cuba totaled 364,757
tons, 59 percent of total raw imports. Ukraine
provided 508,439 tons of Russia's refined sugar, 81
percent of the total of refined imports.
Historically, Russia imported raw and refined sugar
in about equal amounts, but the share of raw sugar
has increased in the last 3 years, with 1995/96 raw
imports forecast at about 55 percent compared with 48
percent in 1993/94. The reason for this change is a
higher import tariff for refined sugar (25 percent)
compared with raw sugar (1 percent). Also since April
1995, imports of refined sugar have been subject to a
10-percent value-added-tax (VAT) and a special tax of
1.5 percent. The VAT on raw sugar, however, is 20
percent. However, the refined sugar import tariff of
25 percent does not apply to other FSU republics such
as Ukraine.
 
It is expected that 200,000 to 300,000 tons of raw
sugar will enter Ukraine during 1995/96 for refining
and reexport. Under Ukraine's tolling and reexport
regulations, imports of raw sugar for tolling have to
be re-exported within 90 days or be subject to the
Ukrainian import tax. Ukraine applies a 10-percent
import duty on either raw or refined sugar. A
20-percent VAT is also applied to raw sugar imports,
unless they are re-exported.

Ukraine's sugar import flows are controlled by
Ukrsakhar under an import license system. Ukrsakhar
is also responsible for export deliveries against
intergovernmental agreements with other FSU republics
and for refined sugar exports from imported raw sugar
based on tolling contracts with international sugar
trade houses. Export licenses are issued by the
Ministry of Foreign Trade.
 
Prospects for the Future
Industry in Transition
Ukraine's sugarbeet growers, processing sector
officials, and government policy makers continue to
try to bring greater economic incentives, production
efficiencies, and market reform to the country's
sugar industry. The outlook is uncertain with respect
to production, consumption, trade, and the
reorganization of the industry.
 
Production--The data clearly point to a significant
gulf between the technical performance of Ukraine's
sugar industry and those in Western Europe and the
United States. While this indicates the generally
poor state of Ukrainian sugarbeet agriculture, it
suggests that with application of appropriate
technologies (i.e. seed, fertilizers, chemicals) and
financial support, Ukraine could increase sugar
production. For example, assuming current area in
sugarbeet, a 15-percent increase in beet yields from
the late 1980's level to 35 tons per hectare--still
well below the level regularly achieved in western
Europe--would raise sugarbeet production to around 50
million tons. Assuming average recovery rates for the
past four seasons of 12.7 percent, beet sugar
production could total about 6.0 million tons, up by
nearly 50 percent from recent levels.

While a larger volume of sugarbeets would help the
general throughput problem of Ukraine's processing
sector, the industry is clearly in need of capital
investment and restructuring. One plan mentioned with
this focus concerns the building of a 12,000 ton
plant in Zhytomyr oblast and closing five small
nearby mills.
 
There are several factors that are likely to
determine the direction of production over the next
few years. On the positive side there are factors
that would encourage an increase in Ukraine's sugar
production. These include greater export
opportunities in Russia, other FSU countries, and the
world market. On the negative side there are factors
that could cause further contraction. These include
the immense needs in capital investments, the
increasing energy costs of the processing sector, and
a view that sugar production should be only large
enough to meet domestic consumption needs, and
resources should be shifted to more remunerative
crops or activities. 

Consumption--Ukraine's per capita sugar consumption
remains high. However, high sugar prices and low
consumer purchasing power are likely to continue to
curb demand growth until incomes improve. Ukraine's
population, now estimated at 52 million, is growing
slowly, so no significant increase is foreseen in
total sugar consumption. What may change over time is
a use pattern from one dominated directly by
consumers to one of greater consumption of
sugar-containing food products from an expanding
western-style food processing industry.
 
Trade--It is very likely that Ukraine could expand
sugar exports if it is able to raise production.
Assuming no change in consumption, production of
around 6 million tons would leave an annual
exportable surplus of around 4.0 million tons, the
same level achieved in the late 1980's. Markets are
available to Ukraine both within the FSU and in
neighboring countries. The magnitude of these exports
will depend ultimately upon such factors as the
industry's production costs, the price it receives
from world market sales, and the price it receives
from domestic sales. Moreover, the need to improve
the general quality of sugar for export will also
determine how competitive Ukraine will be in
international markets.
 
The role of tolling raw sugar for Russia is a
question mark. Russia will remain a large importer of
sugar. Ukraine has sugar refinery capacity and a
developed infrastructure for unloading raws and
shipping refined products. The level of exports to
Russia is likely to continue to depend on
intergovernment agreements on fuel and sugar, the
raw-refined price premimiun, and border taxes--such
as the waiving of the import tariff on refined sugar
from other FSU countries. 
 
Policy Reform--Ukraine's sugar industry faces many
underlying structural problems that have not been
addressed in the initial transition from the old
Soviet command economy. The privatization initiative
is an important first step for a long term
development strategy. However, it remains to be seen
whether this launches a new restructuring process
that will encourage investment and improve
availability of some of the inputs and technologies
available to beet sugar industries in Western Europe
and the United States. 

Unresolved is a comprehensive policy concerning the
country's sugarbeet factories. To cut the high cost
of sugar production, a large number of the small, old
sugar factories with low efficiency would have to be
closed. However, a sizable shut-down of factories
would increase rural unemployment. Clearly the
privatization and potential factory modernization
strategies will be pivotal to the future vitality of
the Ukrainian sugar industry. In addition, seeming
contradictions among different Ukrainian
Parliamentary acts pertaining to enterprise
privatization could seriously limit privatization of
Ukrainian agricultural enterprises.
 
Moreover, transition to a domestic market where
prices are based on supply and demand forces and
payments are made in currency is also essential.
These programs and policies will not be easy to
formulate or implement and the temptation to solve
the industry's underlying structural problems by
government intervention will remain strong.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-TELEGRAFIX: Telegrafix
brings lightning-fast multimedia to Internet for
under $100 -- Free communications software and Web
access offered during release of new "RIP-2" online
publishing technology
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA -- Online publishers can create
television-style multimedia presentations that fly
through the Internet and ordinary telephone lines
with new software available now for under $100 from
TeleGrafix Communications Inc.

RIPaint-2 "universal online multimedia" publishing
software is based on the second generation of
TeleGrafix's world-standard RIPscrip (Remote Imaging
Protocol script) multimedia technology. Following two
years of development, RIP-2 technology brings
unparalleled speed and quality to online graphics.
Complex graphical information such as World Wide Web
pages can be transmitted and displayed at dazzling
speeds over low-bandwidth residential telephone lines
using low-speed modems. 

"RIP-2 is a telecommunications marvel that brings
sizzle to cyberspace. The graphics are gorgeous and
they travel through networks like greased lightning,"
said TeleGrafix President/CEO Patrick Clawson. 

RIP-2 technology dramatically speeds up transmission
and display of online multimedia by encoding graphics
as hyper- compressed ASCII text files that are as
little as one-tenth the size of other graphics
formats. RIP-2 also introduces many new elements to
online publishing, including multiple-column screen
layouts. RIP-2 is the only online multimedia
technology that can transmitted via the Internet or
any communications link without special protocols,
dedicated servers or other custom software. 

TeleGrafix also has released its new "shareware"
RIPterm v2.2. multimedia communications software, a
general-purpose communications program that also
operates as a HTML-3 and Netscape-compliant Web
browser when used with TeleGrafix's upcoming RIPweb
World Wide Web access technology.

A demonstration of RIP-2 multimedia can be viewed on
TeleGrafix's Vector Sector BBS at +1 714 379-2133.
RIPterm v2.2 and technical information can be
downloaded there and at http://www.telegrafix.com on
the World Wide Web.

RIP-2 COMPATIBLE WITH ANY COMPUTER ONLINE SYSTEM
RIPaint-2 is a powerful online publishing tool that
makes it simple for anyone to create multimedia
electronic newspapers and information services with
point-and-click and drag-and- drop simplicity. Online
publishers can create television-style production
effects with a powerful, easy-to-use WYSIWIG
multimedia editor that integrates JPEG photographic
images, complex SVGA graphics, text and digital WAV
sound into a single screen. The technology supports
16.7 million colors and can use Adobe and TrueType
style fonts. It uses the device-independent bitmap
(BMP/DIB) icon format to make screen images appear to
be virtually identical when viewed on both PC and
Macintosh computers.

The initial release of RIP-2 software is in DOS
format for speed, with a unique Windows-style
interface for point-and-click simplicity, and for use
with BBS and corporate online information systems.
Windows and Macintosh versions of RIP-2 products are
scheduled for release in early 1996, along with
"plug-ins" for Netscape and other popular Internet
browsers that will permit the viewing of RIP-2
multimedia on World Wide Web pages.

RIP-2 technology has been designed to operate with
any online system regardless of whether a particular
BBS or Internet server system manufacturer provides
support in its internal system architecture. Unlike
proprietary imaging systems, RIP-2 is fully
compatible with the Internet and any wired or
wireless communications networks that use 7-bit or
8-bit ASCII text. TeleGrafix will publish the RIP-2
multimedia language specification for use as an
international online multimedia standard in the first
quarter of 1996.

RIPAINT IS INEXPENSIVE, LIBERAL UPGRADE POLICY
RIPaint-2 multimedia publishing software is available
for US$99.95 through January 31, 1996. Customers
ordering during the introductory period will receive
a bonus of 25 complimentary copies of TeleGrafix's
new RIPterm v2.2 "universal client" multimedia
communications software, valued at $500, along with
free Internet and World Wide Web access. Customers
are free to resell the bonus copies of RIPterm and
keep all proceeds. On February 1, 1996, the price of
RIPaint-2 will increase to US$199.95, and the bonus
RIPterm gift will be discontinued.

Customers who purchased RIPaint v1.54 after March 1,
1994 are eligible for a free upgrade to RIPaint-2
with electronic documentation. Printed documentation
is available for an additional fee of US$20.
Customers who purchased RIPaint v1.54 prior to March
1, 1994 may upgrade to RIPaint-2 with electronic
documentation for US$34.95, and with printed
documentation for US$49.95. All RIPaint-2 orders will
be shipped in North America via Federal Express. A
shipping and handling fee of US$15 must accompany all
new orders and upgrade requests for U.S. domestic
customers. International orders and those from Alaska
and Hawaii are subject to higher shipping and
handling fees. TeleGrafix accepts American Express,
Visa and MasterCard. 

RIPTERM GOES SHAREWARE, SYSOPS & WEBMASTERS TO PROFIT
RIPterm v2.2 is being distributed as DOS "shareware"
for individual and non-commercial users, with a
US$19.95 registration fee. Commercial and government
organizations must license RIPterm prior to use, and
inexpensive site licenses are available.

Sysops and webmasters who join the new TeleGrafix
Associates Program prior to January 31, 1996 can
receive sales commissions by distributing RIP-2
software on their online systems, with no financial
risk on their part. 

Each TeleGrafix Associate will receive special
RIPterm shareware containing a unique identification
number for public posting on their BBS or Web system.
They will receive a sales commission of US$5.00 for
each copy of RIPterm originating from their system
that end-users register with TeleGrafix. A 10%
commission will be paid from sales of RIPaint-2 and
other TeleGrafix software products. Commissions will
be paid monthly in U.S. Dollars. No commissions will
be paid on the initial 25 complimentary copies of
RIPterm v2.2 that are included with all RIPaint-2
sales. There is no charge to enroll in the TeleGrafix
Associates Program. 

FREE WEB ACCESS TO TELEGRAFIX CUSTOMERS
Finally, TeleGrafix is providing free World Wide Web
access to customers who want to test drive the
company's experimental RIPweb WWW access technology
through January 31, 1996. RIPweb integrates Web
services into existing BBS and online systems,
providing speedy low-bandwidth connections over
ordinary residential phone lines. By eliminating the
need for consumers to have TCP/IP connections (such
as SLIP or PPP accounts) as a prerequisite for
Internet access, electronic publishers can greatly
expand their potential audiences.

Developed in partnership with X-Telnet Oy of Espoo,
Finland, RIPweb automatically translates HTML to
RIP-2 "on the fly," and supports HTML-3, including
tables, background images, text color and background
color specifications. The initial version of RIPweb
is written in Linux, and other UNIX versions are
under development.

To experience RIPweb's capabilities and enjoy free
World Wide Web access, RIPterm v2.2 users may dial
714-379-2134, and login as "guest." After an icon
download lasting about five minutes, users can travel
the World Wide Web without paying any Internet access
or time charges. Normal telephone toll charges do
apply.

RDATE:251295

HIGHLIGHTS:
Heavy snow from an early-week winter storm fell from
the Texas plains to Pennsylvania, bringing
much-needed moisture to small grain fields. Rain in
the southern Great Plains provided some relief to
wheat fields that were not already damaged from the
extended dry weather. In Florida, brief durations of
below-freezing temperatures did negligible damage to
citrus trees.

Low-volume irrigation continued in citrus groves
where leaf curl and wilt were evident. Harvest of
oranges for processing was active throughout
Florida's citrus region. Freezing weather burned some
of Florida's vegetable crops' leaves, but the extent
of the damage had not been determined. In the
southern Great Plains and the Delta States, minor
insect problems in small grains were reported in some
early wheat fields. Wheat in the Midwest was in
mostly good condition before the snow arrived. A dry
week was welcomed in the Pacific Northwest where some
standing water remained in low-land fields from last
week's storm. Light rainfall limited fieldwork in
northern California, while farther south, citrus
growers continued to pick fruit.

Highlights:
Quiet weather prevailed along the West Coast after
last week's major storm, owing to the development of
a jet-stream split over the eastern Pacific. Energy
coursing into the southern branch of the split jet
spurred the development of a significant storm. The
early- to midweek system eased drought in the central
and southern Plains, delivered heavy snow from the
Southwest to the Northeast, and dropped heavy rain on
the Gulf Coast States. In the storm's wake,
temperatures showed a remarkable uniformity,
resulting in above-normal readings in the North and
below-normal values across the South. Early in the
week, 4 to 10 inches of rain fell from eastern Texas
to northwestern Florida, causing widespread flash
flooding and minor river flooding. Two-day (December
17-18) totals reached 8.89 inches in Beaumont, TX,
8.84 inches in Lafayette, LA, and 7.68 inches in
Mobile, AL.

In addition to the heavy rain, severe weather,
including more than a dozen tornadoes, raked the
region. Meanwhile, urgently needed precipitation fell
across the central and southern Plains. In Lubbock,
TX, 0.45 inches of rain on Sunday ended a 75-day dry
spell, leaving the city 2 days shy of its
February-April 1972 all-time record. Dodge City, KS
measured 0.48 inches (5.0 inches of snow),
quadrupling their October 1 - December 15 total.
Storm-total snowfall on the southern Plains, whipped
by wind gusts in excess of 30 mph, reached 2.7 inches
in Amarillo, TX and 4.0 inches in Oklahoma City, OK.
Las Vegas, NM reported a maximum depth of 7 inches.
The northwestern half of the central Plains remained
critically dry, however. In Tribune, KS, only 0.13
inches of precipitation fell during the astronomical
autumn (September 23 - December 22), breaking a
record that had stood since 1939, when 0.18 inches
fell. Farther east, heavy rain fell as far north as
the lower Ohio River Valley, with heavy snow and ice
accumulations observed from the Midwest into the
Northeast.

December 18-19 snowfall topped 8 inches from central
Indiana to New England, driven by
north-to-northeasterly wind gusts that reached 43 mph
in Cleveland, OH (15.3 inches of snow) and 39 mph in
Indianapolis, IN (8.0 inches). In Youngstown, OH, an
11.6-inch total on Tuesday was their greatest
single-day December snowfall. The storm boosted the
astronomical-autumn snowfall to a record 25.4 inches
(three times normal) in Harrisburg, PA. Elsewhere in
the Northeast, snowfall included 10.0 inches in
Bridgeport, CT, 15.0 inches at New York City's La
Guardia Airport, and 15.7 inches in Portland, ME. The
storm dislodged remnant arctic air from northern
Maine that, on Sunday, resulted in minima as low as
-14 degrees F in Caribou and -9 degrees F in Houlton.
Although the storm stalled over southeastern Canada
after midweek, the resultant northwesterly flow
failed to deliver bitterly cold air.

East of the Rockies, the Nation's lowest temperature
after midweek was -12 degrees F, recorded on Friday
morning in Williston, ND. But the persistent flow
chilled the South, where on Thursday, Atlanta, GA
marked the first of 4 consecutive days with a high of
40 degrees F or below. On Saturday, the Nation's
highest reported temperature was 68 degrees F, in Key
West, FL. Farther north, cloudy, squally weather
plagued the Great Lakes States, where Pittsburgh, PA
spent 94 of the week's last 111 hours engulfed in
snow showers. Arctic air also remained absent from
the West, although in high-elevation valleys, lows on
Saturday morning dipped to -4 degrees F in Gallup, NM
and -12 degrees F in Ely, NV. Farther south,
late-week moisture streaked eastward, whitening the
southern Rockies and dampening Florida and southern
Texas. By Saturday morning, 4 inches of new snow
covered Red River, NM. Additional southern-stream
energy moved through southern California on Saturday,
delivering 0.77 inches of rain to Los Angeles.

-BELL ATLANTIC: Bell Atlantic ushers in new year with
$8 million in customer savings

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-BELL ATLANTIC: Bell
Atlantic ushers in new year with $8 million in
customer savings -- Touch-Tone price decreases by
one-third; other prices reduced
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:261295

CHARLESTON, W.VA. -- Bell Atlantic-West Virginia
customers will ring in the new year with $8 million
in savings, as the company is cutting by one-third
its prices for Touch-Tone service. Prices for two of
the company's local service plans also are
decreasing, and customers in several locations will
enjoy expanded unlimited calling within their local
calling areas.

Residential customers of Bell Atlantic-West Virginia
now will pay $1 a month for Touch-Tone service, down
from $1.50 a month. Business customers will pay $1.84
a month, down from $2.75 a month. These prices will
decrease by another third on Jan. 1, 1997, and will
be eliminated on Jan. 1, 1998.

In addition, prices will decrease for two residential
basic local service plans, Community Caller and
Frequent Caller. Community Caller, which offers
customers unlimited calling within their own
exchanges and measured calling to other exchanges in
their local calling area, now will cost $15 a month,
down from $15.80 a month. Frequent Caller, which
offers unlimited calling to all exchanges in a
customer's local calling area, will cost $29 a month,
down from $36.15 a month.

"These reductions are great news for hundreds of
thousands of our West Virginia customers whose
telephone bills will decrease," said Dennis Bone,
president and CEO of Bell Atlantic-West Virginia,
Inc. "These cuts, combined with price reductions
earlier this year for Bell Atlantic-carried long
distance calls and reductions as a result of prior
regulatory agreements, will save customers more than
$35 million a year by the end of 1998."

The latest price reductions are part of a 1994
agreement reached by Bell Atlantic, the West Virginia
Public Service Commission [PSC] staff and the PSC's
Consumer Advocate Division. This agreement provides
for continued price stability, with several price
reductions, through January 1998 while maintaining a
regulatory framework that provides Bell Atlantic with
incentives to continue to invest in its advanced
Mountain State telecommunications network.

With the current regulatory agreement, prices for
local service and Bell Atlantic-carried long distance
calls will have decreased or remained stable from
1985 through early 1998 -- nearly 13 years. 

Unlimited local calling areas expanded for certain
customers

In another change that becomes effective Dec. 31,
Bell Atlantic will expand local calling for its
Community Plus Caller customers in the following
exchanges:

* Calls between the Gilbert [664] and Iaeger [938]
exchanges. 

* Calls between the Fairmont [363, 366, 367, 368,
534] and Grafton [265] exchanges.

* Calls between the Hinton [466] and Meadow Bridge
[484] exchanges. 

* Calls made by customers in the Griffithsville [524]
exchange to the Hamlin [824] exchange.

Customers in these areas who subscribe to Bell
Atlantic's Community Plus Caller local service will
have unlimited local calling between these exchanges.

Bell Atlantic Corporation (NYSE: BEL) is at the
forefront of the new communications, entertainment
and information industry. In the mid-Atlantic region,
the company is the premier provider of local
telecommunications and advanced services. Globally,
it is one of the largest investors in the high-growth
wireless communication marketplace. Bell Atlantic
also owns a substantial interest in Telecom
Corporation of New Zealand and is actively developing
high-growth national and international business
opportunities in all phases of the industry.

Agricultural Prices Narrative

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL
STATISTICS SERVICE: Agricultural Prices Narrative
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295

December Prices Received Index Continues to Rise The
All Farm Products Index of Prices Received in
December was 107 based on 1990-92=100, up 1 point
(0.9 percent) from November. Price gains from
November for corn, hogs, soybeans, and eggs more than
offset price declines for broilers, turkeys, lemons,
and lettuce. The seasonal changes in the mix of
commodities farmers sell also can affect the overall
index level, but these changes were essentially
offsetting in December. Higher relative seasonal
marketings of wheat, tobacco, milk, and cotton offset
the effect of relatively lower seasonal marketings of
cattle, corn, soybeans, and grapes. Compared with
December 1994, the All Farm Products Index was 9
points (9.2 percent) higher. Higher year over year
prices for corn, hogs, wheat, and soybeans more than
offset lower prices for virtually all vegetables,
cattle, and calves. 

Prices Received by Farmers The December All Farm
Products Index was 107 percent of its 1990-92 base,
up 0.9 percent from November and 9.2 percent above
December 1994. All Crops: The December index, at 117,
was up 0.9 percent from November and 10 percent above
December 1994. Higher grain, oilseed, and cotton
prices in December more than offset lower vegetable
prices.

Oil-Bearing Crops: The index was 118, up 4.4 percent
from November and 20 percent above one year ago.
Higher prices for soybeans and peanuts more than
offset lower prices for cottonseed and sunflowers.
Soybean prices averaged $6.71 per bushel, up 32 cents
from the previous month. Dry weather concerns in
South America and good export demand are supporting
prices.

Food Grains: The December index, at 162, was up 3.2
percent from the previous month and 33 percent above
December 1994. Prices were higher for wheat and rice.
The December wheat price averaged $4.92 per bushel,
the highest since March 1974. Lower projected world
supplies and good export demand are supporting
prices.

Feed Grains & Hay: The December index was 132, up 5.6
percent from the previous month and 38 percent from
December 1994. Prices were higher for all feed
grains. The December corn price averaged $3.08 per
bushel, the highest since August 1984. The December
sorghum price averaged $5.66 per cwt, the highest
since November 1974. Tight supplies and strong export
demand continue to support feed grain prices.
Commercial Vegetables: The December index, at 93, was
9 percent below November and 42 percent below
December 1994. Contributing most to the monthly index
decline were lower prices for lettuce, celery, and
tomatoes pressured by ample supplies.

Fruit & Nuts: The December fruit and nuts index, at
84, declined 13 percent from the previous month but
was 17 percent above December 1994. Price increases
from November for apples, grapes, oranges, and
strawberries were more than offset by the effect of
lower grape marketings coupled with higher orange
marketings.

Livestock & Products: The December index was 96, up
2.1 percent from November and 6.7 percent above a
year ago. Higher hog and egg prices in December more
than offset lower poultry and cattle prices.

Meat Animals: The December meat animals index, at 84,
was up 2.4 percent from November and 1.2 percent from
December a year ago. The December hog price, at
$44.30 per cwt, increased $4.40 from November and was
$13.50 above the previous year. December weekly hog
slaughter levels have been running 5-10 percent below
year earlier numbers. December beef cattle prices
dropped slightly in December to $60.60, 10 cents
below a month earlier and $3.80 below December a year
ago.

Poultry & Eggs: The December index was 118, down 1.7
percent from November but up 15 percent from a year
earlier. Broiler and turkey prices declined
seasonally as demand typically increases for pork in
December. Both broiler and turkey prices are at
higher December levels than in recent years. Egg
prices continued to climb on strong seasonal use and
also are considerably higher than recent year levels.
Reliability of Prices Received by Farmers Estimates
Definition: Prices received represent sales from
producers to first buyers. They include all grades
and qualities. The average commodity price from the
survey multiplied by the total quantity marketed
theoretically should give the total cash receipts for
the commodity.

Survey Procedures: Primary sales data used to
determine grain prices were obtained from probability
samples of 2600 mills and elevators. These procedures
ensure that virtually all grain moving into
commercial channels has a chance of being included in
the survey. Generally, States surveyed account for 90
percent or more of total U.S. production. Livestock
prices are obtained from packers, stockyards,
auctions, dealers, and market check data from
AMS-USDA, private marketing organizations, and state
commodity groups and agencies. Inter-farm sales of
grain and livestock are not included since they
represent very small percentages of the total
marketings. Grain marketed for seed is also excluded.
Fruit and vegetable prices are obtained from sample
surveys and market check data from AMS-USDA, private
marketing organizations, state agencies, and
universities.

Summary and Estimation Procedures: Survey quantities
sold are expanded by strata to state levels and used
to weight average strata prices to a state average.
State prices are then weighted to a U.S. price based
on expanded marketings. Recommendations are prepared
by the State Statistical Offices and reviewed by the
Agricultural Statistics Board in Washington, D.C.
State recommendations are reviewed for reasonableness
with survey data, other States, and recent historic
estimates.

Revisions: For most items, the current month's price
represents a 3-5 day period around the mid-month.
Previous month's prices represent actual dollars
received for quantities sold during the entire month.
Revisions are published in monthly issues of
"Agricultural Prices" and in the annual summary
published in July. A schedule of monthly revisions is
published in the December issue of "Agricultural
Prices" and in the July annual summary.

Reliability: U.S. price estimates generally have a
sampling error of less than one half percent for the
major commodities such as corn, wheat, soybeans,
cotton, and rice. To assist users in evaluating the
reliability of prices received estimates for major
grain commodities, the "Root Mean Square Error" is
shown in the table on the next page. The "Root Mean
Square Error" is a statistical measure based on past
performance and is computed using the difference
between first and final estimates. The "Root Mean
Square Error" for the 5-month corn price is 0.2
percent. This means that chances are 2 out of 3 that
the current 5-month price of $2.47 per bushel will
not be above or below the final 5-month price by more
than 0.2 percent, or about half of a cent. Chances
are 9 out of 10 (90% confidence interval) that the
difference will not exceed 0.3 percent, or about
three-fourths of a penny.

Omnitel plans to open 20 stores under the `Spazio
Omnitel` brand name throughout Italy by the end of
1996.  Many of the stores will be opened through
franchising agreements.

The Omnitel store has been designed to efficiently
respond to customer needs and to communicate the
values that characterise the company and its
commercial offer: freedom, ease of use, courtesy and
transparency. 

The new chain of stores is distinctly unique in both
its internal and external designs.  The floor plan
has been carefully laid out to ensure that customers'
pre and post sale needs are efficiently dealt with by
Omnitel staff.  Thus the store not only offers
handsets, accessories and an activation area but more
important, information and consulting. One corner is
dedicated to the company's                      
cellular service where customers can learn more about
Omnitel's tariff plans (Free Time, Night & Day,
Business Time); there is a display area for both
handsets and accessories; a counter dedicated to
service activation; a service area for post-sale
assistance where customers can pick up their
"complimentary emergency phones" should theirs
require maintenance.  In addition, customers can try
the Omnitel service by making a free telephone call

on Oftel licence review
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Mercury Communications responded positively to
today's publication by Oftel of proposals to amend
Mercury's operating licence.

Christopher Weston, Mercury's strategy manager said:
"Competition in the UK telecommunications market has
grown enormously since the end of the duopoly in
1991.  A 'slimline licence' will put us on an equal
footing with other operators in the market, give us
the freedom to compete more effectively and the
flexibility to meet our customers' individual needs.

"We also support the principle of replacing numerous
detailed licence obligations with a general licence
Condition to prevent and deter anti-competitive
behaviour. This would, in our view, provide
sufficient regulatory control in both the domestic
and international markets."

-HERO PRODUCTIONS: Master control, transmission,
production, post capabilities to be upgraded

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-HERO PRODUCTIONS: Master
control, transmission, production, post capabilities
to be upgraded
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:261295

Anticipating the growing needs of programmers and
producers, Hero Productions, the only full-service
international teleport, production and post
production facility in the southeastern U.S. -- and
one of a handful of teleports in the country to offer
automated master control services -- announced today
the launch of a 20,000-square-foot expansion and
acquisition plan, according to partners Robert Behar
and Daniel Sawicki. 

The strategy includes a new program origination
center, establishment of a tape library, and upgrade
of its post production suite and remote unit by
year-end 1995: purchase of its 23rd antenna, a
9.2-meter RSI, expected to be delivered in January
1996, and the addition of a 24th antenna soon after;
completion of a third studio 100'x50' with control
room by first quarter 1996; expansion of its
transmitter room and purchase of a second 12-channel
digital video compression system by June 30. and
equipping of a graphics suite by year-end 1996.

"The growing need for a facility such as ours that
can provide program origination in addition to
domestic and International uplink, production and
post production services. all under one roof,
dictated that we expand and upgrade our facilities to
accommodate future growth" said Behar, Hero
Productions president.

"With the first phase of our expansion, we will have
additional space to service uplink and master control
clients, in addition to greater studio, remote and
post capabilities!"

Hero Productions' new automated program origination
center will house three digital file servers with
over 630 gigabytes of on-line digital video and
stereo audio storage, In addition, the new
1,000-square-foot tape library will feature a
stat-of-the-art rolling shelf storage system and
computer database. 

According to Debar, Hero Productions' expansion also
is intended to capture a greater share of the
production and post production markets. 

"South Florida is attracting more production than
over before from West Coast- and New York-based
companies like Viacom and NBC.  In these prosperous
times, it's more important than ever that we develop
our facilities to meet the increasing demand," Behar
said.

Hero Productions, expanded post suite with new audio
booth was specifically designed to service the
everyday needs of programmers and producers cost-
effectively.  The facility's post capabilities are
based around an upgraded Calaway, CE200 editor with a
Microtime three-channel Impact DVE, Grass Valley 300

& Chinese parties sign Asia Pacific comms agreement

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-SINGAPORE TECHNOLOGIES
TELEMEDIA/SINGAPORE TELECOM: Singapore and Chinese
parties sign agreement to provide mobile satellite
communications services in the Asia Pacific
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

Singapore Technologies Telemedia, Singapore Telecom
and four organizations from the People's Republic of
China today signed the Founders' Agreement for the
approximately US$640 million Asia Pacific Mobile
Telecommunications (APMT) project.

The four Chinese organisations are China Satellite
Launch & Tracking Control General, China Aero-Space
Corporation, China Unicorn Satellite
Telecommunication Co Ltd and China Telecommunications
Broadcast Satellite Corp.

Mr Lee Theng Kiat, President of Singapore
Technologies Telemedia, Mr Lim Toon, Executive Vice
President (International Services) of Singapore
Telecom, Mr Li Baoming, Director of China Satellite
Launch & Tracking Control General, Mr Zeng Qinglai,
Chief Engineer of China Aero-Space Corporation, Mr He
Feichang, Deputy Director of China Unicom Satellite
Telecommunication Co Ltd, and Mr Zhou Zehe, President

Corporation, signed the Agreement on behalf of their
respective companies.  The signing was witnessed by
Mr Mah Row Tan, Singapore's Minister for
Communications, and General Shen Chun Nian, Vice
Minister of China's Commission of Science, Technology
and Industry for National Defence. 

Seamless communications
APMT is a regional mobile satellite project providing
seamless mobile telecommunications services, through
National Service Providers in each country, in the
Asia Pacific region via a geostationary earth orbit
satellite system and a network of ground gateway
stations, The services include voice telephony,
facsimile and data transmission,

Communication is via handheld, vehicular or
fixed-site terminals.  Handheld terminals, the size
of normal cellular phones, will have dual-mode
facility to access either the APMT network or the
local cellular network.  The service will operate
through terrestrial cellular links where they are
available and satellite links where they are not. 
Users thus have the convenience of using their phones
almost anywhere in the region.

Residents and frequent visitors of areas where
cellular and fixed-line services are not available
will find APMT services most useful.  Frequent
business travellers in the region are also expected
to use APMT for roaming purposes.  Coverage will be
available from India in the west to Japan in the
cast, and from China in the north to Indonesia in the
south. 

Service to be launched in 1998
The APMT system is expected to be ready in the middle
of 1998.  A tender has been called for a turn-key
satellite system with a back-up satellite and
associated ground segment facilities.  The bids are
being evaluated and a decision will be announced
soon.

APMT services will be administered by Asia Pacific
Mobile Telecommunications (APMT) Satellite Pte Ltd, a
company incorporated in Singapore.  Initially,
Singapore Technologies Telemedia and Singapore
Telecom will share equally one third of the equity
stake, and the four Chinese parties will share two
thirds of the equity stake in the company.

APMT Satellite Pte Ltd will launch and operate the
APMT satellite system, coordinate with the National
Service Provider (NSP) of each country to set up the
necessary ground communications facilities and sell
air time to the NSPs.  Each NSP, licensed by the
local regulatory authority, will provide
interconnection to the local telephone network and
market and sell APMT services in its territory. 

Apart from capital injection by the six Founder
Members of APMT Satellite, additional funds will come
from external loans and internally generated funds
when the service is launched.  The Members are also
open to NSPs taking equity stakes in the company in
which case each Member's respective shareholding will
be reduced proportionately.

Growing demand
APMT will meet the growing demand for mobile phone
services in the Asia Pacific, a region of buoyant
economic growth and home to half the world's
population.  It has been estimated that the total
number of mobile phone subscribers in this region
grew by 96 per cent to over 15 million during the
year ending June 1995.

-DUN & BRADSTREET: More than 41,000 businesses
collapse in 1995

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-DUN & BRADSTREET: More
than 41,000 businesses collapse in 1995
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295

The drop in the annual rate of business failures in
Britain is disappointingly small accordingly to the
latest statistics on business failures in 1995
published today by Dun & Bradstreet, the business
information service.

41,303 business collapsed during 1995 as compared
with 43,598 during 1994.  The 5.3% drop is small when
compared with the 16-3% recorded between 1994 and
1993.  There was also a 4.6% increase in larger
company liquidations (from 16,335 to 17,280).  This
is the first increase in company liquidations for the
past three years.

More than 6,000 larger companies in London were
liquidated compared to 4,700 in 1994 an increase of
28%.  This large increase was in pan compensated for
by a 20% decrease in smaller business bankruptcies. 
But overall annual business failures in the capital
rose by 14%. 

NU Philip Mellor, D&B's Senior Analyst, said:
"There are worrying signs in these figures that
company liquidations are beginning to rise again in
the North and Scotland as well as in London, For the
past nine months we have witnessed an increasing
trend in company liquidations in the capital which
has now spread to other parts of the country.  It
remains to be seen in the coming months what impart
this will have on smaller companies."

During the last quarter of the year the number of
business failures in the North West increased by a
quarter from W to 1,054 and in the North East they
increased by 16% from 847 to 986, The disappointing
last quarter's figures meant there was little decline
in the overall business failure rates in both these
regions during the year.

In Scotland the business failure rate increased by
22% but because the law relating to bankruptcy in
Scotland differs to that in England and Wales, no
valid comparisons can be made between business
failure rates in Scotland and those in the rest of
Britain. 

Wales emerges as the region of the country with the
biggest decrease in business failures.  During 1995
the business failure rate dropped by 19% and there
were big falls in the business failure rate in the
south west (18.5%) and the South East (16.6%),

-INDUSTRY CANADA: Real gross domestic product at
factor cost by industry -- October 1995

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDUSTRY CANADA: Real
gross domestic product at factor cost by industry --
October 1995
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Economic activity declined after growing moderately
during the summer months. Gross domestic product at
factor cost fell 0.3% in October, as domestic and
foreign demand retreated. The drop left production
0.3% below its most recent peak in January 1995. The
weakness was widespread, spanning several industrial
sectors.

Retailers suffered lower sales for a second
consecutive month. The weakness in consumer spending
was also evident in community, business and personal
services, as reflected in lower sales by lottery
corporations. Lower housing resales restrained growth
in the finance group.

Two sectors dropped the most: transportation and
storage services; and mining. These two sectors
accounted for approximately 45% of the overall
decline. Wholesale trade and the output of utilities
also receded. Manufacturing production and
construction activity were unchanged. 

Consumers reduced their spending once more
Retail sales fell 0.7% in October, after slipping
0.3% in September. Sales dropped in 11 of the 18
trade groups in October. Motor vehicle dealers posted
lower sales for a second consecutive month; after
slowing in September, the number of new vehicles sold
slumped 7.4% in October. Purchases of clothing
continued to fall, while spending on furniture and
household appliances eased for a second month in a
row.

Note to readers
The gross domestic product (GDP) of an industry is
the value added by factors of production when those
factors transform inputs purchased from other
industries into output.

Monthly GDP by industry is valued at 1986 prices. The
estimates presented here are seasonally adjusted at
annual rates. 

Widespread decline in wholesale trade
Wholesalers lost ground (sales fell 0.8%), after
gaining ground in August and September. As in retail
trade, sales of motor vehicles and parts and of
household goods deteriorated. Lower sales of
machinery and equipment and petroleum products
accentuated the overall decline. By contrast, grain
merchants and wholesalers of farm machinery posted
strong gains.

Mining sector slumped
After strengthening in each of the previous four
months, output in the mining sector fell 1.3% in
October. Production of crude oil and natural gas
decreased 0.6%. Natural gas production, which dropped
only marginally, has remained at almost the same
level since April 1995. With generally weak demand,
the price of natural gas has fallen steadily
throughout 1995. Although demand for natural gas
continued to weaken on domestic markets in October,
foreign demand has been firming up since August.

Coal production dropped 2.8%, following peak levels
of production between July and September. In October,
exports of coal returned to normal levels, but output
by thermal electric utilities fell sharply again.

Less drilling activity and lower production in base
metal mines also contributed to the weakness in the
mining sector.

Growth in manufacturing production paused
Manufacturing production was unchanged in October,
after improving during the previous three months.
Output was still 1.0% lower than its peak in January
1995. Production of primary metals and of electrical
and electronic equipment fell the most. Manufacturers
of paper and refined petroleum products also cut
their output.

Output in the wood industries continued to improve;
some of the production-mainly lumber-was accumulated
in inventories. Elsewhere in the wood industries, a
recent increase in the backlog of unfilled orders may
signal higher production in the coming months.
Manufacturers of chemical, plastic and metal
fabricated products were also among the producers who
raised output the most. Production of transportation
equipment advanced despite a decline in motor vehicle
assembly.

Output of primary metals fell 3.6% in October. The
weakness reflected a 6.6% decline in smelting and
refining of non-ferrous metals; production of primary
aluminum was affected by a labour dispute. Lower
nickel production accentuated the drop in the primary
metals industry.

Production of electrical and electronic equipment
fell 1.7%, reflecting a sharp decline in production
of office machinery. The decrease coincided with a
sharp drop in exports of office machinery and
equipment.

Manufacturers of pulp and paper products were
responsible for a 1.4% decline in the paper and
allied products industries. Foreign demand for pulp
tumbled in October, while shipments of newsprint to
the United States fell significantly. Despite the
strong declines in exports, manufacturers of pulp and
newsprint maintained production and accumulated
inventories.

Production of motor vehicle parts led a 0.8% gain in
transportation equipment production. However, part of
the production went into inventory, as motor vehicle
assemblers reduced their demand. In October,
production of motor vehicles fell in Canada and the
United States. Production in the aircraft industry
continued to gain momentum, however.

Growth in transportation services eased
Growth in transportation and storage services eased
(-1.5%), reflecting declines in air, rail and truck
transport. In rail transport, carloadings of most
commodities fell-especially alumina, coal and
containers-while carloadings of grain rose
substantially. A 2.4% decline in the transportation
of natural gas added to the overall weakness.

Activity in construction remains uncertain
Activity in construction was unchanged in October.
Declines in home-building and non-residential
construction offset a gain in engineering
construction. Home-building fell 0.9%, due mainly to
weakness in the construction of apartments.
Construction of single dwellings inched ahead and,
for the first time since June 1994, improved for two
consecutive months. In October, the number of
building permits issued rebounded, mainly for
multiple dwellings. Activity on non-residential
building projects fell marginally following strong
growth during the summer months. In October, activity
on industrial projects continued to rise, but
activity eased on commercial projects. 

Other industries
Output in the finance group advanced 0.2%, after
slipping 0.2% in September. Real estate sales fell in
several provinces for a second month in a row;
however, advances by securities brokers, mutual funds
and stock exchanges were enough to offset the drop.

The output of utilities fell a further 1.3%, as
demand for electricity and natural gas continued to
sag.

industry (15-001, $14/$140) will be released in
January 1996.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDUSTRY CANADA:
Employment, earnings and hours -- October 1995
(preliminary)
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

The number of people employed by businesses was
unchanged in October at 10,746,000. Employment
increased in business services and in finance,
insurance and real estate, but declined in retail
trade and miscellaneous services. Since January 1995,
businesses have added on average 12,000 employees to
their payrolls each month. This pace of growth was
50% slower than in 1994. Since the beginning of the
year, employment gains have been led by community,
business and personal services; manufacturers; and
retail and wholesale trade establishments. Public
administration was the only industry to report a
substantial employment decline during this period.

Provincially, the gains in employment since the
beginning of the year have been focussed mainly in
Ontario and British Columbia; to a lesser extent,
there have been gains in Quebec and New Brunswick.

Table: Employment gains from January to October 1995

Ontario                           51,000
British Columbia                  41,000
Quebec                            29,000
New Brunswick                      8,000

Employees' weekly earnings, after increasing by $4.75
in August, have since remained stable. During the
past year, employees' earnings have increased by only
$5.96 per week (+1.0%). During the same period, the
rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price
index rose 2.4%.

Higher than average earnings increases were
registered for employees in finance, insurance and
real estate as well as mining, quarrying and oil
wells. Employees in public administration and in
logging and forestry services saw their earnings
decline.

Manufacturers maintained recent gains
Manufacturers employed slightly more workers in
October, maintaining the strong gains of the previous
two months. This easing of employment growth
coincided with a dampening of manufacturers'
shipments, a contraction in unfilled orders and an
expansion of inventories. Manufacturers have been one
of the stronger sectors maintaining growth in the
economy in 1995. They have added 4,200 employees on
average to their payrolls each month since January
1995, compared with an average of 3,700 employees per
month in 1994. Average hours for manufacturing
employees paid by the hour have strengthened in
recent months, after following a declining trend
since the start of the year. Similarly, strong
earnings growth in August and September was
maintained in October, as earnings were unchanged.
These recent gains more than offset the drop in
earnings during the first seven months of the year. 

Growth stalled for retailers
Following no change in September, the number of
employees in retail trade fell by 11,000 in October.
The recent movement in retail trade employment has
run counter to the increasing trend observed since
October 1994. It also coincides with retail sales,
which fell in October after remaining stable in
September. The drop in retail employment and sales
was most evident in Ontario. Employees' weekly
earnings rose 0.4% in October to $346.06. Following
substantial monthly fluctuations, earnings in retail
trade returned to the April 1995 level.

Fluctuations continued in miscellaneous services
Fluctuations in the number of employees in
miscellaneous services, which began in the fall of
1994, continued in October with a decrease of 7,000
employees. (Miscellaneous services includes
amusement, recreation, personal, and household
services, membership organizations and other
services.) These strong monthly fluctuations left
employment down slightly from its August 1994 peak.
In October, the drop was concentrated in British
Columbia, and affected mainly amusement and
recreation services.

In October, weekly earnings for employees continued a
growth trend that began in April 1995. Average
earnings in miscellaneous services rose 0.8% in
September, to $394.45.

Employment declined again in public administration,
but at a slower pace 
The declining trend in public administration
employment accelerated between January and July 1995.
On average, this sector reduced employment by 3,000
employees per month during this period. Since then,
the rate of decline has slowed; the number of
employees declined by only 700 since July. During the
past three months, declines continued in federal and
provincial administrations. These were partly offset
by increased employment in local administration.
Weekly earnings for public administration employees
were 0.6% less than in October 1994.

Special trade contractors reduced employment
Construction companies cut employment by 4,000 in
October. The decline was concentrated among special
trade contractors, who reduced their number of
employees by 6,000. The declining trend in
residential construction employment since the start
of 1995 appears to have halted, as the number of
employees increased for the fifth time in six months.
This coincided with recent growth in the value of
residential building permits.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-ANALYSYS: A window on the
world telecoms marketplace
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

A second edition of a directory that has been
described as 'essential for decision-makers' has just
been published by telecommunications consultants,
Analysys. 

The World Telecoms Marketplace, 1996 opens a window
onto one of the world's fastest-moving industries. 
The directory and databook contains details of the
world's telecoms operators, service providers,
manufacturers and regulators, including the names of
senior staff.  More than 1900 organisations, 6500
named contacts, and over 135 countries are covered. 
It also has invaluable market data segmented by
product, region or company type. 

Dr Pekka Tarjanne (Secretary-General of the
International Telecommunication Union) states in his
Foreword to the directory that it supplies, "the
information which is essential for decision-makers
who need to make their way around the labyrinth of
the telecoms industry." 

Information is provided in a flexibly accessible
manner via cross-referenced indexes.  These allow the
user to discover information on the basis of product,
service category, geographical region, or individual
organisation.

It is the only directory of its kind produced by
dedicated telecoms consultants.  Editor Michael
Denmead said:
"The World Telecoms Marketplace 1996 has its roots in
the wealth of contacts and experience our consultancy
work has produced.  It is a single-source reference
for telecoms professionals, procurement managers, and
sales and marketing teams."

The World Telecoms Marketplace 1996 does not just
cover the major players and global service providers. 
It is a source of primary information on the small
and medium sized enterprises which increasingly
comprise an important part of the telecoms sector. 
These include the emerging mobile and new network
operators who are attracted by the opportunities
around the world which are being created by
liberalisation.  Also to be found within its pages
are the service providers and software development
companies which have sprung up to provide support
services based on the development of intelligent
telecoms networks.

-INFORMIX: Informix to acquire Illustra Information
Technologies

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INFORMIX: Informix to
acquire Illustra Information Technologies --
Combination to give significant technology lead in
database market
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

Informix, the open distributed data management
company, today announced an agreement to acquire
Oakland, Calif.-based Illustra Information
Technologies, Inc., the leading supplier of dynamic
content management database software and tools for
managing complex data in the Internet,
multimedia/entertainment, financial services and
earth sciences and other markets. 

Approximately 12.9 million shares of Informix common
stock will be issued to acquire all outstanding
shares of Illustra.  An additional 2.1 million
Informix shares will be reserved for issuance in
connection with the assumption of Illustra's
outstanding stock options.  Informix currently has
approximately 135 million shares of stock
outstanding.  The acquisition of Illustra will be
accounted for as a tax free pooling of interest. 

The acquisition will enable Informix to integrate
Illustra's dynamic content management system into its
core parallel database technology, Dynamic Scalable
Architecture (DSA). Informix believes that this
technology integration will give the combined
organisation a significant market advantage over
competing database vendors in providing a powerful
database engine to support the next wave of database
applications - such as Web applications - which
require high-performance and scalability coupled with
dynamic content management capabilities.

Both companies realise that the Web is driving a
large and rapidly-growing new market for information
management.  This new market, which is driving a
shift from static and fixed data types to dynamic and
rich content, requires users to interact with
three-dimensional graphics, video, audio, HTML,
spatial data, and other complex data.  To effectively
manage this new content, users are demanding a
sophisticated database engine that combines the
robust, scalable, enterprise solutions offered by
relational databases with the flexible, extensible,
content management capabilities pioneered by
Illustra.  The integration of Informix and Illustra
products will offer users the ideal solution.

"This acquisition gives Informix a significant lead
over any other database vendor in capturing the
expanding market of content management, especially in
the Web space," said Phil White, chairman and CEO,
Informix.  "In addition to our shared visions and
markets, the synergy with Illustra's technology gives
us a significant time-to-market advantage.  Customers
who had a hard time choosing between the two
companies now have the clear choice for selecting a
database that will take them into the twenty-first
century and beyond." 

"With this agreement, no other database vendor is
better positioned in the Web market and the overall
information management market today," said Dick
Williams, president and CEO, Illustra.  "The
combination of Informix and Illustra technology will
create the database of choice for cyberspace because
it is the ideal coupling of unique strengths."

Industry Comments on Informix/Illustra Announcement
"In looking for an information management solution to
support our Internet products, we surveyed the entire
database market and concluded that Illustra was way
ahead of the pack in terms of understanding and
supporting this emerging class of complex multimedia
data types. We needed an architecture that could be
adapted and extended to include any type of complex
data. both now and in the future.  Illustra was the
only company able to deliver this kind of extensible,
dynamic content management.  With the number of
online users growing 30% per month, we also needed a
high performance, scalable data management solution. 
Informix is the ideal complement to Illustra because
of its proven parallel processing capabilities and
ability to deliver very high performance.  Together,
they are truly the database for cyberspace."

Linda Dozier
Chief Scientist, NaviSoft division
America Online

"The emergence of multimedia and other complex data
types is driving the need for more processing power,
from the home, to the desktop and up through the
enterprise.  With this comes the need for a database
management system that can control all this rich data
and facilitate the development and deployment of
multimedia.  Both companies have been important
partners for us because of their technologies.  We
see Illustra as a primary enabling technology for
this next generation of computing applications. 
Informix has the scalability and parallel processing
features essential for making dynamic multimedia
content ubiquitous, whether its delivered on an
interactive entertainment appliance to the home, or
on a massively parallel computer to the enterprise."

Dave House
Senior Vice President and General Manager,
Enterprise Server Group
Intel

"This announcement is a major step forward for the
industry.  Historically, relational database
companies have done a great job with structured data
but haven't addressed unstructured content.  The
Internet revolution makes handling and manipulating
documents, images, video, and a wide range of other
unstructured media types extremely important.  The
combination of Informix and Illustra shows that
Informix is really stepping up to the plate on
providing state-of-the-art systems for handling
unstructured content to its customers and partners. 
In addition, the Netscape LiveWire Pro visual
environment does a great job of connecting Web
servers to relational databases such as Informix and
Illustra.  Netscape LiveWire Pro, in conjunction with
the Informix/Illustra database technology, will make
storing and manipulating data on the net easier than
ever."

-PSION: PSION HC120 handheld computers used by Thames
Water maintenance engineers

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PSION: PSION HC120
handheld computers used by Thames Water maintenance
engineers, meter readers and water quality staff
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

It's a tough world for the Psion HC120 handheld
computers used by Thames Water's maintenance
engineers, meter readers and water quality staff. 
The HCs have been dropped down manholes, flung from
the roofs of speeding vans and even stolen.  Yet so
far, Thames has not lost any data as a result of
these testing conditions. 

In 1991, Thames carried out a study into the new
systems the business needed to improve efficiency and
quality of services.  It found three areas collecting
water and waste water samples, meter reading, and
scheduling distribution work where portable computers
would help to streamline the process.  The company
talked to as many suppliers of handheld computers it
could find up to 30 and was impressively thorough. 

Psion met the three key criteria.  The first was the
functionality of the HC series.  The second was the
modularity of the Psion approach: applications and
hardware options such as modems, bar code readers and
memory packs could be added easily.  And third was
value for money.   The Psion HC was the only product
we looked at that met all our selection criteria,'
says Dr Mike Hanbury, manager of Business Systems
Division, a group set up within Thames Water's
Management Services Division.

Thames has developed its own software for its field
applications.  In November 1991 it began work on the
Mobile Job Management System, the handheld
counterpart of an application that ruins on an IBM
mainframe.  Essentially, it's a field engineer
management system adapted for the water industry.  It
allocates work, such as checking for leaks and other
possible problems. 
A customer agent at the Thames Customer Centre takes
reports of leaks and other problems of supply, and
raises a job on the mainframe if appropriate.  The
system allocates the job to a network services
technician, (the water board inspector of old).  It
is then downloaded to the technician's HC, either
directly, or from a supervisor's HC in the field. 

The technician completes the job, and enters the
details into the HC, from which they are transferred
to the supervisor's HC.  The supervisor returns to
the depot, and uploads the details to the main
system.  Within 24 hours full details are on the
mainframe, so if the person who reported the. fault
rings again, they can be told what has been done. 
The network services technician also collects
information from data loggers, supplied by Radcom,
which record water flow rates in the mains for
leakage control and similar data. 

Thames intends to transfer the data from the HC to
the mainframe over radio, an approach already used by
other Psion clients such as Bass Leisure Machine
Services for its field engineers.  "The things the
Bass engineers are doing in the field are obviously
totally different, but there isn't much difference in
the approach," says Hanbury. 

Full roll-out of the Mobile Job Management System was
complete by the beginning of this year, with 400
technicians handling more than 4,000 jobs every day. 
Water sample collection, with software once again
written by Hanbury's Field Information Systems team,
went live in October 1993.  Used by water quality
inspectors, this system interfaces with TAPS the
Thames Advanced Pre-scheduling System.  Inspectors
enter details of the sample collection point, time
and date.  Bottles containing the samples are bar
coded, and all internal bar code scanner in the HC is
used to link the bottle to the record.  Eighty of
these are now in use.

70 Thames meter readers began to use HCs on 19 July
1993.  The meter readers work from home, and use the
HC's internal modem to get details from the depot of
next day's 'walk' using their home telephones.  On
the walk itself, they record meter readings and ally
problems.  Once home, they send this data to the
Thames customer information system, where it is
available for billing and analysis.

Thames is now looking at another application, its
Planned Maintenance Services (PMS) system, for
mobile, paperless operation using the Psion HC.  Job
management and planned maintenance are quite similar. 
"If you were there on day one, you would probably
only build one system for both jobs, but they were
taken in as packages, serving different parts of the
business," says Hanbury.  "The PMS looks after fixed
assets such as pumps and other electrical or
mechanical systems."

Mobile planned maintenance will be used by those
servicing one of Thames' most exciting projects, the
London Ring Main.  Longer than the Channel Tunnel and
deeper than London Under-round, this huge main has a
bore of between 100 and 125 inches. The relationship
between Psion and Thames is important to both
companies.  'Bearing in mind that we've now got more
than 600 units out there, it's very important to our
business that we get the working relationship with
them right in terms of support, says Hanbury.  'It's
important that if we have a hardware problem, Psion
will fix it and fix it fast.  But to date, we haven't
had a true hardware fault.

The planned maintenance and job management systems
are good candidates for a mobile geographical
information system, using digitised large scale maps
of streets, mains, hydrants and manholes.  The Psion
HCs have the potential to display maps should Thames
decide to take this approach.

-PSION: Need a new pump sir?  We'll be round in
thirty seconds

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PSION: Need a new pump
sir?  We'll be round in thirty seconds
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

In the fast moving drinks market, having an edge over
the competition is vitally important.  In many cases,
this means investing in the very latest technology. 
But new machines bring their own problems and both
the customer and the consumer have to be convinced of
the benefits.

Landlords or pub managers may find that more and more
of their keg technicians arrive armed with computers
instead of pen and paper.  HP Bulmer Limited were one
of the first to "go techno" equipping their staff
with the top selling Psion handheld range.  And the
customers, initially reticent about the new
technology, became swift converts to the new system
when they saw the benefits it could provide. 

Bulmer's IT Manager, Robin Flower, tells the story of
a moody landlord who phoned the telesales desk of
Bulmer to ask for a Strongbow pump to be fitted in
his pub.  He put the phone down and saw a man
standing at the bar with a hand-held computer.
"Bloody yuppies," the landlord mumbled to himself and
strode forward to serve the computer-toting gent.
`Good afternoon," said the man, "I'm from Bulmer.  I
understand you're looking for a Strongbow pump?"

As the telesales staff had been typing in the details
of the landlord's request, a keg technician 200 yards
up the road from the pub had been accessing the
company's database at the same time from his Psion
handheld computer.  A coincidence?  Yes, but it shows
the customer service benefits computers can bring to
a company. 

Bulmer are the world's largest cider manufacturer and
they hold 45% of the cider market in the UK. 
Strongbow and Woodpecker are the top two cider brands
respectively and are served in some 60,000 pubs,
clubs and bars.  The company's database which holds
all of this information is affectionately known at
Bulmer as the "pub universe".  This database contains
vast quantities of information ranging from a retail
outlet's history right up to plans and profiles for
marketing future products. 

With only 33 keg technicians to manage their 60,000
outlets, the task of scheduling a day's work at
Bulmer was a huge one.  Apart from new installations,
there are maintenance audits to be carried out.  The
sheer size of Bulmer's "pub universe" - they have GBP
33 million worth of equipment in pubs and clubs -
makes it very difficult to manage and there were
instances where some of their equipment hadn't been
seen for over a year!

Bulmers sought a technological solution to the
problem. "We are the No. 1 cider manufacturer in the
world," says Flower.  "We want to stay one step ahead
of the pack to remain No. 1. With the Psion handheld
computer the whole scheduling process has been
simplified and streamlined, and the "pub universe" is
put to much better use." 

Nowadays there is no need for keg technicians to make
costly phone calls to the office to find out their
next jobs.  Using the Psion and a modem, up to three
days work can be scheduled, including suggested ways
to get there.  These more flexible routes not only
start and end as close to the technician's home as
possible, but have allowed the scheduling of spot
audits to check up on the company's "missing"
equipment. 

The benefits of using the "Keg Technician System" are
greater efficiency leading to cost savings.  "With
better journey planning and scheduling, Bulmer's keg
technician's call rate has increased from five to
nine calls daily and as a result, Bulmers can now
provide better customer service," Flower continues. 
Further benefits have been due to more regular audits
in the field helping reduce Bulmer equipment losses
from 10% to 7% per year.

Overall, Bulmer's has saved an estimated GBP 1m so
far on its investment of GBP 250,000 and is expected
to save a potential GBP 3m in total by using the
Psion "Keg Technician System".

(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

Psion PLC, the international manufacturer of portable
computers and datacommunications products, will be
exhibiting at SERVICE MANAGEMENT EUROPE 1996, (stand
121). 

In April 1995, the Workabout product range was
launched for corporate industrial markets. This
product family provides a cost-effective solution for
applications at the lower end of the corporate market
place complementing the HC range and building oil the
success enjoyed for so many years by the Organiser
family in this area.  Initial market reaction to the
Workabout has been positive.  The Organiser 11 family
continued to sell well for a range first brought to
the market in 1986.

The outlook for HC Corporate products is for stronger
growth in 1995-6, with applications for railway
ticketing, field service, transport and inventory
management.  Interim results (for the six months
ended 30th June 1995) showed sales of the HC
Corporate products were ahead at GBP 3.98m (1994 -
GBP 3.60m).

Highlights are as follows:                            
                    1995        1994          CHANGE

* International sales up 46% to GBP 18.55m (1994 -
GBP 12.71m)
* Turnover in the US was up 65% at GBP 4.76m (1994
GBP 2.88m)
* Sales in the United Kingdom rose 37% to GBP 21.27m
(1994: GBP 15.57)
* Sales of the Series 3 and 3a were up 48% at GBP
24.74m (1994 GBP 16.73m) 

David Potter, Chairman, said today:
"During the first half, trading was at record levels,
margins improved and significant cash was generated. 
However, stronger growth was constrained by limited
supplies of certain semiconductors.  During the
second half, higher deliveries are promised but there
will also be substantial investment in both marketing
and research and development.  Demand levels are
strong and in August a third high-capacity
surface-mount production line was added at a cost of
GBP 1.1m. The outlook for the rest of the year is
good."

-PSION: Bass - facing up to the challenges of the
1990s

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PSION: Bass - facing up
to the challenges of the 1990s
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

The humble slot machine has become a permanent
feature in pub entertainment.  BLit behind the bright
lights, whirring reels and endless "nudges" lies a
highly sophisticated business. One of the major
players is Bass Leisure Management Systems (BLMS),
part of the Bass drinks group.  They have 42,000
machines spread across 10,000 sites and every week
400 of their staff count a staggering GBP 3 million
in cash from machines all around the country. 

Traditionally, when the cash was collected, the split
between BLMS and the pubs had to be calculated
manually.  "This process was open to errors as large
as 25 per cent," said Mike England, Computer Services
Manager at BLMS.  "We felt the answer was to automate
the collection system." BLMS examined some of the
finest high tech solutions available and chose the
Psion HC.

At the user end, the BLMS system consists of a small
hand-held terminal - no bigger than a calculator with
an in-built modem - and a till-roll printer with a
specially designed case. Information about the
machines to be visited and the terms and conditions
which apply to them is downloaded each night to a PC
at the BLMS depot.  The collectors then transfer this
information onto their Psion terminals either
directly from the PC or via the telephone. Collected
information is then up-loaded to the computer in the
same way. 

The immediate benefit was to the collectors. 
Chrissie Holt, the first collector to use tile system
said: "Psion have made our jobs so much easier. 
Everything we do now is self- explanatory.  We can
now do more work, cover more machines and it is much
easier to get things right first time!"

The biggest benefit to BLMS is cost savings with the
initial investment being recouped within two years
but other pluses have emerged also.  Psion terminals
provide managers with important information on
efficiency and we are able to identify problems early
and take appropriate action, for example, by
providing further training." 

The full benefits for BLMS are yet to come.  As well
as speeding up the process, it will produce cost
savings of GBP 80,000 a year on stationery alone.

-EUROPEAN COMMISSION: New look innovation and
technology transfer news letter

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION: New
look innovation and technology transfer news letter
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

The Innovation and Technology Transfer newsletter
published by the European Commission has been
relaunched.  The newsletter, which aims among other
things to help disseminate R&D information more
widely amongst potential users, now has separate
editions for English, French and German speaking
readers.  It presents its vast range of information
in a bright, accessible format that should open new
areas of interest to every reader.

Innovation and Technology Transfer is published six
times a year by the European Commission's Innovation
Programme, which aims to strengthen Europe's
innovation infrastructure and disseminate research
results to industry.  The emphasis is on providing
timely news relevant to these objectives and in-depth
case studies about successful projects.  This enables
readers to gain an insight into topics that directly
reflect their own concerns and requirements.

Readers who are not involved with the Innovation
Programme's work are given a chance to see how
successful and potentially useful that work can be;
those who are already benefiting from the initiatives
can gain from the cross-fertilisation of ideas and
results that characterises the nature of the
programme.  Innovation and Technology Transfer offers
subjects as diverse as 'cleaner magnesium
production', 'designing energy efficient offices' and
'planning for the future in IT'.  Some topics are
weighted towards industrialists and some towards the
research laboratory.  In all, it is a broad, lively
view of the wealth of EU research and technological
development activities, with the accent on
exploitation of these activities' results. 

The newsletter also publishes more general
information that is relevant to the Innovation
programme.  The Policy News section discusses new
initiatives and legislation.  The articles here bring
out the impact of policy changes across the EU; they
also provide a forum in which new programmes can be
announced. Innovation Programme News covers the
latest news from this programme, including details of
new measures to promote an 'innovation-friendly'
environment in Europe, and publications and
information services to assist with technology
transfer, as well as news on funding possibilities
offered by the programme. 

Summaries of important new publications and
announcements of conferences take up the final part
of each issue of the newsletter.  Availability
details are given for the publications and sources
for obtaining more information given for the
conferences. In fact. a feature of Innovation and
Technology Transfer is that throughout the newsletter
contact points are cited at the end of each article,
so that readers can easily see how to obtain further
information.  With the accessibility offered by
Innovation and Technology Transfer there is no excuse
for readers not to participate fully in the disparate
fields which come under the Innovation Programme
umbrella.

-EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  A guiding hand through EU
acronyms

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  A
guiding hand through EU acronyms
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

A new publication from the European Commission offers
help to those whose interest in European Union
research is sometimes hindered by the use of
acronyms.  An increasing part of research and
development vocabulary, the use of acronyms helps
reduce long-winded terminology and enables complex
ideas to be contained in simple phrases.  However,
where acronyms come together in large numbers, the
aim of offering simplicity is often overturned and
the meaning of the information can become confused.

'European Union R&D Acronyms' is a single desktop
reference tool for those wanting to know more about
EU RTD activities.  It is a facet of the EU's
commitment to spreading the message about its
research activities and opening up information to an
ever-increasing target audience.  The intention is to
ensure that as many people as possible have access to
the core information about EU research, to encourage
exploitation of results and participation in current
programmes. 

Within the dictionary the 4,900 entries are explained
in alphabetical order.  The entry for each acronym
also identifies the originating body and the general
programme area to which the acronym belongs.  This
extra information helps set the acronym in context
and provides a clearer idea of the background to the
project or programme to which the acronym refers. 
Users can not only establish the meaning of an
acronym but can ascertain the wider context implied
by its use. 

The dictionary is based on the information held in
one of the databases of CORDIS, the Community
Research and Development Information Service which is
operated under the European Union's Innovation
Programme.  It also serves as a means to alert
potential users to CORDIS and the other information
products offered by this service.  For existing users
of CORDIS the dictionary also offers a concise
explanation of the various subject codes found in the
databases and can thus be used as part of the query
forming process when interrogating CORDIS. Absolute
newcomers to EU RTD are recommended to register with
CORDIS for a more complete and current information
resource, although the content of 'European Union R&D
Acronyms' has a potential value for everyone
interested in this area of activity.

'European Union R&D Acronyms' is published by the
Office for Official Publications of the European
Communities at a price of ECU 25 and is available
from all the Office's sales agents in EU members
states and worldwide.

-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION COMMISSION: Viewing of cable
channels on the increase

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION
COMMISSION: Viewing of cable channels on the increase
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:231295

Cable and satellite channels have regained some of
the audience share lost in 1994, according to the
ITC's most recent survey of viewing in broadband
cable homes.  The share of viewing taken by cable and
satellite channels increased between October 1994 and
October 1995 from 34.9% to 39.6%, while BBC1's share
fell from 24.3% in 1994 to 21.2% in 1995.  Viewing
shares remained fairly constant for ITV and BBC2 over
the two years but Channel 4's share also fell by one
percentage point.

Sky One remained overall the most popular cable
channel, with a share of 4.8% although this share has
fallen from 6.6% recorded in 1994 and 9.6% in 1993. 
Indeed, in the league table of audience shares (table
1) Sky One dropped to third cable place for the first
time behind the Movie Channel (5.8%) and Sky Movies
(5.2%) within homes receiving these channels.

1995 has been a successful year for cable and
satellite channels targeted at the child audience. 
Children's viewing of cable and satellite channels as
a whole accounts for over half of their total viewing
(54.4% of 2 to 15 year olds viewing in October 1995
compared to 47.3% in October 1994).  The preference
for the "new" channels is even more pronounced
amongst the younger age groups with viewing of cable
and satellite channels accounting for 63.9% of
viewing amongst 2 to 9 year olds.  Most notably, the
viewing share for the Cartoon Network has risen
across all individuals from 2.0% in 1994 to 4.5% in
1995.

Amongst 2 to 9 year olds this share reaches 30.5%.
The recently launched Disney Channel accounts for
1.8% of total viewing rising to 6.2% of all
children's viewing (2 to 15 year olds), and 10.1% of
the younger age group (2 to 9 year olds).  The
Children's Channel, one of the longest running cable
and satellite channels. now re-launched as TCC, also
fared well in 1995.  Viewing shares amongst all
individuals doubled (from a 0.6% share in 1994 to a
1.3% share in 1995), while amongst children (2 to 15
year olds) this share rose to 5.1% of all viewing.

Other key results from the study are:
* The proportion of viewers with 2 or more decoders,
giving television sets in different rooms access to
the range of cable channels, increased from 28.4% in
1994 to 34.8% in 1995.  This benefits the more
specialised channels which may appeal to individual
members of the family.  Thematic channels such as the
Movie Channel, Sky Movies, Sky Sports and The Cartoon
Network, achieved greater audience shares in homes
with multiple set connections.  This increased both
the total amount of viewing in those homes, by 2.8
hours a week per viewer, and the cable and satellite
share, which rose to 41.9% compared to 38.3% in
single connection homes.

* Viewers in higher socioeconomic groups continue to
remain lighter viewers of cable and satellite
channels although this characteristic has become less
pronounced (a 33.2% share amongst AB viewers in 1995,
compared with a 24.1% share in 1994).  Cable and
satellite channels disproportionately favoured by AB
viewers in 1995 were Sky One, Sky Sports and
Nickelodeon.

* The socio-economic difference in viewing patterns
has become less marked over the years.  The heavy
skew towards DE viewing of cable and satellite
channels has declined from 54.1% in 1993 to 34.7% in
1994 and 38.1% in 1995 compared to an overall average
viewing of 39.6% in 1995.  DE viewers watched
proportionally more of Sky Movies, The Movie Channel,
UK Gold, The Cartoon Network and The Disney Channel.

* The amount of self-reported time spent viewing
television in broadband homes overall has decreased
slightly to an average of 25.13 hours per week in
1995, compared to 25.32 in 1994.  Amongst children
this tendency has been dramatically reversed with
overall viewing amongst 2 to 15 year olds increasing
from 19.95 hours in 1994 to 22.47 hours in 1995. 
This is largely accounted for by increased viewing of
child-friendly channels such as The Cartoon Network,
The Disney Channel and TCC, together with the
continued appeal of Nickelodeon.

* The level of expressed satisfaction with cable
television services remains very high overall,
although slightly lower than in 1994 (86.4% said they
were very or quite satisfied/pleased with the
services in 1995, compared with 87.2% in 1994). 
Satisfaction is higher amongst viewers in homes
subscribing to premium channels, with 92.3% of
respondents in homes receiving all three Sky Movie
Channels plus Disney stating that they were very
(32.1%) or quite (60.2%) pleased with the service.

Technical Notes
The ITC's study was undertaken by Continental
Research over a two week period in October.  It was
based on a total of 1,306 one- week diaries derived
from 653 respondents aged 2 years old and over
representative of broadband cable viewers in 39 cable
franchises in different parts of the country.  The
diaries covered the two weeks from Monday 16 October
to Sunday 29 October 1995.

This is the latest in a series of similar studies,
conducted by Continental Research for the Cable
Authority in 1990 and for the ITC in 1991, 1992, 1993
and 1994.  The ITC plans to publish a review of these
studies early in 1996.

Tables giving more detailed information are attached. 
Copies of the full report are available from
Continental Research priced GBP 150.00.

-WARRANTECH: Warrantech moves into UK

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-WARRANTECH: Warrantech
moves into UK
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:020196

Warrantech Corporation, the rapidly-expanding
provider of extended guarantees, service contracts
and database management services which has operations
in the USA, Canada, Mexico and Japan, has opened a
European headquarters in Marylebone Road, London. 

The move follows the acquisition by Warrantech of
Southwark-based Home Guarantee Corporation Pie and
the formation of Warrantech Europe Plc, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Warrantech Corporation. 
Home Guarantee Corporation plc provides UK homebuyers
and sellers with a range of extended warranty
products through members of The National Association
of Estate Agents (NAEA). 

In addition to Home Guarantee Corporation, Warrantech
Europe will comprise four other UK divisions -
Warrantech Automotive, Warrantech Consumer Product
Services, Warrantech Creditor and Warrantech Training
and Motivation.

From their Grove House headquarters in Marylebone
Road, the divisions will provide extended warranty
products on a wide range of equipment including cars,
business equipment, office and home computers, mobile
telephones, and major domestic appliances. 
Warrantech Europe will also provide a full database
management, marketing and customer care service for
clients in the automotive, financial, manufacturing,
retail and service sectors.

Major UK clients already include the NAEA, Office
World and the Hartwell Motor Group and the company is
currently in negotiation to provide extended
warranties and other marketing services to a number
of major UK and Continental companies.

One of the leading publicly-quoted warranty companies
in the U.S. (NASDAQ symbol: WTEC), Warrantech
Corporation is an associate company of American
International Group, one of the world's largest
insurance companies with global assets of more than
$100 billion.

Warrantech Corporation Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Joel San Antonio said the decision to
establish Warrantech Europe with a headquarters in
London was part of the Corporation's stated objective
to become the global leader in the provision of
innovative marketing and administrative services for
business. 

He said:
"We see the UK and the Continent as the next logical
step in our expansion programme.  As consumers become
more demanding about the products and services they
purchase, our range of extended warranty products
will give greater financial security to customers,
particularly on items such as homes, consumer
electronics and computers."

Donald Alcorn, Managing Director of Home Guarantee
Corporation, has been appointed Managing Director of
Warrantech Europe.  Mr Alcorn, who has worked in the
UK insurance industry for 30 years, said:
"Warrantech Europe is committed to providing
manufacturers., retailers and service providers with
a range of marketing and administrative services
which will enhance the value of the products they
provide to their customers." 

During the year ended March 31, 1995, Warrantech
Corporation increased gross revenues from nearly $47
million to over $71 million, whilst in the six months
to September 30, 1995, net revenues were a record
$43.41 million - a 40 per cent increase on the same
period last year.

-EUROPEAN COMMISSION: Background report -- Small
businesses in the European Union

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION:
Background report -- Small businesses in the European
Union
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

INTRODUCTION
Small businesses account for a major share of the GDP
and employment of the Community and thus make a
significant contribution to its economy.  The
Community has long recognised their importance for
creating employment and stimulating growth.  Indeed,
the Treaty on European Union makes a specific
commitment to "encouraging an environment favourable
to initiative and to the development of undertakings
throughout the Community, particularly small and
medium-sized undertakings". 

The best way for the Community to stimulate
entrepreneurs and businesses is by improving and
simplifying the environment in which they operate. 
They need an environment which a@lows them to be
competitive in world markets, particularly vis a vis
the US, Japan and the fast-emerging economies of the
Far East. 

The Commission has drawn up a report' which gives a
comprehensive view of the measures taken at EU level
to improve the business environment and to support
the development of small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs).  The report also looks at collaboration with
the Member States, professional organisations and
other European institutions.

IMPROVING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
A recent study from the European Observatory for SMEs
has estimated that the total annual costs of
administrative burdens for business in Europe were
between 180-230 billion ECUs, the equivalent of 3-4%
of EU GDR There is therefore a serious economic cost
which needs to be reduced. 

Assessing the impact of legislation on small business
The role of DG XXIII at the Commission, which is in
charge of enterprise policy, is to ensure that the
Commission is taking appropriate account of the
impact on enterprises, and in particular small
businesses, of any legislative proposals.  Account
must be taken not only of the compliance costs and
other burdens of a regulation but also the
administrative procedures or requirements which stem
from it.! Where appropriate, a business impact
assessment is undertaken which involves full
consultation and the setting out of often conflicting
interests of different business sectors.

The fiscal environment
The Commission has identified three priority problems
for small businesses as far as their fiscal position
is concerned: their capacity to attract adequate
financial resources, their capacity to respond to
administrative complexity and finally the problem of
change of proprietor.  A Recommendation on the
taxation of SMEs aims to ensure greater equity in the
fiscal treatment of retained or reinvested profits
between sole traders, partnerships and limited
companies and to lift the fiscal obstacles in the
transformation from sole trader or partnership to
limited company.  The Commission has also been
working on the transfer of ownership of SMEs. 

The financial environment
Amongst the initiatives to improve the financial
environment, a Round Table of bankers and small
businesses has been set up to improve small business
access to finance.  A Recommendation on payment terms
for commercial transactions aims to combat delays in
payment and a Directive has been proposed on
cross-border payments.  Directives on insurance have
been adopted which simplify the conditions of access
to insurance markets as well as the operating
conditions.  Two new financial instruments have been
put in place: subsidised loans for job-creating SMEs
and the European Investment Fund, (see below). 

The Internal Market
Efforts to improve the business environment are also
under way in other policy areas.  In general, the
Internal Market is seen as having a positive effect
on the business environments of small business.  It
is seen as providing a stimulus to overall demand and
business development and allowing for a reduction in
average production costs as a result of mark-et
expansion.  On the other hand, it has led to keener
competition and greater pressure on costs and price
as factors in competitiveness.  It may lead to a
certain, amount of restructuring in the short-run
while the positive effects materialise in the medium
to longer-term. 

Competition
SMEs have been freed from unnecessary administrative
burdens with exemptions and special regulations in
competition policy.  As far as state aid is
concerned, the Commission's traditionally favourable
attitude to state aid for SMEs was formalised by the
adoption in 1992 of a specific framework, to be
reexamined in 1995.  This framework provides Member
States with the option of granting aid, within
certain set limits, designed to encourage investment
by SMEs and to encourage them to improve their
competence through advice and information.  Member
States are dispensed from notifying the Commission of
very small sums of aid which it considers to have a
negligible impact on trade between Member States and
on competition. 

Energy policy
The Union's energy policy has a direct effect on the
development and Operation of SMEs since its
objectives are to meet the needs of individual and
industrial users at less cost and under circumstances
which ensure security of supply and environmental
protection.  The availability of energy at best
prices and on the best terms is a determining factor
in strengthening the overall competitiveness of the
economy and of SMEs in particular. 

Environmental policy
In November 1994, the Commission presented a
Communication on Economic Growth and the Environment
which underlines the need for market-based
instruments in the area of environmental policies,
such as eco- labelling, tax rebates for green
investments etc.  The idea is for companies to be
able to integrate environmental considerations in
their policies in a more flexible way.

PROGRAMMES AND SUPPORT MEASURES
A large part of Community support comes through
financial instruments, in particular the Structural
Funds, as well as Community programmes, such as the
research and vocational training programmes. 

Financial instruments
The European Investment Bank (EIB)
The EIB finances large-scale investments through
individual loans and modest investments, in
particular those of small businesses, indirectly
through its global loans.  Those global loans are
concluded with financial intermediaries operating at
the national, regional or even local level.  This
puts the EIB in a position to support smaller
investments which it would not be able to finance by
individual loans, for reasons of management
efficiency.  The field of application of global loans
has been progressively increased in order to adapt to
the development of needs and the diversification of
Community policies.  They usually concern investments
of small businesses in industry, services (notably
tourism and agriculture) and small-scale
infrastructure projects contributing to Community
objectives in the areas of regional development,
environmental protection, energy or transport.

In 1994 the EIB concluded global loans totalling ECU
3.281 million and credits on current global loans
amounted to ECU 2.763 million. 60% of this amount was
devoted to supporting SMEs, 90% of which employed
less than 50 people.  Since 1990 the EIB has provided
significant support to the financing of SMEs.  Nearly
36,000 have benefited from credits in a total of over
ECU 9.4 billion.  Over 80% of them are enterprises
employing less than 50 people and 90% less than 250
people. 

The EIB will now not only accelerate the financing of
infrastructure but it will also help job-creating
SMEs. 

The SME facility: subsidised loans for job-creating
SMEs
A mechanism for interest subsidies relating to ECU 1
billion in global EIB loans in favour of small
businesses was approved in April 1994 by the Council
of Ministers.  The interest subsidy of 2% per year is
applied for five years on a maximum loan amount of
ECU 30,000 per job created.  The SME facility should
allow 30,000 jobs to be created.  The mechanism was
implemented in September 1994 and by the end of April
1995, 48% had been allocated to some 2,100 businesses
and more than 23,000 new jobs are planned. 96% of the
volume of loans was granted to SMEs with less than
250 employees.

The European Investment Fund: loan guarantees for
SMEs
At the Edinburgh Council in 1992, it was decided to
create a European Investment Fund (EIF) aimed at
granting loan guarantees for projects relating to
trans-European networks! and for small business.  The
EIF concentrates its attention on those areas where
it can be complementary to existing sources of
finance.  It offers two main types of financial
products, financial guarantees and equity.  The
initial ceiling on the overall commitments of the
Fund has been set at 3 times its subscribed capital
but this may be raised at a later stage once adequate
reserves have been established.  The Fund will work
through appropriate financial intermediaries in the
Member States rather than providing direct guarantees
to individual SMEs. 

Structural Funds
Regional initiatives
On average 10% of the total resources of the European
Regional Development Fund are devoted specifically to
measures dealing with the promotion and improvement
of the economic environment of SMEs.  Funds go to
encouraging demand for services from small businesses
as well as to the supply of services to them. 

A so-called SME Community initiative, allocated ECU 1
billion for 1994-99, aims to contribute to the
internationalisation of small businesses and to
promote improvements in their competitiveness. 

Seven priority areas have been identified:
improvement of production and organisation systems;
environment and rational use of energy; cooperation
with research centres; access to new markets;
cooperation networks; strengthening vocational
qualifications and improved access to the financial
system. 

Twelve other Community initiatives also contribute to
the development of small businesses.  Amongst these
are REGIS which is concerned with the most peripheral
regions of the EU, RETEX which is designed to assist
enterprises in the textiles sector, URBAN which
targets urban areas and ADAPT which helps the labour
force to respond to the changing needs of the labour
market.

Other innovative forms of Community support include
global development subsidies.  These were introduced
in 1988 and are granted to an intermediary body for
carrying out a territorial development strategy which
it negotiates with the Commission and implements
under its own responsibility.  Between 1988-1993, 31
agreements were established for a total combined
amount of ECU 687 million. 

Social funding
Recognising that small businesses are a major source
of new employment, the Commission aims to encourage
entrepreneurial activity to stimulate the creation of
more SMEs.  The European Social Fund (ESF) has three
priorities: to improve education and initial
training; to increase competitiveness and prevent
unemployment by adapting the workforce to change with
continuing training; and to improve the employment
opportunities of the long-term unemployed.

The promotion of a more systematic approach to
continued training is planned to involve about ECU 6
billion during 1994-1999, or some 14% of total Social
Fund allocations. 

Other funds
Small businesses benefit from other Funds, such as
the Agricultural Funds and they are principal
beneficiaries of Community structural interventions
in favour of fisheries. 

Research and technological development (RTD)
Increased efforts are being made to facilitate the
participation of SMEs in Community research
programmes. Under the 3rd Framework Programme
(1990-94) a total of 6368 small businesses
participated in RTD programmes with a budgetary
commitment of ECU 1035 million or 22% of the total
Community financial commitment.

Within the Brite-Euram Programme (Industrial and
Materials Technologies) the Commission introduced two
schemes specifically for small businesses: the
feasibility awards which are aimed at SMEs with RTD
capacity who wish to play a major role in a large
multi-partner project and CRAFT which targets those
with little or no RTD means, enabling them to engage
third parties to carry out RTD work on their behalf.
80% of SMEs taking part in CRAFT are total newcomers
to EU RTD and 50% have no previous RTD cooperation
experience at all. 

About 920 separate SMEs participated in the
Information Technology programme ESPRIT III, with a
bud-et of ECU 1532 million for the period 1991-94. 
They carry out about 31% of the total of the relevant
work of the programme, up from 21% during the
previous programme.  In the next programme, running
from 1994-98, participation of SMEs will be further
encouraged.

The VALUE programme is aimed at promoting the spread
and effective use of results of scientific and
technological research in order to strengthen the
competitiveness of European industry.  SMEs have been
involved in 69% of the projects as contractor, 39% as
partner and 38% as participant. 

Under the fourth Framework Programme special budgets
have been allocated within the different programmes
for specific SME measures totalling over ECU 700
million, or 9% of the total budget of these
programmes.  In addition, SMEs will participate in
other actions within the mainstream research
programmes. 

SPRINT aims to stimulate innovation and technology
transfer, particularly in small businesses. 
Altogether 162,600 SMEs have benefited from the
SPRINT programme, either by purchasing, testing or
keeping informed of the new technologies.

EUROTECH CAPITAL is an initiative to encourage the
financing by private capital of high technology
transnational projects.  In 1994 the Eurotech capital
network comprised 13 members, covering the majority
of Member States, who had undertaken to invest a
total of ECU 202 million. 

From 1974-1989 half of the projects under the THERMIE
energy programme involved SMEs in a total of 2450
projects representing ECU 1.2 billion of financial
support.  The THERMIE programme for 1995-1998 gives
financial support to projects implementing innovative
energy technologies and to a whole series of
complementary activities including technological
stimulation of SMEs. 

While more than half the funds from the EURET
programme, which supports research in transport, has
gone to large enterprises, SMEs come second among
beneficiaries with 19% of the budget and 25% of the
number of participants.

Vocational training
In addition to the resources from the European Social
Fund (some ECU 20 billion for the period 1989-1993),
there are a number of programmes aimed at raising the
level of qualifications throughout the Community,
such as EUROTECNET, COMETT, FORCE and PETRA.  These
programmes were completed at the end of 1994 and
replaced by the LEONARDO programme which will run
from 1995-99. 

The EUROTECNET programme aimed to promote innovation
in vocational training resulting from technological
change and 18% of projects from 1990-94 targeted
SMEs.

The COMETT programme encouraged intra-Community
cooperation between university and business in the
field of technologies, particularly advanced
technologies.  About 75% of enterprises involved as
partners in one or more COMETT projects were small
businesses and 80% included at least one small
business.  Alto-ether it is estimated that 40,000
SMEs will have benefited directly from COMETT II
(1990-94), including at least 15,000 which have
received students on placements from different
countries.  As far as continuing training is
concerned, it is estimated that 200,000 small
business employees have taken a training course or
are using training materials. Furthermore, over 1000
SME intermediary organisations, such as chambers of
commerce or trade associations have participated in
the COMETT partnerships with a multiplier effect on
small businesses. 

FORCE had the objective of encouraging enterprises,
particularly small ones, to invest in continuing
vocational training.  Between 1991-93 2,250 small
businesses or groups of small businesses participated
in this programme as partners in more than two thirds
of the projects, directly or indirectly. 

The LEONARDO programme (1995-99) takes up three main
types of trans-national cooperation measures of the
earlier programmes: pilot cooperation projects,
exchange programmes and surveys and analysis.  It
includes an important innovation in that all measures
should have a trans-national character and a stronger
accent is put on disseminating and analysing the
results.

Environmental programmes
Out of 99 projects co-financed in 1993 under the LIFE
financial instrument for the environment, it is
estimated that 43 involved small businesses,
receiving 38% of the total granted. 

A number of actions have been pursued to help inform
small businesses about improving health and safety. 
The Commission has drawn up a document on risk
assessment in the workplace with one part
particularly devoted to small businesses.  A
self-audit method for health and safety at work has
been prepared to help heads of SMEs to do their
assessments.  A conference entitled "Taking risks and
working safely" was principally geared towards small
businesses and the European Agency for Health and
Safety at Work, which should come into operation in
1995, will pay particular attention to the special
problems of SMEs.  A proposed programme called SAFE
(Safety Action for Europe) will support projects to
promote improvements in safety, hygiene and health at
work, to improve work practice and to influence
attitudes in order to reduce accidents and
occupational diseases. 

The information market
The IMPACT programme(1991-95), targeting the single
market for information services, has undertaken
several actions in favour of small businesses.  In
1994 it implemented over 700 actions on awareness and
promotion of electronic information services.  Small
businesses need advanced methods of access to and
processing of information to become and remain
competitive.  Also the productive industry of
electronic information services is itself largely
composed of small businesses.

Out of the 160 contracts under the TEDIS programme
(Trade Electronic Data Interchange Systems) half of
the prime contractors are SMEs.  TEDIS promotes
electronic data interchange (EDI) standards and has
developed a network of 40 centres in various European
regions to stimulate the knowledge and use of EDI to
help small businesses.  TEDIS is also active in
several international cooperative ventures. 

Providing information for business
The network of Euro-Info Centres (EICs) provides
information for businesses in their region on the
various Community programmes and policies.  EICs have
played an important role in providing information on
public tenders and on research and technology
programmes.  The information and advice mission of
EICs puts them in a special position to understand
the actual problems encountered by SMEs in
implementing legislation or in participating in
certain programmes.  The Commission therefore
consults them directly or asks them to carry out
specific studies based on questionnaires circulated
to the SMEs in their region. Promoting business
cooperation and partnership

The Business Cooperation Network (BC-NET) was
established to encourage an awareness of increasing
business opportunities across Europe.  Its primary
task is to help identify other business partners. 
Other initiatives to promote business cooperation and
partnership include the Business Communication Centre
(BCC) and the Europartenariat and Interprise
programmes.  Europartenariat establishes contacts
between SMEs in different regions of the Community so
that they can conclude technical, commercial and
financial agreements. 

The European Enterprise and Innovation Centres
(EEICs), launched in 1984, are public/private
partnership structures which identify and select
entrepreneurs and projects which offer the most
complete range of services to enterprise and
accompany the firm during the start-up period.  There
are 70 fully operational EEICs throughout the EU
which have contributed to the creation of more than
2,800 businesses representing 16,000 direct jobs.

Pilot schemes
A number of pilot schemes are being undertaken by the
Commission in areas such as access to research and
technological development, access to public
contracts, standardisation and certification,
commerce and distribution and the craft sector and
small businesses.  The Commission will be supporting
the creation of 7 cross-border offices to help the
craft sector and small businesses develop
cross-border activities and overcome existing
barriers.

Following an audit of 842 small businesses, a report
produced by AFNOR (Association Francaise pour
normalisation) showed that the principles of the
single market and standardisation are generally very
poorly understood because of difficulties getting
access to information and because of the low
participation rate of SMEs in the work on European,
or even national, standards.  Small businesses have
difficulty formalising their quality procedures and
often make over-complex interpretation$ of standards
and set up cumbersome and expensive systems.  As
regards certification, there is still much work to be
done in completing the single market, in particular
on mutual recognition.  SMEs are often unfamiliar
with EC markings and see the cost of obtaining
certificates as a problem.

The Commission launched a pilot scheme in 1989 to
stimulate the creation of start-up capital funds.  It
has supported the establishment of 23 start-up funds
whose aim is to make capital available to firms which
are in the embryonic stage of existence and which
have great difficulty obtaining this on the market. 

Another pilot programme, Commerce 2000, aims to
encourage cooperation between small businesses by
establishing modern methods of management and new
technologies. 52 feasibility study projects and 6
pilot projects were selected in 1994, the results of
which should become available in the course of 1995. 

The Community has a multi-annual programme of work
for cooperatives, mutual societies, associations and
foundations in the EU.  The programme provides a
formal framework for EU action and aims to preserve
diversity in the sector, to encourage solidarity and
to help cooperative enterprises to respond to
economic development and social progress.

With a view to improving the available statistical
information, Eurostat, the EU's statistical off ice,
in conjunction with national offices, has begun to
collect all the financial information available on
enterprises in order to highlight the importance of
small business for production and employment.  In
conjunction with DG XXIII, Eurostat has published at
regular intervals its report "Enterprises in Europe"
which contains detailed information by sector of
economic activity and by payroll size on all the
enterprises in the EU. 

International cooperation
Programmes have been set up to stimulate and support
cooperation between enterprises in the EU and those
in EFTA countries, Central and Eastern Europe, the
former Soviet Union and Georgia, Asia, Latin America
and the Mediterranean.

In the context of the PHARE programme, the Commission
has supported the development of SMEs by providing
technical assistance in many countries.  Between
1990-93 the EU made a contribution of ECU 320 million
to countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

Within the framework of TACIS, which fosters links
between the EU and the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) and Mongolia, ECU 19 million has been
allocated to support small businesses in 1992, ECU 20
million in 1993 and ECU 12 million in 1994, a total
of ECU 51 Million.  The programme has been based on
the need to build up intermediary agencies to provide
assistance to existing entrepreneurs and those who
wish to set up businesses.

MEDINVEST is a programme to support the development
of small businesses in Mediterranean countries and
has a budget of ECU 12.2 million for 1993-95. 
ALINVEST, with a budget of ECU 18.5 million, aims to
facilitate commercial exchanges, technology and
know-how transfer and financing to the mutual benefit
of Latin American and European enterprises.

The ECIP (European Communities Investment Partners)
is a financial instrument for the developing
countries of Latin America, Asia and the
Mediterranean which facilitates the creation of joint
enterprises.  The orientation of the ECIP scheme is
towards SMEs.

Initiatives to develop contacts between SMEs are also
underway with China and Japan.  Given the importance
of the private sector for the development of African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States, the Fourth Lome
Convention provides for a vast range of instruments
which can be used to support SMEs in those countries. 
A large part of these programmes are also of direct
or indirect interest to European SMEs. 

COLLABORATION AND CONSULTATION
Consultation with business organisations
The Commission regularly consults and informs
associations representative of small businesses, the
craft sector and commerce at the European level on
Community activities specifically directed towards
them as well as on all subjects that may concern
them, like the Structural Funds, RTD programmes and
legislative proposals.  In return, these
organisations inform the Commission of their opinion
and a good partnership is established which allows
the viewpoints of business to be taken into account. 
In the commerce and distribution sector the
Commission systematically consults the Committee on
Commerce and Distribution, which was created in 198
1. 

Social dialogue
The Agreement on Social Policy which forms part of
the Maastricht Treaty requires new procedures for
consultation with the social partners as well as
conditions by which these collective agreements are
concluded. The list of social partner organisations
includes the European Association of Crafts, Small
and Medium-sized Enterprises (UEAPME), amongst
others.  The Commission has been in contact during
1994 with numerous organisations expressing
particular interest in SMEs, both at the
inter-professional level and at the sectoral level. 

The commerce and distribution sector, over 90% of
which is mad up of enterprises with less than 10
people, is represented by EUROCOMMERCE.  The
Commission has also enlarged its consultation to take
into account the needs of SMEs in the implementation
of the Structural Funds. 

Partnership with Member States
By mutual consultation and cooperation between the
Member States and between the Member States and the
Commission it is hoped that actions can be targeted
at SMEs so that their potential for growth and
employment can be better mobilised.

Collaboration with the other institutions
The European Parliament has emphasised that the
Integrated Programme in favour of SMEs and the Craft
Sector' is the result of the good collaboration that
it maintains with the Commission and that there is
now a global commitment and a strategy towards small
businesses.  It has also created an
Inter-Parliamentary Group on commerce and
distribution.

The Economic and Social Committee proposes carrying
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of existing
measures and an institutional strengthening,
according the political weight necessary to implement
Community policy in favour of SMEs.

The Committee of the Regions emphasises the
importance of coordination between the Community
programmes so as to facilitate access for SMEs and
the craft sector to research and training programmes. 
This is to be achieved by information, a
simplification of procedures, greater participation
of SME representative organisations and a
decentralisation of measures to the regional or local
level. 

Conclusion: In its report the Commission has
attempted to present the links and coordination
between the actions carried out under various Union
policies.  The coordination of Community activities
implies several levels: first within the Commission
services; then with the Member States and the other
European institutions; and then with business
circles.

The Commission will monitor the implementation of
programmes so that the declared objectives of greater
support for SMEs are effectively transformed into
concrete advantages for them.  The Commission intends
to ensure good cooperation with the other
institutions of the Union.  However, given that SME
policy is principally the business of national or
regional authorities, the role of the Commission in
coordinating the policies of the Member States is
limited to stimulating or orchestrating mutual
consultation and cooperation between them and with
the Commission with a view to ensuring more
effectiveness and a certain convergence of actions. 

Effectiveness of measures also implies good
coordination and a permanent dialogue with SME
representative organisations.

The Commission will reinforce coordination with all
its partners, the Member States, the European
institutions and the business organisations so that
the efforts of the Union in favour of small
businesses are converted into growth, competitiveness
and employment.

relations with the Baltic States

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION:
Background report -- EU relations with the Baltic
States
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

Introduction
The Baltic region, as well as being a major
commercial gateway to Russia, is a growing economic
zone in its own right.  A vigorous and open Baltic
Sea(1) economy will Provide new trading and
investment opportunities.  The political, economic
and security interests of the EU and the region will
be served by the fullest integration of the region
into the European and world economy.  To this end, EU
relations with Scandinavia have progressed with the
recent inclusion of Sweden and Finland as members of
the Union and relations with the three Baltic States
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania continue to expand. 

EU relations with the Baltic States have progressed
significantly over the last two years.  Relations now
cover much more than simply trade agreements in
certain sectors.  The European Union has recognised
the wish of the Baltic States to become part of the
Union when the necessary preconditions for membership
are fulfilled.  To this end, the European Union has
signed Europe Agreements with all three Baltic
States.  As a consequence, the Baltic States now take
part in the pre-accession strategy in preparation for
eventual accession to the Union.  Latvia and Estonia
have already applied for membership of the European
Union(2).  The pre-accession strategy covers such
divers fields as Home and Justice Affairs, Foreign
and Security policy, political dialogue, internal
market and trade. 

Against all precedent, the future accession of the
Baltic States to the European Union will in many ways
not be as easy as the accession of any of the current
Member States.  Before accession, the new Member
States(3) already had enough expertise in specific
areas, for example law, to meet the requirement for
membership.  The application of the new legislation
and policies will be the most difficult thing for the
Baltic States.  Without detailed assistance from the
EU, the entire process threatens to take much longer
than necessary.  As a precondition to accession,
therefore, the EU underlines the importance for the
European Union to provide assistance in order to
enable these countries to establish the necessary
structures, introduce measures for implementation and
lay out an optimal set of policy and economic
incentives for economic operators(4).

Background
The Baltic States joined the Central and Eastern
European Countries (CEEC) strategy in 1992.  European
Union relations with the Baltic States, therefore,
falls under the Central and Eastern Europe pre-
accession strategy, under which many of the measures
are applicable to all CEE countries, including the
Baltic States.

The Agreements on trade and commercial and economic
co-operation concluded in 1992 with Latvia and
Lithuania entered into force on 1 February 1993.  The
Agreement with Estonia entered into force on 1 March
1993.  These agreements cover trade in certain
sectors.  The trade arrangements were supplemented by
framework agreements.  Annual arrangements for
fisheries Protocols and on trade in textile products
were also signed with Latvia and Lithuania. 

At the request of the Copenhagen European Council,
the Commission asked the Council for authorisation to
negotiate with the Baltic States to convert the
agreements on trade, commercial and economic
co-operation into Free Trade Agreements, with the aim
of concluding Europe Agreements when possible.  The
Free Trade Agreements would fit in with the
enlargement negotiations and would preserve
compatibility between Community acquis (established
Community law and practice) and the existing
agreements between the Nordic countries and the
Baltic States.  Free Trade Agreements for the three
States were signed on 18 July 1994 and came into
force 1 January 1995(5), replacing the trade aspects
of earlier agreements, as well as including political
dialogue. 

In order for the Baltic States to be included in the
preparation for accession, certain conditions had to
be met.  These include being able to satisfy the
three basic conditions of European identity,
democratic status and respect for human rights as
contained in the Treaty on European Union(6).  In
addition certain other conditions had to be met: the
existence of a functioning market economy, the
capacity to compete in the internal market of the
Union and the ability to take on the obligations of
membership including the adherence to the aims of
political, economic and monetary union. 

As early as 29 May 1995 the Council recorded that the
conditions had been met for the Baltic States to be
included in the strategy to prepare for accession as
defined by the European Council meeting in Essen. 
This has had the effect of allowing the Baltic States
to participate in the joint meetings under the
structured dialogue with the associated CEEC(7).

A key element of the strategy to prepare for
accession is the narrowing of the gap in preparation
of the associated States for integration into the
internal market of the EU.  Preparation for the
internal market is backed up by a variety of measures
designed to promote integration through the
development of infrastructure and of co-operation in
fields having above all a trans-European dimension
(including energy, environment, transport, science
and technology, etc.), and in the fields of common
foreign and security policy and of justice and home
affairs.  The PHARE programme, appropriately funded
within a multiannual financial framework in
accordance with the preparatory strategy agreed upon,
will provide support for this purpose.

PHARE and TACIS Democracy Programme
The process of trade liberalisation in the Baltic
States is one of the purposes of the PHARE and TACIS
programmes.  Projects under these two schemes include
measures to improve the ability of local
administration to handle trade flows, and by
developing export, credit and insurance facilities to
encourage regional trade.  The move towards
assistance to improve infrastructure and attract
investment is another priority of the PHARE
programme.  PHARE assistance to eliminate border
crossing obstacles in the Baltic region remains a
major instrument, for example, through the
development of the Via Baltica and the Helsinki-St
Petersburg corridor(8).

Aid from the PHARE programme continues to expand as
the following figures for 1993(9) and 1994(10)
demonstrate.

Financing from PHARE to Estonia amounted to 12 mECU
in 1993.  This breaks down as follows: 
* Education, training and R&D      1.5 mECU
* General technical assistance;
  miscellaneous                   10.5 mECU 

In 1994 this figure rose to 22.5 mECU and breaks down
as follows: 
* Private sector, SMEs             8   mECU
* Environment and nuclear safety   2.5 mECU
* Education, training and R&D      4.5 mECU
* Infrastructure:
  energy, telecommunications,
    transport, etc.                   6 mECU
* GTAF(11) & others                 1.5 mECU

Financing from PHARE to Latvia amounted to 18 mECU in
1993.  This breaks down as follows: 
* Education, training and R&D       2   mECU
* General technical assistance;
  miscellaneous                    16   mECU

This figure rose to 29.5 mECU in 1994 and breaks down
as follows: 
* Financial sector                 14.5 mECU

* Environment and nuclear safety    5.5 mECU
* Education, training and R&D       5   mECU
* GTAF & others                     4.5 mECU

Financing from PHARE to Lithuania amounted to 25 mECU
in 1993. This breaks down as follows: 
* Education, training and R&D       2.5 mECU
* General technical assistance,
  miscellaneous                    22.5 mECU

This figure rose to 39 mECU in 1994 and breaks down
as follows: 
* Financial sector                 14.5 mECU
* Environment and nuclear safety   1    mECU
* Education, training and R&D      6    mECU
* Infrastructure:
  energy, telecommunications,
    transport, etc.               16.5  mECU
* GTAF & others                    1    mECU

At the Corfu European Council meeting in June 1995
certain priority concerns as regards financial
assistance under the PHARE scheme were laid down. 
PHARE has been redirected towards supporting the
strategy for preparation for accession, so its
programming is being carried out on a multiannual
basis. Technical assistance must take into account
implementation of the White Paper on preparing for
integration into the internal market(12).  Assistance
under the programme has been extended to include
investment activity in the field of infrastructures.

One example of how the PHARE programme has recently
helped Latvia is through the provision of an
emergency assistance package of 2.5 mECU in order to
assist efforts to stabilise the banking sector
following the collapse of Latvia's largest bank, Bank
Baltija(13).  This programme is designed to assist
the sixteen banks in Latvia which are still trading -
following the effective closure of 31 other banks and
to provide assistance to the Bank of Latvia in its
on-site supervision activities in order to help
prevent any further deterioration in the current
situation.

The TACIS Democracy Programme forms part of the
European Democracy Initiative of the European
Parliament.  It seeks to support the activities and
efforts of non-governmental bodies (NGOs) in
promoting a stable open society and good governance. 
It also focuses on the difficult or unpopular aspects
of political reform and democratic practice.  The
general objective is to contribute to the creation of
a human rights ethos in the countries concerned
whereby the general public is made aware of the rule
of law.  It supports the acquisition and application
of knowledge and techniques of parliamentary practice
and organisation by cross-party groups of
politicians(14) and by parliamentary staff.  The
Democracy Programme also covers the strengthening of
non-governmental bodies and associations which by
their vocation and specific activities can make a
continuing contribution to the promotion of a
pluralist society, as well as the transfer of
specific expertise and technical skills about
democratic practices and the rule of law to
professional groups and associations in the countries
concerned(15). 

Europe Agreements
The Europe Agreements establish bilateral
associations between each of the European countries
and the EU. They are based on shared understanding
and values, and set the path for progressive
convergence in a very wide range of activities.  They
are valid indefinitely with short transition periods
for Latvia and Lithuania.  Because of the progress of
economic and political reform in Estonia there is no
transitional period for this country.

As each agreement is the result of a separate
bilateral negotiation, there are a number of
differences of detail.  The objectives and main
elements are however the same.  The Europe Agreements
cover approximation of legislation, economic
co-operation, financial and political and cultural
co-operation as well as including provisions on the
prevention of activities such as illegal immigration,
drug trafficking and illegal trade in industrial
waste.  The Agreements include matters of both
Community and Member State competence.  Each
agreement contains a clause on observance of
democratic principles and human rights and a clause
enabling either party to suspend the agreement at
short notice if the obligations attached to it are
not respected.  The Europe Agreements additionally
take account of developments in certain sectors and
accordingly recognise the increased importance of
multilateral political dialogue and contain a new
heading on co-operation in crime prevention and
provisions for the three Baltic States to take part
in framework programmes, in specific programmes and
in projects or other schemes set up by the Community
in various areas.

Europe Agreements with the three Baltic States were
signed on 12 June 1995(16).  Following ratification
by all parties, including each individual Member
State, the agreements will enter into force.  Since
the signing of the Europe Agreements the three Baltic
States take part in the pre-accession strategy. The
main elements of the Europe Agreements are:

* political dialogue
* recognition of the importance of the involvement of
the Baltic States in WEU, the NATO Partnership for
Peace Initiative and the European Stability Pact;
* bilateral political dialogue in the framework of EA
as well as multilateral political dialogue;
* structured relationship with EU institutions, as
defined by the Essen European Council. 
* economic activities
* free trade in industrial goods;
* preferential treatment of trade in agricultural
products including those already processed;
* liberating trade in many services;
* national treatment for establishment and operations
of enterprises;
* national treatment for bidding for public contract
awards according to Community procurement rules;
* movement of workers: prevention of discrimination
against workers from any partner country legally
employed in the other country;
* co-ordination of social security systems for
legally employed workers and their families; 
* right of establishment of companies and national
treatment or MFN status(17); free movement of goods;
* transport.
* rules and approximation of laws

Commitments by the Baltic States to introduce similar
legislation as that applying in the EU - where this
is not already the case - concerning:
* competition rules and public undertakings(18),
including a safeguard clause in the event of
balance-of- payments difficulties; protection of
intellectual, commercial, industrial property;
* liberalisation of payments and capital transfers in
respect of trade and investments(19); approximation
of laws in other areas affecting the implementation
of the Agreements. 
* co-operation(20)
* economic co-operation;
* industrial co-operation;
* environmental co-operation;
* educational and training co-operation;
* monetary policy co-operation;
* financial co-operation (continuation PHARE aid and
other financial support);
* cultural co-operation.
* crime prevention co-operation.
* institutions
* Association Council at ministerial level to
regularly examine progress in the process of economic
reform;
* Association Committee at senior officials level;
* Parliamentary Association Committee.

Structured Relationship
The Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 agreed
that the associated countries will become members of
the Union when these countries are able to assume the
obligations of membership.  The Essen European
Council of December 1994 adopted a strategy to assist
the CEEC in preparing for their accession.  This
includes, amongst other things, a series of regular
meetings at ministerial level ('structured
relationship with the institutions of the European
Union') and the elaboration of a White Paper
identifying what the CEEC need to do (legally,
regulatory, institutionally, administratively) in
order to participate in the open internal market.

Political dialogue has been on-going since 1993.  For
example, on 19 April 1993 the Community 'troika' had
a meeting in Copenhagen with the foreign ministers of
the Baltic States, in December 1993 Latvia's Minister
for External Trade and EC Affairs, Olgerts
Pavlovskis, met Commissioner Van den Broek in
Brussels.  Under the structured relationship,
however, meetings at higher levels have intensified. 

A number of ministerial meetings have been held in a
variety of areas, for example: the meeting of
Ministers for Foreign Affairs on 10 April 1995 gave
rise to exchanges of views on several political
issues of mutual interest.  Meetings at the level of
Political Directors and European correspondents were
organised, as well as numerous meetings at expert
level

* the meeting of ministers with responsibility for
the internal market met in June 1995 along with
Baltic State representatives.  The meeting discussed
and exchanged views on the Commission White Paper on
the preparation of the associated countries for
integration into the internal market;

* the meeting of the Research Council in June 1995,
at which stock was taken of the progress on
scientific and technical co-operation with the CEEC,
the alignment policy implemented by the associated
countries and the forecasts for their participation
in Community research programmes; 

* the Heads of Government and State of the associated
States were invited to meet alongside the Cannes
European Council in 1995;

The structured dialogue has continued under the
Spanish Presidency in the following fields: 
* Justice and Home Affairs;
* Transport;
* Agriculture;
* Education;
* Foreign Affairs.

Stability Pact(21)

The European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993
discussed the French proposal for an initiative to be
taken by the European Union in favour of a Pact on
stability in Europe.  This initiative is directed
towards assuring in practice the application of the
principles agreed by European countries with regard
to respect for borders and rights of minorities.  The
European Council agreed that recent events in Europe
have shown that action in these areas is timely and
appropriate.  It welcomed the idea of using the
instrument of 'Joint Action' in accordance with the
procedures provided for in the Common Foreign and
Security policy.

In the Common Foreign and Security Policy framework,
the Pact on Stability in Europe is intended to
promote preventive diplomacy and therefore is not
concerned with countries in conflict.  Initially, it
will be directed at those countries which have the
prospect of becoming members of the EU and with which
the Union has concluded or negotiated agreements. 
This includes the Baltic States.  The aim of the
initiative is to contribute to stability by averting
tension and potential conflicts in Europe, fostering
neighbourly relations and encouraging countries to
consolidate their borders and to resolve problems of
national minorities.

The inaugural meeting took place in Paris in March
1994.  The documents setting in train the process
which will lead to the conclusion of the Pact on
stability in Europe were concluded following a round
table discussion(22).  Countries participating were
those which make a particular contribution to the
initiative, countries immediately bordering on the
countries having association agreements and countries
with an interest in stability, in Europe by virtue of
their defence commitments(23).  Representatives of
international organisations concerned by the
initiative also participated(24). 

The European Union reaffirmed its will to mobilise
its economic and financial instruments as its
contribution to the success of this undertaking at
the Corfu European Council meeting in June 1994. At
the Cannes European Council meeting in June 1995, the
European Union further specified some of the
accompanying measures to be taken under PHARE along
side the Stability Pact.  These include, projects
concerning regional transboundary co-operation,
issues relating to minorities, cultural co-
operation, including, language training and
administrative training, and environmental problems. 

White Paper(25) on preparation of the associated
countries of Central and Eastern Europe for
integration into the Internal Market of the Union(26) 

The White Paper marks the beginning of a process.  It
provides a guide for the associated countries in
adapting their legal structures to those which are
needed for future participation in the internal
market. It sets out a logical sequence for adopting
the necessary measures and will enable associated
countries to draw up internal market work programmes
adapted to each country's own economic and reform
priorities.  It will also enable the European Union
to provide the kind of support which is most needed,
drawing on the necessary expertise in the Union's own
institutions, in the Member States and in the private
sector.

The White Paper(27) focuses on legislation which is
essential for the functioning of the internal market.
It shows the key measures in each sector and those
measures which should be tackled first, without
setting up priorities as between sectors, including:
* free movement of goods;
* free movement of services;
* free movement of persons;
* freedom of capital movements;
* competition policy;
* state aids.

It also describes in detail the administrative and
organisational structures which are required in each
sector if the legislation is to be effectively
implemented and enforced. 

The EU recognises that certain assistance needs are
common to all associated countries.  To this end the
Commission intends to establish a Technical
Assistance Information Exchange Office supported
through the PHARE programme.  The Office will be
located in Brussels and managed by the Commission. 
It will provide for the exchange of information and
will help ensure the adequate delivery of services to
the associated countries.  This includes Community
legislation, its transposition into national
legislation, legal terminology, translation, training
and exchanges.

The White Paper also highlights the current state of
play in the relationship between the CEEC and the
European Union, detailing the progress made to date
with legislative approximation and specific sectors,
including:
* company law;
* financial sector;
* agriculture;
* transport;
* competition policy;
* telecommunications;
* intellectual property.

Conclusion
The relationship between the European Union and the
three Baltic States has changed dramatically over the
last few years.  It has progressed from simple trade
arrangements to trade agreements and, this year, to
Europe Agreements.  All three states have expressed a
desire to become part of the European Union, Latvia
and Estonia have formally applied for membership. 
The IGC will address some of the questions
surrounding the accession of new Member States to the
Union in 1996. 

(1) The Baltic Sea region includes the Scandinavia,
Poland and Russia, as well as the three Baltic States
(2) It applied on 27 October 1995

(17) Provisions are made in the Agreements,
especially for Latvia and Lithuania, for a number of
exceptions to the general principle of national
treatment.  Most are temporary 
(18) It is made clear in joint declarations that
special rights granted to come companies by the
Baltic States, particularly in the field of
telecommunications, may be retained for a limited
time under certain conditions
(19) To varying degrees, the three Baltic States have
already established full convertibility of their
currencies.  In addition, free movement of capital is
already possible as well as the fact that payments
relating to goods and services are already
liberalised

(24) CSCE, Council of Europe, WEU, NATO and the
United Nations 
(25) COM(95) 163 final and COM(95) 163 final\2
(26) As an element in the pre-accession strategy, the
White Paper is not part of negotiations for accession
and does not prejudice any aspect of such
negotiations.  Accession negotiations will cover the
entire field of Community legislation and policy,
whereas the White Paper focuses on those Community
measures which create and maintain the internal
market.  In addition, the White Paper does not change
the contractual relationship between the EU and the
Baltic States, which is based on the Europe
Agreements.  As detailed in these agreements, the
approximation of legislation is monitored by a
specific Sub-Committee
(27) The annex to the White Paper provides a
comprehensive and detailed presentation of current EU
legislation relating to the internal market. 
Twenty-three different areas of legislation are
examined in turn

-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION COMMISSION: ITC statement on
ITN shareholdings held by Carlton and Granada

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION
COMMISSION: ITC statement on ITN shareholdings held
by Carlton and Granada
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

The ITC has considered a proposal drawn up on a
contingency basis under which both Carlton Television
and Granada Television would create two new
deadlocked companies owned by them to hold shares in
ITN which are in excess of the levels allowed in the
Broadcasting Act 1990.  After scrutiny of the plan
and taking account of legal advice, the ITC has
concluded that such a scheme, if completed by 31
December 1995, would not breach the provisions of the
Act.

However, the Members of the Commission believe that
such arrangements raise not only legal but also
important policy and regulatory issues.  It is the
view of the Commission that the proposed structure is
contrary to the spirit and intention of the
Broadcasting Act 1990.

As a consequence of the acquisition of Central
Television by Carlton Television and LWT by Granada
Television, the holdings of 18 per cent held by each
company increased to 36 per cent. The Act established
that there should be a limit of 20 per cent on any
individual shareholding by a deadline to be set by
the ITC.

The original deadline of 31 December 1994 for selling
the excess shares was extended by one year pending
the completion of a review by Ministers of a range of
ownership issues.  The Secretary of State for
National Heritage confirmed earlier this year that
the Government did not propose to raise the existing
limits on shareholdings in a nominated news Provider
and the ITC has stated that it expects disposal to
take place by the stipulated date of 31 December
1995.

The ITC regrets that Carlton and Granada are giving
active consideration to interpreting the ownership
rules of the Broadcasting Act in a way which in the
ITC' s view was not originally intended by
Parliament.

David Glencross, Chief Executive, ITC said:
"We have urged Carlton and Granada to reduce their
shareholdings to the level envisaged by the Act as
soon as is practicable, and in a way which is
consistent with both the spirit and the letter of the
legislation.

"We very much hope that the new broadcasting
legislation will address avoidance mechanisms of this
kind".

-PHILIPS: Czech Telecom uses technology from Philips
to increase the number of telephone lines

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PHILIPS: Czech Telecom
uses technology from Philips to increase the number
of telephone lines -- Philips awarded order worth DM
2 million for PCM MULTI multi-channel transmission
system
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

The Czech network operator SPT has awarded Philips
Transmission Networks in Nuremberg, Germany, an order
for the delivery of PCM MULTI systems.  The order is
valued at some DM 2 million.

PCM MULTI, the new multi-channel transmission system,
will enable the network operator SPT to make multiple
use of existing two-wire telephone lines.  This
capability is especially important wherever, due to
poor infrastructure, only one telephone line is
available, and yet a much larger number of lines is
required. 

Using the PCM MULTI system, up to eleven independent
analogue voice channels can be transmitted digitally
using the HDSL transmission technique via one
two-wire line.  The echo cancellation procedure with
the internationally standardised 2B IQ line code is
used for direction separation.  The PCM MULTI system
comprises a connection unit at the subscriber's
premises and one at the exchange.  PCM MULTI can be
used in both analogue and digital telecommunications
networks.  In the ISDN, a maximum of five telephone
lines are available.

The PCM MULTI units are powered via a central 48/60 V
exchange battery.  A power supply is therefore not
required on the subscriber side.  The bridgeable
distance between the connection unit at the
subscriber's premises and the exchange depends on the
subscriber line diameter.  Using cable with a
conductor diameter of 0.4 mm, a distance in excess of
3 km can be bridged.  Being so quick and easy to
install in existing telecommunications
infrastructures, PCM MULTI represents an affordable
way of extending the number of telecommunication
lines.

-PHILIPS: DM4 million high-bit-rate SDH and broadband
digital TV transmission system order from PTT Telecom

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PHILIPS: Dutch operator
PTT Telecom awards Philips of Nuremberg order worth
over DM 4 million for delivery of high-bit-rate SDH
and broadband digital television transmission systems
-- The systems are ideal for the cost-effective
installation of broadband distributive networks
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

The Dutch operator PTT Telecom has awarded Philips
Transmission Networks in Nuremberg, Germany, an order
worth over DM 4 million to deliver SLE-16 SDH systems
with transmission rates of 2.5 Gbit/s and DIMOS
digital television transmission systems for bit rates
of up to 140 Mbit/s.

Using this combination of equipment, PTT Telecom will
be able to expand the coverage of its broadband
distributive networks still further at a
cost-effective price. TV and radio channels will be
transmitted in digital format via fibre-optic cable. 

DIMOS, the digital television transmission system, is
able to transmit one or more TV channels in PAL,
NTSC, SECAM or D2-MAC.  It can also be used to relay
radio channels and data.  The signals are transmitted
at a data rate of 140 Mbit/s.  As a result of the
high transmission quality, DIMOS is equally ideal for
exchanging channels between TV studios as it is -
when used in combination with SDH transmission
equipment - for feeding channels into broadband
distributive networks. 

Transmission in the long-haul network is achieved
using the SLE-16 SDH transmission systems.  These are
each capable of accepting sixteen DIMOS systems
simultaneously at the central feeding point.

Factors encouraging the network operator to deploy
the DIMOS and SLE-16 systems for setting up new
network structures include the quality of the video,
audio and data transmission, as well as cost
considerations.  By using different coding boards,
DIMOS can be adapted for a host of applications.  In
suitable networks, up to sixty TV and sixty FM
channels, plus two DSR packages (32 digital radio
channels), can be broadcast, for example.

-MESSE MUNCHEN: Munich trade fair boss Dr Werner
Marzin retires

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-MESSE MUNCHEN: Munich
trade fair boss Dr Werner Marzin retires
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:191295

* The Minister-President of the Free State of Bavaria
presented the President of Messe Munchen GmbH on the
occasion of his retirement with the Knight
Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the
Federal Republic of Germany

On November 30th 1995, Dr Werner Marzin, the longest
serving trade fair boss in Germany, celebrated his
departure from active professional life and his
transition into retirement in the company of
colleagues, partners and friends in Hall 23 of the
Munich Trade Fair Centre.

The importance of his work for the trade fair
business in Munich and worldwide was underlined in
speeches given by the Minister- President of the Free
State of Bavaria, Dr Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian
Minister of Economics, Transport and Technology, Dr
Otto Wiesheu, the Lord Mayor of Munich, capital of
Bavaria, Christian Ude, and by the President of the
Chamber of Trades and Crafts for Munich and Upper
Bavaria, Heinrich Traublinger.  On this successful
evening, attended by more than a thousand guests, the
Bavarian Minister-President awarded the Knight
Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the
Federal Republic of Germany to Dr Marzin for his
"decades of successful work for the benefit of Munich
as a trade fair location and in the interests of the
trade fair business throughout Germany".

In 1964 Dr Werner Marzin joined the recently founded
Munich Trade Fair and Exhibition organisation, and he
has remained loyal to it for over 30 years.  Since
1968 he has also held the office of President of the
GHM, Gesellschaft for Handwerksausstellungen und
-messen mbH (Handicrafts Exhibitions and Fairs,
Organisation), since 1978 that of President of Messe
Munchen GmbH, and since 1981 also that of President
of IMAG, Internationaler Messe - und
Ausstellungsdienst mbH (International Exhibition and
Fair Service Ltd.). In this role he formed the
promotional umbrella organisation, MMI - Messe
Munchen International - and thus created a distinct
identity for Munich as a trade fair location. 
Honorary offices were also conferred upon him, such
as, for example, Member of the Steering Committee of
the UFI - Union des Foires Internationales (World
Federation of the International Trade Fair and
Exhibition Industry), Vice-President of the
Ausstellungs- und Messeausschuss der Deutschen
Wirtschaft (AUMA e.V., (Confederation of German Trade
Fair and Exhibition Industries), Member of the
Landesvorstand des Bayerischen Handwerkstages
(Regional Board of the Handicrafts Convention of
Bavaria) and Vice-President of the Export club of
Bavaria.  He was also honoured with many awards from
Germany and abroad for his services in the trade fair
business.

Dr Marzin will continue to put his long years of
professional experience at the service of Messe
Munchen through his involvement primarily in
neighbouring countries in Central and Eastern Europe
through the regional office of Messe Munchen in
Vienna.

The fact that Munich, a comparatively recently
developed trade fair location, now has a
comprehensive programme of major international trade
fairs and is at the forefront of worldwide
competition, is due in large part to the efforts of
Dr Werner Marzin.  Yet he has also fought for the
future of trade fairs in Munich.  His was the
initiative behind the building of the New Munich
Trade Fair Center, a modern trade fair site that will
secure the competitiveness of Munich as an
international trade fair location through into the
next millenium.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-IPC MAGAZINES: Robert
Powell -- Cured by a carrott! in this weeks Woman's
Own
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:020195

They say carrots are good for you, but comedy cop
Robert Powell has revealed that his Detectives
co-star Jasper Carrott has much more serious healing
powers.

In this week's issue of Woman's Own, Robert reveals
for the first time how Jasper's touch cured him of a
painful ailment whilst filming one of their shows. 
He says: "I had something wrong with one of my eyes -
it suddenly became incredibly sore.  But Jasper
managed to get rid of it just by the laying on of
hands.  I was up and running very quickly."

But Jasper himself is very modest about the incident
and says: "It was probably a coincidence, although I
do believe everybody has the ability to heal.

"It's not a matter of belief, it's a physical fact. 
There's nothing particularly mystical or spiritual
about it.  Everybody has the ability, but some people
are better than others.  I wouldn't want people to
get the wrong idea about it, either - I'm not going
around healing people all the time.  But I really do
think that anyone can do it.  A mother instinctively
heals a child's knee by rubbing it, and it's just an
extension of that."

-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE: Men's Health Awareness
Campaign -- Lose your gut in six weeks

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE:
Men's Health Awareness Campaign -- Lose your gut in
six weeks
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

More than half of all men in the UK are overweight,
but losing you gut is simple, says MEN'S HEALTH
Magazine.

The average beer gut - the type that's just creeping
over your trousers and making you wear your jacket
open - is about 6lbs of excess fat and if you aim to
lose 1lb a week you'll be back to the taut stomach of
your youth within six short weeks.

If you have a bigger belly problem, you'll just have
to keep repeating your six-week plan until you don't!

Now for the bad news.  To shift 1lb of fat you have
to lose 3,500 calories. This may seem a depressing
statistic, but if you see your beer gut as half -
pound packets of butter hanging around your middle
and picture losing two of those packets a week, a lb
a week suddenly seems like quite a lot! says MEN'S
HEALTH Magazine.

The equation for losing your beer gut is
straightforward - calories in versus calories out
through exercise.  Just work out how much exercise
you are willing to do and the rest of the calories
you have to cut from your diet. 

But remember, diet and exercise COMBINED is the most
efficient way to lose weight, so aim to lose 50% of
your calories from your diet and burn off 50% through
exercise, says MEN'S HEALTH.

Now get out your calculator and do your sum.  Firstly
work out how many calories you need to maintain your
weight.  An easy guide is to multiply your body
weight in kilograms by 35.  So, for example, if you
weigh 76 kilos, you need 2,660 calories to keep your
weight steady.

You already know that to lose one lb of fat you need
to lose 3,500 calories a week and that's 500 a day. 
This could mean you burn-up an extra 250 calories
through exercise and you cut 250 calories from your
daily diet. 

To find out how many calories you are going to burn
from exercise, consult the following table and
multiply the number beside your chosen exercise (s)
by your body weight in kilos to find out your hourly
calorie burn. 

Rowing                         9.5
Cycling (road 10mph.)     6 to 8
Cycling (stationary)      3 to 5
Stairmaster                    6
Weight-lifting                 3
Running (6mph)                10
Swimming                      10
Skiing                         7
Social football                2.5
In-line skating                7
Speed-walking                  4.5
Tennis                         7
Golf (carrying clubs)          5.5
Aerobics (low-impact)          5

For example, if you decide to cycle to work three
times a week and it takes half an hour, multiply the
figure for cycling (6) by your body weight and you
will find out your hourly calorie burn.  IE: Cycling
: 6. So 6 x 76kg (body weight) = 456 calories burned
per hour.  Therefore 1 1/2 hours a week cycling 684
calories burned.  As you need to lose 3,500 calories
a week, that still leaves 2,816 excess calories which
you will have to take out of your diet. That's 402
calories a day.  So, subtract 402 calories from the
amount you should be eating to maintain your weight,
2,660, and you will find out your new calorie intake
should be 2,258 calories a day.

To achieve weight-loss as well as cardiovascular
fitness, you should ideally aim to exercise three or
four times a week for around 30 to 40 minutes,
advises MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.  If you do less than
this, you will have to train very hard to get enough
calorie burn and you will be more likely to give up.

And remember, if you have been fairly sedentary for a
while, start exercising gently and build up
gradually.  Walking, cycling a-id swimming are ideal
starting off exercises because you can achieve a good
calorie burn without much risk of injury.

Food wise, you need to reduce your fat intake by
choosing low-fat versions of the basic foods (butter,
milk and cheese) and only eat lean meat cooked
without any added fat.  Make sure you cut right back
on pastry dishes, pies and chips and eat lots more
vegetables, energy-giving complex carbohydrates
(pasta, rice, potatoes and bread) and switch to fresh
fruit instead of fattening puds.

Be very wary of takeaways because they can be laden
with fat - even a lunchtime sandwich my be burdened
with high-fat butter and mayonnaise - and cut back on
beer.  At around 180 calories plus per pint, a
lunchtime pint plus a couple in the evening can mount
up to about 550 calories in a day!  Dry white wine
has far less sugar than beer or try spirits with a
slim-line mixer. 

Francis Cottam, the Editor of MEN'S HEALTH Magazine
says:
"It's not difficult for a man to lose his gut, but it
does take an organised effort.  Most men want to be
fitter, healthier and sexier.  A flabby out of shape
body signals poor health and low self-esteem.  A
well-toned physique radiates good health and
self-confidence. 1996 is the year for men to shape-up
for a better life. We'll show you how.`

-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE: Reasons to be cheerful! -- 10
ways men can make themselves happy in 1996

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE:
Reasons to be cheerful! -- 10 ways men can make
themselves happy in 1996
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

* TAKE A 'HAPPY DAY' OFF WORK
"For many British workers, the sneaky day-off under
the pretence of flu, migraine or botulism is me of
the most popular routes to temporary happiness," says
MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.  "And it's almost always
happier than a legitimate holiday, because there is
no pressure to have a great time, it's a day just for
you." In fact, a lot of sickness absence is simply a
stress-relieving exercise - you've worked hard m a
project and you need a day-off.  In Sweden, workers
are given a number of 'mental health days' by their
employers, which they can take without having to
phone in to say they've got the lurgy.

So next time you genuinely feel the need for a
stress-busting day-off, don't call it a 'sickie'.  Be
positive and call it 'a happy day'.

* HAVE A LAUGH
The very act of laughing helps you feel happy.  And
the sillier, the better, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine. 
Research shows people who are most happy seem to be
eccentrics who don't care what the world thinks of
them.  Monty Python had it right all along. "When you
laugh, your whole body benefits from an internal
massage," says MEN'S HEALTH. "This relaxes muscle
tension, reduces stress in the nervous system, you
breathe deeper, you have greater circulation and
endorphin 'happy' chemicals are released." 

* DO THINGS THAT MADE YOU HAPPY AS A KID
Research has found that in average kids smile 400
times a day, whereas adults only times a day - so try
reverting to your childhood pleasure, says MEN'S
HEALTH Magazine. "Fly a kite, play Scalextric, go to
the seaside and build sandcastles or go ride your
bike.  For many of us, the times we remember being
happiest were Saturday mornings, with no school to go
to, the world to explore and a Raleigh Chopper to do
it on" 

* SMELL A 'HAPPY SMELL'
Of the five sense, smell is the me most directly
linked to the brain, says MEN'S HEALTH.  "The
olfactory nerve goes into the part of the brain that
deals with emotions, moods, hormone release and
primitive instincts.  Even by simply making you
breathe more deeply, essential oils can have a
beneficial effect.  Breathing well and feeling
relaxed is a pretty happy state to be in."

Choose an essential oil that is classified as
'uplifting' such as rosewood mixed with lime or a
coriander and lemon mixture - but don't heat ails
over a candle, you will simply cook up all the
residue and give yourself a splitting headache! 
Instead, invest in an Aroma Diffuser from the chemist
or evaporate the oils over a pan of boiling water.
You could also try frying some bacon and then
tantalise your sense of taste with a bacon buttie!

* GET FILTHY
It's not often nowadays that a man can enjoy the
honest pleasure of getting caked in filth.  But in
our modern world of order, cleanliness and desk
tidies, there's spiritual renewal to be had from
simply getting mucky, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.

* DRIVE A TANK FOR THE DAY
Give a new meaning to road-rage.  Off-road centres
around the UK offer the experience of driving a range
of 4WD and ex-military  vehicles and a few have
tanks!  Driving a 55-ton Chieftain tank is
'absolutely brilliant' says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine. 
"You sit in a very small cab with your head poking
out of the top.  There is a real sensation of power
and control as you accelerate and all you see if you
go uphill is the sky."

* EAT HAPPY FOOD
If you really fancy a flake, have one.  The power of
chocolate is legendary, it's the all-purpose
happiness drug, says MEN'S HEALTH.  It contains
phenylethylamine, or PEA, a substance that is turned
into noradrenalin in the brain and could have an
addictive effect.  It has even been likened to the
feeling of 'being in-love'.  Chocolate is also high
in sugar and because many people suffer from low
blood-sugar which makes them feel mentally and
physically sluggish, lethargic and possibly fed-up,
chocolate can give you a quick lift for an hour or so
which can be positively mood enhancing. "A one or two
day detox can also work wonders, both mentally and
physically, but don't go on a water-only fast.  Eat
fresh fruit, vegetables and brown rice all weekend
and by Sunday evening, you will really feel on form. 
Your mental clarity will be good and your aches and
pains will have cleared up," says MEN'S HEALTH
Magazine.

* GET A NATURAL EXERCISE ENDORPHIN HIGH
Endorphins are naturally occurring morphine-like
opiates within the body and they are linked to
feelings of happiness.  Certain enjoyable activities
- love and sex, drinking alcohol and eating - can all
be linked to the production of endorphins, but none
is as effective as vigorous exercise. 

* GO AND LOOK AT SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
Visit an art gallery.  Art provides mental
stimulation.  If you are feeling low, go and learn
something, expand your mind - it is a key to
happiness, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.

- WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, INDULGE YOURSELF!
There are times when even the fittest, most
spiritually pure triathlon runners find true
happiness with a couple cans of beer, a chicken
Biriyani from the local takeaway and a night on the
sofa with a Van Damme video. "It's only one meal in a
week that might contain 21 of them so enjoy it and
don't feel guilty," says MEN'S HEALTH, "but don't
make it the norm." 

And remember, me of the highest causes of stress is
that people are waiting for happiness to happen, says
MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.  It's the Puritan Work Ethic -
we work hard now in order to buy future shares in
happiness.  For a man, it's part of the no-pain,
no-gain, no-such-thing-as-a-free lunch philosophy. 
So stop waiting for happiness to happen and think
about what makes you happy NOW.

PA group company, Two-Ten Communications' decision to
open a Web-site to carry all the traffic from its UNS
NewsWire service has opened a 'window' for
journalists who, up to now, have had to plough
through mountains of paper and fax press releases to
find their stories.

The Internet service - currently up to 50 stories on
weekdays and almost 90 on Budget Day - will gradually
extend to include all releases sent out by Two-Ten on
paper and fax on behalf of its 2,000 PR clients.

Until now, UNS - which carries general and business
news, features and advisories has only been available
to national and regional daily newspapers and major
news agencies and broadcasters.  Now, any journalist
can access it on the Internet, making the service
available to magazine journalists and freelance
correspondents and also to staff with a PC and modem
working from home.

"UNS on the Net" can be found at
www.twoten.press.net.
The Netscape facility 'client-pull' allows news
organisations to keep to up-to-date with news stories
as they are transmitted.  Managing Director, Paul
McFarland explains "Internet users recognise that a
drawback is the need for the user to go hunting for
news and updates.  Our service is designed so that if
a PC is connected to the Net and tuned to the Two-Ten
index, the page will automatically update itself
whenever a new story is released.  So, as with wire
services and Teletext, journalists can keep an eye on
the news without having to keep re-accessing." 

NOTE TO EDITORS:
Two-Ten is part of the Press Association group, which
includes PA News and PA Sport, the UK's leading news
and sport agencies.  Two-Ten's UNS news and picture
wire service is delivered via the PA satellite
network to national and regional daily newspapers and
major news agencies and broadcasters.

Two-Ten is the leading provider of media and
financial information and distribution services to
the Public Relations industry, employing 125 people
at its central London operation.  In addition, the
company has another 80 staff at its Wetherby
operational centre in West Yorkshire, which provides
a wide range of fulfilment and response services,
including subscription management, telephone
order-taking, storage, packaging and distribution.

-THE SCOTTISH OFFICE: The secretary of state's new
year message

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE SCOTTISH OFFICE: The
secretary of state's new year message
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

In his New Year message to the people of Scotland,
the Rt Hon Michael Forsyth MP, Secretary of State for
Scotland, writes:- 
"My most striking memory of the past year is of the
first public engagement I carried out as Secretary of
State, when I attended the VJ Day ceremonies.  I was
privileged to meet some of the veterans whose
sacrifices won our freedom.  They were so unassuming
that it was difficult to realise that they had -
quite literally - save  the world from tyranny.  But
that is precisely what they did.

"VE Day and VJ Day left a lasting impression on me
and I found myself wondering during the following
weeks what fitting memorial we could create in
Scotland, in the 50th anniversary year of the
victorious conclusion of the Second World War, to
those who fought and in many cases lost their lives
in that conflict.  Then I became aware of the history
of the former Rowardennan estate on the east bank of
Loch Lomond.

"Because of its outstanding quality, this land was
purchased by the Government in 1950 under the terms
of the National Land Fund 'to preserve the natural
beauty of the area, safeguard public access and
utilise the land for forestry and agriculture'. 
Today the land is owned by Forest Enterprise and the
National Trust for Scotland.  At my request, these
bodies have agreed to undertake the management of the
area in partnership, with a view to creating a major
national monument. 

"I am pleased, therefore, to announce our intention
to establish the Ben Lomond National Memorial Park,
dedicated to the memory of all those who served our
country in the Second World War.  The Memorial Park
will be based on conservation principles, giving
priority to landscape, nature conservation and quiet
recreation.  An integrated management strategy will
include a project for increasing the native woodland
areas within the park.  It is our objective to ensure
that the Memorial Park is protected for all time as
an inalienable national property, permanently
dedicated to this purpose.

"We shall also be launching a national competition to
devise a memorial to the fallen as a focal point to
the park.  Future generations will be able to enjoy
this superb environment, while recalling the
sacrifices that were made to secure for us our
present liberties and quality of life.

"That inheritance can no longer be taken for granted. 
Once again our way of life is threatened - this time
by an enemy within.  The drugs epidemic is a scourge
as terrible as any medieval plague.  This country
strove in unity, as one nation, during the Second
World War to defeat tyranny.  We must find that unity
again to crush the drugs menace. 

"Let us, as a nation, make a New Year resolution that
1996 is the year in which we will turn back the tide
of drug abuse which is engulfing our young people and
threatening our civilisation.  Our aim is nothing
less than to win back Scotland from the drug culture
and liberate a generation.  That is of far more
importance than any party political objective.  We
must unite across party lines and across every age
group to drive the drug barons out of our
communities.  This is not a campaign: it is a
crusade.

"We must rediscover the spirit of wartime unity.  I
am delighted that the leaders of all the political
parties in Scotland are keen to join forces to launch
a major new national initiative against drugs. 
Scotland Against Drugs will seek to unite communities
in fighting drugs misuse. The success of local
anti-drugs campaigns, notably those run by the
Glasgow Evening Times and the Paisley Daily Express,
has paved the way to a nationwide effort.  Its
purpose will be to educate and dissuade young people
from taking drugs.

"It will be launched in January under the auspices of
the Health Education Board for Scotland, linking into
the work of agencies which are already involved in
the fight against drugs.  I hope that it will enjoy
the active support of every MP in Scotland, all the
media, the business community and the country at
large.

"Scotland Against Drugs will publish the facts about
drug misuse; support efforts against local drug
dealing; promote drug-free activities for young
people; and stimulate community attempts to combat
drugs. If we are to divert young people from drugs,
we must spell out one simple message: drugs are for
losers.  But that message will only have credibility
if young people see a real prospect of becoming
winners. We must work together to provide
opportunities for the next generation and the key to
that is partnership.

"In all our endeavours we shall gain strength from
working together. 1 have enjoyed the six months I
have served as Secretary of State, despite the heavy
workload, because I have discovered that, in this
office, you can make a difference - you can make
things happen. Scotland has huge reserves of talent
and enterprise.  But they need to be encouraged and
unleashed.  That is my objective: to help Scotland
fulfil its potential.

"I should like to thank all the people who have
already helped me in this task: the staff of St
Andrew's House and everybody across Scotland who
contributed to my consultation exercise.  Highland
Region and local activists gave invaluable help in
saving the Fort William sleeper service.  The Scotch
Whisky Association were doughty lobbyists and the
fruits of their work were seen in the Budget. All my
Scottish Conservative parliamentary colleagues stood
united, without exception, against the Bill to
introduce Double Summer time which would be very
unwelcome in Scotland; this united stance was clearly
decisive in depriving the Bill of Government support. 

"And there were many other partnerships: with the
doctors and others in the NHS who helped to shape the
policies that led to the rescheduling of Temazepam;
Locate in Scotland's success in securing the Chungwha
inward investment project; Scottish Screen Locations,
on a shoestring budget, helping to create a promising
Scottish film industry; and many more - too many to
be listed here.

"The Scottish economy is a success story.  The latest
export figures, for 1994, show a leap of almost 24
per cent over the previous year to more than GBP 14
billion.  We now export more per head than Japan -
who would have imagined that ten years ago?

"During the last year unemployment fell below 200,000
to its lowest level in 15 years; that means a happier
New Year for many Scottish households than was the
case in previous years.  Scotland's unemployment rate
has now been below that of the United Kingdom for
almost four years and long-term unemployment is
falling. 

"If I had one wish for 1996 it would be that all of
us in politics should realise we do not have a
monopoly of good ideas in any one party and that we
should try to find common ground.  I have tried to do
so in 1995.  One example is Campbell Christie's
suggestion of revamping the Scottish Economic Council
to serve Scotland better.  It was a good idea and we
took it on board.  Similarly, many good ideas on
devolution of power to local government were
contained in the paper submitted by COSLA last month. 
In 1996 we will make some of these ideas reality.

"My own resolution for 1996 is to make our country
safer.

Maintenance of law and order is the first duty of
government.  That is why, in the year ahead, we shall
be ensuring that the punishment fits the crime and
that criminals do not walk out of prison half-way
through their sentences.  Drugs can never be
tolerated in prisons; random drug testing is our
answer.  We must give strong support to the police. 
That is why we are putting 500 more officers onto the
streets and giving them the technological help they
need, such as DNA. testing facilities and automatic
fingerprint reading machines.  Let us make a
resolution that 1996 will be a very bad year for
criminals in Scotland. 

"The successes of 1995 point the way ahead for 1996. 
In a spirit of partnership rather than dissension we
must persevere in securing Scotland's interests and
liberating the talents and enterprise of our people
to make our country stable and prosperous.  That is
the spirit in which I ask you to join with me in
striving to make 1996, for everyone in Scotland, a
truly happy New Year."

"FUTURISTIC" MICROCELL PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK PROPOSED FOR
U.S.

     In the first proposal for microcell communication by a major
U.S. company, a subsidiary of Millicom, Inc. has petitioned the FCC
to set aside frequencies in the 1.7 to 2.3 GHz range for a new
mobile phone service based on microcell radio architecture.  PCN
America, Inc. said that its proposed Personal Communications
Network would be similar to the PCNs being proposed in the United
Kingdom and under consideration in Europe and Japan.  Millicom is
a member of a consortium (with Pacific Telesis International, Matra
Communications and British Aerospace Space Systems) that has
applied in the United Kingdom for a license for a PCN.  Licenses
are expected to be awarded in a few months, with service by 1992.
     The deadline for comments on the PCNA petition is December 18,
1989.  Reply comments are due January 3, 1990.
     The basic concepts of PCN, said PCNA, are:
     1) The network should link persons, not stations;
     2) It should allow voice, data and image transmission; and
     3) It should make the most efficient possible use of the
frequency spectrum.
     Applying these principles, PCNA proposes to install a
nationwide network of microcell radio base stations wherever people
congregate.  These would include business and residential
neighborhoods, and in office buildings.  The PCN technique includes
handoffs from cell to cell permitting slow speed mobility (but not
while driving).  PCNA proposed low-powered, wallet sized handsets
that would be activated by a smart card inserted by the user.
Since the smart card is personalized to each user, the network
would recognize the identity of a caller for billing purposes.  A
user away from home would be able to receive as well as initiate
calls if he or she logs in at a network base station and notifies
the network of his or her willingness to accept calls from all or
a particular class of callers.  PCNA said that the intelligence in
the network, combined with the ability to locate any user who has
logged in, will permit the "ability to reach a party with a
communication of a type specifically tailored for receipt by that
party" regardless of his or her location.  The PCN microcell radio
system would be well adapted for cordless PABX's in office
environments.
     The network architecture would be based on the Signalling
System 7 protocol (SS-7) which will allow such "futuristic"
features such as selective call ringing and rejection, virtual
private networks, "wide-area" Centrex, and ISDN features.  To
maximize spectrum reuse, PCNA proposes to use CDMA or similar
spread-spectrum techniques, rather than the TDMA used in DECT or
the FDMA used in the British CT2 system.
     The Chief Engineer of the FCC, Dr. Thomas Stanley,  commented
that his agency welcomes proposals such as this, and is already
engaged in an in-depth study of the concept of personal
communications systems.  He said that the FCC expects to issue a
Notice of Inquiry in the spring of 1990, and the PCNA petition
would be considered in the context of that inquiry, along with
another petition filed by Cellular 21, Inc. for a CT2-type
Telepoint system.
     PCNA  has proposed a service that is far in advance of the
CT2-based  Telepoint system being implemented in the U.K., and
proposed for the U.S. (see separate stories), and could cut into
the cellular market if it can be brought in at a reasonable price
(only the market for the cellular users who must have phone service
while driving will be immune).  CT2 does not allow for calls to be
received, and cannot be used for data or fax transmissions, far
less allow the Centrex-type features promised by PCNA.
     PCN would have convenience and cost marketing advantages over
cellular.  As a low-powered radio (around 10 milliwatts) the
handset would be much smaller than current  models - around half
the size and weight of the Motorola 950 Microtac model, if the
British Telepoint phones are a guide, and its batteries would last
perhaps ten times as long.  PCNA did not estimate the cost of
either hardware or service over the proposed PCN, but since
hardware prices and investment costs per subscriber of a CT2
microcell system are far below those of conventional cellular, it
seems likely that a PCN could significantly underprice cellular.
     Installation of a nation-wide PCN is not around the corner,
but must await the conclusion of the FCC inquiry into personal
communication systems.  According to Dr. Stanley, that inquiry will
probably take about a year from its start in the spring.  If the
FCC then approves the concept and allocates frequencies,
applications for licenses will be accepted.  Some kind of lottery
system is likely if the volume of applications is great.  Only
after some applications are granted would construction of the
network start, and this timetable could be set back if the FCC
decides to await the outcome of the World Administrative Radio
(WARC) conference scheduled for 1992.

U.S. COMPANIES PLANNING MICROCELL NETWORKS

   In addition to Millicom, Inc. (see lead story), at least three
United States companies are  preparing to set up microcell
communications systems - two using the CT2 technology developed in
Great Britain, and one seeking to overlay a microcell radio
technology on existing cellular systems.  A third approach to
Telepoint based on the Digital European Cordless Telephone standard
(DECT) is slated for trials on an interim basis by Ericsson Radio,
Inc.  All of these approaches have potential to create Telepoint
networks across America.  CT2 has the advantage of being already
operational in the U.K. and of requiring very low capital
investment, but has little or no radio spectrum immediately
available.  Additionally, as an out-bound only system, CT2 may not
satisfy the needs of U.S. users.  The existing cellular systems
already have frequencies available and are two-way, but adding
cells is expensive, and cellular operators may not be willing to
give up frequencies for a lower-priced service.  DECT is
intermediate between the CT2 and cellular concepts.  It uses
microcell technology to provide two-way call, but is more expensive
than CT2, and cannot be used while driving.  Each approach has its
proponents, and the competition between them will be worth
watching.  The two major differences between CT2 and cellular-- CT2
is outgoing only (outside of the home), and cannot be used while
driving -- means that Telepoint's target market will be different
from that of cellular.  Additionally the anticipated low cost of
each handset (perhaps $150 at first, eventually going to $75 or
below) focusses Telepoint's appeal on a different segment of the
population than cellular.
     The companies initiating trials are:

Corporate Technology Partners

     CTP is a group of venture capitalists in San Diego seeking to
assemble capital, technology and know-how for a Telepoint network
based on the CT2 system in operation in the United Kingdom.  It
claims to have most of the capital and hardware arrangements in
place for a trial system.  Tests of a prototype will begin in the
first half of 1990, claims Charles Mason, the president of CTP.
The test will use handsets and base stations purchased from a
British manufacturer, transmitting in the same 864-868 MHz as the
U.K.,band on an experimental basis.  If the trial is successful CTP
anticipates installing Telepoint systems on a city-by-city basis in
the United States.

International Mobile Marine.

     IMM is preparing to conduct a test of a Telepoint system in
cooperation with a cellular telephone operator, using cellular
techniques and frequencies.  Initially one microcell will be
established then a pilot program with several cells in a
metropolitan area.  George Calhoun, President of IMM, which is
based in Philadelphia, said that he expected the experiment to be
conducted in the first half of 1990.  While his company has already
conducted some one-cell trials in Philadelphia, he wants to have a
more realistic test using many more handsets in an urban
environment.  IMM's experimental system will use TDMA digital
technology, with separate transmit and receive channels, and using
cellular frequencies.  The initial trials will focus on voice
capability only, but eventually , according to IMM, Telepoint will
accommodate data transmission up to 128 kbs and fax.
     IMM's aim is to develop a base unit, not the handset.  IMM
seeks the best parameters of a system that will work in congested
urban areas.  Calhoun said that while some cellular operators would
not want to give up any of their precious frequencies to set up a
Telepoint system, if the peak period for cellular traffic turns out
to be different from the peak period for Telepoint traffic, then
cellular  frequencies could be economically used for both services.

Cellular 21.

     Like CTP, Cellular 21, of Rutherford, N.J., will be working
with CT2.  Matthew Edwards, the president, said that it has already
received experimental licenses at 864 MHz, and is conducting field
tests with 1,000 Ferranti Phone Zone telephones.  Additionally,
Edwards plans field trials in New York City, on the street and in
the subway system.  He said that if the pocket telephones could
provide acceptable transmission quality in the noisy subway
environment, and on the street directly below the huge radio and TV
towers on top of the Empire State Building, he could be assured
that they would work anywhere.

BRITISH TELEPOINT NETWORKS LAUNCHED

     In the United Kingdom, two of the eventual four Telepoint
mobile phone services have started in London and, hesitantly, in
other cities too.  British Telecom was first with its Phonepoint
network, followed by Ferranti's Phonezone.   Mercury
Communications' Callpoint is due to appear within a few weeks, and
the fourth service from BYPS, a consortium of Philips, Barclays
Bank and Shell, will follow in early 1990.
      Handsets currently cost the equivalent of $310 or so, sign-on
fees are $40 and monthly subscriptions to a service cost $14 (it
varies only a little between the services) although costs are
expected to drop gradually during 1990.  The usage rates are 13
cents per minute local and 37 cents per minute national, about 20%
above coin phone rates.  They are considerably below cellular
rates, which are 60 cents per minute, local and national.

Telepoint Features

     So far there are just two Telepoint handsets, the Phonezone's
and one made by Shaye Communications being used by both Phonepoint
and Callpoint.  BYPS expects to offer CAI standard phones from day
one - the reason they cite for their later launch timetable.  Also
to offer handsets in 1990 is Obitel, a joint venture of Racal and
Plessey.
     Telepoint handsets operate at 864-868 MHz with 40 channels per
public base station although most base stations will initially
operate with 2-4 channels activated until traffic picks up.  The
CT2 technology uses FDMA digital transmission between handset and
base, which permits interference-free calls with high audio
quality.  The small size of the cells allows high spectrum
efficiency, since the 40 channels allotted to Telepoint will be
reused at each cell.  In dense urban areas, the cell size can be
reduced from the standard 200 meters, allowing more users per
square kilometer.  Features of the handset can include
national/international call barring, remote disablement of lost or
stolen handsets and self diagnostics on base stations.

Networks are Growing

     Both the live services have started small, with some 300 base
stations in London and one or two other areas at their launch,
though both have increased the base station population since then.
Phonepoint, for example, has raised its end 1989 forecast to 1500
base stations in operation.  However both services have promising
base station contracts.  Phonezone for instance has a contract to
place base stations in all London Underground (subway) stations -
62 in the central city area alone.  Post Offices have been signed
by Phonepoint and both have contracts with hotels, service areas,
airports, banks and restaurants.    Nevertheless, it seems to us
that in the race to be first, Telepoint may have been tempted into
launching prematurely.
     The eventual target for full saturation is for the user to
never be more than 500 meters from a Telepoint in urban areas or
ten minutes' drive on main roads. To achieve that would require
hundreds of thousands of sites across the UK - Phonepoint says that
agreements already in place give them potentially 30,000 or more.
Both services admit that users will be slow to come forward until
a critical mass of sites exists, but there is no concurrence on
what that level may be.  Projections for 1995 usage by Telepoint
operators and financial analysts have ranged from 800,000 to 6
million subscribers.
     Another major block to growth is the lack of standards - the
first three Telepoint services are incompatible.  A Common Air
Interface (CAI) will allow handsets to be used on more than one
service when it comes into existence in mid-1990, but users will
have to subscribe to both services, increasing the cost.
     The government license obliges all Telepoint services to
introduce roaming, though it could be two years away yet.  Then
subscribers to one service will be able to use another service's
base stations, presumably at slightly higher call charge rates than
usual.

PROJECTED INCOME STATEMENT OF U.K. TELEPOINT SYSTEM

   The following table is an estimate of the financials of a U.K.
Telepoint operator, neither the largest nor the smallest of the
four Telepoint operators.  An underlying assumption is that there
will be approximately two million Telepoint subscribers in the U.K.
by late 1995.
     Service revenues include registration fees, monthly subscriber
charges and usage fees, and expenses include sales/marketing costs,
customer service (including billing), system operation and
maintenance, network charges, G&A and depreciation.

UK'S CHRISTMAS DIP DOES NOT MEAN REAL CELLULAR SLUMP, SAYS INDUSTRY

The disappointing figures for new UK cellular connections recorded over
the run-up to Christmas do not reflect a real slump in demand for
cellular services in the UK, according to leading figures in the
industry.

They argue that while the total of 222,900 net connections made last
month represents a 25-per-cent decline on the record-breaking 300,000
figure achieved in December 1994, this does not mean that there has
been a significant tailing off in consumer interest.

They point out that the December decline has disguised the fact that
connections for the year as a whole were much higher than they were in
1994.  The UK's four network operators added a total of 1,886,009
customers in January to December 1995 -- a 22-per-cent increase over the
1,544,033 added in the previous year.  But in 1995 the demand was
spread out more evenly.

The aggressive competition between dealers, retailers and off-the-page
companies during 1995 soaked up much of the demand for cellular
telephones in advance of December.  ``In 1995, it was a sale every
month,'' said Nigel Salomon, marketing director of service provider
Securicor Cellular Services, ``how much more could happen at
Christmas?''

Executives say that many of the telephones bought in December 1994 were
gift purchases which led to disconnection when their new owners
received their first bills.  They hope this December's new customers
will ``churn less but make more calls,'' according to David Savage,
chairman of service provider Astec Communications.

Who's number one? Vodafone's market leadership is under pressure from
its nearest rival Cellnet, which by the start of this month had only
33,009 fewer subscribers.

On January 1, Vodafone had a total of 2,333,009 subscribers compared to
Cellnet's figure of 2,300,000.  Cellnet has been gradually eroding its
rival's lead.  December was the sixth consecutive month in which it
connected more net new customers than Vodafone.  In December it gained
89,100 net new customers compared to Vodafone's 53,800.

Vodafone faced a major challenge from Cellnet this time last year but
responded aggressively to see off the challenge.  It will be hoping
that last week's launch by service providers of its restructured GSM
tariffs will have a similar effect this year (Mobile Communications,
185/1).

Cellnet is thought unlikely to respond immediately to Vodafone's new
package of per-second billing and ``bundled'' tariffs, which are
similar to the existing packages offered by Orange.  Bundled tariffs
offer customers a certain number of calls as part of their monthly
subscription charge.  Cellnet has tested such tariffs but does not
appear close to a launch.

Cellnet last month withdrew its under-performing Frequent Caller Plus
Budget Plan, the bundled GSM-only tariff for business users which has
not proved popular.  The tariff will no longer be offered, although
existing subscribers can stay on it.  It offered a monthly subscription
charge of #45 in return for either 100 minutes of calls at peak rate or
200 minutes at off peak, or a combination of the two.

Orange's dream Christmas: Although Cellnet is Vodafone's main rival in
terms of total subscribers, one of the main reasons for the slowdown in
its performance is the competition it faces from smaller rival Orange.
Orange is focusing on the business market, which is much more important
to Vodafone than it is to Cellnet.  In December, Orange made 50,000 net
new connections, making this the third month in a row that it has
pushed Vodafone close on new connections (Mobile Communications,
183/7).

Orange now has 380,000 subscribers and is close to overtaking its
nearest rival, Mercury One-2-One.  This company, which signed up 30,000
subscribers in December, now has 397,000 subscribers.

Overall, Vodafone trailed Cellnet on total connections over the 1995
calendar year, with 695,009 against 740,000.  It also lost out to its
rival in 1994, making 585,911 connections compared to Cellnet's
664,122.

Last year, Orange and One-2-One added 280,000 and 171,000 net new
subscribers respectively.  This compares with figures of 100,000 and
194,000 respectively in 1994, reflecting a considerable advance by
Orange but a disastrous slump for One-2-One.

Third quarter: Vodafone lost out particularly badly in the most recent
quarter, October-December, when it connected 143,000 net new
connections -- well down on the predictions of industry analysts --
against Cellnet's 215,000.  These compare with figures of 186,000 and
281,200 respectively in 1994.

Cellnet, however, showed a significant increase in churn in the last
quarter of 1995 compared with the same period last year -- although its
net figures were down on 1994 its gross connections were up over the
previous year, 379,500 compared to 369,500.  Vodafone's churn also
increased.  Gross connections for the last three months of 1995 were
286,000 compared to 313,000 last year.

SPAIN FOLLOWS ITALIAN MODEL IN CELLULAR COMPENSATION PLANS

The Spanish government has drawn up a series of proposed measures
designed to compensate Airtel, the country's second GSM digital
cellular operator, for the Pta85 million ($702 million) fee it had to
pay to secure its licence.

The government, which is understood to have finished putting together
draft proposals on December 28, is currently working with Airtel to
produce a final version of the plan.  The two sides expect to reach an
agreement by the end of next month, if not before.

This rate of progress so far appears to have been acceptable to the
European Commission, which had originally told the Spanish government
to come up with a compensation plan by the end of December (Mobile
Communications, 183/1).

The Italian government, which was set a similar timetable by the EC, is
one step ahead.  It has already completed its package of similar
measures to compensate Italy's second GSM digital cellular operator,
Omnitel, for its L750 billion ($475 million) licence fee.  This
package, which was announced on December 22, was worked out in
agreement with the EC and is expected to receive its formal approval at
the end of this month.

The two governments would have faced legal proceedings before the
European Court of Justice if they had failed to comply with the EC's
demands.

Spanish plan: The Spanish proposals centre on three core measures:
reducing by up to 50 per cent the interconnection rates that Airtel has
to pay to use the network of the state-controlled Telefonica; allowing
Airtel to build its own infrastructure or to use alternative infrastr-
ucture; and awarding Airtel a concession to build and operate a
personal communications network (PCN) based on the DCS-1800 standard.
The first two measures are based on suggestions put forward by Airtel
itself last summer (Mobile Communications, 176/3).

The proposals have been drafted under the aegis of Rienaldo Rodriguez,
the director general of the communications branch of the ministry of
transport and communications, who was appointed to the task at the
beginning of November.

At the moment it is unclear whether the Spanish government intends to
adopt a mixture of all three measures, although this is considered
highly likely given that the Italian government's EC-sanctioned package
is based on a combination of almost identical elements.

Airtel -- which is owned by Airtouch of the USA (15.8 per cent), BT (6.3
per cent) and a group of leading Spanish banks, utilities and
construction groups, and which  launched commercial services on October
3 (Mobile Communications, 179/1) -- had connected 8,000 subscribers by
December 1, and 15,000 by the start of this month.  Telefonica Moviles,
the cellular arm of Telefonica which was charged no fee for its GSM
licence, launched its digital service in July, and had connected 23,000
customers by December 1 and 37,000 by January 1.

The EC told the Spanish government last July that it would have to come
up with measures to enable Airtel to compete on an equal basis with
Telefonica Moviles.  It placed a similar requirement on the Italian
government in respect of Omnitel and its state-controlled counterpart
Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM).

The EC considers the imposition of steep licence fees on new entrants
to the market to be potentially discriminatory if the incumbents do not
have to pay fees for the licences they already hold.  It says that in
order to rectify the situation, the governments concerned should either
extract a licence fee from the incumbent cellular operators, or
introduce measures that will compensate the new entrant for the money
it has already paid.

Italian package: The Italian package, which was announced by
telecommunications minister Agostino Gambino, provides for Omnitel's
interconnection fees to be reduced by 25 per cent this year and by the
same amount next year, which is expected to produce savings in the
region of L60 billion over the two-year period.  The first reduction in
interconnection fees took effect on January 1.

Omnitel will also be granted a licence to offer PCN services based on
the DSC-1800 standard, and will be allowed to use alternative
infrastructure as soon as legislation is in place to enable this.

Omnitel says it is ``happy'' with the compensation package, a reaction
that has surprised several analysts who do not consider it a
particularly good deal.  Telecommunications analysts with merchant bank
Robert Fleming Securities note that the L60 billion savings from
reduced interconnection fees hardly match the L750 billion that Omnitel
paid for its GSM licence in March 1994 (Mobile Communications, 146/3).

In respect of allowing Omnitel to use alternative infrastructure,
analysts point out that this is allowing Omnitel no more than the
freedom to which it would be entitled anyway, given that the Italian
government says it wants to liberalise alternative infrastructure this
year in line with the timetable being pushed through by the EC (Telecom
Markets, 277/1).

The Italian government has already stated its intention to award
licences for PCN services by the middle of this year (Mobile
Communications, 181/1).  But when Gambino announced the plans in
October there was no indication that a licence would automatically be
awarded to Omnitel.  At the time it was said that one licence would be
automatically granted to TIM and a second put out to competitive
tender.

Under the new deal, Omnitel will not be allowed to offer commercial PCN
services until 1998, and neither TIM nor any other competitor will be
allowed to start PCN services before Omnitel has done so.  This puts
back the start of PCN by about a year.  Last October, Gambino intimated
that services would start on January 1 1997.

Omnitel -- whose major shareholders include Olivetti (41.3 per cent),
Airtouch (11.7 per cent) and Bell Atlantic (11.6 per cent), and which
started commercial services on December 7 (Mobile Communications,
184/6) -- says that by January 7 it had signed about 50,000 subscribers.
 TIM had 417,855 GSM subscribers on January 1, and says that on
December 22 alone it signed 23,633 new digital subscribers.

Omnitel is now is the process of expanding its Spazio Omnitel retail
stores.  The first four were opened on December 15 in Milan, Florence,
Genoa and Brescia.  A further 20 stores are scheduled to be opened
throughout Italy by the end of this year, many through franchising
agreements.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S MOBILE DIRECTIVE IS FINALLY ADOPTED

The European Commission yesterday (January 10) adopted the Article 90
directive to liberalise mobile services and networks (Mobile
Communications, 184/3).  A political decision had already been taken on
December 20 but formal adoption was delayed by translation
difficulties.

The directive will come into force before the end of February.  Once it
comes into force, the member states will be given nine months in which
to notify the Commission of the appropriate national measures taken to
implement the provisions.

The directive requires member states to abolish all exclusive and
special rights in the mobile communications market and, wherever this
has not yet been achieved, to establish open and fair licensing
procedures to authorise the launch of GSM, DCS-1800 and Digital
European Cordless Telecommunications (Dect) standard services.  The
number of licences should only be limited by `essential requirements'
such as spectrum efficiency.

Restrictions on current licensees will also have to be raised to allow
them to extend their services from one frequency into another.

In particular, the entering into force of the directive will mean that
member states will not be able to refuse to allocate licences for
public access or telepoint applications for systems operating on the
basis of the Dect standard.

Similarly, member states will not be able to restrict the combination
of mobile technologies, in particular where multistandard equipment is
available.

Nor will member states be able to refuse to allocate DCS-1800 licences
to either new operators or existing GSM operators.  But this aspect of
the directive will not come into effect until January 1 1998.  The
delay is being granted in order to give member states the option of
allowing new DCS-1800 operators time to establish themselves before
existing GSM operators jump in.

Operators will also have the right to provide their own infrastructure
and to make use of alternative infrastructure provided by third parties
such as utility companies.  The Commission believes this to be
particularly important as it estimates that the cost of leasing
transmission capacity currently accounts for between 30 per cent and 50
per cent of the revenues of a second operator.

Member states with less developed networks -- Portugal, Greece, Spain
and Ireland -- will be able to apply for derogations of the directive
for up to five years.  Luxembourg has already made it clear that it is
not interested in any derogation.

Alternative networks: The Article 90 directive to open up alternative
networks and establish full competition is currently being examined by
various working groups and is likely to be adopted in February (Mobile
Communications, 184/3).

OLIVETTI SHARE ISSUE FULLY SUBSCRIBED

Olivetti says that last month's L2,257 billion ($1.42 billion) share
issue, which closed on December 15, was almost fully subscribed with
99.8 per cent of the offer taken up.  It intends to invest a
significant proportion of the money in Omnitel.

LUXEMBOURG GETS SET TO AWARD SECOND GSM CELLULAR LICENCE

The Luxembourg ministry of communications this week invited potential
bidders to register initial expressions of interest in the country's
second GSM digital cellular telephone licence, which is to be awarded
later this year.  It says that eight or nine parties have already come
forward.

The ministry will not reveal who the parties are.  But the Luxembourg-
based Millicom International Cellular confirms that it has expressed an
interest in the licence while Airtouch of the USA says it is
considering doing so.

Interested parties will eventually be asked to put forward proposals
for an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 service.  But the ministry says that it
will award an integrated licence only if it receives a submission which
is sufficiently convincing.  Otherwise the licence will be GSM-only.

However, the ministry will not be able to issue a tender, let alone
grant the second GSM licence, until parliament has agreed to end the
monopoly of cellular services that is currently enjoyed by the state-
owned P&T, which is already operating a GSM network alongside an older
NMT-450 analogue network.

The cellular monopoly will be broken through enacting a new
telecommunications law which is intended to liberalise the country's
extremely closed market in advance of the European Union deadline of
allowing full competition by January 1 1998.

The new telecommunications law will among other things create an
independent regulatory authority.  However, the ministry of
communications says it has no immediate plans to allow new operators
into any sector other than digital cellular.

The government expects to present the new legislation to parliament
this spring, and is confident the bill will be passed by the summer.
At this point it will be able to issue an official licence tender,
leading to the award of two GSM licences later in the year.  One will
automatically be given to the P&T, while the other will be awarded on a
competitive basis.

The P&T will be eligible for an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 licence.  But
like the bidders for the second licence, it will have to put forward
proposals to justify this.  Otherwise it will get a GSM-only licence.

The ministry has not yet revealed detailed licence terms, but it did
give a broad overview of certain elements when it announced its licence
plans towards the end of last month.  The process will involve the
payment of a competitive licence fee, although the ministry stresses
that this will be just one aspect of the selection procedure and that
it will not be running an auction.  Other important elements will
include the speed of each bidder's proposed network roll-out and the
nature of its tariff proposition.

The P&T will have to pay a licence fee to match the one paid by the new
entrant.  If both operators get the same type of licence, the fees will
be the same.  If one gets a GSM licence, and the other gets a GSM/DCS-
1800 licence, then the P&T fee would be adjusted appropriately.

The ministry is considering an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 service because
Luxembourg, with a population of 390,000, is too small a market to
support two GSM networks and two DCS-1800 networks as well.

The P&T's GSM network, which was launched in July 1993, had about
27,500 subscribers by the start of this month.  The NMT-450 system,
which was launched in 1983 and has been in decline for some time, had
about 160.

The only private involvement in the cellular market at the moment is
through four service providers, which sell GSM services but not
analogue ones.  One of these, Mobilux, is equally owned by the P&T and
by MIC.  The other three -- CMD, LTM and Satcom -- are wholly private.

WEST EUROPEAN MARKET HITS NOVEMBER SLOWDOWN

November proved to be a disappointing month for the west European
cellular industry, with a relatively slow rate of growth, according to
figures collected by Mobile Communications.

These show that the market added 769,721 net new subscribers during the
month, taking the total from 20,797,135 to 21,566,856, representing
growth of 3.56 per cent.  The end-month total is 63-per-cent higher
than the 13,231,421 reached at the end of November 1994.

The November growth figure compares with the October figure of 808,689
(4.05 per cent) and the September figure of 708,037 (3.67 per cent).

The equivalent growth figure for November 1994 was 494,680 (3.7 per
cent) (Mobile Communications, 162/5).

The figures would have been influenced by the slow rate of growth in
the UK -- Europe's largest cellular market.  In the UK the November
total of net new subscribers was 158,500, much the same as in November
1994 when 165,000 were added (Mobile Communications, 162/2).  The UK
growth rate for November was 3.15 per cent.

Not all UK operators are experiencing the same growth.  DCS-1800
operator Orange is adding almost as many customers as the much larger
Vodafone (Mobile Communications, 185/2).  Orange added 30,000 net new
customers in November (to take its total to 330,000) compared to 42,500
for Vodafone (to take its total to 2,279,209), 69,000 for Cellnet
(total 2,210,900), and 17,000 for Mercury One-2-One (total 367,000).

An increase in GSM handset prices in Norway following the end of a
``commission war'' has caused growth to slow to about 3.83 per cent,
well down on the spectacular growth rates over the summer (Mobile
Communications, 179/6).

The fastest growing markets in November were Ireland (9.36 per cent),
Luxembourg (7.17 per cent), Spain (6.05 per cent), the Netherlands
(5.48 per cent), Italy (4.69 per cent), Cyprus (4.40 per cent), France
(4.21 per cent), and Germany (4.08 per cent).

The Irish market has been particularly boosted by the growth of GSM
subscriptions.  The price of handsets has fallen substantially
following an increase in commission payments by Eircell, which is
preparing to face competition for the first time following the award of
a second GSM licence to Esat Digifone last October (Mobile
Communications, 182/1).  Increased coverage has also boosted the
attractiveness of GSM.

In Italy, Spain and the Netherlands the launch of new GSM services has
contributed to the growth of local GSM markets as well as stimulating
cellular markets as a whole.

INDIAN GOVERNMENT FINALLY AWARDS REGIONAL GSM LICENCES

The Indian government has finally issued cellular licences for all of
the 18 regional concessions where bids were placed, a process that was
thrown into disarray by the imposition in November of a cap on the
number of licences that any one operator could hold.

Several groups have not yet paid the first instalment of their licence
fees, which were due on December 18.  But the delays are understood to
be temporary and therefore not a cause for concern.

Groups that have yet to pay include Modicom for its Karnataka grade A
licence circle for which it offered Rs13,930 million ($393 million),
the third highest bid placed (see table).  The Modicom group has also
not yet paid the first instalment of its Punjab grade B licence circle,
which cost it Rs12,660 million.

All of the second-highest bidders have agreed to the government's
requirement that they match the fee placed by the highest bidders, as
set out in the initial tender process (Mobile Communications, 179/3).

Under the terms of the licence cap, a single operator can hold no more
than three licences in the grade A and B licence circles, which are the
most attractive.  But there is no limit on the number of licences it
can hold in the less attractive C circles (Mobile Communications,
183/4).

The only groups hit by the cap were the US West-BPL group and Modicom.
US West-BPL originally looked set to win five licences and Modicom four
licences, all in grade A and B circles (Mobile Communications, 177/1).

The operators were obliged, when decided which licence options to give
up, to retain those in circles where they had been the highest bidder.

Modicom originally bid the highest in Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan and
Utter Pradesh East.  So it had the choice of which of these licence
options it should give up.  It decided to relinquish its option on the
Rajasthan licence, which passed to Aircell Digilink, and to hold on to
the other three.

But it was forced to give up Utter Pradesh East because its net worth
did not meet the minimum holding limit set down by the Department of
Telecommunications for any operator wishing to hold more than two of
the top ranked licences.

US West-BPL bid the highest in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and the second
highest in Gujurat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.  So the group was
obliged to keep the first two, and then had the option of deciding
which of the second two to relinquish.  It chose to retain the licence
for Maharashtra (Mobile Communications, 185/16).

CZECH GSM LICENCE CONTEST ATTRACTS WIDE INTEREST

The competition for a 49-per-cent stake in one of the two GSM digital
cellular telephone licences that are being awarded in the Czech
Republic has attracted initial expressions of interest from a total of
18 companies (Mobile Communications, 180/1).

The list of companies which have put in requests for tender documents
and submitted contributions to the consultation process contains
several leading operators from Europe and North America and a number of
local companies.

The potential bidders include DeTeMobil, the McCaw International
company run by cellular billionaire Craig McCaw, Telesystem
International Wireless of Canada, TeleDanmark, France Telecom, RWE
Telliance, Skoda-Mannesmann, Southwestern Bell International, Telenor,
Telecom Finland, Stet International, AirTouch, Vebacom, Tokyo-based
communications company Domen, Czech energy distributor Czechkom Plus,
Czech energy generator CEZ, and two other Czech companies JITY and
Telekomunikace Montaze.

Many of the companies on the list are now involved in negotiations to
form consortia before the final deadline for applications at the
beginning of February.  TeleDanmark and Telenor have already announced
that they will be making a joint bid, with TeleDanmark taking the lead.

A government-appointed committee will evaluate the bids during February
and March.  Following the submission of its recommendations a final
government decision is expected to be made before the end of March.

The winner will become the junior partner to the state-controlled radio
infrastructure operator Ceske Radiokomunikace, which has already been
given a 51-per-cent stake in the new operating organisation that has
been awarded one of the GSM licences.

The other GSM licence has already been promised to the existing NMT-450
operator Eurotel -- which is owned by Czech telecommunications operator
SPT (51 per cent), US West (24.5 per cent) and Bell Atlantic (24.5 per
cent).  A 27-per-cent stake in SPT is held by a joint venture between
KPN of the Netherlands and Swiss PTT Telecom.

Bidding process: Any consortium bidding for the 49-per-cent stake
alongside Ceske Radiokomunikace will have to be controlled by a foreign
company because the government has specified that a leading role must
be played by a `qualified operator' with a minimum of 300,000 cellular
subscribers.

According to Vladimir Sedlacek, director of telecommunications policy
at the ministry of economics, the main criteria for choosing the
winning consortium to partner Ceske Radiokomunikace will be the ability
to deliver low tariffs, good coverage, quick roll-out and high levels
of investment.  The licence fee will be set low to reflect these
priorities, at about $12 million or $13 million.

POLISH GSM CONTEST LIMPS ON

Meanwhile, there has been a much less enthusiastic response to the
contest for two GSM licences in Poland, with only three consortia
submitting bids by the closing date of January 3.

One consortium contains Polish oil refiner Petrochemia Plock, copper
mining group KGHM Polska Miedz and the Polish Power Grid Company in
partnership with TeleDanmark and AirTouch.

Another includes Polish state-owned chemical company Ciech Warszawa,
together with smaller Polish partners alongside Stet.

The third is led by Polish trading company Elektrim together with other
smaller partners and US West.

The winning bidders are expected to be announced by the end of
February.

The number of contenders has been limited partly by the shortage of
sizeable Polish partners capable of taking the required 51-per-cent
domestic stake that a bidding consortium must have in order to qualify
for the contest (Mobile Communications, 180/9).  Another factor has
been the size of the licence fee, with bidders being asked to pay
Ecu100 million ($78.54 million) at the outset and additional annual
payments after that.

Bidders may also have been frightened off by the legal dispute between
the Polish government on the one hand, and France Telecom and Ameritech
on the other.  The two foreign operators, which partner the state-owned
telecommunications operator Telekomunikacja Polska (TP) in the
country's existing NMT-450 Centertel cellular operator, say that the
government has gone back on a promise to award Centertel one of the GSM
licences (see below).

One potential contender which did not submit a bid was the consortium
headed by Polish computer company Optimus and including Telecom
Finland, Veba Telecom, Kinnevik of Sweden and Millicom International
Cellular of Luxembourg.  This group collapsed just before Christmas
after the foreign partners pulled out, citing the high licence fee as
the reason.

CELLULAR LOSERS MOUNT LEGAL ACTION

This week France Telecom followed Ameritech in announcing that it would
take legal action against the Polish government for failing to honour a
1991 pledge to grant Centertel a GSM licence (Mobile Communications,
180/9).

Both operators have asked the International Court of Justice in the
Hague to set up arbitration proceedings.

France Telecom is seeking around $500 million in damages to compensate
it for investment in Centertel's infrastructure as well as the loss of
future earnings.

The Polish government is believed to have suggested to the Centertel
partners that it could instead offer them the DCS-1800 licence it is
planning to award towards the end of 1996.  However, the decision of
the two foreign operators to initiate legal action suggests that
neither was impressed by this proposal.

THIRD GSM OPERATOR FOR ESTONIA

A third GSM licence was awarded in Estonia on December 18 to the
Ritabell joint venture between Millicom International Cellular (48 per
cent) and Estonian media company Levicom (52 per cent).  Luxembourg-
based Millicom International Cellular has management control over the
joint venture.  The new service will be launched in the second half of
1996.

There are already three networks in Estonia, run by two operators.
Semi-state-owned Eesti Mobiiltelefon -- which is a consortium of Eesti
Telecom, Telia and Telecom Finland -- runs an NMT-450 network (launched
in 1991) and a GSM network (launched in 1993).  Radiolinja Estonia runs
a GSM network (launched January 1995).  At the beginning of October,
Estonia had a total of 25,400 cellular subscribers and a penetration
rate of 1.6 per cent (Mobile Communications, 183/5).

Millicom says that Estonia may be a small country but that it is
showing a lively rate of growth and is capable of supporting a third
GSM operator.  It suggests that a GSM network in the region may require
only 10,000 to 15,000 subscribers to be viable.

FCC STAGES BILLION-DOLLAR PCS FREQUENCY AUCTION

The second Federal Communications Commission auction of Personal
Communications Services (PCS) radio frequencies in the USA had
attracted top bids totalling $1.38 billion by the end of last week.

The largest single bid of $225 million was submitted by North Coast
Mobile Communications for the New York licence area, the largest on
offer covering a potential 18 million users.

The highest total bids came from PersonalConnect Communications, the
venture backed by cellular billionaire Craig McCaw, with offers
totalling $278 million in five licence areas.

In this `C' block auction, which is aimed at entrepreneurs rather than
major telecom-munications players, the country is divided into a total
of 493 licence areas, known as Basic Trading Areas (BTAs).  The winner
in each BTA, roughly the size of a US county, will receive 30 MHz of
radio frequencies.

Last year, the FCC sold off 30 MHz of radio frequencies in its `A' and
`B' block auction but in far larger licence areas known as Major
Trading Areas (MTAs).  This auction, which attracted bids from the
industry's major players and lasted three-and-a-half months, raised a
total of $7.73 billion (Mobile Communications, 168/8).

The C block auction, which started in December and will probably run
for at least another month, started with 293 companies and still has
255 on board.  When it is finished, the FCC will decide when to sell
off the smaller D, E and F frequency blocks of 10 MHz each.

LATIVIAN AUTHORITIES TO SELECT WINNER OF GSM LICENCE

Latvia: Meanwhile, the Latvian authorities are due at the end of this
month to select the winner of the contest for a second GSM licence.  A
decision had been expected at the end of 1995.  There are five
applicants for the licence, including consortia led by Millicom
International Cellular, Motorola and Radiolinja of Finland.

The only operator in Latvia at present is Lat Mobilais Telefons -- a
joint venture between Telia, Telecom Finland and three Latvian
companies -- with a NMT-450 network launched in 1991 and a GSM network
launched in January 1995.

CANADIAN GOVERNMENT PLAYS SAFE WITH PCS LICENCES

The Canadian government awarded four national personal communications
service (PCS) licences on December 18 (Mobile Communications, 181/6).

Two national 30 MHz licences were awarded to Clearnet PCS and Microcell
Network and two national 10 MHz licences to the two existing cellular
operators, Rogers Cantel Mobile and Mobility Personacom Canada (which
has actually been given 12 regional licences to be held by the
affiliates which own it).

Industry Canada, the federal department for industrial affairs, had the
option of awarding up to six national licences in total and was widely
expected to do so.  Its decision to award only four leaves two national
blocks of frequency unallocated -- one of 30 MHz and one of 10 MHz.  No
official explanation has yet been given for the decision.  But Industry
Canada is due to publish a report later this month outlining its
reasons and also giving details of the licence conditions and the
spectrum transition policy which have not yet been released.

The Industry Canada decisions also represent a more mainstream approach
than expected.  During the contest, the department had stressed that it
wished to encourage innovation and competition as priorities, and that
it was willing to consider dividing up the frequency blocks on a
regional basis (Mobile Communications, 174/3).  But it is believed to
have been disappointed by the lack of new ideas exhibited in the
submissions.  These tended to be fairly similar, retaining a strong
high-mobility voice-telephony emphasis.  As none of the outsiders
distinguished themselves sufficiently technologically, the licences
ended up going to the safe options.

Clearnet PCS and Microcell Network were generally held to be two of the
three main candidates for national 30 MHz licences (Mobile
Communications, 181/6). The third favourite, TeleZone, a telepoint
licensee in which Bell Atlantic and AirTouch are strategic investors,
received nothing.  It has already announced that as a result it will be
laying off half of its staff.  It is believed that the company is
considering an appeal and may close down completely if it does not
obtain a licence.  Industry Canada says that there is no formal appeal
process, but that it is always possible to make representations.

Commentators suggest that TeleZone did not win a licence because it did
not provide a sufficiently regional focus to its application.

Clearnet PCS is a Canadian operator of enhanced specialised mobile
radio (ESMR) services in which substantial stakes are held by Motorola
and US ESMR operator Nextel.  Clearnet has still to make a technology
choice.  It has been trialling Nortel's GSM-based PCS technology and
Motorola's Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology in Ontario.

Microcell Network is a telepoint licensee (Mobile Communications,
163/6) with shareholders including National Telesystem (which has a
controlling stake in international operator Teleglobe), Sprint Canada,
CUC Broadcasting and others.  Microcell Network is thought likely to
opt for a GSM-based PCS system although no technology decision has yet
been announced.

Existing cellular operators Rogers Cantel and Mobility Personacom
Canada did as well as they could expect with 10 MHz each.  They were
unable to apply for 30 MHz blocks because they are subject to a
spectrum cap (Mobile Communications, 174/3).  No technology decisions
have yet been announced by these two operators.  Both are expected to
make use of the new spectrum to relieve areas of high congestion on
their existing networks.

There is speculation that the 40 MHz of spectrum that Industry Canada
has held back might also end up going to Rogers Cantel and Mobility
Personacom Canada once their spectrum caps expire in three years' time.
 According to one industry commentator this solution would give new
operators Clearnet PCS and Microcell Network a head start but would
then at the end of the three-year period create a level playing field
with each of the four PCS operators ending up with 30 MHz of spectrum.

PCS services are expected to be launched by 1997 at the latest,
initially in the main urban areas of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.
This would initially involve cellular voice services although more
innovative applications are likely to be introduced at a later stage.

TWO COULD BE COMPANY FOR VODAFONE AND AIRTOUCH

A merger between AirTouch of the USA and Vodafone of the UK, the
world's two leading international cellular operators, would offer
considerable benefits to both, according to an investment report from
UK securities house Robert Fleming.

The report, published at the end of last month, argues that a merger
would create major economies of scale, particularly in Europe where the
new company, which Robert Fleming calls AirFone, would run cellular
networks in virtually every country.  Airfone would also have a major
presence in the US and Asia-Pacific regions.

In Europe, the merged company would be in a strong position to extract
better interconnection terms from fixed network operators or even,
depending on EU regulations, to build its own long-distance and
international links to carry cellular traffic between its national
operations.  Such a move would substantially improve margins on calls.
In addition, a merged company would be able to generate increased
revenues from users roaming across Europe by requiring its customers to
roam only to its own networks, thus reducing the scale of outpayments
made to other operators.

The two companies would also have a stronger say in the running of the
Globalstar satellite venture, in which both are currently involved as
individual shareholders.

Robert Fleming foresees little opposition to a merger from existing
shareholders, many of whom, such as US financial institutions Fidelity
and Capital Research, are already investors in both companies.

Discussion of the merits of a possible AirTouch-Vodafone alliance --
which is not thought to be an imminent prospect -- is the result of
investor concern over the weakness of Vodafone's share price since
November.  This weakness, which has been largely caused by fears about
the increased level of competition that Vodafone is facing in the UK,
has led to concern that the company could be becoming undervalued,
prompting analysts to examine a number of ways in which the real worth
of the company could be more properly realised.  But any proposal for a
merger would probably have to wait at least until the retirement of
Vodafone's chairman and chief executive, Sir Gerry Whent, in two years'
time.

Other recent analyst suggestions on how to unlock Vodafone's value have
included proposals for a demerger of its international business from
its UK operation.  It is argued that this would allow the hidden value
of the international business to be realised.  But a demerger is
dismissed by Robert Fleming as unrealistic, on the grounds that such a
move would run counter to the global trend for consolidation in the
cellular industry and would also expose Vodafone's relatively weak
position in the UK.

More likely is the idea of spinning off individual foreign operations
in which Vodafone holds a stake.  Aside from profitability, Vodafone
would also have to secure the support of other shareholders before a
flotation could take place.  Candidates for such a strategy, which
would not happen at least until next year, would include Greek GSM
operator Panafon and Vodafone's Australian GSM operator, which is also
called Vodafone.

ONE IN FOUR USERS UNHAPPY

One in four of those cellular users who pay their own bills now regret
buying their telephones, according to a survey by the Consumers'
Association which criticises poor quality service and unreliable
equipment.  The results of the survey -- which involved questioning
thousands of users of all types, but excluded from the analysis those
users for whom the bills are paid by someone else, such as their
employer -- is published next month in the association's two-monthly
Consumer Policy Review magazine.

The survey also criticises the contracts that service providers offer
to users.  This is already the subject of an Office of Fair Trading
inquiry (Mobile Communications, 184/1).  The OFT wrote to nine service
providers in November, telling them to change their contract terms, or
risk court action.  Some of these service providers have responded, but
it is unclear whether all of them have done so.  The OFT has yet to
take further action.

ORANGE FLOAT PLANS

Hutchison Telecom UK, the parent of Orange, has confirmed the formation
of a bank syndicate to underwrite the initial public offering in the
mobile operator later this year.  Global co-ordinators Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson and Goldman Sachs will lead the sale.  Senior managers
in the UK and Europe will be ABN Amro Hoare Govett and NatWest.  Lehman
Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette will manage
the offering in the USA.  HSBC and a few other banks with a strong
presence in the Asia-Pacific region will handle the sale in the rest of
the world.

The offering now appears likely to take place in the second quarter of
1995, rather than the first quarter, which is thought to have been
Hutchison's initial wish.

Hutchison Telecom, owned by Hutchison Whampoa and British Aerospace, is
valued at about #2 billion but its owners are not expected to sell more
than a 25-per-cent stake.

WAVELENGTH SET TO OFFER NATIONAL PAMR SERVICE

The UK will have a second national public access mobile radio (pamr)
operator from the start of next month with the launch of an expanded
service by regional operator Wavelength.

The company has linked together its existing regional networks, which
cover 70 per cent of the UK's population, in order to offer a UK
service in competition with National Band Three.

Up to now, Wavelength's coverage has had significant gaps, for instance
between Birmingham and Manchester.  These will now be bridged by
providing coverage on major roads linking its regional networks -- an
arrangement which is allowed under Wavelength's regional licences.

The company will continue to target the traditional pamr market of
transport or service companies and will not attempt to branch out to
consumers.

``Wavelength's move should boost competition in the UK pamr market,''
said one observer.  ``National Band Three has better coverage and
capacity because it has more transmitters and leased lines.  But
Wavelength, with less infrastructure, might be cheaper.''

Wavelength, which has 5,000 users, has been expanding since its
takeover in 1994 by Telesystem International Wireless (TIW), a Canadian
company that invests in mobile communications ventures (Mobile
Communications, 156/6).

In the autumn of 1994, TIW won six out of nine regional pamr licences
awarded by the Department of Trade and Industry (Mobile Communications,
159/5).

UK RADIO AGENCY SET TO LICENSE DIY SERVICES

The Radiocommunications Agency will next week (January 18) allow UK
users to run their own limited mobile radio services when it issues the
first licences for Short Range Business Radio (SRBR) services.

The new licences, which will cost #30 for three years, will enable
users to use analogue SRBR handsets to provide themselves with radio
and paging services over a range of up to 400 metres, without the need
for infrastructure.  The technology is suitable for locations such as
building sites, hospitals or industrial estates.

The agency expects eventually to be issuing about 500 licences a year,
although by this week it had received only one application.

The licences should prove attractive since the only cost of the new
service, after having paid the licence fee, will be the purchase of
handsets and paging units.  Users do not incur any airtime, connection
or rental costs.

Motorola will next week launch Handie-Com, the first SRBR product
range.  Motorola was one of the main manufacturers behind the much-
delayed technology.

SRBR is linked to a similar technology, known as Digital Short Range
Radio (DSRR), which the Department of Trade and Industry had wanted to
see implemented as long ago as 1990 (Mobile Communications, 184/11).

A NEW NAME, AN EXPANDED MISSION

Dear Subscriber:

     Welcome to the inaugural issue of Mobile Communications
Report, incorporating the former Mobile Satellite Reports -- and
much more.

     In introducing Mobile Communications Report, we're responding
to the clear mandate of our satellite readers to expand our
coverage of nonsatellite mobile communications.  The mobile
satellite industry always has been best understood within the
context of its "allied and competing" industries (as we had dubbed
them in our regular Mobile Satellite Reports feature).  Now,
responding to your requests and to the rapid changes taking place
in mobile communications as a whole, we have created Mobile
Communications Report.

     Our mission is simply stated:  To continue to provide the
industry with the sharpest, most concise and most accurate news and
analysis anywhere.  It's what Warren Publishing has been doing for
more than 50 years.  We will remain the acknowledged authority on
the mobile satellite industry.  We'll apply the same standards to
our fuller treatment of terrestrial mobile communications.

     A final pledge:  Mobile Communications Report, like all of
Warren's publications, never will be something that adds to your
burden of keeping up.  You already have "too much to read."  We
pride ourselves on providing newsletters that our readers want to
read -- because our work is thoughtfully planned, accurately
written and meticulously edited.

     I would love to hear from you, with both comments and
questions.  My number is 202-872-9202, ext. 245.

     Sincerely,
     Daniel Y. Warren
     Associate Publisher and 
        Senior Editor

SECOND FCC PCS AUCTION AT TWICE BIDDING PACE OF FIRST ROUND YEAR
AGO

     Long-delayed Block C PCS auction set fast pace, with 293
companies seeking 493 licenses through first 4 rounds 2 weeks ago,
easily eclipsing pace for first round in 1994 when bigger, richer
companies sought 99 licenses.  Round 4 ended Dec. 21 with
$1,209,613,496 in net revenue vs. $678.9 million through same stage
in earlier auction.  Although licenses cover same territory,
industry observers suggested smaller service areas in Block C
coupled with repeated delays in launching sales may be contributing
to faster pace.  "There is a lot of pent-up demand for these
licenses," said Kathleen Ham, chief, FCC Auctions Div.  Auction was
to resume Jan. 5 if govt. shutdown has ended.

     Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) auction for 1,040 licenses,
more commercial and less glitzy industry, slowed "to a crawl" and
FCC was forced to move Stage 2 bidding rules until after holiday
break, Ham told us.  SMR bidding through 13 rounds ended with
$166.9 million in net revenue from high bids, although Atlanta
Trunking's erroneous bid of $125 million skewed numbers.  Without
withdrawal of payment owed by Atlanta Trunking, net revenue is
$60.6 million, FCC said.  Ham said Stage 2 rules require companies
to bid on 75% of eligible pops, compared with 50% in Stage 1, or
face reduction in eligibility.  Auction staff will review bidding
pace after sale resumes -- Jan. 2, if govt. has reopened -- she
said.

     Interest in PCS Block C licenses grew as legal delays pushed
back start from April to summer, then fall and finally to Dec.,
with further one-week delay in first govt. shutdown.  Ham said
pent-up demand combined with 2-week hiatus for holiday probably
contributed to aggressive bidding.  Wireless Bureau Chief Michele
Farquhar said:  "This shows that good things come in small
packages."  Ham said experience acquired in first action also may
contribute to speed of bidding in current sale.

     Block C licenses could generate greater value based on smaller
territories compared with A and B Block licenses, which raised $7
billion from 18 bidders.  Ham said speculation has focused on
revenue possibilities that would increase for smaller licenses. 
Larger A and B territories, such as N.Y. and L.A., covered more
than one state, requiring substantial buildout.  Block C is geared
to Basic Trading Areas (BTAs), with 10 BTA licenses for each MTA.

     Industry analyst Herschel Shosteck offered additional reason
for size of opening round:  Block C companies are vehicles for big
companies to expand existing cellular or PCS holdings, using
ability to hold up to 49% of Block C bidder as minority Partner. 
"This is a facade for the big boys to take another crack at it," he
told us.  "It all has to do with ideology."  For example, he said
U.S. AirWaves, headed by former U S West executive John DeFeo, has
backing from MCI, which has loaned company $25 million.  Wireless
entrepreneur Craig McCaw acquired 25% of Personal-Connect
Communications of Seattle.  To qualify, companies had to have
revenues under $125 million for last 2 years, and assets below $500
million, but Shosteck said several companies had up-front payments
-- in cash -- of more than $50 million.  AirWaves paid $81 million
and NextWave, which is thought to have Qualcomm as backer, $79
million.  At end of auction, he said, small companies that bid
"will sell out" to larger companies, leading to news stories on
success of entrepreneurs.

     Analysis of Round 4 bids showed PCS 2000, P.R.-based company,
still would pay premium for its licenses of $11.24 per pop compared
with other leaders bidders' $7.50-$9.  Company also bid $46.5
million ($11.24) in Boston and $46.3 million ($11.24) in
Washington, D.C.  For example, GWI PCS offered $112.5 million for
L.A. ($7.73 per pop) and $48.9 million for San Francisco ($7.59),
DCR PCS offered $70.3 million, $8.58.  NextWave bid $53.1 million,
$9, in Philadelphia, and $37.8 million, $8.03, in Detroit.  In
Block A & B auction, Pacific Telesis bid high of $21.39 in L.A. and
San Francisco, Poka Lambro $1.83 for Wash.-Mont. and Guam.  Most
paid $10-$15.

U.S. POSITION ON FUTURE STRUCTURE OF INTELSAT IS IMMINENT

     U.S. is set to finalize position on future structure of
Intelsat as soon as it returns from shutdown, Michael Fitch of
State Dept. Office of International Communications & Information
Policy (ICIP) told recent FCBA conference in Washington.  When U.S.
position is completed, he said, process of changing organization
can be accelerated.  U.S. has proposed creating one or more
separate Intelsat affiliates to compete for new services such as
mobile, direct-to-home, VSAT, other broadband applications. 
PanAmSat has said organization should be split into 3-4 companies
to ensure fair competition.  ICIP head Vonya McCann said "there's
no question that if member governments created [Intelsat and
Inmarsat] today, they would be different."  She said belief when
international satellite organizations were established that single
nation or company couldn't operate satellites has been "shattered"
by advances in technologies and economies.

     PanAmSat lawyer Henry Goldberg said that "given the
marketplace, we don't need intergovernmental treaty organizations"
to provide satellite capacity.  Comsat Gen. Counsel Warren Zeger
said current plan would have 51% of affiliates owned by
non-Intelsat signatories.  Similar Inmarsat affiliate -- ICO -- is
owned almost entirely by Inmarsat and its signatories.  Zeger said
issues involving ownership and governance of affiliates should be
resolved in time to conclude situation at Assembly of Parties in
1997.  Goldberg told us after panel that he doubts U.S. is still
considering divestiture, but is hopeful it will decide on creating
multiple affiliates instead of just establishing single affiliate
for new services.

     On separate issue, industry again rejected auctions as means
of resolving mutually exclusive applications in satellite area. 
Auctions in U.S. "could set off a chain reaction" across world,
Iridium Vp Leo Mondale said.  Systems such as Big LEO that Iridium
proposes "will never get investors because of the uncertainty" of
costs and ability to acquire licenses in auctions, he said:  "What
we're really concerned about is the open-endedness of the auction
process."  Auctions in more than 200 countries could kill satellite
programs, Comsat's Zeger said.

     Mark Grannis, FCC International Bureau legal adviser, said
auctions are fast and efficient and asked whether there's better
way to resolve mutual exclusivity.  While panelists didn't offer
alternatives, we're told industry was prepared to offer several at
Bureau's scheduled policy roundtable that was cancelled because of
govt. shutdown.  Roundtable tentatively has been rescheduled for
Jan. 10 at FCC hq.  Sources said members of Satellite Industry
Assn. haven't reached consensus on what policies to advance, so
companies will offer their ideas individually.

BOEING'S ZENIT-BASED SEA LAUNCH VENTURE GETS ORDER FROM HUGHES

     Hughes ordered up to 10 launches from Boeing, which plans to
use Ukrainian Zenit rockets launched from sea-based platform to
beat prices offered by other providers.  U.S. signed agreement on
Dec. 15 that will allow up to 20 American-built satellites to be
deployed on Ukrainian boosters.  Under accord, Boeing-led Sea
Launch consortium can launch up to 15 satellites and Ukraine itself
as many as 5.  Boeing is lead partner in Sea Launch, which plans to
market launch service to global customers.  Hughes, which said
first flight will be in 1998, was awarded $1-billion contract to
launch satellites of Inmarsat affiliate ICO, which Hughes is
building.  It said it's considering using Zenit for one or more ICO
satellites.

     Hughes signed similar agreement with McDonnell Douglas to use
its planned Delta 3 rocket for up to 10 launches in 1998-2005
period.  "Sea Launch is another solution to what we see as a need
for assured access to launch vehicles and launch slots over the
next few years," Hughes Space & Communications Chmn. Donald Cromer
said.  He said Hughes launch costs will be reduced because, among
other things, Sea Launch will maintain home port in nearby Long
Beach, which will reduce shipping expenses.

     Sea Launch consortium will be licensed under authority of
FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST), Dir. Frank
Weaver told reporters Dec. 19.  Home port for Sea Launch is Long
Beach and launches will be from special ship operating in
international waters using Ukrainian Zenit boosters.  Weaver said
OCST derives its authority over company because Boeing is U.S.
corporation that has critical role in project.  Situation is
different from Lockheed Krunichev Energia (LKE) venture that
launches Western payloads on Russian Proton, Weaver said, because
Lockheed's role is limited to marketing.  OCST doesn't license LKE
launches.  Weaver said OCST will inspect Sea Launch hardware and
procedures to ensure safety, and additional approvals may be
required from other U.S. agencies such as Coast Guard and Maritime
Commission.

     Ukraine is allowed to launch up to 20 U.S.-built satellites,
Weaver said, but final number depends on how robust international
launch market is over next few years.  He said low-end projections
indicate there will be about 20 internationally competitive flights
per year, with high-end figure around 30.  Under agreement, if
market averages 24 launches in 1996-1999, Ukraine can fly up to 5
satellites itself and international joint venture with key U.S.
partner (such as Sea Launch) can send up 11 geostationary birds. 
If there are 24 or more launches per year on average during period,
Ukraine can fly up to 6 satellites, while venture has authority to
launch 14.  Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites will be handled
separately, but Weaver said U.S. intends to ensure that American
providers are given "fair consideration."  Globalstar has deal
(part cash, part contribution of services) to launch several of its
LEO satellites on Zenit.

     Meanwhile, Weaver said OCST plans to release first part of
2-part notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in March on proposals
to streamline and simplify procedures at federal launch ranges and
to detail financial responsibilities of govt. and private sector
for commercial launches.  He said date for release of 2nd NPRM
hasn't been determined, but OCST will propose rules for procedures
at "purely commercial spaceports," which have been proposed in 5
states.  It also will include proposed safety rules for planned
reusable launch vehicles, he said.

FCC PROPOSES COMPENSATION POLICY FOR LEC-WIRELESS INTERCONNECTION

     FCC proposed compensation arrangements for LEC-wireless
interconnection that would mandate interim use of "bill-&-keep" as
reimbursement method.  Under bill-&-keep, each carrier terminates
calls for others at no charge.  Commissioners said at final meeting
of 1995 that bill-&-keep isn't ideal system, but speed is of
essence.  Comr. Quello warned that "search for an economically
perfect system would be the enemy of the economic good."

     Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina Keeney told commissioners
that interconnection is becoming increasingly important "as the
infrastructure evolves into a network of networks" and agency is
concerned that current FCC policies "aren't enough."  Current rules
require "mutual compensation" but don't set more specific
requirements.  Beauty of bill-&-keep is that it's "administratively
simple," Keeney said.  It doesn't require setting up new billing
systems.

     At present, more calls flow from wireless to wireline, meaning
LECs may have to bear more costs under bill-&-keep, but that
situation is changing.  Wireless companies, on other hand, have
complained that LECs are charging them inflated prices for
terminating their calls.  "There's a real danger" that without FCC
action, telephone companies will be able to impede development of
PCS through high prices and delays, Comr. Ness said.

     Although it considers bill-&-keep "preferred" solution,
Commission will seek comments on other options such as setting
uniform rate, charging whatever LECs charge neighboring LECs to
terminate calls, picking up one of various state solutions.  Comr.
Ness said she would be willing to listen if someone came up with
better system "but it's got to be less regulatory and it's got to
be speedy."

     Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. (CTIA) praised FCC
compensation proposal that it said would result in decreased fees
to wireless customers and increased competition.  CTIA said that
under current practice, wireless providers are required to pay LECs
for terminating calls that originate on mobile phones but LECs
don't pay wireless carriers for terminating their calls.  CTIA
Pres. Thomas Wheeler said that in 1994 wireless carriers paid LECs
more than $800 million to terminate their calls.  "Such a fee can
only act to impede development of wireless as a competitive local
exchange service," he said.

     Commissioners took pains to emphasize that they weren't
stepping on toes of state PUCs.  Fact that FCC has authority to set
compensation arrangements was mentioned several times -- as was
eagerness to keep states in loop.  "We have a good relationship
with the state commissions and we don't want to lose it," Chmn.
Hundt said.  "We want to work with them."  Key issue affecting
state PUCs is how FCC rules will apply to termination of intrastate
traffic.  Commission invited comments on whether it should adopt
interconnection model that isn't binding on state regulatory
commissions or whether it should opt for mandatory model.

     Commission tentatively concluded that information on
LEC-wireless interconnection arrangements should be made public and
will take comments on how to do that -- through tariffing, public
disclosure report or other approach.  Agency also will seek comment
on whether new rules should apply to interconnection between LECs
and all commercial mobile radio services or should be limited to
arrangements between LECs and 2-way providers such as PCS, cellular
and specialized mobile radio.  Other option would limit rules to
interconnection between LECs and PCS providers.

     Personal Communications Industry Assn. (PCIA) Vp Mark Golden
called FCC action "an important step for making a right that
existed in the rulebooks happen in the marketplace."  He applauded
Commission for "doing something fast and simple" rather than
following "a long, drawn-out process in search of the perfect." 
Comcast said action "may be the single biggest step the FCC has
taken so far to promote local telephone competition."

     Group of 4 Chinese organizations and 2 Singapore companies

     Group of 4 Chinese organizations and 2 Singapore companies
announced plans to create regional mobile satellite system called
Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications (APMT).  Backers of
$640-million project include China Satellite Launch & Tracking
Control, China Aerospace Corp., China Unicom, China
Telecommunications Bcst. Satellite, Singapore Telecom, Singapore
Technologies Telemedia.  APMT has requested proposals for 2
satellites and ground facilities.  First launch is planned for 1998
on Long March.  System will compete against Aces project backed by
consortium of Indonesian, Thai and Phillipine companies and
AfroAsia system backed by Indian concerns.  Aces has contract for
Lockheed Martin satellite, AfroAsia will deploy Hughes bird. 
Singapore Telecom withdrew from Aces project but still is part
owner, along with Hughes and others, of American Mobile Satellite. 
However, that doesn't necessarily mean Hughes has edge in
competition to get contract for APMT satellite, analyst Tim Logue
of Reid & Preist said.  "Hughes doesn't have a sweetheart deal," he
said.  Entry of 3rd regional MSS provider in Asia raises questions
about whether market will support that many systems.  Logue said: 
"It's remarkable that 3 geostationary satellite-based systems are
planned for launch by the end of the century for Asia.  There may
be market enough for all to prosper, but the question is -- what
market share does that leave for the Big LEOs?"  He said Big LEOs
have significant investment from region, which will host 6-way
fight for MSS business, "but it's a big continent."

     Ill. Circuit Court, Chicago, dismissed Health & Environmental

     Ill. Circuit Court, Chicago, dismissed Health & Environmental
Sciences Group (HES) and Dr. George Carlo as defendants in lawsuit
brought by Debbra Wright, who charged cellular telephone caused
brain cancer and who accused industry of conspiracy to conceal
evidence.  Judge Paddy McNamara said Wright case, originally filed
against Motorola, included substantial evidence but nothing linking
HES to conspiracy.  He's expected to issue written opinion this
month and rule in March on similar charges Wright filed against
Wireless Technology Research (WTR), which also is headed by Carlo
and set up by industry to study health effects of cellular phones. 
WTR said all allegations should be dismissed because "they are
based on the same key factual issues the judge has now resolved...
WTR believes that lawsuits such as the Wright case are wasteful
attacks on the scientific community, that they slow completion of
the research necessary to answer the public's questions about the
health effects of all wireless technology and that these tactics
could themselves pose threats to public health if they delay
implementation of any interventions that may prove necessary."

     Atlanta Trunking Assoc. filed request for waiver at FCC

     Atlanta Trunking Assoc. filed request for waiver at FCC
seeking to avoid substantial withdrawn-bid penalty in specialized
mobile radio auction (SMR) after intended $125,000 bid became
$125-million error.  Company said bid filed electronically carried
3 extra zeros.  In waiver request, it asked Commission to consider
size of company and nature of mistake in granting waiver.  Full
Commission will have to review request at end of auction, lawyer
Diane Law said.  Under FCC rules, company that withdraws bid is
liable for penalty based on difference between withdrawn offer and
eventual high bid at end of sale.  Company earlier bid $1,100 for
same license, designated P frequency block;  high bid before error
was about $100,000, submitted by FCI 900 -- which is Nextel. 
Atlanta Trunking resubmitted $125,000 bid in Round 10, FCC said. 
Efforts to contact company, part of Southland Corp. and SMR
operator at 900 MHz in Atlanta, were unsuccessful.  Meanwhile,
Commission said software used to report activity on 1,040 SMR
licenses has glitch preventing quick reporting and summarizing of
auction results on daily basis, and Round 12 and 13 results for
Dec. 20-21 were delayed.  Net revenue in Round 13 Dec. 21 increased
0.85% to $166,880,732 from 97 new bids.  On Dec. 20, total was 
$165.5 million, with 105 high bids and 112 eligible bidders.  In
final round of year, Paging Network offered $13.2 million for 87
licenses, including high bids of $925,000 in N.Y., $575,000 in L.A.
and Detroit, $545,000 in San Francisco.  Geotek had $10.8 million
in high bids on 179 licenses, and FCI 900 -- Nextel -- had $10.3
million on 222.  Auction resumes Fri.

AIRFONE FOUNDER JACK GOEKEN SEEKS FCC O.K.
FOR AIR-TO-GROUND PASSENGER DATA NETWORK

Sending facsimiles, receiving pages, checking stock quotations,
obtaining flight information, confirming rental car and hotel
reservations and playing computer games will be possible from your
airline seat if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approves
a new data network. In-Flight Phone Corp. (IFPC) in Oak Brook, Ill.
on December 14 filed a petition with the FCC to establish a
nationwide air-to-ground data network.

  In-Flight was established by Jack Goeken, the founder of Airfone,
which has installed passenger phones on thousands of airplanes.
Goeken also was one of the founders of MCI Communications Corp.

  The company has asked for a developmental/experimental license that
would be the forerunner of a commercial digital data-only service in
1990. IFPC plans to install a 6" x 4" LCD on the back of each seat,
above the drop-down tray. Buttons that are dedicated to specific data
applications would be positioned around the screen. Also, an RJ-11
jack would be installed next to the LCD.

  A small phone -- dramatically smaller than the current GTE Airfone
model -- would be attached on the side of each seat, says Dimitrios
Lalos, vice president of engineering at In-Flight. A raised
alphanumeric keypad and cursor keys would be included on the back of
the phone's handset. A PC to control the onboard network would be
installed on the aircraft.

  In its FCC filing, the company says six data services for
passengers will be test marketed:

  1. Stock quotations selected  by passengers from New York and
Chicago exchanges.

  2. Video games, where passengers use cursor keys on the telephone
handset to control the actions. To avoid complaints by passengers who
might be bothered by the sounds emanating from the games, users will
have to use headphones. The game chips probably would be stored in
In-Flight's onboard PC.

  3. Connecting flight information that might be displayed 30 minutes
before the plane lands.

  4. Radio paging for passengers who register with In-Flight via
their seat computer after boarding the plane. Passengers could
receive alphanumeric pages from callers using a toll-free telephone
number. IFPC would control the airborne paging operation; the company
hasn't discussed any tie-ins with existing national or local paging
companies.

  5. Obtaining airline information from the North American Official
Airline Guides.

  6. Miscellaneous services, such as catalogue shopping, accessing
databases with laptop computers and sending faxes. Initially, faxes
will only be outgoing, from an In-Flight fax machine on the aircraft
or through a passenger's own PC-based fax card.

  The company also sees a large demand for making or reconfirming
hotel and rental car reservations. The LCDs will include several
buttons that are dedicated to specific applications, including
reservations. Step-by-step instructions would be shown on the LCD.

  In addition to these third-party services, the airline crew could
use the system for transmitting messages to passengers. These
messages could include the traditional pre-flight safety spiels, the
choices of meals and beverages and, possibly, advertising.

  The prices for many of these applications haven't been set, but the
company is looking at about $2 per transaction, says Bob Rubens, vice
president of airline relations at IFPC. For example, $2 would be
charged for confirming or reconfirming hotel or rental car
reservations. Receiving radio pages during the flight might be
cheaper, perhaps $2 for an unlimited number of messages, says Rubens.
Additional charges might be assessed for priority service to skip
ahead of the queue.

  The first network would operate with frequency shift keying at
1,200 bits/second, upgrading in 1991 to 9,600 bits/second, says
Lalos. In-Flight's proposal calls for building 25 ground stations
near major airports and 17 at other locations in the United States.
All the stations would be near GTE Airfone base stations.

  IFPC has requested the use of one subchannel from each of ten
channels used by Airfone under Airfone's experimental license. The
channels would be in 849/850 MHz and 894/895 MHz. Each of the 800 MHz
channels is divided into 31 subchannels, but the first subchannel is
not now used by Airfone, Lalos says.

  Every subchannel pair would be 6 KHz incoming and 6 KHz outgoing --
for a total of 120 KHz. Airfone has been allocated a total of 4 MHz
for its phone service.

  In-Flight is requesting this relatively small bandwidth allocation
because it wants to get up and running as quickly as possible; by
using Airfone's existing network, it can do so. IFPC is concerned
that other companies could beat it to the punch with services to keep
passengers entertained.

  Methods of providing in-flight movies, games and information
services have been under development for several years by such
companies as Avicom International, Air Vision and Transcom. They've
all explored tie-ins with air-to-ground telephone service.

  (Mobile Data Report's first issue in September 1988 featured an
item on Air Video, a Toronto firm developing an "Entray" computerized
game screen.) In-Flight has discussed the possibility of joint
ventures with these firms.

  "This revolution in the in-flight aircraft environment cannot be
realized, however, without the development of an ATG [air-to-ground]
network which can provide the data communications necessary to
support new services sought by the airline industry," says IFPC's FCC
petition.

  Although In-Flight has asked the FCC to use Airfone's frequencies,
Goeken really prefers to obtain his own channels. After five years of
service, Airfone's allocation is still considered developmental. The
FCC is expected to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in February
or March that would provide a permanent allocation.

  The possibilities include: giving the entire 4 MHz to Airfone,
allocating 2 MHz to Airfone and 2 MHz to another licensee or allowing
several companies to share the 4 MHz. Obviously, Airfone would prefer
to receive the entire allocation. In-Flight also wants a piece of the
spectrum for voice service.

  In August, IFPC filed comments at the FCC for an air-to-ground
service that would use 2 MHz. The comments replied to a Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking issued by the Commission. IFPC is also talking up
the sharing option, where possibly more than two companies would
offer service on 4 MHz.

  In addition, In-Flight is considering the possibility of offering
its services via an existing satellite vendor, says Rubens. He
declines to name the vendor, but Inmarsat's satellite network could
probably transmit the data.

                              *********

                   Goeken's Travails With Airfone

  For years, Jack Goeken has been talking publicly and privately
about offering data and other value-added services over Airfone. When
he was at the helm, Airfone had conducted a few experiments with
transmitting data. The company used modems to transmit electronic
mail and electrocardiographs. A few years ago, Goeken had announced
that the "next generation" of Airfone telephones would include an RJ-
11 jack.

  However, GTE decided not to provide a computer connection. In fact,
it decided not to offer a variety of services that Goeken had wanted.
In February 1989, he resigned from the company and filed a breech of
contract suit against Airfone, seeking release from the non-compete
clause of his contract.

  The DuPage County [Ill.] Circuit Court ruled in favor of Goeken,
stating that GTE Corp. and GTE Airfone had "committed numerous
material breeches of the stock purchase agreement." As a result,
Goeken is free from all of the stipulations in his contract and is
legally able to establish a competitive air-to-ground network.

  GTE Airfone is working on reply comments for the Federal
Communications Commission on In-Flight Phone Corp.'s data network
and, therefore, won't discuss Goeken's plans. However, "we definitely
see that there is a demand out there [for air-to-ground data
services] and we're cognizant of that fact," says Kevin Petschow, a
public relations spokesperson for Airfone.

  What type of data services would Airfone offer? "We're still in the
early stage of figuring that out," Petschow says.

HUGHES AIRCRAFT ENTERS MOBILE DATA MARKET
AS SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR FOR RUGGEDIZED USES

  A familiar name in the military hardware market is entering the
mobile data industry as a systems integrator. Hughes Aircraft in
Carlsbad, Calif. is developing a line of "portable information
equipment" for military and commercial applications that generally
require rugged products and relatively fast data rates.

  The new venture is under the aegis of Hughes' industrial products
division and will capitalize on the company's expertise in building
cathode ray tubes and other types of displays, test equipment and a
variety of electronic gear.

  As part of its entry into mobile data, Hughes obtained the
exclusive worldwide rights to develop military and heavy-duty
commercial products using Reflection Technology's Private Eye display
(see Mobile Data Report, September 11, 1989).

  Private Eye allows users to view a 12-inch image floating in front
of one eye while looking through a tiny display with the other eye.
The display, which features red characters on a black background, is
contained in a 1" x 1" x 3" device that can be held up to the eye or
attached to headsets, eye glasses, etc.

  Reflection Technology sees its product as supplementing or
replacing a variety of displays or hard copy output, such as pager
LCDs, laptop computer screens and paper printouts from facsimile
machines.

  By wearing the device attached to a headset, doctors could see
readouts from medical monitors or scanned images, stockbrokers could
watch especially important real-time data without having to look at a
specific CRT and military field commanders could scan computer
projections and maps while watching the battlefield action.

  Eliminating traditional displays or paper output would
significantly reduce the size and weight of computer devices while
increasing the battery life, says Jim Bradley, assistant division
manager of Hughes' industrial products division. Bradley is program
manager for the company's portable information equipment venture.
Private Eye offers a "unique way" of displaying images with a
satisfactory resolution in a small package and with low power
requirements, he says.

  However, Hughes won't "fall in love" with any display; it will use
whatever is appropriate, Bradley says. Another appropriate technology
for certain mobile data is computer voice recognition. By building a
device that recognizes voice commands, the keyboard could be
eliminated. This further decreases size and weight.

  These advances in display and voice recognition technologies will
produce new types of products that will create new markets for which
today's heavier computers are now unacceptable, he says.

  Although the military is an obvious market for portable data
devices, "we know it takes ten to 12 years to get anything into the
field," he says. There's good and bad news for companies that want to
sell this type of equipment to the military. On one hand, funding for
new projects is less than in previous years. On the other hand, the
Department of Defense (DOD) is placing increasing emphasis on
computer-aided maintenance and logistics.

  For both military and commercial use, Hughes sees a significant
market for "portable maintenance manuals," ranging in size from
products that can hang on a belt to more sophisticated handhelds.
With radio frequency links, maintenance personnel can access host
computer databases. Indeed, some DOD people have been describing the
maintenance manual of the future as a laptop computer that you carry
around, says Bradley.

  Agilis Corp. in Mountain View, Calif. has been talking about this
application since the company was founded. Agilis' rugged mobile
computer is the type of product that Hughes has evaluated. Neither
Hughes nor Agilis will comment on the potential of a formal
relationship.

  However, if Hughes wants products that can be attached to a belt,
Agilis would have to develop smaller products. Interestingly, Roger
Higgins, vice president of marketing at Agilis, has been speculating
(just humorously?) about "computers that you wear."

  Hughes isn't an expert in commercial RF networks; "we're a hardware
manufacturer," Bradley says. He's is especially interested in spread
spectrum transmission because it doesn't require a license from the
Federal Communications Commission. Agilis and Telesystems SLW in Don
Mills, Ontario are among the companies with spread spectrum products
for mobile local area networks.

IBM MIGHT DEBUT TERMINAL IN FIRST QUARTER
FOR HIGHER-END TERRESTRIAL, SATELLITE DATA

  IBM, which has been working on a mobile data system for
Consolidated Freightways, will publicly announce its new mobile data
computers sometime during the first quarter of this year, says John
Pemberton, program director for mobile technologies at the Gartner
Group, Inc. in Stamford, Conn. In an online alert to his clients,
Pemberton says Geostar Corp. might be the first customer for IBM's
vehicular PCs, which would supplement Sony Corp.'s satellite
receivers.

  An article in the January 3 issue of The Wall Street Journal
reported that IBM's product is likely to replace Sony's receiver.
That was a misquote, says Pemberton. IBM's computer will be targeted
at customers who want a more powerful machine, he says. (Of course,
IBM is known for developing numerous products in its laboratories
that are never commercially marketed or are sold only to a limited
number of customers.)

  Sony is "definitely in the [mobile satellite terminal] business for
the long haul," says Shelley Donlon, marketing administrator at Sony
in Park Ridge, N.J. The company will continue to develop terminals
for Geostar, though it has no plans to produce units for other
satellite vendors, she says. Sony won't comment on IBM developments.

  Before releasing his predictions, Pemberton didn't receive any
direct confirmation from IBM, he tells Mobile Data Report. That's
certainly not unusual, since IBM rarely says anything about products
before they are announced. What was somewhat unusual to Pemberton,
though, was that sources at the computer giant not only didn't refute
his claims but seemed to have encouraged him to publish them, he
says.

  Pemberton says he was spurred to make the announcement
some of his clients who were briefed by IBM about the product. For
example, IBM contacted a delivery company with more than 50,000
vehicles that might participate in a pilot program. Several companies
contacted by Mobile Data Report said IBM had asked them to visit Boca
Raton, Fla. where the developmental work is being conducted.

  It's no secret -- though the parties involved have treated it as
one -- that IBM has been developing a mobile computer for
Consolidated (see Mobile Data Report, September 11, 1989). Some 100
vehicles in Cincinnati are testing the system, which includes
dispatching and vehicle location. For Consolidated, Etak is
developing a positioning system based on map matching and Loran-C.

  IBM's mobile units supposedly will work with satellite positioning
networks and terrestrial systems. The computers probably will be
compatible with specialized mobile radio networks, such as Motorola's
Coverage Plus data system, Pemberton says. Coverage Plus was
announced last year -- possibly to counter the publicity over Ram
Mobile Data's 50-city Mobitex network -- but will not be available
until later this year.

  Pemberton says today's 20,000 mobile data terminals have created a
market of $50 million. By 1995, two million mobile satellite
terminals worth $4.15 billion might be sold. IBM could realize more
than $1 billion from the sale of terminals, he says. The computer
firm's entry into the market would bring the benefits of its Systems
Application Architecture and electronic data interchange into the
mobile environment, says Pemberton.

  Other mobile data companies -- such as Motorola, Electrocom
Automation and Kustom Electronics -- promote their compatibility with
IBM systems. But IBM's ability to provide a total host computer-to-
mobile workstation solution, integrating software and hardware, would
be a powerful incentive for existing IBM shops to choose Big Blue's
mobile PC. The majority of traditional mobile data customers, in
trucking, delivery, public safety and field service, use IBM
products.

  Also, if sources are correct, IBM's product will be sort of a
downsized PS/2. Though Motorola and Electrocom provide the ability
for portable PCs to access their proprietary mobile data systems,
they do not offer a DOS machine. Only Agilis now markets DOS-
compatible mobile computers. Agilis' product is a portable that can
be mounted in a vehicle; IBM's computer is expected to be a vehicular
unit, not a portable.

SUCCESSFUL BETA TESTING REQUIRES CAREFUL
PLANNING, INTEGRATION FOR TRUCKING FIRM

  The key to developing a worthwhile test of a satellite messaging
and location network is to quickly integrate it into a company's
existing computer dispatching system -- not to use just one
standalone PC. That's the view of Tom Burns, senior director of
quality, at Midwest Coast Transport (MCT), which is testing
Transtrack's meteor burst network (see Mobile Data Report, November
15, 1989).

  In June 1989, the Sioux Falls, S.D. trucking company tested a
mobile satellite network. It was either Qualcomm or Geostar, but
Burns declines to identify the company. Equipment was installed in
eight of MCT's 600 vehicles. The host software was installed on a PC
which wasn't interconnected to MCT's computer dispatching system.

  As a result, dispatchers had to leave their seats to use the PC,
which would display the trucks with the satellite equipment.

  "Unfortunately, it just sat in a corner....No one ever used it,"
Burns says. The trucking company employs about 20 dispatchers during
peak times and they were just too busy to spend much time at the PC's
keyboard. However, the standalone PC method might work better at
smaller firms, where the dispatchers aren't as busy, he says.

  This time, Midwest aims to conduct a much better trial and is
"doing a lot of upfront work" to determine how to implement the test.
Most importantly, Transtrack's communications/messaging software will
be integrated into the IBM 38 computer terminals that are used by MCT
dispatchers. A dedicated PC will be needed, but only as a link
between the IBM 38 and Transtrack -- not as a dispatch terminal.

  Also, all of Midwest's dispatchers will be taught how to use the
system. During the previous test, only a few dispatchers were
trained.

  To accommodate Midwest and other customers, Transtrack is modifying
its network to provide real-time transmission of messages from
vehicles to dispatchers. Currently, customers' host computers have to
dial Transtrack's networked 80386-based PCs to obtain messages.
"That's one of the things that I do not want," he says. Receiving
messages quickly is important to Burns, but the modifications are
behind schedule.

  In general, though, he's pleased with Transtrack's service and
responsiveness. "They're very customer oriented....They are very nice
to work with," he says. He's also pleased with the company's pricing,
which is significantly less than Geostar's or Qualcomm's.

  Transtrack's onboard equipment will cost some $2,500 less than
satellite messaging and vehicle location systems, says Burns.
Transtrack charges about $2,000 for its onboard terminal, $30/month
for system access and six vehicle location updates an hour, $.10 for
short, pre-programmed status messages and $.02 per character for free
form text, says Jim Feeney, president at Transtrack. On average,
customers pay $45/month for airtime.

  Dispatching over any RF network is "going to cut down on our phone
bill tremendously" because drivers won't have to use a payphone to
contact the office, Burns says. Monthly telephone bills of $30,000-
$35,000 are not uncommon.

  MCT also expects the system will let its truck drivers get more
sleep. Today, drivers can put in a full day's work and have to stay
awake late at night until notified when another load is available.
With Transtrack, the driver could sleep in the cab until he is
notified. Burns has suggested to Transtrack that it increase the
sound level of its alarm. With an idling engine and a snoring driver,
the present alarm isn't loud enough, he says.

  Other companies scheduled to test the network include the Denny's
restaurant chain and USX, a delivery service. Transtrack's primary
competitor in providing lower cost location and messaging services is
Pegasus Message Corp. in Herndon, Va. Like Transtrack, Pegasus'
network is based upon meteor burst transmission.

INTERCONNECTING DIFFERENT TERMINALS, LAPTOPS
TO STANDARD COMPUTER PROTOCOLS TO MARK '90S

  Maps and specialized databases on CD-ROMs, faster cellular modems
and new SMR hardware and software are some of the developments just
introduced or expected in the early 1990s.

  Predicting certain mobile data trends is not difficult. Customers
generally want to integrate their existing host-computer software
into any mobile network. Also, existing and potential users are
increasingly interested in taking advantage of the power of laptop
computers for mobile applications. And, the network operators and
manufacturers are going to give them much -- if not all -- of what
they want.

  From the presentations of speakers at Waters Information Services'
"Connectivity in Mobile Data Networks" conference -- representing
many of the industry's leading-edge network operators and hardware
vendors --  it was obvious that compatibility with existing software
and computer protocols are major goals. At the conference in
Washington, D.C., even Motorola emphasized its desire to allow any
terminal -- dedicated or laptop -- to access its Data Radio Networks.

  Compatibility with IBM mini and mainframe architectures, local area
network architectures and the Open System Interface platform is being
pursued vigorously. Yet no single mobile data standard is likely to
emerge for the foreseeable future. For example, companies that are
well known for landline computer products, such as modem
manufacturers, are introducing their own error correcting standards
into the mobile arena.

  Few, if any, mobile data technologies during the next couple of
years will be appropriate or inexpensive enough for the mass market.
However, the introduction of lower cost vehicle navigation products
as part of a driver information system installed in higher-end
automobiles will generate consumer awareness in the early to mid
1990s.

                                Etak

  The president of Murdoch Magazines, which owns the map making firm
of Etak, knows "instinctively" that drivers will want more travel-
related information in the 1990s. "I don't believe you can research
these things," says John Evans, president at Murdoch. In the 1990s,
perhaps in 1992, at least one automobile manufacturer will begin
offering driver information systems that contain databases on CD-
ROMs, says Evans.

  Evans declines to discuss which company will offer such a system,
but General Motors is Etak's exclusive licensee in the United States
for providing equipment to the automobile marketplace. G.M., along
with virtually every other major automaker, has been working on cars-
of-the-future containing cellular phones, facsimile machines,
navigational systems and a host of computer-related add-ons.

  Using Etak's digitized maps and map software, companies will begin
offering databases on CD-ROMs, including the location of and
information on hotels, restaurants, gasoline stations, tourist
attractions and do-it-yourself tours catering to specialized
interests. The data will be displayed on either stand-alone CRTs or
built-in monitors. The success of his vision is dependent upon the
commercial introduction and acceptance of computer displays in
vehicles.

  He envisions motorists being able to obtain subscriptions to a type
of CD-ROM-of-the-Month-Club. Advertiser sponsorship of CD-ROMs will
be vital to generate revenues to sustain this market's growth, Evans
says.

  As a subsidiary of one of the largest publishing firms in the
world, Murdoch Magazines has a great deal of experience in selling
newspaper and magazine advertising, he says. The publishing firm owns
five automotive magazines in the United States and Europe, which
could be used to promote a vehicle location/CD-ROM system.

                               Modems

  "We think having a higher speed modem is very critical to the
success of the mobile office," says John Fox, senior program manager
at Telebit, Inc. in Oak Brook, Ill. With Telebit's Cellblazer modem,
the company wants to create entirely new markets and "revolutionize
the way business is done," says Fox.

  Telebit sees the market for Cellblazer for such applications as:
on-site insurance adjustment, for faster settlement of claims; field
sales, for faster processing of orders and for verifying
availability; field maintenance, for accessing mainframe databases;
government use, for Internal Revenue Service agents to access records
and for security agents to check photographic I.D.; and for
establishing temporary office communications.

  The Waters conference was the first public introduction of
Telebit's modem (see Mobile Data Report, December 4, 1989). In
November, Microcom had announced its MNP 10 modem that was designed
for "adverse environments," such as cellular (see Mobile Data Report,
November 20, 1989).

                        Electrocom Automation

  A new marketing strategy for penetrating the Specialized Mobile
Radio (SMR) industry is under development at Electrocom Automation in
Arlington, Texas. More than a year ago, the company unveiled a
generic dispatching package for E.F. Johnson SMRs that would use
Johnson's modems in conjunction with Electrocom's software and mobile
data terminals.

  But a massive reorganization at Electrocom resulted in layoffs,
including the person charged with selling the SMR system. This has
placed the program on hold. However, Electrocom has just completed a
major survey of the SMR industry and will be rolling out a new
marketing strategy in 1990, says Roy C. Emory, a senior staff
engineer at Electrocom.

  Rather than offering a generic dispatching package for all
potential users, the Texas company is developing a targeted approach
that will focus on individual niche markets. Products will have to be
"cheap," says Emory. A customer who pays $1,000 for his radio doesn't
want to pay more than that for a mobile data terminal, he says.

  * Modems Plus, Inc. in Atlanta has sold its first mobile data
system, Commrad, to the Duke Power Company in North Carolina, says H.
Thomas Thorsen, president at Modems Plus. The Atlanta firm offers an
80386-based network controller/protocol converter that allows
vehicular terminals to access IBM systems running 3270 SNA/SDLC. The
system uses Dataradio's packet modems to support transmission rates
of up to 9,600 bits/second.

  Duke Power has been testing Commrad since September 1989. Service
technicians can remotely access customer accounts and enter work
orders. By August 1990, 60 terminals will be installed for Duke
Power's field service force, Thorsen says.

  * American Mobile Satellite Corp. and Telesat Mobile will award a
contract for their satellites this month, says David Castiel, vice
president of marketing and business development at AMSC in
Washington, D.C.

  * Within two years, the shared-used data network of Mobidata in
Canada could be transmitting at 19,200 bits/second. Mobidata, which
is owned by BCE Mobile Communications and Motorola, now transmits at
4,800 bits/second.

  * Racotek is likely to unveil its completed Specialized Mobile
Radio data network software sometime during this quarter, says Dr.
Isaac Shpancer, director of research at the Minnesota company.
Racotek is adapting by the Open System Interface model for SMR
networks. Later this year, the company is also expected to offer a

  Qualcomm, Inc. in San Diego will replace Loran-C with its own
proprietary location technology by the end of the first quarterof
1990. QASPR -- Qualcomm Automatic Satellite Position Reporting --
involves triangulation with existing Ku-band satellites and ground
stations (which are regular Omnitracs receivers), says Tom Bernard,
vice president and general manager at the California firm.

  QASPR's accuracy will be one third of a mile in virtually all areas
of the country, he says. This compares with Loran-C, which ranges in
accuracy from one tenth of a mile to several miles. The increased
accuracy will be important mostly to truck companies carrying
hazardous materials. Qualcomm developed the system primarily for
overseas use, in Europe, Japan and Australia, where Loran-C is not
available, Bernard says.

BUSINESS
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Singapore Telecom MobileLink has launched its PCN
service after a US$48m investment in hardware from
Northern Telecom. The service is being marketed
alongside all existing cellular services in operation
with pricing pitched towards the private user. The
installation process has not been that easy.
According to Pascal Debon, VP and general manager of
Nortel GSM Wireless Networks: "In Singapore, Nortel
had to face geographical and technical challenges due
to a very high population density, high-rise
buildings and expressways tunnels.  Specific
equipment has been successfully developed to adapt to
this particularly complex environment and to optimize
the indoor coverage." A number of PCN roaming
agreements are being planned as PCN service rolls
out.

Northern Telecom has revealed that it has advanced
the launch dates of expansion for a Taiwanese GSM
cellular network, bringing it up to five months ahead
of schedule due to tremendous user demand. In
September 1994 the Long Distance Telecommunications
Administration awarded a US$100m supply contract to
Nortel for a GSM digital cellular system in Taiwan
and the network has been operational in phases with
160,000 users online by the end of October with
10,000 new subscribers signing up for service each

Vodac Ltd, the Vodafone Group Plc cellular service

to corporate customers including the provision of
cellular telephony bills on computer disk through the
so-called Call Manager software package.  Customers
have to pay GBP25 per month to receive accounts on

authority card' which allows corporate customers to
receive a repair service from any Vodac Service
Centre throughout the UK and the account can be
settled directly with Vodac. In the new year Vodafone
plans to emulate the 24-hour repair/replacement
scheme first pioneered by Hutchison Telecom/Orange
which will allow customers to get prompt replacement
for faulty cellular equipment, although details are
presently not known.

MOBILE MATTERS-AUSTRIAN GSM CELLULAR LICENCE AWARDED
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

The Austrian government has awarded the first
competitive GSM cellular licence to a consortium
backed by Siemens and Deutsche Telekom known as Oe-Call.  
Oe-Call bid US$397m for the licence -- the
highest of the five applicants.  Viktor Klima,
transport minister for the Austrian government, said
that the competing service was forecast to bring down
prices by as much as 30%. Some competing consortia
said that the bid was unfair as Siemens was an
important equipment supplier to the Austrian Post
Office -- operators of the other GSM service.  An
appeal is permitted under Austrian law although to
date no company has said that it intends to take
advantage of this option.

Orange Personal Communications Services Ltd in the UK
has given a pledge to the Office of Fair Trading
stating that it will not breach the Resale Prices
Act. The OFT previously launched an investigation
after receiving numerous complaints from dealers who
said that Orange was attempting to impose minimum
resale prices on mobile phone handsets. Under the
Resale Prices Act 1976, it is unlawful for a supplier
of goods to make it a condition of supply that its
goods will not be sold below a specified price. Many
dealers had experienced sudden problems getting new
stock once they had sold phones at a price other than
Orange's recommended price.

Peoples Phone, a large UK independent cellular

Charles Wigoder a multi-millionaire in the process.
Analysts expect the company to be valued at around
GBP200m although Peoples Phone was not exactly a
rags-to-riches affair for the 35-year-old son of
Liberal peer Lord Wigoder.  The company has rapidly
expanded since its formation in 1988 to a company
turning over GBP118.5m in 1994 through its 175
brightly-decorated retail outlets -- capturing a 7%
stake of the UK market.

MOBILE MATTERS-TEXAN PAGING FIRMS HIT OUT AT LOCAL
TAXATION
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Paging companies in Texas, USA are angry about a new
taxation plan which will, according to them, provide
an unfair burden on their businesses when compared to
other sectors. A tax has been introduced to create a
US$150m fund which will help schools and hospitals
purchase equipment to connect up the information
superhighway, with half of the funding coming from an
assessment on local telephone companies, the other
half from the wireless industry, comprising mainly of
cellular and paging businesses. The wireless industry
contends that they are a smaller business with annual
revenues of around US$1.5bn compared to the wireline
businesses which generate around US$8bn annually.
Administratively, this is causing some problems for
local authority officials as the telecommunications
levy has to raise a fixed amount of money from an
indeterminate number of companies with unpredictable
revenue.  A number of workaround solutions are under
consideration.

According to the UK government's Radiocommunications
Agency, the new Short Range Business Radio service
(SRBR) is set to be introduced in early 1996 which
will allow parties to use their own equipment with a
range of up to 400m without restrictions on
portability or location. The Agency believes that the
SRBR will be of particular use to small businesses
who will be able to take advantages of speech and
paging services on a localised site basis. A licence
costing GBP30 will be required covering a three year
period, although in reality observers suggest that
enforcement will be difficult. Frequencies for SRBR
will be: 461.2625MHz, 461.4750MHz and 461.4875MHz,
for the speech service and 49.2625MHz, 49.2875MHz and
461.3000MHz for the paging service.

PHILIPS COMMUNICATIONS says that its RBS918
GSM/DCS1800 radio base stations recently helped deal
with the world's busiest GSM network, located at the
Telecom  95 exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland. Four
out of the five base stations which covered the
Palexpo site were from Philips and they managed the
highest traffic load ever measured in a GSM network
and successfully mastered a peak traffic load of
about 360,000 calls per day.  Philips said that the
service problem was exacerbated because there were
only a limited number of frequencies available for
GSM as part of the spectrum is still used by the
analogue NMT900 system, that interference to both
French GSM networks had to be considered and that the
large surface of Lake Geneva causes difficult
propagation conditions. Load of the radio channels
reached up to 99.9% frequently throughout the event.

is being gathered with a view of lodging a formal

MOBILE MATTERS-ORANGE CHANGES DISTRIBUTION POLICY TO
CHAGRIN OF RETAILERS
COPYRIGHT 1995-6 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Hutchison Orange, operators of a UK PCN service, has
changed the way they distribute products to the
channel, much to the chagrin of retailers.  A range
of new and existing handsets are now being made
available to dealers at full trade prices with
commission paid upon connection.  When Orange first
launched it sold units at net prices to dealers who
then sold on mark-up. The company claimed that it was
breathing a breath of fresh air into the cellular
marketplace although it denies that it has made a
sudden about turn.   Orange dealers will also be able
to earn extra commission by signing up customers to
higher price plans, based on marketing support
programmes and gimmicky offers.  "Orange if convinced
these proposals will ensure the competitiveness of
the trade proposition for 1996, building on the
excellent results seen since the launch of Orange,"
claimed Gareth Jones, group director of sales.

Several cellular service providers are clamping down
on their customers mobile phone usage in a bid to cut
fraud.  One network reseller has already placed a
ceiling of GBP50-worth of calls without a deposit
being paid and large deposits are being demanded off
GSM digital cellular users who wish to take full

Cellphones Direct, a UK service provider who resells

against it upheld where it offered a free pocket
colour TV on the purchase of a mobile phone.  The
complainant stated that the offer was only valid for
a select number of phones and not the entire range as
implied and noted that the offer was only being
offered for analogue handsets and not the digital

mobile phones and not all tariffs with the exclusions
listed in footnotes.  The ASA said that the adverts
should have been more clearly stated to avoid
confusion and requested that greater care be taken in
the future. HUTCHISON ORANGE was censured following a
direct mail shot which offered trade-ins through a

INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES REFLECT ON 1995, LOOK AHEAD TO 1996

     More than a decade ago, a revolutionary service in communications
was born:  cellular.  The cellular industry has come a long way,
changing and growing along the way.  And as 1996 begins, many are
reflecting on the impact 1995 has had on the industry and what the new
year may hold for cellular--domestically, internationally and
technologically.  Several issues raised in 1995 will continue to
affect the industry in 1996.  Instead of rehashing bygone issues of
MPN, we will let a few industry insiders reflect on 1995 and what the
new year has in store for the wireless industry.

  ...From a National Brand Point of View

     "The lesson we learned [in 1995] was the same we have learned--
and learned from--the past 11 years:  Start with your customers," said
Cellular One Group Executive Director Richard Lyons.
     "Looking forward, the new year holds one promise:  exciting
change.  The telecommunications industry will continue its
metamorphosis--the evolution of the telecommunications revolution. 
From the brand perspective, such as Cellular One's, that means that
even in the presence of the immense amount of change that drives the
industry, the key challenge will be to not lose touch with our current
customers and to anticipate the needs of our potential subscribers.
     "In looking at the issues facing the cellular industry as the new
year begins, one stands out:  the need for the cellular industry to
solidify and expand its positioning in the larger telecommunications
marketplace.  This is a direct result of the increased competition
that will occur from the introduction of new wireless technologies,
such as PCS, as well as the entrance of new players into the wireless
industry.  In 1996, the competition could become even more fierce when
Congress passes the telecommunications bill.  Consequently, in 1996,
Cellular One will look at broadening its product and service
offerings.
     "This increase in competition has made the strength of a brand
name more important than ever before.  Consumers have strong brand
preferences and make purchasing decisions daily based on the strength
of a brand name."

  ...From a Resale Point of View

     National Wireless Resellers Association Executive Director David
Gusky predicts resellers will profit in 1996 if 1995 is any
indication.  "[Last year] was a good year for wireless resale in that
more and more companies seeking to enter the wireless marketplace saw
resale as a legitimate means of market entry.
"Nineteen ninety-six should see this trend continue, especially when
you consider the changes in store for the industry.  As an increasing
number of PCS carriers, both broadband and narrowband, open for
business, creating greater competition and network capacity, the stage
will be set for a real boon in wireless resale. Competition will drive
down prices and shrink profit margins, meaning carriers will be
looking for efficient, low-cost distribution channels.  This
situation, together with the excess network capacity that is bound to
occur as PCS carriers build out their systems to comply with FCC
timetables, will prompt carriers to turn to resellers in increasing
numbers to distribute their products and services.  Resale today
accounts for just 3 percent of total revenues in the cellular
marketplace.  When you consider that long-distance resellers account
for 10 percent of their industry's revenues, or more than three times
the market share of their wireless counterparts, and that the wireless
industry will soon take on characteristics of the long-distance
industry in terms of competition and network capacity, we expect good
things to happen in wireless resale in 1996 and for a good many years
to come."

  ...From a Software Solutions Point of View

     Eric Johnson, president and CEO of Coral Systems Inc., had this
to say about the year ahead.  "We will see in the United States, the
emergence of competition into the whole wireless industry.  In the
past, we had the luxury of being able to focus on subscriber
acquisition in a duopoly environment. ...  [In 1996], we will see a
whole different tier of users ..., which will change the way the
wireless industry does business. ...  We're not just cellular anymore. 
We're a wireless industry comprised of many different standards. 
[Nineteen ninety five tells us that] wireless carriers need to focus
on customers."
     Internationally, global system for mobile communications (GSM)
operators are going through the same problems analog carriers in the
United States went through in the early stages of cellular, he said. 
But they are "close to having the majority of them solved.  I think we
will see a dramatic increase in GSM in 1996.  We'll see similar things
with CDMA [code division multiple access].
     "I'd like to say we'll have a resolution between the standards,
but there will probably be a further entrenchment [of differences]. 
Ericsson will be very aggressive in promoting time division multiple
access (TDMA) and GSM.  Competition among infrastructure providers
will increase.  We may see those who have announced what standard they
are going with, reversing [their choices]."
     He said it is unlikely dual-mode phones will pair CDMA, GSM and
TDMA, but rather each of those standards will be paired with analog. 
"Analog will emerge as the common unifier amongst [all the digital
standards]."
     Reflecting on trends that emerged in 1995, Johnson said, "I think
that there has been an enormous increase in fraud awareness."  He
described it as one
of those problems that has always been around, but now that
competition is
becoming more serious, carriers are paying more attention to the
issue.  Also, he said 1995 saw widespread acceptance of selecting a
fraud strategy or platform.  A platform of different fraud solutions
allows carriers to put unrelenting pressure on criminals, which is the
most effective strategy.
     Another trend to emerge in 1995 was the formation of national
alliances.  PCS PrimeCo L.P. Johnson said is a significant example
because it shows how the industry has "reached a phase where your
enemies become your friends."
     What does 1996 hold for Coral Systems?  "We will be announcing
some large strategic relationships early this year that show our
strategic vision, which is basically to give carriers the tools they
need to manage their businesses."

  ...From a Domestic Services Point of View

     In looking at 1995 and the future, Comcast Cellular
Communications Inc. President Don Harris reflected on the industry's
beginnings.  "When the industry first got started, cellular--although
a tremendous advancement in and of itself--was fairly primitive by
today's standards.  Phones were bulky and very expensive.  There was
no such thing as value-added features and services, and carriers
offered relatively few choices for customers.  Today, cellular has
become an incredibly sophisticated industry, offering customers a
dazzling array of equipment and feature options, and more choices than
ever before. ...  With 30 million subscribers and more than 10 percent
national penetration, [the cellular industry] is a classic American
success story."
     "Now, there are as many descriptions of what this wireless future
will look like as there are pundits who observe this industry.  From
our perspective, though, the future is all about being able to respond
to virtually every customer segment with wireless solutions that
enhance productivity and make people's lives easier and more
convenient," Harris said.  "We are emerging as a single-source
provider of wired, wireless and [TV] program content to customers here
in the United States and around the world."

  ...From an International Services Point of View

     According to AirTouch International President and CEO Arun Sarin,
highlights of 1995 included the launch of AirTouch cellular service in
Italy, Spain and India, expansion of its presence in Japan through
several joint ventures, opening of a European headquarters and in the
third quarter of 1995, growth of its international subscriber base by
130 percent compared with the third quarter of 1994.  Looking ahead to
1996, Sarin said he expects AirTouch to bid for licenses in Poland,
the Czech Republic, Brazil, Taiwan and possibly China.  Also, he
expects AirTouch to increase profitability of its operations in Asia
and Europe as well as launch services in South Korea, India and Japan.

  ...From a Technology Point of View

     TDMA Forum Project Manager John McQueen says TDMA is still the
best kept secret in digital cellular.  The Forum grew from 14 to 44
members in 1995 without any formal promotion, McQueen said.  "We have
built the most thorough protocol conformance specification, software
and test procedures to ensure full operability and functionality of
IS-136 mobiles."
     Also in 1995, the Forum uncovered and solved a major analog
compatibility problem that would have kept almost 4 million analog
phones from working on digital networks, and it began discussions on
merging IS-136 and GSM standards.  In 1996, the forum plans major IS-
136 deployments in the first quarter, and will launch an Internet web
site, sign up new members and improve TDMA functionality.

FCC PROPOSES `BILL AND KEEP' FOR CMRS-LEC CONNECTIONS

     To speed competition in both the wireless and local exchange
service markets, the FCC proposed at its December meeting an interim
"bill-and-keep" compensation plan for interconnection of commercial
mobile radio service (CMRS) and local exchange carrier (LEC) networks. 
In initiating CC Docket No. 95-185, the commission also tentatively
concluded that information about CMRS-LEC interconnection arrangements
should be made public, and it is seeking comments on whether to
require tariffs, public disclosure reports or some other alternative
to private contracts.
     For CMRS-LEC interconnection through dedicated transmission
facilities, the commission proposed a compensation plan based on
existing flat-rate access charges for similar facilities.  The FCC
further proposed that CMRS providers be allowed to recover access
charges from interexchange carriers in the same manner the LECs do. 
     Telcos generally have opposed bill-and-keep compensation for
interconnection with any type of competitor--wireline or wireless. 
Under a bill-and-keep system, each service provider terminates the
other carrier's traffic without imposing an interconnection charge. 
The LECs contend that they will be terminating significantly more
outside carrier calls than will other carriers.  
     Commissioners wanted to hear about other types of compensation
plans, but they generally seemed convinced that bill-and-keep was the
best interim choice because of its ease in administration and the
relatively small market share of wireless competitors.  Chairman Reed
Hundt said those proposing another compensation method should "think
hard about the economics and relative market powers of incumbents that
control wireline networks."
     The notice also seeks views on the FCC's jurisdiction in setting
interconnection polices affecting intrastate terminating traffic.

Industry Responds To FCC Proposal

     Soon after the FCC announced its bill-and-keep proposal, Comcast
Corp. President Brian Roberts released a statement applauding the FCC
for its actions.  "[The proposal] may be the single biggest step the
FCC has taken so far to promote local telephone competition," he said. 
"This proposal could make wireless an economically viable way to
compete for all customers."
     Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association President Thomas
Wheeler also released a statement favoring the proposal.  "The wire-
less industry commends the FCC for its action today, which will lead
to greater competition in the local telephone market and lower charges
to customers. ...  In 1994, wireless customers paid LECs more than
$800 million to terminate their calls.  Such a fee can only act to
impede development of wireless as a competitive local exchange ser-
vice.  Reciprocal Termination is the solution to this anti-competitive
inequity, as the FCC has wisely proposed."

FCC Simplifies Radio License Application

     At a brown bag luncheon in December, FCC Wireless
Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) Chief Michele Farquhar said she has
approved a simplified, one-page version of Form 600, which is used to
apply for mobile radio licenses.  Farquhar said the Office of
Management and Budget has 120 days to approve the Form 600 EZ before
it can be made available to applicants.  Judy Dunlap, chief of the
FCC's Data Services Branch, said that up to 85 percent of applicants
should be able to use the new form.  In January, the commission also
will begin accepting Form 600 electronically.
     In other FCC news, former Commercial Wireless Division Chief
Rosalind Allen is now associate bureau chief.  David Furth, formerly
deputy chief, will become acting chief of that division.  Larry Atlas
and Daniel Phythyon, formerly associate bureau chiefs, will move to
the Common Carrier Bureau (CCB) to work with former WTB Chief Regina
Keeney, who now heads the CCB.  Coming from the CCB, Karen Brinkman
will join the WTB this month to assist with local competition issues. 
Farquhar also expressed interest in creating a new division
specializing in public safety issues.

SUBSCRIBER GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA OUTPACES OTHER REGIONS, STUDY SAYS

     The cellular subscriber base of Latin America will reach 22
million by 2000, according to Pyramid Research Inc.  Its report,
"Cellular and PCS Markets in Latin America and the Caribbean,"
projects an annual growth rate of 40 percent between 1995 and 2000.
     The report claims that subscriber growth is outpacing all other
regions.  That surge is driven by tremendous growth in Brazil and
Colombia as well as continued growth in Mexico, Argentina and
Venezuela.  Privatization is racing through the region; non-basic
services including cellular are the first markets to open up, followed
closely by basic services markets, the study said.  Argentina, Chile,
Mexico, Peru and Venezuela have witnessed total privatization of their
telecom sectors.  To illustrate the penetration of competition into
these markets, the study takes note of how many competitors there are
in each.  Chile has four separate mobile phone operators, Colombia and
Argentina each have six and Mexico has 10.  In Central America (aside
from Mexico), where competitors are fewer, granting cellular operator
licenses is a top priority for governments.
     Operators serving Colombia were surprised by the demand, the
study said.  In the first nine months of operations of the cellular
networks in the country, subscribership totalled 150,000, which is
nearly half of what the operators had predicted Colombia would have in
five years.  Venezuela also was greeted with more demand than
expected, so much so that government officials are considering
licensing a third operator and speeding up the buildout of personal
communications service (PCS) networks.
     Demand is high even in markets that are not yet privatized.  For
example, in Brazil, where state-owned companies still maintain a
monopoly, the number of subscribers grew by an average of 283 percent
between 1991 and 1995.
     Why is demand so high?  Cellular often serves as a solution to
public networks unable to meet demand for telecom services. 
"Backlogged demand for basic service and heightened competition have
contributed to strong growth in the region's cellular markets," said
report author Linda Barrabee, a senior analyst at Pyramid Research. 
This demand also will benefit equipment vendors. Between 1995 and
2000, the market for cellular and PCS infrastructure is expected to
grow from $1.5 billion to $3.7 billion.  Digital equipment will
dominate in the equipment market for the region.  Revenue for digital
is expected to grow from $87 million in 1995 to more than $2.7 billion
in 2000.
     Proponents of time division multiple access (TDMA) and code
division multiple access (CDMA) technologies are battling for market
share as the region moves closer to a migration from analog to digital
networks.  Many countries have selected TDMA because it was available
first, but some of the larger markets--including Argentina, Brazil and
Mexico--have delayed their decisions until the next generation of the
TDMA and CDMA standards are available.  "Many of the larger markets
are serving as test-beds for a range of digital cellular ... standards
such as TDMA, CDMA, E[nhanced]-TDMA, and the GSM-based standard DCS-
1900," Barrabee said.  The migration to digital is inevitable because
the current demand for service cannot be met by analog systems.
     The total number of PCS subscribers will be 4 million by 2000. 
But Barrabee says that "cellular operators should not be threatened by
PCS operators in the short-term.  The window of opportunity is far
from closed.  After all, with or without PCS, by the year 2000, Brazil
will log on 9 million cellular subscribers, Argentina will top 2
million and Mexico will surpass 4 million."

COURT EXCUSES WTR's CARLO AND RESEARCH FIRM AS DEFENDANTS IN CANCER
LAWSUIT

      On Dec. 18, George Carlo, chairman of Wireless Technology
Research LLC (WTR), and the research firm he heads, Health and
Environmental Sciences Group Ltd. (HES Group), were dismissed as
defendants in a lawsuit alleging cellular telephones cause brain
cancer.  Motorola Inc., WTR (formerly known as the Scientific Advisory
Group), the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA)
and CTIA Senior Vice President-Public Affairs Ron Nessen are the
remaining defendants in the suit (MPN, March 13, 1995, pages 1-2). 
The judge is expected to deliver a written opinion deciding the matter
this month (January).
     Last March, plaintiff Debbra Wright alleged that use of cellular
phones had caused her benign brain tumor and that the defendants had
conspired to withhold information from the public about the alleged
connection between cellular phones and brain tumors.  The lawsuit,
filed with the Circuit Court of Cook County, Ill., is Debbra Wright v.
Motorola.  As a real estate manager for Bell Atlantic Mobile, Wright
said she used cellular phones from one to six hours per day between
February 1988 and March 1994.
     "[On Dec. 18] Illinois Judge Paddy McNamara ruled that even
though Wright had obtained a vast amount of information in the last
year about Dr. Carlo, HES Group and the scientific program that Dr.
Carlo is leading, she had not come forward with any evidence that Dr.
Carlo and HES Group were involved in the alleged conspiracy," said
James Baller, chief litigation counsel to Carlo, the HES Group and WTR
in the case.
     "Judge McNamara also is expected to rule in March 1996 on similar
charges [filed] by Wright in September directed specifically against
the independent scientific organization WTR," Baller said in a
statement.  "WTR believes that these allegations should also be
dismissed by Judge McNamara as they are based on the same key factual
issues the judge has now resolved.
     "WTR believes that lawsuits such as the Wright case are wasteful
attacks on the scientific community, that they slow completion of the
research necessary to answer the public's questions ... and that these
tactics could themselves pose threats to public health if they delay
implementation of any interventions that may prove necessary," Baller
said.
     "CTIA and the others have also filed a motion to dismiss and that
should be heard sometime early in the new year," said Nessen.  "Just
as the [motions of Carlo and HES Group] one by one have been dismissed
for lack of scientific evidence, we expect the court will also dismiss
this case."

SATELLITE EXECUTIVES LOOK AHEAD TO A BOOMING NEW YEAR
Even as Regulatory Challenges Remain, Rollout Activity to Accelerate

     If the optimism of many satellite executives is any indication,
look for the big winners of last year to consolidate their lead, while
those left behind in 1995 play an increasingly difficult game of
catch-up.
     And 1995 was a whirlwind year.  "The most significant development
was the emergence of mobile satellite communications as a major
satellite service," said Donald Cromer, president of Hughes Space and
Communications Co..
     "I expect we're going to see phenomenal growth, evidenced from
almost day one," added John Farrell, president of Canada's TMI
Communications.  TMI's MSat satellite is slated for launch in March.
     But despite some executives' positive outlook, regulatory issues
will remain a big variable as companies enter 1996.  "The true hurdle
of this business is not the market, not the technology.  It's regula-
tory," said Stephen Morgan, director-business development for Little
LEO Starsys Global Positioning Inc.     
     Indeed, although the recently concluded World Radiocommunication
Conference (WRC-95) eliminated much of the spectrum uncertainty that
has plagued the mobile satellite service (MSS) industry, the
conference is only a prelude to the global task of acquiring licenses
in individual countries.
     However, several observers doubted that the difficulties
encountered at WRC-95 will re-emerge in countries' licensing
proceedings.  "As far as I know, there's nothing that will affect the
licensing process," said Lloyd Rezler, managing director of satellite
services for Globalstar L.P. partner AirTouch Communications Inc..
     For the second-round Little LEOs, "a holding pattern is a good
analogy," Morgan said.  "Although the planes are moving, they're going
in circles while the traffic controllers work madly."  Any solution
will come at WRC-97, he said.
     But in a year which will bring launches including Inmarsat's
third- generation satellites, TMI's bird and the first Iridium Inc.
satellites, many expressed enthusiasm for 1996.  "This is going to be
an interesting year for us," said Barry Bertiger, director of Motorola
Inc.'s satellite communications division.  "First launches are always
exciting."
     The initial Big LEO launches "should serve as an indicator as to
how quickly and effectively these new systems can be brought online,"
observed industry consultant Ed Martin.
     However, the launch failures of 1995 do not bode well for the new
year.  "The failure rate has got to come down and stay down, or
ambitious plans like the Big LEOs and Teledesic Corp. will have a
terrible time rolling out," said Tim Logue, space and telecom analyst
for Washington law firm Reid & Priest.
     But while groundbreaking companies such as Iridium and Orbital
Sciences Corp. prepare their initial or follow-on launches, others
plan significant preparatory deals for the first part of this year. 
Odyssey, the Big LEO backed by TRW Inc. and Teleglobe Inc., expects to
seal its strategic partners as well as handset and launch vehicle
plans beginning in the first quarter.
     Odyssey launch vehicle candidates include the Ariane, Long March,
Proton and Soyuz rockets, while TRW has letters of intent for handset
development with OSC's Magellan Systems Corp., Japan Radio Co. and
Panasonic Corp.
    Further, look for Starsys--which is about to close its acquis-
ition deal with GE American Communications Inc.--to award satellite,
launch vehicle and handset deals soon.The FCC's Internat- ional Bureau
has a full mobile agenda for 1996, although its work has been halted
by the federal government's shutdown.  Issues include its twice-
delayed satellite policy review, as well as its Ka-band rulemaking.  
    The three remaining Big LEOs, deferred last year for lack of
financing, also are slated for an FCC decision by Jan. 31., although
this may be delayed.  Ellipso has entered into talks with Rockwell
International Corp. , as well as Telstra Corp., Australia's largest
carrier, while Constellation Communications Inc. and American Mobile
Satellite Corp. have remained guarded.
    But even the current MSS leaders still have significant finance
work left.  However, the satellite industry's growth will ease
financing, Hughes' Cromer said.  "I believe financial backing will
continue to become available as more satellite programs are proven and
business cases are demonstrated," he said.  
    Overall, "It will be a year of realistic thinking," AirTouch's
Rezler said.  "The weaker companies just simply won't get the funding. 
The stronger companies will be facing the realities of implementation. 
[By year-end], it will be a very strong industry with respect to the
remaining competitors."

APMT COMES TOGETHER WITH STRONG CHINESE AND SINGAPOREAN BACKING

     Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications (APMT), the latest
addition to the Asian regional mobile satellite fray, revealed
significant support from Chinese and Singaporean companies in a
founders' agreement announced in late December.
    People's Republic of China organizations China Aero-Space Corp.
(CASC), China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General, China
Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp. (managed by China's
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications) and China Unicom Satellite
Telecommunication Co. Ltd. are involved in the $640 million deal. 
Additionally, Singapore Technologies Telemedia and Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. have a one-third stake between them.
    APMT, incorporated in Singapore as APMT Satellite Pte. Ltd., will
be funded by its six founding members, with local service providers
expected to dilute founders' shares as they take equity stakes.   
    Asia Mobile Telecommunications (Thailand) has received Thai
regulatory approval and reportedly will take a 10 percent equity stake
in APMT.  Additionally, APMT also has joined with Japan's Mitsubishi
Corp., and is talking to potential partners in four other countries,
reported the South China Morning Post.
    APMT currently is evaluating turnkey space/ground segment bids; a
report from an Asian correspondent had Hughes Space and Communications
Co. entering into final negotiations.  Hughes officials had no
comment.

  ...Courting the Asian Tigers, Or a Three-Ring Circus?

    APMT will join two other regional MSS projects, as well as the
four global MSS ventures, to vie for Asian subscribers starting in
1998 to 1999 (MSN, Sept. 21, 1995, p. 3).  And despite some concerns
of overcapacity, MSS companies--all with relatively limited
capacities--will enter a booming Asian mobile arena.
    Indeed, a 1995 study by Economic and Management Consultants
International Inc. (EMCI) predicts 78.8 million Asian cellular
subscribers in 2000, up from 10.7 million in 1994.  Japan will remain
the largest market in 2000, at 32.3 percent, but China will move to
second-largest, at 26.8 percent, EMCI said.
    But despite a promising market, APMT's entry still may affect the
jockeying of its competitors to develop strategic relationships in
China, particularly among the global MSS companies.  
    Although having contracts in China isn't a precursor to doing
business there, "China very distinctly insists on some level of
participation, generally above and beyond providing services," said
Iridium Inc. spokesman John Windolph.
    Both Globalstar L.P. and Iridium have launch contracts with
state-owned China Great Wall Industry Corp.  Iridium also has a
relationship with Long March developer CASC--also an APMT partner--
which will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for Iridium
service in China.  
    But London's ICO Global Communications Ltd. has the strongest
ties of the global systems: China's Inmarsat Signatory Beijing Marine
Communication and Navigation Co. recently upped its equity commitments
in ICO to $103 million.
    Globalstar, through partner AirTouch Communications, still is
developing its Chinese connections.  "[China] is the only major
territory that's very much up in the air with respect to their inten-
tions," said Lloyd Rezler, AirTouch's managing director-satellite
services.
    One potential wrinkle as companies seek to boost their Asian ties
may be the uneasy political situation between China and Taiwan.  "So
far, that's not been an issue, and we're hoping that the development
won't become a political issue in that respect," said Rezler.  "It's a
win-win for everybody to have these systems up and running."
    Added Iridium's Windolph, "They are distinctly separate
territories, and consequently they are being treated as such."

WRC-95 OPENS THE DOOR

    The Big LEOs and Teledesic Corp. both achieved strong results at
this year's World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-95), held in
Geneva by the International Telecommunication Union.  Teledesic wound
up the surprise winner after a strong international campaign to raise
awareness of its system, while the Big LEOs capped off their success
at 1992's conference with solid feederlink allocations.  ICO Global
Communications Ltd. had some difficulties due to the crowded nature of
its 2 GHz bands, but succeeded in its primary goal: advancing the
global availability date of its spectrum to 2000.
    The Little LEOs had to contend with the challenges of little
preparation time for WRC-95 and spectrum scarcity in bands below 1
GHz.  However, they succeeded in a small global allocation--as well as
more bands in the Americas--and improved their recognition by other
countries.
    Overall, WRC-95 showcased growing regionalism among ITU member
countries.  Aside from the usually cohesive European bloc, the
countries of the Americas joined on many items, as did the African and
Arab regions to a lesser extent.  Although European unity may spur
other regions to join on issues, observers noted that regionalism also
may be the only way the ITU can function with the ambitious agendas
and accelerated, two-year schedule of the WRC meetings.

COMMERCIAL SERVICE:  AMSC AND ORBCOMM BREAK NEW GROUND

    Despite developmental activity on all MSS fronts, 1995 also
brought commercial rollouts from American Mobile Satellite Corp.  and
Orbital Sciences Corp..  OSC launched its first two Orbcomm birds in
April and currently is marketing non-real-time telemetry applications
until it launches the rest of the 36-satellite system next year.  In
turn, AMSC began Skycell commercial voice and data service at the end
of the year.
    Both companies' technical hangups prior to beginning service show
the challenge of setting up satellite systems, as well as the effect
start-up problems have on investor confidence.  AMSC's and OSC's
respective glitches prompted uncertain diagnoses from the companies,
while both stocks suffered on Wall Street.  But even as the two
companies opened the way to providing MSS from dedicated satellites,
Qualcomm Inc. aggressively boosted the international rollout of its
OmniTracs fleet management service.  After breaking 100,000 total
terminals sold by the first quarter, the company established a
Malaysian subsidiary and expanded its operations in Mexico and Brazil.

MSS COMPANIES WATCH THE BOOMING IPO AND BOND MARKETS FROM AFAR

    The strong results of initial public offerings (IPOs) and bonds
in 1995 offered no solace to MSS companies attempting to enter the
market.  Underwriters scaled back the Globalstar L.P. IPO prior to its
release, only to see the stock sink, while both it and Iridium Inc.
cited high costs in pulling their high-yield debt offerings.  MSS
companies' forays to the credit market show that exceptional risk
inevitably will bring demands for high returns.  
    On the equity side, the unestablished nature and nonexistent cash
flow of MSS companies give stock analysts few reference points.  But
Globalstar illustrated how news-driven MSS stocks are, when its solid
WRC-95 results pushed its stock price up more than 80 percent above
its pre-conference level.
    The exception to the MSS companies' public financing trials was
ICO, which parlayed its Inmarsat heritage into $1.4 billion in private
commitments, while satellite vendor Hughes Space & Communications also
invested $94 million.  Both Iridium and Globalstar also turned to
internal backers as well in the wake of their attempted debt
offerings.

LICENSING:  U.S. LEADS THE WAY, WHILE EUROPE CHOOSES ITS COURSE

    The Big LEO regulatory marathon of 1994 ended in January when the
FCC deemed Globalstar, Iridium and Odyssey qualified to build their
systems.  Look for a ruling on the deferred LEO systems, Ellipso,
Constellation and AMSC, next month.  Little LEOs Starsys Global Pos-
itioning Inc. and Volunteers in Technical Assistance gained licenses
in July and November, respectively.  Starsys ended its foreign
investment impasse with the FCC by dropping its French ownership to 20
percent, while satellite giant GE Americom bought 80 percent.  
    Meanwhile, the European Commission (EC) adopted a proposal to
have a final MSS regulatory structure in Europe by March 1997. 
Although the process is incomplete, observers said it likely will be a
comparative-hearing proceeding, including spectrum availability and
reciprocal market access issues.  Separately, the EC's competitiveness
directorate requested commercial information from Globalstar, ICO and
Iridium to ensure "level playing fields" for MSS in Europe.  
The Asian Regional Market Shapes Up
    Along with strong Asian telecom and broadcast satellite activity-
-as well as high cellular growth--three new Asian regional MSS systems
arose in 1995.  These alternatives to the global systems prompted
concerns of MSS overcapacity in Asia, but optimists said the
potentially huge market may dwarf systems' capacities.  Given the
region's low teledensity and per capita income, look for the economics
of low cost equalling high volume to play heavily in any MSS shakeout.

SMALL LAUNCH VEHICLES STUMBLE; TRADE LIBERALIZATION WITH CHINA AND
UKRAINE

    The nascent small launch vehicle industry had a tough year, with
launch failures of OSC's Pegasus XL, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s [LMT]
LMLV 1 and EER Systems Inc.'s Conestoga.  Meanwhile, the United States
loosened restrictions on the use of Chinese and Ukrainian launch
vehicles.  Generally, the negotiations balanced existing contracts set
before the agreements--such as Globalstar's and Iridium's deals--and
overall "carrot and stick" trade relations, against the protests of
manufacturers such as McDonnell Douglas Corp..

EXPANSION INTO BROADBAND TECHNOLOGIES

    Notwithstanding Teledesic's pre-WRC obstacles, broadband boomed
in 1995.  AT&T Corp., Lockheed Martin, Loral Corp. , and Motorola Inc.
all announced geostationary broadband plans, with the FCC's October
application deadline bringing the total field to 15 proposed systems. 
The FCC also took a step toward resolving a spat pitting satellite
companies against local multipoint distribution service (LMDS)
advocates, by proposing a Ka-band plan in July.  The plan stayed
intact through WRC-95; look for an order this year.

THE AUCTION OPTION

    The auction debate escalated in 1995, with issues including how
to allocate licenses fairly and accommodate spectrum scarcity. 
Congressional pressure for auctions was a factor, but key
congressional and FCC officials said international systems may be
outside the debate.  The issue was punted to the FCC's satellite
policy review, although the federal budget brawl delayed the first
industry roundtable.  In the midst of the debate, the Satellite
Industry Association emerged as an advocacy group for the oft-
fractious satellite industry.

ICO REGULATORY MISCELLANY:  PATENTS AND INVESTMENT CONCERNS

    The U.S. patent agency awarded patents for TRW Inc.'s Odyssey
system, an event which TRW said would preempt ICO's system.  While TRW
proceeded to file patent applications worldwide, the State and
Commerce Departments raised questions about the separation of ICO and
Inmarsat, as well as the propriety of Comsat Corp.'s investment in
ICO.  Both issues remain unresolved.

FIRST FIVE IRIDIUM SATELLITES ARE IN PRODUCTION; 1996 LAUNCHES
SCHEDULED

     Iridium Inc. is on course to be the first of the Big LEOs in
orbit, with five satellites currently in the factory and a launch
slated for the fourth quarter.
    Construction is now ahead of contractual schedule; Iridium
sponsor Motorola Inc. chose to continue its buildout plans despite
spectrum uncertainty prior to last year's World Radiocommunication
Conference (WRC-95).  "From a construction standpoint, things are
actually going quite well," said Barry Bertiger, Motorola corporate
vice president and general manager of its satellite communications
division.   
    Bertiger lauded Motorola's relationship with its Iridium
subcontractors.  There have been "a couple cost claims" on the fixed-
price development subcontracts, but they are "all very minor," he
said.  The main subcontractors are Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon
Co., and rocket manufacturers China Great Wall Industry Corp.,
Khrunichev and McDonnell Douglas Corp..
    Motorola has two qualification spacecraft built, as well as the
five flight models in its Chandler, Ariz., plant.  For the Iridium
project Motorola introduced a "five-day, dock-to-dock" timetable for
turning satellite components into a complete spacecraft.  Currently
the company is holding a seven-day cycle time for initial production,
with the five-day goal set to begin with the 20th of the initial 72
Iridium satellites and spares, Bertiger said.
    After the early production run, Motorola will defer construction
until results are in from the first flight tests.  Regarding manuf-
acturing changes ifnecessary, Bertiger said the production
line is "reasonably flexible.  Minor changes we can handle fairly
easily."
      In-orbit "tweaking" is also possible, since the satellites'
software is programmable, he added.  Iridium will begin in-orbit
testing with three satellites in one plane, to test crosslinks between
satellites and L-band and gateway links with the ground.  A second
launch of two satellites will enable plane-to-plane crosslink tests.   
 Despite Motorola's aggressive satellite construction campaign, the
development schedule for Iridium's novel dual-mode handheld phones
will not be a issue, Bertiger said.  "Fortunately, that's all under
one umbrella here," he said.  Motorola has a working handset
prototype--"not portable, but transportable," with plans for a few
hundred prototype portables by 1997, he said. 

Motorola Signs for Five More Delta Launches

     Last month, Motorola added a five-launch Delta 2 order to its
existing $400 million, eight-launch contract with McDonnell Douglas. 
The follow-on launches, of three satellites each, will replenish the
initial 66-satellite, six-spare Iridium constellation.  Launches of
replacement satellites or spares will begin in 1998 or 1999,
"depending on when we need the satellites up," said Stephanie Nowack,
Motorola Satellite Communications Division spokeswoman.

  ...Mac-Dac Develops New Delta Components to Handle Iridium Launches

    Building a launch vehicle fairing to hold five satellites is a
first for McDonnell Douglas, said Will Hampton, a program manager with
McDonnell Douglas.  To accommodate the Iridium satellites atop its
Delta 2 rocket, Mac-Dac created a new fitting to interface with the
second stage, as well as a new satellite dispenser.  Meanwhile, the
whole assembly will be encased in a new composite (rather than
aluminum) fairing.  The Iridium launch vehicle production is in the
existing Delta production flow and is on schedule, Hampton added.
    Motorola and McDonnell Douglas officials declined to give
specific dates for the first launch, although a manifest from the
Office of Commercial Space Transportation shows an Iridium launch
slated for September.
    Hampton said the satellites will arrive at the Vandenberg Air
Force Base launch facilities five weeks before launch.  The Iridium
program is "much more 
streamlined in terms of vehicle processing," he said.  "They've done
very impressive work in terms of the amount of time they've been able
to reduce."

  ...Globalstar Cutting Metal, While Odyssey and ICO Prepare

    Globalstar L.P. ICO Global Communications Ltd. and Odyssey, the
two other Big LEO consortia, also are proceeding with their satellite
development plans, although all are behind Iridium to varying degrees.
    Globalstar space segment manufacturer Space Systems/Loral has
built a prototype satellite, as well as basic elements of the flight
models, said Globalstar Executive Vice President Tony Navarra.  The
first flight model is due this fall, he said.  Navarra acknowledged
Iridium's progress, but said he expects Globalstar will be first to
market, since its system can operate (at reduced capacity) with only
32 satellites.  But regarding Iridium's groundbreaking launch, "We're
absolutely looking forward to it," he said.
    Meanwhile, Odyssey sponsor TRW Inc. and ICO (through its
satellite builder Hughes Space and Communications Co. remain embroiled
in their well-known squabble prompted by TRW's patents of the Odyssey
constellation.  
    Hughes is in the early stages of the recently awarded ICO
program, although satellite construction has not begun.  Regardless,
"We're not waiting for any patent considerations here," said a company
spokesman.
    In turn, TRW is concluding development of the Odyssey satellites'
internal propulsion, and has successfully tested the Odyssey L-band
antenna design.

DEFENSE MERGER WILL KEEP SATCOMS SEPARATE

     The $10 billion Lockheed Martin Corp.Loral Corp. merger announced
this week will keep the defense giants' satellite communications
businesses separate, the two companies said.  "Loral now will be a
leading space and communications company," said company Chairman
Bernard Schwartz in a statement outlining the merger.  The new Loral
Space and Communications Corp. will retain its 31 percent stake in Big
LEO Globalstar L.P., as well as its 33 percent stake in manufacturer
Space Systems/Loral (SS/L).  Additionally, Lockheed Martin will invest
$344 million for a 20 percent equity share of Loral Space.  However,
the two may find some commercial overlap.  While SS/L is the primary
builder of Globalstar's satellites (and owns 37.5 percent of
Globalstar), Lockheed Martin is leading the construction of Iridium
Inc.'s satellites.  On the broadband side, Loral and Lockheed Martin
have their respective Cyberstar and Astrolink projects.  Despite a
short day of trading due to a blizzard on the East Coast, Globalstar's
stock shot up 23 percent the day the merger was announced, reaching at
one point a high of $44.50 per share.  (Lockheed Martin, 301/897-

MIKE SYNAR DIES AT AGE 45

     Mike Synar, former Oklahoma Representative and ambassador-
designate of the U.S. delegation to last year's World
Radiocommunication Conference, died of cancer Jan. 9 at home in
Washington.  
     Synar embraced the technical issues of WRC-95 with the same self-
assured exuberance that typified his eight terms in Congress.  "I
think the principle that evolved our telecom system in Oklahoma must
guide us for WRC-95," he told Phillips editors in a 1995 interview. 
"And that is this:  We believe that the American telecommunications
products should be available at the same time, the same quality, the
same quantity, anywhere in the world."

MILSTAR SATELLITES' CROSSLINKS CHECK OUT; PARALLEL CONCEPT TO
IRIDIUM'S

     Lockheed Martin Corp. announced last month that the first two
Milstar geostationary satellites, built for the U.S. military, have
successfully relayed messages via their intersatellite links.
    Lockheed Martin billed the event as the first use of satellite
crosslinks; ordinarily, traffic is transferred between satellites by
"double-hopping" via ground stations.  When fully operational, the
Milstar system will relay high-priority voice, data and video traffic
to fixed, mobile and man-portable units.
    Several commercial systems have specified crosslinks in their
design, including Iridium Inc., the Motorola Inc.-sponsored Big LEO
that counts Lockheed Martin among its contractors.  "Iridium is based
somewhat on the technology developed for Milstar," said Lockheed
Martin spokesman Eric DeRitis. "It gave us the knowledge to produce
the crosslinks for Iridium."
    The parallel is not exact.  The two Milstar satellites (four more
will be launched, starting in 1999) relay traffic between their
respective central Pacific Ocean and continental United States orbital
slots, while Iridium only will send traffic through adjacent
satellites in its 66-satellite network.  Further, the Milstar
crosslinks operate at 60 GHz--for security, since stray signals are
absorbed by the atmosphere--while Iridium's crosslinks are at 28 GHz.
    "We've never been all that concerned about intersatellite links,"
said Barry Bertiger, general manager of Motorola's satellite
communications division.  "They're pretty straightforward point-to-
point microwave links."  The links have been fully tested on the
ground, he added.
    However, even the Milstar system does not have crosslinks between
satellites in different planes (and moving in different directions),
as Iridium does.

  ...Crosslinks Offer Security Advantages for the Milstar System 

    By using intersatellite links, the Milstar system reduces the
U.S. military's reliance on potentially vulnerable (and expensive)
ground stations outside the United States.  However, innovation comes
at a premium.  Unclassified funding for the Milstars and mission
control as of Sept. 30, 1994, was $6.4 billion, according to our
sister publication SPACE BUSINESS NEWS.
    Lockheed Martin designed Iridium's crosslinks, with Com Dev
manufacturing antennas and Gorca Systems Inc. providing systems
engineering.  Although crosslinks have obvious military benefits,
Iridium's have led its competitors, among others, to assert that it
will bypass local networks in routing calls to end users--a scenario
Iridium officials vehemently deny.  Iridium maintains that its network
is designed to interconnect with all existing telecom systems.

INTERACTIVE TV MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED

Although the promise of true interactive television still
captivates the public, analysts now believe it will take
longer to come to fruition than originally expected.
Recent interactive TV trials, including a 4,000 home
trial in Orlando, Fla., conducted by Time Warner, have
not gone as well as expected.  Analysts believe the
reasons include an immature system, a price point that
is too high for providers to make money, and a
marketplace that isn't quite ready to jump into
interactivity.

The nascent industry is still trying to overcome its
early boastful claims about the price and breadth of
services interactive TV would provide.  Analysts now say
those claims were blown out of proportion and caused
confusion in the marketplace.

Telephone and cable companies originally claimed that
interactive TV would be relatively easy to implement and
that it could be done in a cost-effective manner,
explained Jim Penhune, an analyst with BIS Strategic
Decisions (Norwell, Mass.).  "After a while, the
companies began believing their own claims and nobody
would admit that it would be harder to implement
technically and profitably than had originally been
believed," he said.

One stumbling block to fast adoption of interactive
television may be that consumers are not interested
enough or ready for interactive television in its current
incarnation.  As a result, the industry will have to
define a very low-cost entry point for interactive
television to become a reality soon, said Tom Maresca,
an analyst at Jupiter Communications (New York, N.Y.).

The level of sophistication of current interactive
television offerings also has been rather poor, which
doesn't endear consumers to the concept, said Walter
Miao, an analyst at Link Resources (New York, N.Y.).
Lack of standards and interoperability are other factors.
"TV viewers today are accustomed to being passive with
our TV sets.  The only thing that has even been a little
interactive up until now has been the remote control or
a video game," Miao explained.  "If interactive TV is
going to catch on, we need to define new levels of
interactivity, and we need to do it slowly.  You have to
start small, which is part of the mistake so far.  As
much as I admire Time Warner for putting in a full-
service network in Orlando, they are trying to do
everything.  That's a mistake, and it's expensive."

Starting small may mean creating an entry-level
interactive system just for games, Miao said.  "Show me
an interactive TV system I can just do shopping and
transactions on.  Then define that system as a scalable
system so I can scale it up from 20 to 200 households and
then to 2000 households.  Then I can start adding new
interactive services.  That's the way you can ratchet
things up."

The best way to deliver interactive television is to do
so incrementally, agreed Penhune.  "Reality is that more
limited forms of what we would call interactive TV will
deployed to more people over the next year or so.  We'll
see a scaled-down version of services.  You are going to
see more high-end pay-per-view TV from cable people and
near video-on-demand, where instead of being able to
choose any of 2,000 movies and run them instantly at any
time with stop, fast forward, and rewind, you will have
a choice of 50 to 100 movies, delivered at 15 minute
intervals.  The industry will see that there will be no
problem providing those types of services
cost-effectively."

THE FUTURE OF INTERACTIVITY

It may be that in the end, interactive television, the
Internet, and on-line services will all be melded
together.  "You are starting to see video and audio on-
demand on the Internet.  It is getting to the point where
it is starting to resemble TV more than it ever has
before," Maresca said.

Ten years from now, people probably will be accessing the
Internet in a much more robust fashion than via their TV
sets, "but this will be an Internet that has multimedia,
video, audio, and a heavy look and feel to it," Maresca
predicted.  Many of the services that are starting to be
done over the Internet now, including banking and
shopping, will most likely grow, and those same types of
applications eventually can be extended to the television
environment, he said.

The industry will have to mature a little more before
consumers can receive interactive television services
they will value at a cost they will pay, Miao added.  And
today's world is primarily an analog world, while
interactivity is best suited to a digital world.  These
factors mean that the beginnings of true interactive
television probably won't happen until at least the end
of 1996, Miao said.

ATM, ETHERNET WILL COEXIST IN THE SHORT TERM

LONG TERM UNCERTAIN:  IN THE SHORT TERM, ANALYSTS EXPECT
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Ethernet each to
have a secure place in the networking arena because each
serves a unique purpose.  On the desktop, Ethernet is the
clear protocol of choice, both in terms of efficiency and
price, said John Morency, an analyst at The Registry, a
consultancy in Newton, Mass.

Ethernet on the desktop, both at 10 megabits per second
(Mbps) and 100 Mbps, has a bright future, Morency said.
Fast Ethernet meets the capacity demand and appears to
have the support of virtually all of the major hub
vendors, including Cabletron, Bay Networks, and 3Com.
Most people will continue to deploy Ethernet to the
desktop because it is most cost-effective to do so, said
Dave Passmore, an analyst at Decisys (Sterling, Va.), a
network consulting firm.

Ethernet on the desktop also is popular because users do
not have to worry about support for ATM LAN emulation.
"All the current software people run on their desktop
machines today assumes a broadcast LAN environment like
Ethernet, and if you go to ATM, you open a Pandora's box"
of LAN emulation with ATM, the standard for which is
relatively new, Passmore explained.  But when it comes
to linking Ethernet switches together, ATM comes into
play.  Decisys sees ATM as the backbone to link those
switches together.

Just as Ethernet seems to have a lock on the current
desktop, ATM is currently best suited to the backbone,
or the pipe that provides quality of service along
multiple virtual connections, allowing the user to
process voice, video, and data simultaneously.  For the
next three years, Passmore advised counting on ATM as the
backbone to tie routers and switches together.

ATM prices are declining fairly rapidly, which bodes well
for the technology, said Mordechai Fester, ATM product
manager for Cisco Systems.  "In some situations, that
could make it tougher for Ethernet.  You could easily
imagine a scenario where if ATM had stayed at $2,000 per
server the way it was a year or two ago, people would be
delaying implementation of ATM and might favor another
technology," he said.

More important than declining prices for ATM is the
rollout of the next generation of ATM switching.
Production-ready ATM backbone switches will hit the
market this year, prompting many companies to move to ATM
as a mainstream backbone technology, Fester said.

ATM on the desktop will happen eventually, but don't
expect to see it in most commercial organizations until
the year 2000 at the earliest, Passmore predicted.

"We really don't see desktop ATM really taking off to any
significant extent in 1996," agreed Morency.  "Technology
will still be too expensive and there isn't going to be
real interoperability to exist to make network managers
feel comfortable enough.  It will take time for it to
really mature."

1997 AND BEYOND

Although 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps Ethernet have their place,
something much faster is on the horizon.  Gigabit
Ethernet will supply full-duplex fiber links over 20
kilometers; a copper version will cover shorter
distances.  Although the impact of Gigabit Ethernet on
the market in 1996 is negligible, it may take off in
1997, when the specification is expected to be released.
Gigabit Ethernet is still quite new, and it isn't clear
whether it will meet distance limitations, Passmore said.
"Today, if you are going to the trouble of putting fiber
in to give you any kind of distance, you might just as
well use ATM," he said.

When Gigabit Ethernet finally arrives, it may give ATM
a run for its money.  But because ATM has been around
longer and is more firmly entrenched, it may win out,
Passmore speculated.  Ethernet is more of a known
quantity on the desktop, though, and users may turn to
it.  "They might not like the idea of moving to a totally
new technology, therefore choosing the safety and
familiarity of Ethernet," Morency said.

"If we are at the point next year where ATM LAN emulation
really hasn't taken off, ATM desktop connectivity is
still too expensive and not very interoperable, there may
be a lot of shops that may look to Gigabit Ethernet to
provide a short-term tactical implementation to get the
advantage of higher performance," he said.

1996 MAY BE BIGGEST YEAR YET FOR VIDEOCONFERENCING

Bill Gates, who has as many opinions as he has millions,
has said that videoconferencing, although a promising
technology, cannot compete with personal contact.  "A
face-to-face meeting is still a better way to collaborate
than the most ideal videoconferencing solution," he has
said.

For once, analysts agree with Gates.  But although
nothing can compete with a face-to-face meeting, it isn't
always possible or practical.  In those cases,
videoconferencing may be an ideal solution, especially
as the technology matures and standards designed to
support it are put into place.

1996 will be the year videoconferencing comes into its
own, predicted Sarah Dickinson, president of Dickinson
and Associates (Cambridge, Mass.), a videoconferencing
consulting firm.

More and more companies are entering the
videoconferencing market, and as large companies become
more involved, the market will begin to accelerate, said
Tony Paradiso, director of marketing in PictureTel's
personal systems division.  PictureTel has a 50 percent
market share, but it is smaller than many of its
competitors.  A growing installed base of PC users and
large companies like Intel and British Telecom, which
have recently entered the market, will help bring
visibility to the technology.  Such large companies help
educate the market and help accelerate the technology's
acceptance, Paradiso said.

STANDARDS WILL HELP ACCEPTANCE... AND PRICE

As standards for videoconferencing loom on the horizon
and the technology becomes simpler and less expensive,
the videoconferencing market will grow more quickly,
analysts believe.

The standard that will have the largest effect on
videoconferencing's expected boom is H.324, which will
create an integration of videoconferencing within the
domain of the home PC, Paradiso explained.  Approved last
month, H.324 is the standard everyone will build to, he
said.  It will force the quality of video to improve and
prices to become dramatically lower, and will foster
interest by the consumer market.

H.324 also will allow videoconferencing to be used with
regular telephone lines, but the jury is still out on
whether people are going to be interested in using
videoconferencing that way, Dickinson said.  Most
importantly, H.324 will bring videoconferencing into a
mobile environment for laptops and business travelers.
That capability is critical to widespread acceptance, she
said.

Another standard crucial to widespread acceptance of
videoconferencing is H.323, which allows for
videoconferencing over a local area network.  H.323 will
makes video over the LAN a very popular application,
Dickinson predicted.  It is expected to be approved by
the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) by the
end of this year.  And on the horizon is a planned
standard for videoconferencing for ATM, currently being
discussed at the ITU.

Such standards will lead to cost decreases, predicted
Paradiso.  "In the past, AT&T and other companies had
videophones, but they were $1,500, [they had] terrible
quality, and they were proprietary," he explained.  "But
with these standards, two videoconferencing users can buy
equipment from two different vendors.  You will begin
seeing PC vendors adding videoconferencing capabilities
to their platforms, and you will be able to do video over
standard phone lines.  All of this will bring the prices
down and availability up."

Last on the standards list is T.120, the information-
sharing piece ratified in 1995.  Although some vendors
claim compatibility, take that claim with a grain of
salt, warned Steve Kimball, an analyst with META Group
(Reston, Va.).  "They have probably tested it on their
own products, but haven't tested it yet with different
vendors' products.  It will be more toward the second
half of 1996 that T.120 compliance really gets
addressed," he said.

BY THE NEW MILLENNIUM

Videoconferencing over the Internet also is an important
advance, Dickinson said.  Products like Apple's QuickTime
conferencing kit will give users videoconferencing
capabilities over the Internet using TCP/IP or regular
Ethernet LAN and at the higher end, over ISDN.  This
capability will attract a new group of users, which is
crucial for the technology's continued success, she said.

As the decade progresses, widespread adoption of
videoconferencing by businesses will become more likely,
Kimball said, but it will take a few years for businesses
to realize enough benefit from the technology and for the
technology to become more affordable.  "If it becomes
cheap enough that it doesn't matter whether it is
installed [in PCs] or not, then all of a sudden people
get used to communicating that way.  At that point, he
said, it will become a commodity.

MSNBC BRINGS MICROSOFT ONE STEP CLOSER TO TECHNOLOGY
DOMINATION

Last month, Microsoft and NBC struck a deal to create a
news service that will inform viewers across broadcast,
cable and the Internet.  The revolutionary news service,
dubbed MSNBC, is designed to take advantage of NBC's
newsgathering expertise and Microsoft's strength in
computer technology, both through its software and its
fledgling on-line service, Microsoft Network.

As Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said when the deal was
announced, people want to be able to call up news on
demand at their convenience.  While watching breaking
news on television, consumers want to be able to get
access to more in-depth information on items of interest.
The deal with NBC will help create innovative interactive
news content and an integrated media experience, he
explained.

The deal calls for Microsoft to invest $220 million over
five years for a 50 percent stake in the all-news cable
station.  Both Microsoft and NBC will invest $200 million
over five years to fund the cable channel and a
supporting on-line service.

Areas of special interest for Microsoft include
interactive television and on-line computer services,
both of which will be incorporated into the MSNBC
venture.

Gates apparently wanted to enter the news business very
badly: when a deal to acquire a large stake in Turner
Broadcasting Service went awry last August, Microsoft got
back in the saddle and spent the next several months
contemplating and executing a plan to get what it wanted.
With the MSNBC deal, it may have done just that.

A BETTER PLAN

The MSNBC venture is a much better way to go than
Microsoft's previous idea, which was to form its own news
organization, said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst with
Arlen Communications Inc. (Bethesda, Md.).  Microsoft had
hired more than 20 reporters, who would form the genesis
of what might have been Microsoft's unique news
organization.

But the current plan allows Microsoft to have a buffer.
"Not only does Microsoft get to provide state-of-the-art
news, but it also doesn't get taken to task as a news
agency, which might have been very difficult from a
corporate point of view," Krasilovsky said.

The MSNBC venture will have to prove that there is a
market for people who want to customize this type of
information, said Peter Bernstein, president of
InfoNautics Consulting Inc. (Ramsey, N.J.).  "I think
there is a small segment of the population that would be
interested in doing that, but the question is whether
they will be willing to pay a stiff price for it," he
said.  "Will the perceived value be there for the service
to get the kind of penetration it will need to be
successful?"

At this point, it is difficult to envision that people
who are accustomed to getting information one way will
change their behavior so radically as to heavily use the
service MSNBC plans to provide, Bernstein said.  "But
Microsoft and NBC have plenty of money, and if they want
to back it to the extent that it will probably need to
be backed to change people's behavior, they can do it.
It's a question of marketing, and Microsoft has proven
itself very good at marketing."

By entering into this deal, Microsoft is covering all
bases, trying to position itself as a premier content
provider.  This agreement, along with Microsoft Network
and Microsoft's strong interest in interactive
television, is Microsoft's move into the real-time
content business.  "They honestly believe that content
is going to be king in the future," and Microsoft wants
to own a large part of that empire, Bernstein said.

Content is key, agreed Jim Penhune, an analyst with BIS
Strategic Decisions (Norwell, Mass.).  Microsoft has made
many alliances for content, including the defunct deal
with Turner Broadcasting and its relationship with SKG
Dreamworks.

A STEPPING STONE TO INTERACTIVE TV?

Some say that providing on-demand news is an interim step
toward gaining a foothold in the interactive television
market.  Microsoft is hoping that MSNBC will be the
interactive TV vehicle for news information, some
believe.

"You can't go wrong with content because all of it is
fairly leveragable," Penhune explained.  "A year ago, or
even now, there is a lot of talk about [deals like this]
giving Microsoft content for interactive TV.  But even
if it doesn't, it gives them content for all these other
media as well, so it isn't like they are going to be
stuck with something they can't use."

Although projects like the MSNBC venture take plenty of
Microsoft's energy and money, they will not distract
Microsoft from its core projects, Penhune said.  Those
core projects are all targeted at the consumer market,
"and if you accept the premise that they are consumer-
and not business-oriented, then doing something like this
is not a distraction.  It is another way of addressing
the consumer market," he said.

STRATACOM UNVEILS ATM SVC SWITCHING

StrataCom last week announced full support of high
performance switched virtual circuit (SVC) switching to
automate connection set-up and configuration.

ATM SVCs provide three benefits for carriers and end
users: scalability, flexibility and ease of use.  The
company said it expects to begin beta testing of ATM SVCs
with select customers in the first quarter of this year.

In addition, StrataCom unveiled a set of ATM signaling
and security features that give users more flexibility
and various levels of control across ATM wide area
networks.  The new features are designed to give
companies the ability to prevent unauthorized access
among users.

Available as a system software upgrade, StrataCom's ATM
SVCs will support ATM user-to-network (UNI) interfaces
ranging from T1/E1 (1.544/2.0 Mbps) and T3/E3 (45/34
Mbps) to OC-3/STM-1 (155 Mbps). StrataCom ATM SVC
signaling also includes compliance with both ATM UNI 3.0
and 3.1 with translation between these standards.

The company also said it will support ATM SVC signaling
for ATM Frame UNI (FUNI) and ATM Inverse Multiplexed
(AIMUX) interfaces with the delivery of these products
in the first quarter of 1996.  It will also support the
Interim Inter-Switch Signaling Protocol (IISP) which
provides interoperability with other vendor's ATM
switches and the Interim Local Management Interface
(ILMI) protocol for ATM connection management.

Unlike frame relay, ATM is widely viewed as the
underlying transport technology for multiple
services -- making ATM SVCs fundamental in supporting
large numbers of users and high volumes of traffic.  SVCs
are the foundation for several new ATM-based services
such as LAN interworking over ATM using LAN Emulation and
Multi-Protocol Over ATM (MPOA) standards.  These services
will require the ability to rapidly establish and
tear-down large numbers of connections.

While permanent virtual circuits or PVCs must be pre-
established and manually configured, SVCs make use of ATM
signaling information within each ATM cell allowing
connections to be automatically set up on-demand by
switches as ATM calls are requested by the user.

ATM SVCs provide an ideal foundation for multimedia
applications, according to Stratacom.  While router
architectures aggregate many users' traffic, the use of
ATM SVCs permits a separate connection for each pair of
users and each application.  This allows quality of
service guarantees which are essential for multimedia
communications.

Though PVCs remain attractive for customers with a
limited number of interconnected devices, as many more
users come online -- as is evidenced by the growth of the
Internet -- SVCs become a critical requirement.  SVCs
significantly reduce network administration by
eliminating manual configuration of connections while
increasing the flexibility by which devices can be added
to the network providing quicker connectivity to all
other devices.

The company is working on enhancements designed to scale
SVC capacity per switch to support millions of concurrent
SVC connections and thousands of SVC call set-ups per
second.

VIDEOSERVER ANNOUNCES MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCE SERVER

VideoServer Inc., a provider of H.320-based multipoint
control units (MCU), announced availability of a new
member of its Multimedia Conference Server product family
targeted at large corporate users and service providers.

MCUs mix audio and switch video signals to each
conference endpoint, allowing each participant to see
anyone else in the conference and hear the complete
discussion.  Multipoint technology is critical for
multimedia conferences to approach the efficiency and
flexibility of face-to-face meetings, minus the high
travel costs.  Without an MCU, multimedia conferences are
limited to only two sites, hindering effectiveness as
virtual meetings.

The dual-bus Model 2020 is the most powerful offering in
VideoServer's Series 2000 family, which ranges from
entry-level MCUs to high-capacity units.  With
high-capacity, dual-bus design, the new model is targeted
at large corporate sites and conference service
providers, supporting up to 32 sites using internal
inverse multiplexers (IMUX) in 336 Kbps or 384 Kbps
conferences.

Most cost effective for large corporate videoconferencing
network usage charges dominate the life cycle cost of any
videoconferencing solution.  Over a five-year life cycle,
it's not uncommon for these charges to exceed equipment
costs by a factor of ten to one.  The challenge for
videoconferencing managers, then, is to deploy conference
networks that use MCUs to minimize network charges and
will scale with future demand.

While small, distributed MCUs keep phone costs down in
low-volume scenarios, large corporate facilities benefit
from large, centralized MCUs.  For organizations with
more than three or four hours of videoconferencing
between any two sites each day, running leased T1 or E1
lines from each remote site to a centrally located Model
2020 yields substantially lower network costs than
switched digital services.  In addition to lower overall
network costs provided by leased lines in higher volume
scenarios, the cost of conferences between satellite
offices that are connected through the centrally-located
Model 2020 is essentially free.  Management costs also
drop when the MCU is centralized.

FIRST VIRTUAL UNVEILS DESKTOP MULTIMEDIA COLLABORATION
PRODUCTS

First Virtual Corp. announced several products targeted
at business users interested in desktop multimedia
collaboration.

The company's FIRST-Multimedia Switches deliver ATM to
the desktop at switched Ethernet prices, according to the
company.  The family is built with a "stackable/modular"
architecture allowing for a variety of scalable
configurations and can scale to support eight to 24 users
per switch; 120 users per stack and can further provide
scalability through the backbone.

The cost is $300 per 25 Mbps ATM port.  The switches are
support multimedia through modular options including: 25
Mbps ATM for the desktop, Ethernet, token ring for LAN
access, and 155 ATM OC3 for server or backbone switch
access.

The switch complies with ATM Forum UNI 3.0 and 3.1
Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) signaling and LAN
emulation standards to ensure interoperability with
existing LAN data applications and other vendors' ATM
products.

The ATM telecom gateway has been enhanced to include
PRI/TI support.  The Gateway Server is an ATM-Telecom
Gateway which distributes high-quality, remote H.320
videoconferencing streams from the Telco WAN to the
desktop over a local ATM network.  It adds
high-performance ISDN PRI and T1 WAN rates, enabling
room-system quality wide-area videoconferencing and
greater capacity for multimedia traffic and users.

The FIRST-WWW Server enables Internet users to cache
data, graphics and video streams off of the web in the
FIRST-Multimedia Storage Server.  This storage cache
helps facilitate fast access and high quality playback
by users on the ATM or LAN network.  Users can store and
share commonly-used video streams, as well as documents
that incorporate video, data and images using standard
Internet browsers.

In addition to being a QoS manager for out-of-the-box
applications running over ATM, MOS now enables live video
streams to be encoded into MPEG-1 real-time, then
distributes them to various desktops within the
organization using ATM's point-to-multi-point features.
PC users can receive high-quality, broadcast video while
performing any network activity.

FIRST-H.320 introduces development capabilities, via a
Software Developers Tool Kit (SDK) for store and forward
of H.320 streams. This will allow applications such as
Video-Mail and Video Session storage.  Videoconferencing
users will have the same benefits as voice mail users,
namely, the ability to leave a video message.

Net.January: We look at the future of the Web, and ponder the online gender
gap


The beginning of the year is a traditional time to think about
the future, and in the net biz we have more than a little future
to look forward to. In four years, we'll have reached the millenium
a nice round number that's as good a place as any to aim for.

We sent Karen Heyman out to talk to a bunch of Smart People
about what the Web will look like in the year 2000. Everyone
had their own ideas, but they all agreed on two things: that
the Web is here to stay, and that it will look nothing like
what we've got today. The story's called "Web 2000," and it
starts on page 52.

You've Got Mail

But for now, we're still dealing with the net as we know it
and for most of us, that means e-mail. Kevin Reichard surveyed
the world of Windows and Mac e-mail clients, and found a lot
of excellent programs for not a lot of money. "Push the E-Mail
Envelope," starting on page 60, tells you what we picked as
the best of a good lot.

Weaving a Web

The first question about the Web is generally, "How do I write
my own home page?" The second (and more important) question
is usually, "Where do I put my page so people can see it?"

The three biggest online services have been slow to let their
users become part of the Web. That's changed, as America Online,
CompuServe and Prodigy now give their clients Web space and
a simple non-HTML means to create pages.

Of course, neither all pages nor all online services are created
equal. Frequent contributor Joel T. Patz clues us in on which
one is best. The story about "Pre-Fab Home Pages" starts on
page 76.

Women Online

One of the enduring questions about online life is where all
the women are. The latest survey shows that about one-third
of the people online are female, but that's significantly less
than the half of the population that are women. Judith Broadhurst,
an expert in the field of women online, spoke to many women
some connected, some not-and got them to explain what it is
they're looking for. "Bridging the Gender Gap" starts on page
84.

And Also 

Net.News this month offers tips on how not to be a victim of
online scams, reminds you how to tell the difference between
a denizen of California's Silicon Valley and New York's Silicon
Alley, and clues you in on your phone company's plans for Internet
access.

In Workshops, you'll learn the ins and outs of IRC, how to get
your small business online, what graphic tools you really need,
and what the top 10 planning issues are that Webmasters need
to pay attention to.

And, of course, don't forget our columnists, the reviews in
Net.Results, and the customary 300 ratings and reviews in CyberGuide.

Happy New Year!

Net Mail: The Ones That Got Away


In the November 1995 issue of NetGuide, you provided a rather
comprehensive review of the more popular and current versions
of browsers ("New Directions for Browsers," page 56). Why not
follow up with something about the grandfather of them all
 NCSA Mosaic and Cello. These two browsers have been around
for quite some time. They are not as flashy as Netscape, but
they will work on the millions of computers manufactured before
1995 that have been sold with 4 MB of RAM or even less.

Howard Bingham

Houston

I didn't see any mention of CompuServe's Spry Mosaic in the
article and wasn't sure what that means. I'm also confused
about the term "Mosaic" when it's used by itself or as "Spry
Mosaic." Is this the same browser?

Jack Galloway

Snohomish, Wash.

I was dismayed to discover that you did not include OS/2 WebExplorer
in your survey of Web browsers. I would have liked to see how
it stacked up against the several Windows/Mac browsers you
did include in your review. WebExplorer has been available
for a year now. What are you waiting for?

Charles Henrich

New York

NCSA's "Mosaic" was the first graphical browser in widespread
use, and its core technology was licensed widely in early 1995.
That's why so many browsers have the name Mosaic, even though
they're evolving in very different directions. That confuses
you, and it confused us. Spry Mosaic accidentally dropped out
of our November roundup; we did, however, review it in December
as part of the excellent Mosaic In A Box.

NCSA Mosaic and Cello didn't appear because they are now second
tier products whose technology has been passed by. We didn't
include WebExplorer because there is no other major browser
for the OS/2 platform; if you're running OS/2, you don't have
much of a choice, and if you're not using OS/2, WebExplorer
isn't enough of a reason to change your mind.

Net Mail: Sharing Wares


In "Party Girl Lets Loose on the Net" (October 1995, page 29),
Ron Bel Bruno refers to the software program CU-SeeMe as a
"public-domain shareware program." Being a shareware author
myself, I find it astounding that two very different types
of software would be combined into one. I suppose that "public
domain shareware" is something akin to "military intelligence"
and "journalistic research," no?

Brad Stowers

CU-SeeMe is freeware, but its copyright is held by Cornell University.

Net Mail: No Integration?



As one who came to the Internet through one of those user-friendly,
convenient online services, I have recently been surprised
to discover an almost complete lack of integrated software
for accessing the Internet. It seems to me that one or more
software engineers would recognize this as a golden unserved
market niche and dive in with a new product, yet I continue
to be told that no integrated suite or all-Internet "front
end" exists. Frankly, this is astonishing to me.

You're told wrong. We'll be reviewing these so-called "box solutions"

Regarding the November 1995 Net.Mail letter "Wrapping It Up,"

the U.S. Postal Service to destroy.

Net Mail: Columny


The last paragraph in Mark Eckenwiler's Net.Law column (November
1995, page 39) says that it should trouble us all that a person
served with a subpoena would have to choose between self-incrimination
and contempt of court. How about being honest and telling the
truth? What really troubles me is that because the criminal
conspirators of the example were co-workers, we're supposed
to bend the law and become co-conspirators to help them get
away with their crimes. Honest people don't have to lie or
worry about self-incrimination.

Herb Zieman

I commend Dan Rosenbaum for his use of the immigrant metaphor
in his November 1995 column on the new wave of Internet users
(page 17). I found it both apt and imaginative. However, there
is another source of hostility that will continue to exist
on the net that has far less to do with the clash between new
and old than it does with the human animal.

The Internet is the great equalizer of this era, and we are
all potential Davids against our perceived Goliaths. People
lash out on the Internet because they can-because they are
insulated and safe behind their screens-and this is an unfortunate
by-product of an otherwise indispensable form of communication.

But I suppose this is simply another example of the Internet
paradox: Just as the system unites us, it keeps us very much
apart.

Net Mail: Immorality in Cyberspace



I would like to congratulate the authorities who caught those
responsible for trafficking child porn and seducing minors
online ("FBI Thwarts E-mail Porn Ring," December 1995, page
21). It is those [people] who give online services and the
Internet a bad name. While I believe in free expression on
the Internet, I also believe that it's an absolute disgrace
to abuse this exciting technology. Once again, the crimes of
a few are ruining it for the rest of us.

Brian Hedden

Old Bridge, N.J.

In response to a letter written by Stephen W. Nicholas in the
November 1995 issue (page 11), I must say that Mr. Nicholas,
who claims we must "prevent the tyranny that comes from too
much freedom," seems to be barking up the wrong tree.

What is "frightening" about "the fact that the average citizen
has access to a numbingly vast amount of information"? Free
information access sets humans free from any oppressors.

Government regulation will not prevent immorality from invading
cyberspace. The only way to have nothing to fear is to educate
people to understand their fears and to take individual action
to protect against them.

While your monthly listing of interesting sites is great and

on your own Web site?

Net.Editor: The current coarsening of the net has little to do with newbies

By:
Dan Rosenbaum

Is there really an online community? Assuming there is, I sometimes
wonder if I really want to be a part of it.

Depending on whose abacus you use, there are either about 8
million, 15 million, or 20 million of us online geeks in the
United States. As far as the worldwide Internet population
is concerned, you'll probably get a shrug for an answer, but
an estimate of 30 million seems fair.

That's a lot of people-on the scale of New York, Mexico City,
or Tokyo. Populations like that are in a weird netherzone.
They're not big enough to make a serious demographic dent.
A television show with 8 million viewers, for instance, is
on the fast track to cancellation. But 8 million people can
make a lot of noise, especially when they're equipped with
computers and modems.

It's the noise that worries me. There's always been a certain
amount of noise on the net, a side attraction to the great
information that's available for the mining. The noise level
rose and fell with the season (early fall and midwinter were
usually the worst), but it was generally possible to ignore
or tolerate it.

In the last year, the noise level has risen dramatically. Spams
and e-mail bombing are a weekly occurrence. What was once the
occasional appearance of a chain letter has become an unremitting
cadence. Constant struggles continue between regular participants
of some newsgroups and those people who seem intent in drowning
out the group's charter simply because they have a spare week.

This behavior is not new. I have fond memories of the "cats"
conference in the earliest days of the BIX online service,
which devolved quickly and hilariously (if somewhat tastelessly)
into a debate between cat fanciers and cat haters. Perhaps
the exact point is that the same people were frequently on
both sides of the "battle." In this particular case, the noise
was the signal.

Not very long ago, any material that was even remotely salacious
or offensive would be "rot-13"-ed, the letters substituted
for others 13 letters away: "a" becomes "n," "b" becomes "o."
"Sheesh" becomes "furrfu," and vice versa. (Try it, it's fun!)
Newsreaders could translate a posting into a rot-13ed text
with a single keystroke, protecting even the daintiest sensibility.
Yet, anyone could read such a posting if desired.

Rot-13 still exists on Usenet, but its use is now nearly archaic.
People just post what they want to say. The rights of the person
who might not want to see something inappropriate or upsetting
have been almost totally overtaken by the rights of a poster
hell-bent on free expression.

I'm hardly the only person worried about this. You may or may
not realize that the technical basis for the Internet is a
series of Requests for Comments that have been circulated widely,
discussed, and agreed upon. RFCs are what make the net work.
Most of them deal with abstruse technical questions of data
communications and message formatting. But there is now an
RFC 1855, which attempts to codify netiquette. Created by Sally
Hambridge at Intel, RFC 1855 is a lengthy and detailed discussion
of the dos and don'ts of the net. It is so detailed, in fact,
that most newbies will never hear about it and never read it.

There's another problem with RFC 1855: The coarsening of the
net has little to do with newbies. It's not newbies who crosspost
chain letters across the world. It's not newbies who take over
newsgroups. It's not newbies who set electronic robots loose
to cancel posts they deem "wrong." It's sophisticated users,
operating sophisticated tools, who are making the net a worse
place to be.

Of course, it's the rowdies who often affect how a community
is perceived. If a town is full of graffiti, or if the grass
on the highway berms is unkempt, the town will look neglected,
and reality will usually follow the perception.

That's why I'm so worried about the future of The WELL.

The WELL-Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link-has long been one of the
special places on the net. It can trace its lineage directly
back to the Community Memory project, in which customers of
the San Francisco-area Whole Earth stores could type essays,
thoughts, commentaries, or just plain ramblings into strategically
placed computer terminals.

Other people could respond to those postings, or start off on
entire new topics of their own. It was an experiment in interactivity,
in community, in communications. A commercial success it was
not. But Community Memory was an important piece of the mosaic
that became the online world.

One of the great things about The WELL-perhaps the single greatest
thing-is its clientele. Among its several thousand customers
are the very people making the electronic revolution happen.
It's a notoriously tough audience: Know what you're talking
about when you post, or you risk getting reduced to cinders.
On the other hand, The WELL's conferences read like a history
of online communication. It was the place where Time magazine's
notorious cyberporn story got debunked, and it's one of the
places that helped track down hacker Kevin Mitnick.

It used to be hard to get to The WELL. It's in the San Francisco
Bay Area, and for the longest time it required a long-distance
call if you weren't in the neighborhood. Even after the service
allowed access over the Internet via Telnet, The WELL remained
steadfastly terminal-based. No graphical interfaces here. If
you wanted to participate in a conference, you had to learn
an admittedly arcane command structure. The users seemed to
like it that way. Keeps out the bozos, they said.

But this past fall, The WELL introduced a new interface based
on the World Wide Web. Now, for $5 a month, you can fire up
your Web browser and dive in. The WELL is now simple and uncomplicated
even if the users are still a tough audience.

But if The WELL becomes easy to use, easy to get to, and easy
to afford, what's to keep it from getting overrun by the same
vandals who seem intent on ruining the rest of the net? Are
we on the verge of losing one of our special places?

The folks at The WELL say no. What will protect them, they say,
is their sense of community. That doesn't mean keeping out
all outsiders. Quite the opposite; they seem to believe strongly
in the need for new blood I wrote about in this space two months
ago.

The answer, they say, lies in the concept of community. It's
absurd to believe that 20 million people form any sort of community
just because they happen to inhabit the same non-space. In
some ways, I have more in common with the person who works
in the office next to mine than I do with my upstairs neighbor;
in other ways, the reverse is true.

We all belong to many communities, and the ones defined by proximity
or distance have become for many of us-particularly those of
us who are online-the least important. If a community is best
defined as a group of people with a common interest, the net
is awash with overlapping communities. And communities defend
themselves.

This is not necessarily a popular concept online. More than
once, I've seen angry exchanges between people who post inappropriately
and someone trying to correct them. Inevitably, the original
poster will send a sentence like, "Who appointed you the Net
Police?" At that point, of course, most useful discourse between
the parties in question has ended.

But the question is worth following. We're all the net police.
We all need to defend our online communities against the thoughtless
and destructive elements who are undeniably there. The net
is not some anarchic outpost where people can do what they
want. Its very existence is predicated on and depends upon
cooperation. If the larger online community of more than 30
million is to survive, people in the smaller communities will
have to stand tall and take the necessary measures to keep
their areas the way they want them.

You would do as much in your home, you would do as much where
you work, and you would do as much in your town. If you believe
in the online community, you need to do as much on the net.@

Net.News: Been Scammed? How to Avoid Becoming an Online Sucker

By:
Cynthia Kurkowski

Ever wonder how you could still mail a first-class letter using
a 2-cent stamp? Or how you could repair a bad credit record
by just paying the right people? Such bogus claims are the
stuff of which online scams are made.

Whether its investment fraud, money-making pyramids, illegal
credit repair offers, or even false software reseller fronts,
the net's shadowy anonymity is a real lure for scam artists.
According to the Federal Trade Commission, frauds commonly
appear as classified advertising or forum or bulletin board
notices. These postings are disguised as testimonials about
the quality and performance of a particular product or service.
Unscrupulous marketers even use chat rooms to pose as "satisfied
customers" who extol the virtues of fraudulent goods and services.

Thankfully, the same warning signs of a shady deal that you'd
look for in the physical world also apply to online scams.
Exaggerated claims, urgent sale closing deadlines, promises
of quick and easy profits, disclosures of insider trading information,
and unsubstantiated claims are a few of these dead giveaways.
In fact, the FTC's Web page at http://www.ftc.gov/ lists these
and more tips on how to distinguish a scam.

"It's in a new forum, [but] the old rules still apply," says
Lynn Collins, spokeswoman for the National Advertising Division
of the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB). Recently,
the division's authority to evaluate false or misleading advertising
was extended to the net.

The most popular online scams, according to the FTC, result
from consumers ordering software online from vanishing vendors.
To avoid such a bilk, Lee Peeler, associate director of advertising
practices at the FTC, says it's best to authorize a credit
card purchase only after you've had a chance to review the
product, or until it's received. Thanks to the shareware movement,
a reputable software vendor will offer either a demo of the
application or a trial period if you ask for it.

Here are some additional tips for checking out a potential online
scam:

Procure a physical address. "This is important if a complaint
is to be filed or action is taken against the company. Consumers
should always be wary of P.O. box businesses," Peeler says.
These addresses, he says, are often the proxy for individuals
using their home computers as agents of fraud.

Do your homework. Peeler suggests using newsgroups and chat
rooms to get references before making a purchase. (However,
it's important to verify the source of at least two or three
such references, to make sure they're not false claims planted
by scammers.) When in doubt, the FTC also suggests you contact
your Internet or online service provider with information about
suspicious sites or promotions.

To check financial or investment offers, consult the Securities
and Exchange Commission at the Office of Consumer Affairs.
The commission can tell you if an investment is registered
or if a salesperson is licensed to sell what's being offered.

Use a credit card. Despite the security issues of releasing
credit card information over the Internet, Peeler says, "When
you go outside the credit card purchasing system, you lose
protection. There aren't any billing-disputes rights to protect
you from unauthorized purchases or theft."

Make that call. Online fraud is clearly a global issue, though
its enforcement remains a regional duty. Report suspicious
businesses or individuals to your local Better Business Bureau,
Consumer Protection Agency or Attorney General's office. The
CBBB is adding a complaint form to its home page and plans
to add an Internet scam alert section. If you feel a particular
advertisement is either misleading or completely false, the
CBBB will evaluate your claim. If it determines the complaint
valid, it then will ask the advertiser to comply with ethical
standards before taking legal action. The National Fraud Information
Center's toll-free phone service, at 800-876-7060, takes fraud
reports and answers consumers' questions about online scams.

Report all losses. Collins urges consumers to report deceitful
businesses, no matter how little the loss. "You can help others
in the future to determine which businesses are ethical or
not," Collins says. "Scam artists depend on that $20 or $30
from thousands of people the same as if they have received
$1 million from [one] individual."

Net.News: The Nielsen Survey Says 

By:
Judith H. Bernstein

You're smart, you're relatively well-paid, and you have about
a one-in-three chance of being a woman. According to a recent
Nielsen Media Research survey commissioned by CommerceNet,
you're the typical Internet user.

The study bases its findings on 4,200 phone surveys-methodology
that distinguishes it from other Internet reports typically
conducted on the net. The study says 37 million people in North
America over 16 years of age enjoy net access. Those surveyed
are generally better educated, with higher incomes, than the
general population. Among other findings, the study's respondents
average 5-1/2 hours a week online. And while males represent
66 percent of net users, they actually create 77 percent of
network traffic. Meanwhile, 31 percent of all respondents report
daily net access.

Net.News: From the Alley to the Valley-Cyberspace's Great Bicoastal Divide

By:
Kate Gerwig

It's the difference between lofts and cubicles art and engineering
coffee and Coke hip and geek. It's the difference between Silicon
Alley and Silicon Valley.

Since the mid-1970s, when San Jose, Calif., and its environs
were dubbed Silicon Valley, the region has reigned as the mecca
of advanced computer development. Meanwhile, on the Right Coast,
whatever New York's Silicon Alley (a nebulous downtown zone
comprising parts of Soho, Chelsea, and the Flatiron District)
lacks in terms of propeller-head quotient it abounds in artsy
design resources-a precious net commodity. That's why MCI/News
Corp's Delphi, Prodigy's content division, and CompuServe's
Entertainment Drive are nesting there.

NetGuide informally surveyed professional residents of both
Silicons to compile this graphical rendering (left) of East
and West.

Net.News: News Filters Stem the Tide

By:
Lynn Ginsburg

Had it with online news overload? Personalized news services
deliver only the stories you need or want to see.

Both Microsoft and Ziff-Davis Interactive already have debuted
customized news services. The latest entry is Individual Inc.'s
personalized news service, iNews, which was expected to debut
on the Microsoft Network by press time. INews lets subscribers
set criteria to filter numerous news sources. It draws information
from hundreds of newswires, magazines, newsletters, and newspapers,
with major media sources like the Associated Press, Business
Wire, Reuters, Newsbytes, IDG Communications, Ziff Davis Publishing
Co., and CMP Publications Inc. (NetGuide's parent company)

The iNews configuration employs the venerable Microsoft Wizard
system, helping you choose up to 10 topics as filters for your
news profile. Thereafter, iNews generates a new issue every
night, sending you up to 20 briefs for your chosen topics and
industries. When clicked upon, links within each brief take
you to Individual's Web site of full-text stories.

INews monthly subscription prices are low-$6.90 per month, or
$3.95 if you allow your name to be sold for marketing purposes.
The higher price keeps you untouchable.

You can tap Ziff Davis Interactive's personalized news service,
ZD Net Personal View, via the company's ZD Net/World Wide Web
Edition. Unlike iNews, advertiser-sponsored Personal View is
free to registered users. However, news is limited to computer
topics, drawn from PC Magazine, MacWeek, and other Ziff publications,
plus computer industry news distributors like Newsbytes, Business
Wire, and PR Newswire.

Personal View users must fill out a personal profile to set
news filters. When you log into the service each day, you're
presented with the stories that match your personal profile.

Net.News: An MSN Progress Report

By:
Kate Gerwig

The sky was supposed to fall for America Online, CompuServe,
and Prodigy when Microsoft launched its Microsoft Network last
August.

However, the sky appears to be holding, with the major online
services working hard to improve their offerings and to maintain
subscribers. Microsoft even feels it deserves some credit for
whatever overall improvements the market experiences. "The
fact that Microsoft entered the business, in some ways, raised
the bar for online services. Suddenly, they're improving their
services and coming up with more friendly user interfaces,"
says Naveen Jain, MSN senior technical marketing manager.

Microsoft remains mum on exact subscriber numbers, but industry
analysts estimate MSN acquired more than 400,000 subscribers
after its first two months in business. Before MSN launched,
some analysts predicted up to 10 million users would sign on
by the end of 1995. Meanwhile, Microsoft evangelists are keeping
to a more modest goal-1 million subscribers by the end of its
first year.

Early reviews of MSN criticized its alleged lack of bells and
whistles. This is not unusual, according to Jupiter Communications
analyst Adam Schoenfeld. He believes that while Microsoft did
"a bad job of rolling MSN out, it would have been impossible
to live up to the hype surrounding it."

In an attempt at maximum quality control, Microsoft maintains
it will cap its MSN subscriber base at 500,000 temporarily
while it works out any bugs. Jain says the company wants to
get feedback from its subscribers and improve the service any
way it can before opening the gates again.

Inteco Corp. vice president and market analyst Rob Rubin is
skeptical about the strategy: "That would be like turning away
money. I don't think it's in their nature to do that."

Net.News: Log On, Look Around, Tune Out

By:
Kate Gerwig

Since the dawn of online services some 16 years ago, about 6.2
million home PC users have tuned in, then ditched an online
account, a new study claims.

A mail survey of 10,000 U.S. households in August by Inteco
Corp., a Norwalk, Conn., market forecasting firm, reveals high
cancellation rates on America Online, Prodigy, CompuServe,
GEnie and Delphi.

While the online services themselves don't like to talk about
"churn" rates, varying estimates report that 30 to 50 percent
of those who join an online service each year eventually cancel.
Inteco vice president and market analyst Rob Rubin said the
results don't mean business is bad. "The online industry continues
to experience excellent growth, but our study clearly indicates
there's little brand loyalty and that there's a significant
amount of dissatisfaction with all of the services," he says.

Actually, many of the deserters never truly subscribed at all.
Among the household users surveyed, Inteco found that many
simply depart after a free trial period is over. Many PC users
switch from one service to another to take advantage of free
trials or to try out new features, Rubin said. Eventually they
cancel the less satisfactory of the two to avoid paying two
monthly charges.

Net.News: Dishing Out Net Access

By:
Kate Gerwig

Rather than dispensing Internet access by the hour, Hughes Network
Systems simply charges information junkies by the megabyte.

DirecPC, Hughes' high-speed, satellite-based Internet access
service, is probably too pricey for a novice user. But if you
need lots of information and you're tired of spending 45 minutes
dusting your computer while downloading a large file, DirecPC's
scheme could be your ticket, with 400-Kbps data throughout.

After you shell out $995 for the right hardware, which includes
a 24-inch satellite dish, an adapter card, and Windows-based
software, Hughes offers a $15.95 monthly subscription for 30
megabytes of usage, or $39.95 a month for 130 megabytes.

For this expense, surely you'll want to cost-justify DirecPC
in your household budget. "You probably wouldn't download a
6 MB video clip from a Disney movie with your average modem,
unless you had extra time on your hands," says a DirecPC representative.
Lucky for you, time is not of the essence.

To make for a more rounded content offering, DirecPC also offers
CNN Headline and Reuters news, as well as stock and sports
news. Originally targeted to businesses, the system currently
is available in the United States and Canada.

Net.News: You Want My What?


Call it low-rent hacking-or just plain sleazy-but a bunch of
online marauders have been, under a variety of ruses, out to
pilfer passwords from unsuspecting America Online subscribers.

A NetGuide editor received the above "instant message" one rainy
October night in a chat area. However, according to AOL advisories,
employees of the service would never require a subscribers
to divulge a password online.

In most cases, the offending sender's screen name is generated
by AOHell, a hacker program. This underground software can,
among other wily attributes, generate renegade AOL accounts
by creating falsified new-user sign-up information.

Net.News: "I Want My Web TV!"

By:
Kate Gerwig

Tired of booting up your PC to Web surf? How about using a special
TV, or an "Internet box" attached to your TV set, instead?

Though Oracle Corp. hasn't officially announced a "Web TV" product,
Lawrence Ellison, the company's chairman and CEO, discussed
introducing such a product in a speech he gave during an October
telecommunications industry conference. Compaq Corp. also has
announced a similar project in conjunction with Intel Corp.
to create an "Internet Surfer."

Such preliminary announcements give birth to interesting speculations
among experts. At the Yankee Group, a Boston-based consultancy,
for example, analyst Gregory Wester thinks what might actually
materialize from Oracle or another vendor is a set-top Internet
box-much like a cable TV converter. Still, Wester thinks this
approach is limited. "Traditional PC users are used to working
on specific applications," he says.

While David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments,
a New York money-management research firm specializing in interactive
technology, lauds Oracle for tackling such a project, he sees
the price point as crucial. Even $500 is too steep for the
mass market, according to Simons. "In the world of consumer
electronics, the price tag should be about $250," he says.

Net.News: Wow! Woos Net Novices

By:
Judith H. Bernstein

Novices will get a shiny pair of training wheels this spring
when CompuServe's hush-hush Project Wow! online service debuts.

At first blush, this new venue seems to be pitted against America
Online and Prodigy. But according to Scott Kauffman, CompuServe's
vice president for consumer markets and Project Wow! leader,
the company "is not marketing against anyone" with this combination
online service/Internet access product. Still, the groups Kauffman
says Wow! will target-families, young professionals, and seniors
constitute a huge chunk of those services' users. For these
folks, "the technology has to become invisible," he says. To
that end, Kauffman says Wow! will provide "a proper balance
[of] content, community, and customization."

The company hopes to attract 1 million subscribers in its first
year. "We're trying to put the Internet in context," Kauffman
says. "We're not going to prevent adult men and women from
having a full Internet experience."

Mark Mooradian, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, in New
York, says CompuServe may miss the boat by launching its new
service so long after other, similar offerings.

Net.Dern

By:
Daniel Dern

We lost another valuable Internet resource in October. It was
the victim of the cluelessness engendered by the very same
national online services that are busily hyping themselves
as purveyors of the Internet.

When Catherine Yronwode, an America Online subscriber, was denied
Usenet posting privileges by the mail2news@cs.utexas.edu gateway,
she posted a long, threatening letter of complaint to news.admin.misc
and a dozen or so other newsgroups.

The response of gateway-keeper Fletcher Mattox, who'd been responsible
for providing this free-for-use, unfunded resource for a decade,
was that of any sensible, overworked system administrator supporting
a volunteer project. He pulled the plug. (Yronwode's activity
was not the sole cause of his decision. Her outburst, however,
was inarguably the event that caused Mattox to decide it was
time to call it quits.)

Many of the unofficial but valuable resources in the pre-deluge
Internet and Usenet were similar labors of love. So, as they
get shut-or shot-down, how can they be replaced? And as new
services get offered, how can they be funded in ways that are
self-sustaining? Well, it depends on what kind of information
resource you're talking about. Once you pare away the services
that we'll gladly pay for, like BusinessWire or Dow Jones,
you've got sites offering sales and marketing information from
the likes of Apple, IBM, Sony, and others that will gladly
pay to hawk their wares. What's left? A large middle ground,
comprising commercial advertising and sponsorship.

With sponsorship, businesses subsidize the online content we
do want, in return for attaching their own messages somewhere
within the content (it's the same theory as commercial TV).
During the past year or so, sponsors have discovered the Internet,
and the Internet has discovered the money font of sponsorships.
In fact, there's no shortage of resources soliciting sponsorship.
(For a list of prices for links and sponsorships, see http
//www.netcreations.com/ipa/adindex.htm; for a list of "sponsorable"
sites and resources, see http://www.trafficresource.com/.)

However, few companies are willing to sponsor sites without
first getting some information about the site's traffic-preferably
evidence of "readership." In current Internet jargon, that
means counting hits. Sponsors want reassurance, and sites want
to command top price.

Mandatory registration is one scheme that gathers user IDs and
passwords-along with demographics, in some cases-for the service
provider. This arrangement, initially employed by sites like
GNN, HotWired and others, has proved less than fruitful. Most
of us are already drowning in passwords and IDs. What's more,
if these systems are so smart, why can't they validate us based
on information from our browsers?

But why keep people out when your goal is to rope them in? Only
interested parties will stay for more than a screen's worth
or two anyway. Sites like HotWired have adopted flexible strategies,
putting enough of the information outside the "IDs required"
zone that we can, at least, get a taste without having to go
through registration first.

Meanwhile, advertisers want hits. So sites run counting programs,
which usually watch downloads of a graphic near the top of
an entry page. Companies like Nielsen and I/PRO have announced
"site monitoring and hit reporting/analysis" services to slice
and dice this traffic data.

There's only one problem. The data's meaningless. For one thing,
lots of people aren't downloading the hit-triggering items.
They may have their browsers set to "no-graphics" mode, to
expedite page-getting.

This method doesn't count users employing a non-graphics browser,
like Lynx, which doesn't even touch graphics (unless you're
using a shell-enhancer like SLIPknot or I-Comm, or finding
and grabbing images "by hand"). This situation alone invalidates
most count figures.

Yet another, more practical issue: A user may come in via the
side door, by zooming below the top page to something on a
lower page, never triggering the graphics. Add this user to
the pile of visitors the hit-counters won't catch.

Some Webwatchers out there don't rely on watching one or two
pieces, but instead watch all requests. Does this mean data
we can count on? Once again, no. Many users have their Webware
set to cache-that is, to save retrievals on disk. Many sites
use "proxies" that cache these retrieval requests. So if Users
B, C and D request a Web URL that User A's already asked for,
B's, C's, and D's requests will be fulfilled locally-from the
cached copy-instead of dragging duplicates across the Internet.

This scheme helps reduce unnecessary load on a site's Internet
connection. That's a good thing, since three or four Mosaic
users grabbing weather maps can saturate a 56-kilobit-per-second
line. But for advertisers, it means site visitors are seeing
the content they sponsor without being counted.

One solution would be Web servers and browsers that could send
back hit reports whenever a URL was examined from a local cache
instead of being retrieved again. If Webware would check a
URL's "last-modified" data automatically before deciding whether
to retrieve or use what's cached, hit-counters could get this
as by-product.

But all this still begs the question-because it's not a done
deal-are hits the appropriate currency to assess Web usage?
Even those actual download-based hits don't mean anything.
The Web is bursting with people looking at sites because of
"coolness," or just cruising at random. "Sure, it's nice to
see tens or hundreds of thousands, even millions of hits in
a Web log," says Larry Chase, president of The Online Ad Agency
(http://advert.com). "But what's the sense if all they do is
hit your home page and bounce off into the atmosphere, never
to be heard from again?"

"The trick is attracting qualified leads that eventually lead
to conversions," Chase says. Conversions may be immediate orders,
or requests for brochures or prices, but they indicate definite
interest in the company and its offerings.

Companies shouldn't read too much into hits per day, or even
hit levels after specific announcements. "Some sales cycles
are longer than others," Chase points out. "800

FLOWERS has a short sales cycle, while Liberty Mutual Insurance
has a longer one. The key is tracking from when the conversions
came, not the hits. I'd gladly pay more for a stream of qualified
prospects that are apt to turn into conversions than less for
thousands of meaningless visitors, who'll forget I ever existed
three clicks after they left my site." Any site that can report
conversions and customers, not just a lot of hits, is bound
to make the short list when a company is evaluating which sites
to sponsor.

But there may still be a role for hit-watching. For example,
good hit reporting can track derivative information, like how
many visitors become customers or how long it usually takes
(do they buy on the first or fourth visit?). This can help
a site manager re-evaluate and fine-tune the selling part of
the Web.

If you still think hits can be meaningful, here are two Internet
tools I've conceptualized: HitMaker and BrowserBeater. IMHBCO
(In My Humble But Correct Opinion), these products would render
hit-counting meaningless. HitMaker would take a list of URLs
and "hit" them with specified frequency-a great way to inflate
hit counts. It wouldn't be long before the credibility of hit
counts would suffer. The flip side of the coin would be BrowserBeater.
This anonymous Web browser would work in tandem with a proxy
server to shield your identifying information. To access ID
required sites like HotWired, BrowserBeater would "borrow"
names from appropriate lists of pre-registered IDs and passwords
for such Web sites.

The HitMaker and BrowserBeater could skew a site's hit rate
significantly. But even if they're never developed, I don't
think it would change hit-counting's diminishing status. If
sponsors are going to require "proof of value" from sites,
let's give them a meaningful metric.

Net.Media

By:
Michelle Slatalla

Phil Gramm waves an American flag in my face. He hopes it'll
remind me of him. Pat Buchanan compiled an archive of patriotic
historical documents for me to read.

And Bill Clinton? He keeps offering to show me photos of him
and Hillary ladling in a soup kitchen.

The 1996 presidential campaign season is going to be different
from all previous years, for one reason-the candidates are
setting up Internet headquarters. It makes sense, in theory,
because it finally will give them a way to bypass the media,
to shovel unlimited amounts of information directly at voters.
A candidate can put up reams of transcripts of his speeches
and put his own spin on these and other facts he disseminates.

"The Internet is perfect for Pat, because his message right
now is not getting past the media. There's a media blackout,"
says Linda Muller, the Internet coordinator for the Buchanan
campaign. "I think people are tired of the media's digestion
and regurgitation anyway. We don't need someone to tell us
what we just heard. Let us draw our own conclusions."

The candidates will rush to cyberspace in the coming months.
I expect that the Old Media-newspaper, TV, and radio reporters
will have to start monitoring the net for news. Already, dozens
of Web sites are conducting straw polls on the candidates and
on issues. Those results might become fertile fodder for news.

"Reporters are still trying to figure out what it means to us,
what it means in terms of doing a complete job covering the
campaign," says Susan Page, White House correspondent for USA
Today. "It's good when people can get information unfiltered,
like they can by watching C-SPAN, for instance. Then they don't
have to have a reporter, who may or may not be smart, filter
it."

In fact, there's a name for the act of cutting out the media
and connecting the viewer with the source. It's "disintermediation,"
one of my favorite big words. Good for using at a cocktail
party. Disintermediation is what the Internet is all about.
Newspapers are limited by space; TV broadcasts are limited
by time. But the net has no time or space constraints. You
can find as much information as you want, whenever you want
it.

New kinds of media emerging online will most likely provide
that detailed level of data. Congressional Quarterly, something
I formerly used as a reference for term papers, could become
an influential media player in this new world, via a Web site.

As far as the candidates are concerned, the Internet's highly
educated voter population-12 million Americans with a penchant
for poring through reams of raw data-are exactly who they want
to reach. This could be a very good thing for us as voters,
since we'll have more direct access to the candidates. We will
no longer have to rely on The New York Times or the networks'
newscasts to give us a quote from last night's rubber-chicken
dinner policy speech. Instead, we can log into a candidate's
home page and read the full text, then click to a hyperlink
that tells us how he voted on the same issues in the past.

For candidates trailing in the polls-those who can't afford
30-second ad spots on prime-time TV shows-the Internet will
be a great equalizer. Setting up a home page on the Web is
cheap. Case in point: A campaign volunteer designed Buchanan's
for free and hung it on a server for only 50 cents a month
per megabyte of data (the first 5 MB are free)

Candidates with deeper pockets will be able to experiment with
the Internet more intensely. For instance, a Boulder, Colo.
based Web site called Votelink (http://www.votelink.com/) is
hoping candidates will be willing to pay from $2,500 to $15,000
a month for a package that includes surveys of voters' perceptions
of major issues and the candidates' platforms. Votelink online
forums let the candidate (or his aides) sit at a computer and
answer voters' questions directly.

But let's take a deep breath before we start predicting that
online campaigns will totally transform the political landscape.
Before I looked at any of the presidential candidates' home
pages, I toyed with the idea that the net would elect the next
president. But the current state of cyberspace campaigns tempered
my enthusiasm.

So far, most of the candidates' pages are unimaginative-a click
over to AT&T's site was exciting in comparison. There's a communications
problem here if I'd rather read about how switches work than
compare the candidates' abortion platforms.

Maybe it's because the whole Web thing is new to them; after
all, they've been doing it for only a few months. The presidential
candidates figured out the first step back in mid-1995: Get
online and that will be enough of a novelty to garner a front
page story in The Wall Street Journal.

The next step will be far more difficult. These politicians,
who for the most part aren't too computer-literate themselves,
will have to learn how to use the Internet more creatively
to deliver their messages.

For now, the candidates seem content to mimic each other, with
straightforward text blocks dryly explaining their views on
abortion, the budget, taxes, and other topics that could use
some multimedia effects.

The candidates' personal idiosyncrasies manage to peek through,
of course. But I wonder if that's even something they did on
purpose. Lamar Alexander-who pundits expect will rally with
one of the more savvy net campaigns, since he's an outsider
looking for a new medium for his message-wallpapered his page
(http://www.nashville.net/~lamar/) to resemble his signature
flannel shirt. Buchanan's home page (http://www.buchanan.org
) has a definite colonial style to it, with an emblem of an
American Eagle and the Buchanan Brigade Library, an online
archive of documents that includes stories about Paul Revere,
poems, and prayers.

Clinton's family photos on the White House's official home page
(http://www.whitehouse.gov/) have the studied feel of a project
that 50 editors signed off on. I got the same feeling from
watching his biographical video at the Democratic Convention
in 1992. He has so many handlers that it is becoming increasingly
impossible for him to convey anything authentic about himself
as a person.

The same can be said for Bob Dole, judging from his home page
(http://www.dole96.com/), where the hyper-glossy images of
him smiling benignly recall those circa-1957 agricultural filmstrips
we all had to watch in high school.

Gramm's page (http://www.gramm96.org/), in comparison, is a
relief. Despite the not-exactly-original American flag motif,
it loads more quickly than other pages, and offers a straightforward
menu of Gramm's stance on dozens of issues.

"You really want to avoid looking too blow-dried," says Berkeley
Internet Connections president Eric Davis, who designed Gramm's
page. "I sort of view the Internet as a place for scrappy young
men and women, and I designed the page to appeal to people
like me, 25-year-old political junkies who know a lot about
how the net works."

Actually, if you're looking for trenchant political commentary,
there are a few very witty sites to peruse-the many parody
pages satirizing the candidates. The best fake Dole page (http
//www.dole96.org/) is subtly wallpapered with Dole pineapple
can labels. Likewise, on one fake Buchanan page (http://www.buchanan96.org
) you'll find that the candidate allegedly opposes abortion
because "every fetus is a potential taxpayer. Each abortion
reduces the tax base of the federal government."

Some political consultants think candidates will remain cautious
about their online images. For one thing, there's no hard evidence
about who exactly reads these home pages and how the information
affects voters' opinions. That kind of feedback won't be gathered
until after November.

"How many voters can you reach? And how many net users look
at the political home sites in the next 90 days? Those are
the kinds of questions that need to be answered, because for
now the candidates still feel like they can probably reach
20 times more people with TV," says Joel Benenson, a political
consultant at Penn & Schoen, which conducts polls on behalf
of the Clinton campaign.

These points are undoubtedly true. But how many of these citizens
vote?

Michelle Slatalla recently completed a suspense thriller about
the Internet.

Net.Law

By:
Mark Eckenwiler

One of the wonderful things about cyberspace, generally speaking,
is that each of us can create a new persona.

Moreover, fanciful user names and the proliferation of anonymous
remailers let us interact with other denizens of the global
electronic village in near-total anonymity. In the future,
it seems, everyone will be anonymous for 15 minutes.

But while it may be true that (in the words of the now-famous
New Yorker cartoon) on the Internet nobody knows you're a dog,
the promise of anonymity also carries an undeniable downside.
For every CancelMoose performing the public service of canceling
Usenet spam, there's another equally anonymous (but far less
benign) poster-like the CancelPoodle, canceling articles that
criticize the Church of Scientology. It's surely the best known,
or more accurately, unknown offender.

The cluster of issues surrounding online identity and pseudonymity
provokes legal questions as well. And while U.S. courts have
had little opportunity to analyze the legal status of electronic
anonymity, the case of a disgruntled Ohio taxpayer's grassroots
protest sheds some helpful light on the First Amendment's protection
of anonymous speech.

At a 1988 public meeting, Margaret McIntyre expressed her opposition
to a proposed school-tax increase by handing out leaflets.
McIntyre signed some of these leaflets "Concerned Parents and
Taxpayers" instead of using her name. Although the flier contained
no false or libelous statements, McIntyre found herself the
object of unwelcome attention-and the recipient of a $100 fine
from the Ohio Elections Commission.

Her offense? She violated an Ohio election law that made it
illegal to circulate written materials endorsing or opposing
a candidate-or even a referendum issue-without the author's
name and address. While an Ohio trial court struck down the
fine, two state appellate courts (including the Ohio Supreme
Court) decided that the First Amendment did not protect McIntyre.

On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court voted overwhelmingly (7 to
2) to strike down the statute. Writing for six members of the
Court, Justice John Paul Stevens noted that "under our Constitution,
anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious, fraudulent practice,
but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent It thus
exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights and of the
First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals
from retaliation-and their ideas from suppression-at the hand
of an intolerant society."

Even Justice Clarence Thomas, ordinarily not an overly zealous
defender of First Amendment rights, agreed with the outcome.
Thomas noted that the Federalist Papers themselves-issued under
the name "Publius"-are among the most famous pseudonymous works
in American history.

The McIntyre decision marked the culmination of a series of
Supreme Court cases that have found a right to anonymity under
the First Amendment. The Court laid the groundwork for this
modern trend in NAACP vs. Alabama (1958), holding that the
state of Alabama could not compel the NAACP to disclose its
membership list. The strong likelihood that doing so would
expose NAACP members to threats and retribution meant, in the
Court's view, that compelled disclosure would harm the members'
right to associate freely.

Two years later, the Supreme Court enlarged the scope of First
Amendment privacy in Talley vs. California. In that case, the
Court considered-and struck down-a Los Angeles ordinance prohibiting
the distribution of any anonymous leaflet, holding that a blanket
ban against anonymity violates the right to free speech under
the First Amendment.

The importance of McIntyre is that it took a much narrower law
one regulating only certain types of anonymous publications
(those advocating election causes)-and held it invalid under
the same rationale. Moreover, the reasoning in McIntyre and
its precursors applies directly to anonymity (and pseudonymity)
on the Internet.

Those who would attempt to ban anonymous e-mail or Usenet articles
often complain that such messages are of dubious worth without
author attribution. Internet service providers and online services
remain free to prohibit the sending of anonymous messages,
as a number of prominent private universities have attempted
to do. (These efforts have been largely in vain.) The McIntyre
decision, however, made it clear that a broad-based legal ban
on anonymous messages would not be shielded from constitutional
challenge.

Specifically, the majority view assesses the value of a real
signature, as opposed to a pseudonym. "In the case of a handbill
written by a private citizen who is not known to the recipient,
the name and address of the author adds little, if anything,
to the reader's ability to evaluate the document's message,"
says the Supreme Court. Moreover, as the Court observed in
a footnote, readers are not stupid. When they see an anonymous
or pseudonymous message, they can and will take its ambiguous
source into account when assessing its verity. This observation
is, of course, borne out a hundred times a day on Usenet, where
anonymous articles often meet with a skeptical reception.

According to their opponents, anonymous online messages facilitate
libel, fraud, and the sexual abuse of minors. (Indeed, last
year in an overwrought article attacking the use of anonymous
mail servers, the author of The Wall Street Journal's Personal
Technology column railed against each of these allegedly ubiquitous
problems.) What these critics often omit entirely, or give
short shrift to, are the positive aspects of anonymous speech.
With their identities unknown, political and ethnic minorities
under oppressive regimes can speak without fear of reprisal;
religious dissidents, whether criticizing a state-sponsored
religion or a vicious cult bent on harassing apostates, can
do likewise; and survivors of rape or sexual abuse can join
in anonymous online discussions.

The Supreme Court has recognized these beneficial uses. As the
justices observed in the Talley case, "anonymous pamphlets,
leaflets, brochures, and even books have played an important
role in the progress of mankind It is plain that anonymity
has sometimes been assumed for the most constructive purposes."

Moreover, the Court has adopted this rights-protective stance,
despite its recognition that anonymity can shield libel or
fraud. In both McIntyre and Talley, the Court freely conceded
that such misconduct may be punished appropriately. However,
the Court also has ruled that the First Amendment won't allow
blanket bans on anonymous speech-bans that would indirectly
punish such libelous or fraudulent offenses.

To be sure, anonymous speech may have some limitations placed
upon it. The McIntyre decision leaves open the possibility
that some narrower categories of anonymous speech could be
banned. A second, seemingly contradictory line of Supreme Court
cases upholds the power of the government to require disclosure
of the names of contributors to political campaigns. These
cases make it clear that even in the realm of political speech
at the core of First Amendment protections-the Court might
in the future endorse legislation narrowly targeted at anonymous
speech sponsored by campaign organizations.

In fact, the California Supreme Court did essentially that in
November 1994-before the McIntyre decision-when it upheld fines
imposed on Daniel Griset, a candidate for the Santa Ana, Calif.,
city council, for circulating pseudonymous fliers attacking
his opponent. The state court took pains to point out, however,
that its ruling did not address the constitutionality of banning
anonymous speech by individual citizens. The fact that the
U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in Griset's case
five days after issuing the McIntyre decision suggests its
approval of this outcome.

Finally, it is useful to note what is not protected by McIntyre.
If an anonymous remailer keeps track of its users and their
pseudonyms, nothing would prevent a U.S. court from ordering
that information to be disclosed in a related lawsuit. Nothing,
that is, unless the remailer is outside the United States,
but even that's no guarantee of safety. Last February, Finnish
police forced the administrator of the best-known anonymous
server, anon.penet.fi, to reveal the identity of one of his
users. Preserving the legal right to anonymity is one thing;
preserving anonymity itself, evidently, is another matter entirely.@

Judith H. Bernstein, Gayle Isaacs, and Ted Stevenson

Don't worry, it's probably not you-or your computer. If you're

into thinking it's more than the sum of its parts. By replacing
Windows' virtual memory system and compressing portions of
RAM, MagnaRAM2 can reputedly increase your "apparent" RAM by

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: 3Com's ISDN Modem Has Major 
Internet Impact

By:
Daniel Scolnick

One of the first of the long-awaited personal ISDN communications
devices to appear on the market, 3Com Corp.'s Impact ISDN "modem"
is available for both the Macintosh and PC, with or without
V.32-compliant (14.4-Kbps) analog fax/modem capabilities. We
tested the IBM-compatible model 3C872 with a V.34 fax/modem,
which lists for $749. 3Com's digital-only models list for $549
each. Regardless of platform, all units incorporate both the
NT-1 terminal needed to make an ISDN connection and an analog
voice port for attaching phones, fax machines, and answering
machines to the ISDN line.

No-Sweat Setup

The 3Com Impact is easy to install: You simply attach it to
a serial port just like a standard modem. (3Com highly recommends
that IBM-compatible systems be equipped with a high-speed 16550
UART and run DOS 3.1 or later; Macs should use an 8-pin serial
port and System 7 or higher.) The straightforward Windows-based
setup and diagnostic software made short work of configuring
the unit. All procedures are simple and well-documented.

Net Speed

Using the Trumpet Winsock DLL and Netscape Navigator, we connected
to the Internet using both digital (ISDN) and analog (standard)
services. The Impact worked smoothly and seamlessly with whichever
connection we chose, but that's not to say that the results
were the same: With ISDN operating at full capacity, our connection
speed was more than four times that of a typical V.34 (28.8
Kbps) connection. Here's how it works.

Uses Two Channels

The Impact lets you use an ISDN line's two 64-Kbps "B" channels
("business channels") simultaneously-in a couple of different
ways. To achieve maximum Internet throughput, Multilink PPP
(a special variant of the serial Point to Point Protocol) can
effectively combine the two into a single connection of 128
Kbps capacity.

Then again, the built-in analog phone port lets you attach and
use a phone, fax machine, answering machine, or other telephony
device in tandem with an ISDN connection on the other channel.

In fact, a feature called dynamic bandwidth allocation lets
you place an analog phone call even while a Multilink PPP connection
is active.

We've waited close to 15 years for ISDN to become a reality.
If the 3Com Impact is any indication of what we can look forward
to, the wait will not have been in vain. While this hardware
is far from budget priced, what can we say? It works seamlessly,
giving us Internet connections beyond our wildest serial dreams.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: Inside Track Turns 
CompuServe Into a Portfolio Manager

By:
Theresa W. Carey

MicroQuest, publisher of Inside Track investment software, has
a good idea: Take advantage of the commercial online provider
with the best services for personal investors and provide a
front end that tracks portfolio performance. First the positives
of this $49.95 Windows product:

The program is easy to use and has some online help built in,
though not a lot. You can set up as many portfolio groupings
as you'd like, and you can get reports on the performance of
each individually or of all your holdings together. When you
add a security to a portfolio, you have to work through several
dialog boxes that let you specify breakpoint-prices that will
generate an alert. Using a nifty feature, you can set the program
up to run even when you're not at your computer, and the alerts
can be programmed to beep your pager.

Inside Track taps into CompuServe Information Manager to get
you online; if you don't have CIM, you'll have to install it.

The program has some rough spots: If you want historical pricing,
you'll have to log on and download it one security at a time
not efficient. Resized windows revert to default size the next
time you open them-annoying. If you add an account while you
have the transaction register open, the new account doesn't
show up on the list until you close the register and open it
again-sloppy.

Inside Track has a lot of potential. It's not filled with technical
analysis bells and whistles, but it can give you well-formatted
basic information about your investments.

CompuServe members can GO QUEST to download an interactive demo.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: Getting Serious About Page Design

By:
Joel T. Patz

Cruising the Internet these days is an eye-opening experience.
With new Web sites appearing daily and familiar sites changing
style, format and content, there's an unending variety of stimuli
clamoring for attention. To attract interest and increase visits
to your site, design a Web page to grab your viewer. How to
do this in today's increasingly complex technical environment
is the subject of Web Publisher's Design Guide for Macintosh
by Mary Jo Fahey, $34.99, published by The Coriolis Group.
(WPDG for Windows 95, co-written by Fahey and Jeff Brown, is
expected by the time you read this.)

Conceived to provide the graphic artist with tools to design
outstanding Web sites, this 416-page treasure trove of advice,
insight, practical instruction, and encouragement aims to do
away with guesswork. It uses Netscape Navigator, Quark XPress
and Photoshop as basic tools.

Opening chapters discuss Web navigation using both conventional
2-D controls and futuristic-looking 3-D controls that take
advantage of VRML and 3DMF (3D Meta File). You'll learn how
to work with images and how to manipulate the time it takes
to download them.

Extensive sections on photography, animation and 3-D graphics
explain the conventions of these media and the practical differences
between print and Web graphics. Emphasis is placed on learning
from existing Web pages and leveraging the advantages of various
image formats. Tips on digital photography, QuickTime VR, Apple's
QuickDraw 3D, and CGI (Common Gateway Interface) open new worlds
for Web designers.

Accompanied by a CD-ROM loaded with tools, templates, and examples,
Design Guide provides the essential practical side of the equation.
Inspiration completes it.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: Secure Wallet Stashes Cybercash

By:
Harry Hawk

CheckFree Corp. has entered the Internet commerce fray with
a software scheme for moving credit-card data securely across
the Internet. The system, CheckFree Wallet, feels secure, is
easy to set up, and is even easier to use. Best of all, it's
free.To get set up with Wallet, first download the software
(from http://www.mc2-csr.com/vmall/checkfree/v20/software.html).
This takes about five minutes using a 28.8-Kbps modem. Then
connect to CheckFree and configure the application by registering
your name or "persona." Next, establish a password and input
the credit cards you plan to use. This one-time process might
take up to 30 minutes, but with signup out of the way, making
purchases will be far quicker than ordering through an 800
number.

Wallet works only for transactions with merchants who've adopted
the system themselves. For a listing of these merchants, point
your browser at http://www.mc2csr.com/vmall/checkfree/v20/wmalls.html.
When we checked this site early in November, only about a dozen
merchants were online, but more will be coming soon.

With Wallet, your credit-card data is never stored on the merchant's
Web site, so there's nothing online for hackers to steal.

Visit CheckFree's Web site at http://www.checkfree.com/ for
system requirements and a listing of compatible browsers. The
system currently runs on Windows and will soon run on Macs.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: From One Pipe, Many Connections

By:
William Wong

Ascend's $895 Pipeline 25 is an ISDN Ethernet router designed
for small offices and home offices (SOHO). Routers exchange
data transparently between local area networks (LANs) and remote
networks over phone lines. Thus they can connect LANs in physically
separate offices or-much more likely in the SOHO context-connect
a LAN to the Internet, giving everyone on the LAN a high-speed
net connection.

ISDN service consists not of a single digital line transferring
data at 128 Kbps, but of two 64-Kbps "B" channels that can
be used individually for data or voice connections. You can
plug phones, modems, or fax machines into the Pipeline 25 and
use them for both incoming and outgoing calls-one B channel
per call. The Pipeline 25 can even accept incoming calls when
both B channels are already in use. It simply drops one data
channel, allowing the new call to ring the phone. This gives
a single ISDN line the potential to support a small office's
entire voice and data load.

Setting up the Pipeline 25 and getting an ISDN account can be
tedious, but Ascend and ISPs like PSINet (Herndon, Va., 800
827-7482) can handle much of this for you. PSINet even sells
the Pipeline 25 at a substantial discount ($700) when setting
up a LAN account, which offers unlimited connect time at about
$250 per month.

Ascend's data compression option ($300) potentially ups Pipeline's
transmission speed to 512 Kbps when it's connected to a similarly
equipped router. For further information, contact Ascend Communications
Inc., Alemeda, Calif., 800-621-9578, http://www.ascend.com.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: A Scanner That's No Scam

By:
Joel T. Patz

It took us only five minutes to get the PaperPort Vx from Visioneer
installed and working. Adding this amazing 12- by 2.5- by 3.75
inch scanner to your arsenal of equipment will revolutionize
how you work. Feeding a document into this highly compact unit
turns it on and launches the software; before you know it-in
less than 10 seconds-an image of your document is on screen,
ready for you to work with.

The PaperPort's setup program automatically creates icons that
let it work with any of more than 100 popular applications.
To fax a document, for example, just drag it to the fax icon;
PaperPort launches your fax program and converts the document
to fax format. Drag a scanned document to the OCR icon and
it's converted into an editable file.

The quality of PaperPort's scans is quite good for general-purpose
work and can be adjusted. You can clean up documents, straighten,
trim, and crop. Special technology called SharpPage minimizes
the effects of colored backgrounds.

The Annotation Tool Bar lets you add sticky notes, fill in preprinted
forms, draw freehand and add arrows. And you can organize GIF,
JPEG, PCX and BMP files that you download from the Internet
or other online services on the "Desktop."

Included with PaperPort are PictureWorks Copier, which lets
you enlarge and reduce scanned images and adjust brightness
and contrast, and CardScan, which turns business cards into
editable database records.

PaperPort Vx's estimated street price is $369. For more information,
call Visioneer at 800-787-7007.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: This Modem Means Business

By:
Joel T. Patz

There are scads of modems out there these days, but no matter
how we use them, we all want speed and high performance. The
new Hayes Optima 228 Business Modem fulfills both criteria
and more. The advantages of data, fax, and voice capabilities
in one box won't escape power users or those just looking for
something better.

Using the latest enhanced v.42bis data-compression, Optima 228
can send and receive at throughput rates up to 230.4 Kbps.
And we had no problems connecting to Internet service providers
and America Online at its highest transmission rate, 28.8 Kbps,
over standard phone lines. It's fast.

The Smartcom Message Center LE and Modem Manager software included
with the Optima turn your computer into a professional answering
service that can distinguish voice from data and fax calls,
maintain as many as 10 mailboxes, and supply fax on-demand.

If you have Caller ID and/or Distinctive Ring, this system supports
them. You can password-protect voice messages and faxes, and
Optima 228 supports dial-back security.

Indicator LEDs adorn the front of this low-profile unit. A voice
data button and small speaker are located on top, microphone
and speaker jacks on the right side. The on/off switch, power,
serial port, line, and phone connectors are on the back. A
modem cable accompanies the Macintosh model, but PC users will
have to supply their own modem cables.

Good stuff like this isn't cheap: Optima 228's sleek performance
and first-class features will cost you $579. For more information,
call 770-840-9200 or visit http://www.hayes.com/.

Web 2000--We Show You Tomorrow's Net Today

By:
Karen Heyman

It's Jan. 2, 2000. You're finally starting to recover after
having stayed up all night to participate in a Virtual World
party, after which even your avatar felt hung over. As you
stumble to the bathroom, you trip over that pile of computer
magazines you've been intending to read, and you see NetGuide's
"Web 2000" cover. For a moment, you're foggy enough to think
you're behind in your reading by only a month. Then suddenly,
horribly, you realize just how long that pile's been stacked
up-because nobody has used the term "Web" for years. - What
will the Web be like in four years? John Fleming, a medievalist
and former chairman of the English Department at Princeton
University, looks back for inspiration in predicting the future.
"I see it as a dramatic extension of something that's already
happened-the invention of movable type" Fleming says.

The invention of movable type changed the world as it was then
known. It disseminated academic knowledge and transformed a
predominantly oral culture-in which scholars memorized entire
books-into a literate one. The combination of the 15th century's
invention of the printing press and the 16th century's translation
of the Latin bible into vernacular languages led to the Protestant
Reformation. Given these examples of the Law of Unintended
Consequences, it's safe to say that as far as the Web is concerned,
we still don't know what we have here. And we won't for at
least another generation.

A Clear Technical Sight

Ironically, the technological path of the Web is somewhat easier
to determine than its cultural impact. Espousing a preference
for "seamless applications," everyone from Tim Berners-Lee
to Microsoft marketers forecast that we'll connect directly
to the net. No longer will we be stuck in the kludgy four-step
process of open application on hard drive, log on to ISP, search
the Web for data to place into an application, manually place
data in application.

As Berners-Lee explains, "People will not have to concern themselves
with where things are stored, whether [they're] on a local
or remote disk, for example. All one will do is specify the
speed and reliability you need for access to a copy of a document,
and the machine will decide, in negotiation with other machines,
where to keep copies.

"The desktop and the Web browser should become one," Berners
Lee continues. "The folder, hotlist, and hypertext document
objects will all become objects that you can change, drag things
into, publish, and send to people." And, he says, the appearance
of objects on screen "will depend less on what software you
have bought shrink-wrapped and more on where you have been
browsing recently. As you browse, your computer will acquire
the software it needs to interact with the information you
are using.

"The important things will be: who has access to an object,
how fast, and how reliably," he says. "I might see a news article
and say to the system, 'save that,' meaning 'ensure I have
rapid and reliable access to that until I tell you otherwise.'
The system will decide how many copies to keep where. We shouldn't
be aware of file names in five years' time."

This also explains why you're reading an article entitled "Web
2000." The Internet as we currently know it, divided by application
software into distinct areas, like IRC and Usenet, will continue
to merge through extensions to Web protocols into one seamless
multimedia something. The closest thing that "something" will
bear resemblance to is the Web.

Web designer David Siegel, one of whose pages was a runner-up
for Cool Site of the Year, suggests that by 2000, we probably
won't even call it the Web, or even say "I'm going to go on
the Web." Consider the awkward phrases used when PCs were born
 "I'm going to do my paper on the computer" now sounds as redundant
as "I'm going to watch Babylon 5 on television."

The Web already has split into professional and amateur sites,
a gap that is likely to widen as HTML becomes increasingly
complicated and programmer-only tools-like Sun Microsystems'
Java-come online. Adobe's Acrobat and Netscape's tables have
only just begun to make the Web an attractive environment for
top graphic designers. As more artists design for the Web,
the visual sophistication of professional Web sites will increase.
As a result, amateur sites may start to look more and more
"homemade" by comparison.

OK, so maybe we can't make any grand proclamations about the
Web's impact on world culture until the 2030s. But until then,
there's a great deal of history to be made. Here, in the fields
of education, media, politics, and law and commerce, we depict
some of the changes instant worldwide distribution can bring
about.

Law and Commerce

The cobwebs are taking longer to leave your brain, as they have
ever since 1998, when caffeine became a controlled substance.
Desperate for a hit of Jolt, now only available by prescription,
you sit down at the keyboard of your NetBox and say "Tijuana,"
since you're in no shape for typing. Once inside the virtual
Mexican pharmacy, you see that they moved the Jolt. "Bring
me to Jolt," you mutter. A quick digital cash-card swipe through
the keyboard's built-in slot, and in a few hours, UPS makes
a no-questions-asked, same-day delivery.

Law and commerce have frequently met in many a cultural analysis,
but they are practically inextricable on the net. We've chosen
to combine these topics because so many of those we interviewed
did. There's a growing feeling that Internet commerce will
thrive-that is, if it isn't regulated out of existence.

The good news is that an estimated $7.2 billion online marketplace
will exist by 2000, according to Jupiter Communications' 1996
"Home Shopping Report." ($4.5 billion Web-based, $2.7 proprietary
online services.) But right now, some very ominous threats
hail from Washington. Says Mike Godwin of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation: [They] "are afraid of this new medium. The federal
government is afraid of digital cash, since the FBI has increasingly
relied on traceable transactions. Anti-pornographers like [Edwin]
Meese want to make distributors of online information liable
for that information."

Thus, ISPs can be held liable in their legal role as publishers.
For example, The WELL would be at risk simply for admonishing
people not to discuss Pentiums on a Macintosh forum. "Do we
want laws that force services into one or the other?" Godwin
asks. One solution is to try to define ISPs and proprietary
providers as "distributors," like bookstores and libraries.
"If NetGuide publishes libel, you can't sue Barnes & Noble,"
Godwin says. "Yet a mystery bookstore can make the editorial
decision not to sell science fiction."

The greatest unresolved online issue linking law and commerce
is copyright. The National Writers Union and the Writers Guild
of America are concerned about what ease of distribution (as
in information for sale online) will do to copyright law. However,
Lance Rose, an attorney who specializes in online law, won't
be a digital vendor for now: "I don't have my book up there,"
he says. Among the growing number of proposed answers to the
problem are digital payments, a proposal that makes the electronic
commerce crowd very happy. In fact, one writer has signed up
with NetCheque, one such digital payment system.

At IBM's infoMarket Internet division, Jeff Crigler, vice president
and managing director, describes the service's own solution
to the copyrights-in-commerce issue. "We were focused on the
wrong problem. It wasn't copying. It was payment assurance."
To remedy the problem, IBM has created what it calls "cryptolopes,"
encrypted capsules of information which require a recipient
to pay for data electronically before accessing it. This ensures
that the copyright holder keeps receiving payment whenever
material is re-distributed. A cryptolope functions as sort
of digital shrink-wrap-your browser can decrypt it, but every
time you send it on, "the price tag stays on it" and it must
be decrypted again-and paid for-by whomever you send it to.

Nevertheless Crigler admits, cryptolopes can make bootlegging
"very hard, but [not] impossible." He can easily see Southeast
Asian bootleggers distributing CD-ROMs of downloaded music
and videos. To help law enforcement, IBM also is working on
a digital watermark that will encode the address of the original
recipient into the material.

Politics

The NetBox has its advantages-it's always on, just like telephones
used to be, and the little dumb terminal was cheap. OK, it
was 500 bucks, but that's still less than the money you spent
on an ISDN card alone back in the '90s. Staring at the flat
panel screen, you marvel that anonymous electronic payment
has survived this long. Your thoughts are interrupted by a
Mary Hart-like blonde. "Remember to disable auto-avatars,"
you think, as she chirps on about your party's new campaign.
Funny, she looks an awful lot like the blonde the president
denied having sex with in that now-famous videoconference.

Call the White House press office to get a quote on the future
of the Web in politics and guess what? They'll tell you to
fax that request. Such moped-like activity from the folks who
stuck us with the term "information superhighway" notwithstanding,
Steven Singer of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government
is optimistic. He suggests we will see candidates reaching
much more directly to the electorate in 2000 by campaigning
to online communities, in much the same way they discovered
talk shows in the 1992 elections. Candidates might even circumvent
television's sound bites: Imagine a candidate saying, "No New
Taxes-See www.me.org!"

But if there is a greater opportunity for unfiltered communication,
the downside for candidates, says David King, also of the Kennedy
School, is that candidates lose wiggle room for issues that
weren't anticipated during the campaign. "If you can go and
find online transcripts, there's a direct comparison that tends
to become binding," King says. A further downside for the candidates
is that political reporters can go straight to the people,
too. Now, instead of printing just one or two damaging quotes,
entire documents can be placed in front of the world. Award
winning investigative reporter Steve Pizzo is already doing
just that over at Web Review (http://gnn.com/wr/)

Meanwhile, over at the Democratic National Committee, one very
wired Democrat has some thoughts on how to use the Web for
organizing. Dick Bell, the committee's interactive media specialist,
started out in the trenches-literally (he used to dig the holes
for candidates' lawn signs). Granted, nobody wants junk e-mail
coming from candidates, but he suggests that you can run listservs
from candidates' Web sites-it would be voluntary and non-intrusive.
"You can think of things for people to do sitting where they
are. If people don't have to drive to meetings, you can broaden
the base of who gets involved. If you go to a campaign office
now, you'll only see students and senior citizens. We could
finally include more working parents," Bell says.

The availability of Java and VRML likely will mean many simulations
could be run either by campaigns or online newspapers. Should
you vote for that new bond issue to expand the freeways? The
Los Angeles Times Web site could let you experience "before"
and "after" traffic congestion. Meanwhile, the downside of
such multimedia tools is obvious: It becomes even easier to
fudge data in a simulation.

Although it is unlikely to happen by 2000, one of the current
blue-sky dreams is electronic democracy. The biggest stumbling
block is that it would be too easy-for some of the population.
The concern is that election results could be skewed by those
who had to do nothing more in the middle of a freak early November
blizzard than sit down at their keyboards. Yet, we may still
see an even more divided electorate, split between those who
get their information from TV sound bites, and those who will
be able to read everything available about the issues on the
Web.

Education

Happy day! UPS just showed up. Ahhh, warm Jolt and cold pizza,
a nice traditional breakfast to start the new millennium. NetBox,
ShmetBox-that first hit has you pumped for some serious hardware.
Like that Intel P9 box you gave yourself for Christmas that's
got more power than a Cray, and weighs less than those clunky
old laptops. Synched to your 3-D video projectors, it's perfect
for entering the University Bio Lab and finishing your project
telerobotically-or knocking off a round of Doom 2000.

Secondary schools in Watchung, N.J., have wired all their classrooms,
teachers receive all their daily memos by e-mail, and parents
are clamoring to have all those permission slips and PTA notices
e-mailed home. Students in Princeton, N.J., are required to
complete a multimedia project in order to graduate-from sixth
grade. But Watchung and Princeton residents have some of the
highest per capita incomes in the country. In a country that
still bases most public school funding on property taxes, poor
communities will continue to lag behind. Even middle-class
communities feel it: Green Brook, N.J., which borders Watchung,
considered wiring its school system, until somebody actually
multiplied the cost of putting only one $2,000 PC in each classroom
in the district.

At a public meeting of the Advisory Council on the National
Information Infrastructure, the biggest question from the audience
wasn't access to the Internet-it was access to computers. Period.
Now, Compaq recently announced it will create a $500 box with
net access. Perhaps by 2000, it will actually exist. But even
at that price, it will be beyond the reach of many families.
Perhaps they will be able to rent dumb terminals connected
to servers as we once rented telephones, and be charged for
downloaded applications on a per-minute basis. Perhaps.

The situation is further complicated by infrastructure. The
only wiring in most American classrooms exists to turn on the
light switch. Yet there is optimism on the horizon. In October,
President Clinton called for "a high-tech barn raising" with
a four-point set of goals:

 Modern computers will be accessible to every student.

 Classrooms will be connected to one another and to the outside
world.

 Teachers will be ready to use and teach technology.

 Educational software will be an integral part of the curriculum.
Not surprisingly, it is expected that most of these goals will
be met with private-sector help. The president cited the state
of California, where by the end of the school year, all K-12
schools will have access to the Internet. He was referring
to Pacific Bell's Education First initiative.

Most encouraging of all is the creation of Tech Corps, a Peace
Corps for the '90s, according to its founder, Gary J. Beach.
Tech Corps seeks to enlist technical professionals as volunteers
to wire America's classrooms to further the spread of computer
literacy. Information about Tech Corps can be found on its
Web site (http://www.ustc.org)

Media

The caffeine has hit optimum cruising speed through your veins,
and you really should be working. But you're having too much
fun flirting with the other players and the professional characters
writers on Star Trek: A Generation of Deeply Spaced Voyagers.
Thank goodness for the simultaneous translation, which is helping
you get to know that girl from France. Oh, no! Now some nerd's
insisting on speaking Klingonese to her. Sigh. Some things
never change.

Dr. Clifford Neuman, an expert in authentication and creator
of the NetCheque system of digital payment, sits in his office
at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences
Institute. He views The Spot (http://www.thespot.com), an online
narrative site often likened to an Aaron Spelling TV show,
for the first time, and comments, "The Web phenomenon is very
much not the technologist's phenomenon but what the artists
did with the phenomenon. If I were asked 10 years ago, could
you use TCP/IP to send images like this, certainly the answer
was clearly yes. But if I'd been asked, 'Is this what we should
be doing with it?" he laughs. "I wouldn't have anticipated
this!"

Neither did Hollywood. Berners-Lee sums up the media's myopia

After the phrase "Interactive Television" in a correspondent's .sig 
file, he types, "an oxymoron surely. :-)" Hollywood producers
are now trying to make up for lost time, and by the time you
read this, any number of sites will have been approached and
deals made-or more likely, fallen through.

"I don't see the level of vision and commitment. I think a number
of them still feel it's going to be cable," says Guy Morris
of Cracks in the Web (http://www.cybertown.com/cybertown/cracks.html),
referring to Hollywood's persistent belief that a TV with a
set-top box will be the device of the future. "But they feel
that they should be doing something. The market is going to
get ahead of them, but they can always jump in once the market
is mature."

For Web creators, and for traditional Hollywood types, ambitions
lie in two directions. A Web site can be a relatively low-cost
way to try out new ideas for an episodic television series.
Previously, there was no other way to do that than to spend
millions to put a show on the air, and to hope for the best.
Now a cast and plotlines can be road-tested before a network
makes a major investment. Without revealing details, Scott
Zakarin, one of the creators of The Spot, confesses, "We see
doing this type of thing as lab work. [Hollywood] production
companies are talking to us about it all over the place."

Push The E-mail Envelop--It's the single most popular service
on the net-the universal application. But are you getting all
you should out of Internet e-mail?

By:
KEVIN REICHARD

How quickly we forget. Most Internet users-especially those
of us who have logged a zillion hours on the net-simply take
e-mail for granted. We've lost that sense of wonder and excitement
at the magic of messages that circle the globe in seconds.

It's a shame, since e-mail is the universal Internet service
the one that provided the initial impetus for the net's creation
and is still the most popular single online activity.

But the real bottom line is that many of us don't take full
advantage of the capabilities of Internet e-mail. We think
we're cool when we quote an original message in a reply or
attach a file to a message from time to time. But there's much
more to today's Internet e-mail. It's not a static technology;
it's evolving all the time. And you can find plenty of affordable
e-mail client software packages out there that can widen your
e-mail horizons-particularly the ones highlighted in this feature.

Great Expectations

What should you expect from an up-to-date e-mail package? For
starters, a well-organized user interface that doesn't require
a lot of time and effort to master. But that's just the beginning,
the sine qua non. Here's a list of important features that
good e-mail software provides:

Signatures: Signatures let you automatically affix a file or
text tag to every outgoing message. Multiple signatures are
nice because they allow you to attach one signature, say, to
your work messages and another to your "play" messages. And
there's no rule that says signatures have to be text-Emissary,
for example, lets you attach a GIF or JPEG file as your signature.
(If you think those florid 30-line signatures are bad, wait
until everyone starts attaching their photos to their outgoing
mail. Oooh, that shrinking bandwidth!)

Address books: Address books should allow you to store both
individual Internet users and groups or "mailing lists." A
really good Internet mail package will automatically add addresses
from incoming mail to your address book.

Attachments: Attachments-at least Internet mail attachments
actually are formatted to be part of the mail message, though
they appear separate to the end user. The most popular attachment
format is MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension). A mail
package that supports MIME translates a binary file into text,
putting markers at the beginning and the end of the text. The
beginning marker contains the name of the file and the specific
type of attachment (there are MIME types for audio, binary
program files, text, and more). When a mail package receives
a message with a MIME-formatted attachment, it translates the
text back into a binary file, stores it with the file name
specified in the marker (usually while giving you the chance
to specify a new file name), and displays the name of the file
as well as its size and an icon representing its originating
application.

Two other attachment formats are in common use, both similar
to MIME. BinHex is popular in the Macintosh world, but not
well-supported in the Windows and Unix worlds. Most of the
mail packages we review also support uuencode/uudecode, an
older format still widely used in the Unix world.

Inbox/outbox: Inboxes and outboxes are de rigueur for e-mail,
of course. But a single inbox for storing accumulated messages
just doesn't cut it today. You should be able to easily create
multiple mailboxes or folders, the metaphor used by most packages.
This lets you keep all work-related messages in one box, for
example, and all personal messages in another. A really up
to-date package like Quarterdeck Messaging Center allows folders
within folders, so you can store messages in a hierarchical
fashion.

Filtering/routing: Filtering or routing lets you set up rules
for dealing automatically with incoming messages. These rules
typically key off of the subject line or some part of the address
(To:, From:, Cc:), sometimes even the message text. The range
of actions that can be carried out depends on the individual
package, though most packages with this feature at least let
you route incoming mail to a specified folder based on message
contents. For example, all mail from your boss could be routed
to your ReadFirst folder. Some of the packages add to this
capability. Eudora Pro, for instance, lets you change or create
a new subject line to both incoming and outgoing mail automatically,
or send a stock reply ("I'm on vacation," for example) to every
incoming message.

Universal mailbox: Universal mailboxes let you retrieve mail
in one place from several different sources besides the Internet.
We review two such products: E-Mail Connection (for Windows)
and Claris E-Mailer (for Macintosh)

What We Reviewed

In this roundup, we didn't attempt to look at every available
Internet e-mail package. Rather, we chose products that are
both affordable and worth your serious consideration. This
means software priced at less than $100 that provides a reasonably
complete selection of up-to-date e-mail capabilities, both
basic and advanced. (There are some first-rate corporate-style
TCP/IP mail packages-Z-Mail, for example-that sell for upwards
of $300 a pop.) Our list includes both Macintosh and Windows
applications, and one that runs under DOS as well. (The Windows
apps all run under Windows 3.1 and Win95.)

To use any of these packages, you'll need a direct connection
to the Internet, either through a dial-up SLIP or PPP account
(using accompanying software, such as Trumpet Winsock or MacTCP)
or a direct network connection. Some of these packages, such
as Emissary or Quarterdeck InternetSuite, contain the software
needed to make this connection, but most don't.

You'll also need an account on an Internet mail server that
runs either POP3 or IMAP. (The server is where your incoming
mail is stored.) IMAP is the newer of the two protocols and
offers some advanced features (both for users and system administrators)
that POP3 and the older POP2 do not. (For example, with an
IMAP server, you can choose to leave mail on the server or
download it to your local system, whereas with POP servers,
all mail is downloaded automatically when you log on.) None
of the packages we review is written specifically to take advantage
of the IMAP protocol, though all work just fine with IMAP servers,
since there's backward compatibility between IMAP and POP3.
Your service provider or system administrator may provide you
with two e-mail addresses: a POP3 or IMAP server for incoming
mail, and an SMTP server for outgoing mail. Very often, though,
these two addresses will be the same.

And speaking of service providers, some of the publishers of
packages we review here, most notably Quarterdeck Corp., have
arrangements with service providers that simplify or eliminate
many of the configuration problems encountered in connecting
directly to the Internet.

So, peruse the reviews that follow, and see our sidebars on
free e-mail ["Internet Free-Mail," page 74] and mail service
provided by commercial online services ["The Online Service
Connection," page 66], and set yourself up to get the most
out of this wonderful resource-one of the 20th century's great
contributions to communication. Oh, and don't forget to drop
us an e-mail (netmail@netguide.cmp.com). It is, after all,
ridiculously easy and inexpensive.

Claris E-Mailer

Claris E-Mailer 1.0.2 is a universal e-mail inbox, for the Macintosh
only, with links to the Internet, America Online, CompuServe,
eWorld, and RadioMail. Claris E-Mailer works from a dial-up
Internet connection (in this case, using MacTCP) to check for
messages.

Perhaps the most compelling reason to look at Claris E-Mailer
is its simplicity. You won't drown in a sea of confusing configuration
options when dealing with E-Mailer, and you'll appreciate the
tidy interface. All of E-Mailer's elements (inbox, outbox,
filing cabinet, address book) are organized by tabs in a single
browser-style interface. Moving between elements is simply
a matter of clicking the tabs.

Once you've mastered the interface, you've pretty much mastered
E-Mailer. To sort your messages, you click a column; the sorting
is keyed to the entries in that column. Click the Date column,
for instance, and the entries will appear in the order they
were received. You can sort in ascending or descending order.

The address book is similarly easy to use. You can set up both
individual and group addresses. Addresses are presented in
a single list, regardless of source (Internet, AOL, etc.).
If your address list is long, you can use the Filter feature
to locate an address by typing in the first few letters of
a name. Once you've located the desired address, you can either
create a pre-addressed message or drag and drop the address
into the message space.

E-Mailer also can be set up to process incoming mail automatically
based on the contents of the message. For instance, E-Mailer
automatically could forward all messages from a particular
correspondent to your assistant. While you're on vacation,
E-Mailer can send an "I'm on vacation" response to all incoming
messages.

And, of course, there are the things that Internet mail junkies
would expect, such as MIME attachments, quoted replies, and
automatic signatures.

For Mac-based net surfers who want an easy-to-use Internet mail
package, E-Mailer is a good choice-you'll be up and running
in no time, and with the program's powerful routing feature,
you can make sure your mail always gets delivered to the right
place.

E-Mail Connection 3.0

Once you become more than a dabbler in the online world, you
quickly tire of switching between software packages to retrieve
your mail from the several services you inevitably find yourself
using. You writhe in despair at tracking down messages saved
among different mail packages.

That's why ConnectSoft's E-Mail Connection 3.0-the original
universal mail package-is such a powerful tool for busy Windows
based e-mail users. In addition to handling Internet mail,
it lets you send and receive mail via such services as CompuServe,
MCI Mail, America Online, and Prodigy, and/or over a local
area network using any of the popular transport protocols.
You even can use E-Mail Connection to handle your faxes.

This not only makes e-mail easy to get at, it makes mail usage
transparent to end users; you don't need to think about which
mail system you're interacting with. When E-Mail Connection
logs on to the Internet and downloads your Internet e-mail,
it's automatically sent to your inbox along with all other
incoming mail. (This is mostly a blessing, but also a minor
curse: It would be great to be able to set up multiple inboxes
and route mail to them depending on who sent it or where it
came from.) The same holds for replies: The sender's electronic
address is logged in E-Mail Connection's address book automatically,
and your reply just goes there.

E-Mail Connection compares favorably with any of the dedicated
packages reviewed here. It handles all the basic functions,
such as managing MIME file attachments, with aplomb. (For example,
a received message clearly shows all attachments by file name,
file size, and originating application.) And if you're working
with a lot of mail, you'll appreciate the advanced search capabilities.
You can search through a specific folder or all folders, seek
messages from a specific source or all e-mail sources, and
look for specific text strings in the text or the Subject field.
Finally, it's one of the few packages to offer sophisticated
message security-in this case, RSA encryption.

As for price, E-Mail Connection just makes our cutoff for affordable
Internet e-mail. But if you work a lot with e-mail from multiple
sources, you'll find that it's worth every penny. (Alternatively,
you can grab the free Version 2.5.03 of E-Mail Connection,
scaled down for Internet-only usage, from ConnectSoft's Web
site.)

Emissary

Emissary 1.00 from The Wollongong Group Inc. is like a Volkswagen
Beetle that's been outfitted with the cockpit of a Boeing 747
 There's a lot of control provided for what is essentially
a simple task, but it's the perfect setup for those who are
into precision flying.

The design philosophy behind Emissary is clear-that the distinctions
among the Web, mail, and news are mostly artificial, and that
most users would benefit from software that combines these
functions into a unified interface. By and large, this approach
succeeds, but it makes for a rather busy interface-hence the
Beetle/747 comparison.

To begin with, the modest downside of this design philosophy
 First, you have to wade through a lot of interface to get
at your mail, and second, if you're already committed to another
Web browser or newsreader, it simply may not be worth the effort
to bring Emissary onstage just for e-mail.

If the interface doesn't turn you off, though, there's a lot
to like about Emissary's holistic approach to the Internet.
All the basics are here, some executed with flair. For example,
there's a well-designed address book, complete with alias and
mailing list capabilities. If you have a lot of messages, Emissary
lets you search through them efficiently.

Other, more advanced tools can make your life even easier. These
include the automatic message filter, which can route messages
from a particular sender or with a specified subject to the
folder of your choice. You also can exercise extensive control
over how Emissary interacts with your mail server, even to
the point of specifying the lengths of timeouts if the server
fails to respond to various portions of a communications session.

There's even a diagnostic function that lists the version numbers
of your various Emissary resource files (or DLLs), a feature
that will be handier in the future as more advanced versions
of Emissary are made available.

Emissary is one of those e-mail software packages that's in
your face, challenging you to get the most out of it. And even
though you might be confused, even annoyed, by the interface
when you first encounter it, you'll find it's well worth mastering.

Eudora

Available in both Windows and Macintosh versions, Qualcomm Inc.'s
Eudora is probably the single most popular Internet e-mail
package among PC users.

A note here about Eudora's several versions: Eudora Pro is the
commercial software; Eudora Light is freely distributed by
Qualcomm Inc. at ftp.qualcomm.com and is also bundled by Netscape
Communications in its Netscape Navigator Personal Edition.
Eudora Light lacks a number of important features-such as spell
checking-that are found in Eudora Pro. Incidentally, the Macintosh
and Windows versions of Eudora are identical in both the Light
and Pro versions.

A quick tour of Eudora Pro shows why it's so popular: Installation
is a breeze. All you need to do is enter your server addresses
and your own user information. To create mail, you select New
Message and enter the appropriate addressing information (recipient,
any carbon copies, subject). If you want, you can specify a
file to be attached, and you have your choice of MIME, BinHex
(popular in the Macintosh world) or uuencode (popular in the
Unix world) formats. You also have a choice of signatures,
as Eudora supports both main and alternative signature files.
When you're done writing your mail, Eudora Pro brings up its
spelling checker and the completed message is then shipped
automatically to a mail server. Eudora will check your mail
server at regular intervals if you like, but you also can elect
to check on the spur of the moment. In addition, you can set
up Eudora Pro to route mail to specific folders, so that you
can, for instance, send all messages from your significant
other to your personal folder.

So what would make Eudora Pro perfect? For starters, a better
search mechanism, as Eudora Pro allows only for simple text
searches, and does not provide wildcards or allow you to winnow
down search criteria (such as searching only through the inbox)

If and when Qualcomm makes this improvement, it will be welcome.
Meanwhile, Eudora Pro is about as good as it gets in the Internet
e-mail world, in both its commercial and freeware incarnations
so good that you probably won't even mind the less-than-stellar
search tools.

NetShark 1.0.4

Integrating a Web browser with a mail module makes perfect sense,
as these are the two most heavily used Internet services. That's
the philosophy behind InterCon Systems Corp.'s NetShark 1.0.4,
available by download in both Windows 3.1 and Macintosh versions
which, though not identical in organization and interface details,
do offer similar features. (Be warned that this product is
updated frequently. Even as NetGuide went to press, new versions
were being posted on InterCon's Web site.)

NetShark's mail/browser integration is complete on the Mac:
To access the mail functions, you simply choose Mailbox while
in the Web browser, whereupon you can send and receive mail.
Under Windows, however, NetShark Mail and WebShark (the Web
browser) are separate, but linked, applications.

In either case, once you get to the mail package, you'll find
that NetShark Mail is a pretty complete offering. The important
Internet mail tools, like signature files and MIME attachments,
are all supported. You can sort your messages by a number of
criteria, such as date, order received, status, and subject.
And the package has some fairly advanced search tools. For
instance, you can search for all messages that either do or
don't contain a specific text string, and you can use the *
and ? wildcards to expand your search.

NetShark also provides a sophisticated set of automated processing
actions that can be applied to mail. For instance, you can
use wildcards (*) or other expressions to expand or narrow
a criterion that triggers an action. These actions can involve
automatically filing messages to specific folders, deleting
messages, or marking them as read. About the only function
it can't perform is respond automatically to every incoming
message when you're away or on vacation (a feature that Claris
E-Mailer offers)

For Mac users, NetShark is a powerful, easy-to-use mail package
that easily rivals anything else on the market. For Windows
users, the integration of mail and Web browser is a hard one
to pass up-considering the many amenities NetShark Mail offers.

Pegasus Mail

One of the neatest things about the Internet is seeing the contributions
that individuals have made to the community at large. A good
example is David Harris' creation, Pegasus Mail 2.10, which
comes in Windows, Macintosh, and DOS versions. Not only is
P-Mail a first-rate product, it's free, and Harris keeps it
up to date by regularly releasing new and more powerful versions.
You have to order the manual (for a reasonable cost), and technical
support is offered via e-mail.

Free products are inherently attractive, but P-Mail's popularity
ultimately rests on the fact that it's a pretty darn good piece
of software. Designed to run in both the Internet and Novell
NetWare environments, P-Mail has lots of power when it comes
to configuration and usage, offering features like mail filtering
(you can route all messages from Bill Clinton to a folder called
President, for instance), advanced configuration options (like
not automatically downloading mail that exceeds a certain size),
and more standard features such as signature files, spelling
checker, and quoted replies. You can choose your favorite method
of encoding outgoing attachments; MIME, uuencode, and BinHex
are all supported. It even lets you encrypt mail for better
security-still an unusual capability.

P-Mail also has a unique feature called noticeboard, which is
akin to a low-rent Lotus Notes-type bulletin board on a local
area network. With noticeboard, users can add comments to a
threaded conversation, and discussions can be nested within
other conversations. Noticeboard discussions are organized
in the same manner as mail folders, so users can switch between
them easily.

Unfortunately, P-Mail's power is hidden behind some very unhelpful
icons and a sometimes-confusing organization. Also, you'll
want to know at least a little about how networking and Internet
mail work before you tackle a P-Mail configuration. Still,
with a willing spirit (and some help from the adequate documentation),
you'll find that P-Mail is a surprisingly satisfying piece
of software.

Pegasus Mail 2.10; freeware; http://www.cuslm.ca/pegasus/

Quarterdeck

You can get lost in the Quarterdeck Message Center (which ships
as part of Quarterdeck InternetSuite 1.0), but in a good way.
Quarterdeck Corp.'s QMC offers a wealth of configuration options
beyond the basic mail tools we expect to see in an up-to-date
package.

A tour of the Preferences dialog box shows why: Don't like how
QMC is displaying the messages in your inbox? You can choose
to sort by sender, date, size, or subject. Want to poll for
new mail every minute? You can change the default setting (10
minutes) to suit your needs. Want to be notified with a beep
when mail arrives? You can add a beep. Want to set the timeouts
on your mail-server communications to make sure you're not
waiting too long for a balky server? You can tweak the default
(normally 60 seconds) to fit your technology. Want to hang
onto your trashed messages for a week or so? You can specify
the number of days mail is allowed to sit in your trash folder
before it's purged.

If some of these settings seem nit-picky, remember that for
experienced e-mail users, those minor details can make a major
difference. About the only important detail missing from QMC
is a way to search through message text for a specific string
(which is almost mandatory for those who work with lots of
messages). There's even a utility for working with TAR (Tape
ARchive) files, a Unix archiving format common on the Internet.

Of course, you don't need to be detail-oriented to get the benefits
of QMC; if you're just looking for an inexpensive, easy-to
use mail package, QMC can give you what you need right out
of the box. Quarterdeck InternetSuite as a whole is quite the
bargain, encompassing QMC as well as the highly customized
Quarterdeck Mosaic and a Winsock that's easy to configure.
If you want a quick entre into Internet e-mail, InternetSuite
should be near the top of your shopping list.

3.x or better, 20 MB free hard-disk space, 4 MB of RAM, VGA

SPRY Mail

ou probably don't automatically think of e-mail when you think
of Internet In A Box, but SPRY Mail, its mail module, is an
easy-to-use and surprisingly full-bodied personal e-mail program
that stands quite nicely on its own. It lacks some features
business users are likely to want-routing, searching, and sorting
but if you receive a moderate volume of mail, you may find
I-Box 2.0's $80 price worth it for the mail alone.

SPRY Mail certainly won't dazzle you with a wealth of advanced
features, but it's a true load-and-go package. All the important
functions are right at your fingertips immediately on installation;
just supply the name of your mail server and SPRY Mail does
the rest. If you don't have a Winsock or TCP/IP stack installed,
you can use the dialer provided with I-Box. Once you receive
mail, you can use the handy toolbar icons to forward, print,
or reply to it. Mail storage is in standard folders.

SPRY Mail supports multiple address books, which is convenient
if you're handling a slew of addresses and want to organize
them thematically. The address book files can be copied from
machine to machine, and you can send mail to all members of
an address book at once.

Those who want to get more out of the package can delve further
into mail configurations, deciding which signature file to
use and how often to check for incoming mail. You also can
change the location of your mail inbox, which can be convenient
when using I-Box over a network.

The absence of certain features, however, makes SPRY Mail a
questionable choice for business-oriented use. For example,
there's no mechanism for searching through your messages. There's
one weakness from the personal user's point of view as well
 You have to work online. People with networked connections
probably don't care whether they're connected while they compose,
read, and reply to mail, but private users who are paying a
service provider would rather do these things offline.

Still, for right-out-of-the-box performance, SPRY Mail has few
equals. And when you want to expand your e-mail horizons, SPRY
Mail will help.

The Bottom Line

By:
Kevin Reichard

Internet e-mail is a strong, mature software field. Realistically,
any of the reviewed packages here should serve most of your
needs; we picked them that way. But these are our choices:

Cross-platform: Eudora Pro for the Mac and PC. If yours is a
mixed shop, large or small, you really can't go wrong with
Eudora Pro: Its interface is the best of the packages reviewed,
but it doesn't sacrifice any power.

Macintosh: Claris E-Mailer. While there are a few things we'd
like to see added to Claris E-Mailer-most notably a way to
search through the contents of your inbox-it's nonetheless
a solid choice for Macintosh users.

Windows: E-Mail Connection. This is the strongest package we
reviewed, both in terms of ease of use and flexibility. It's
now a truly universal inbox, encompassing both e-mail and fax
communications.

The Online Service Connection

By:
Kevin Reichard

Wide-area e-mail has been available for many years to subscribers
of dial-up online services-most notably CompuServe. Despite
the easy availability of affordable Internet connections today,
online services still handle a lot of e-mail-including Internet
e-mail. How good a job do these services do with Internet e
mail? What are the trade-offs?

You can send e-mail across the Internet from any of these online
services, and receive it, too. Furthermore, these services
have recently cleaned up their addressing schemes (a significant
bugaboo in the past), allowing you to use a "real" name for
your Internet address (like Kreichard@prodigy.com) as opposed
to vendor-assigned service IDs (like 73670,

3422 on CompuServe). On the other hand, of this group, only
America Online can match the varied features found in full
fledged Internet mail service provided by the packages reviewed
here. Here are capsule summaries of the capabilities of the
Big Five:

 America Online is the most evolved when it comes to Internet
e-mail, by virtue of its support for MIME attachments-though
it can handle only one attachment per message. In addition,
AOL effectively integrates Internet addresses into its address
book, treating them just like standard AOL addresses. Thus,
you can create mailing lists in AOL that let you send hundreds
of messages to the Internet.

 CompuServe supports only straight text in Internet e-mail messages.
It doesn't support file attachments at all, but you can send
individual binary files across CompuServe's Internet gateway
as separate messages. CompuServe subscribers use a number of
different front ends (WinCIM, MacCIM, and Golden ComPass),
so there's no standard handling of address-book matters.

 MCI Mail supports MIME-formatted text attachments to messages,
but chokes on other MIME formats, such as image or audio files.
However, MCI Mail automatically uuencodes and uudecodes file
attachments sent via the Internet. Depending on the front end
you're using (like CompuServe, the service is text-based at
its core), you can create mailing lists that incorporate Internet
addresses along with other addresses.

 Microsoft Network uses the Exchange client provided in Windows
95 to send and receive Internet mail, but doesn't fully take
advantage of it: Exchange supports MIME attachments when used
with an Internet mail server, but the Microsoft Network itself
doesn't support MIME. However, it's very convenient to have
all your e-mail centered in one client, which is the biggest
advantage of MSN and Exchange.

 Prodigy features the best message-creation tools among the
online services-its address book doesn't differentiate between
Internet and Prodigy users, and there's even a spelling checker.
However, Prodigy doesn't yet support MIME attachments, which
means you're limited to text-only messages.

Internet Free-Mail

By:
Kevin Reichard

All e-mail packages reviewed in this feature require you to
have a direct connection to the Internet, and millions of you
are paying service providers for such connections, anywhere
from $5 to $50 a month. But this is America and entrepreneurs
are vying for your business (so to speak) by offering you Internet
mail service completely free of charge.

The catch? Advertising.

At press time, two companies-FreeMark Communications, in Cambridge,
Mass. (http://www .freemark.com/), and Juno Online Services,
in New York City (http://www.juno.com/)-are busy launching
free Internet e-mail services. By the time you read this, both
expect their services to be up and running. We checked out
the interactive demos at each vendor's Web site and looked
at the beta versions of their client software.

On the face of it, these companies really do appear to be offering
free e-mail: There are no limitations on the number of messages
you can send or receive; there are no long-distance phone charges
for accessing your mail; and there are no online charges. Indeed,
even the access software is free.

In both cases, however, your every e-mail-related move will
be accompanied by some form of advertising. With FreeMark,
each message you send will be "sponsored" by an advertiser,
and the advertiser's logo will be present as you retrieve,
read, and write messages. At the bottom of both outgoing and
incoming messages, you'll find links to offers from advertisers,
online coupons, or some other promotional messages.

Advertising will be the prime source of Juno's revenue as well,
though the company promises to supplement this with some online
marketing research, too

Your Money's Worth

Technically speaking, neither system is true Internet mail.
You're not directly accessing the Internet; instead, you dial
into the FreeMark or Juno computer to upload or download mail
not unlike the MCI Mail system.

Further, you're limited by the capabilities of the proprietary
software supplied by the service providers. FreeMark isn't
planning to support file attachments, and if the online demos
are an accurate indication, neither company will support quoted
replies or signatures. The only concession to standard Internet
mail conventions will be an address book.

Finally, both services are limiting their offerings to the Windows
world, though Juno says it may develop a Mac version if there's
enough interest.

Pre-Fab Home Pages--The major online services want to give you
a space on the Web-no programming required

By:
Joel T. Patz

Early in the Internet game, getting a Web page up and running
was technically complex. You had to delve into HTML code just
to create a sentence someone could read online. Learning the
protocols for Web page layout was confusing. And how on earth
were you going to be sure that links would really take surfers
where they were supposed to go? Without a lot of dedicated
equipment-and "extra" time that few of us have-personal Web
pages were little more than a fantasy.

Well, times change and fantasies become realities. The three
major online services-America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy
have paved the way, not just to creating Web pages, but to
putting them on the Web without setting up your own server
or signing on with an Internet service provider. HTML knowledge
has been replaced by filling in the blanks, some basic word
processing skills, and simple point-and-click operations.

Prodigy

scratchpad 1.0, the tool Prodigy provides for building personal
Web pages, is available to any service member using the onliner's
browser and following the directions on its Web home page.

Getting started couldn't be easier. Simply enter your name,
a user ID (which becomes part of your personal URL), a password,
your location, and your Prodigy ID-and you're off and running
with your first Web page. You begin by giving it a title and,
as suggested in a text box that automatically appears on your
screen, supplying details you want people to know.

Suppose, for example, you're a cook and want to develop an online
recipe file. Here's your chance to share your favorite dishes
and discuss results and refinements with others. Include a
couple of your favorite food-related URLs to add interest for
your readers and click Submit. You've done it.

You can create up to seven separate Web pages on Prodigy and,
if you want, develop an index that links the items in them.
There's a template that lets you effortlessly share your 10
favorite Web sites, and another where you can profile the best
clubs, restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, museums, etc.,
in your town. Still another template lets you share details
about your business. If you're curious about how many visits
your site gets, you can add a counter to any page. (The help
file will tell you how.) It's updated automatically.

Prodigy provides an Image Library-containing animals, flags,
and signs of the zodiac, to name a few-so your page can include
graphics from the get go. A variety of symbols is available
to call attention to hypertext links, such as a MailTo symbol
for e-mail; sound and movie symbols to identify links to audio
and MPEG video clips at other sites; and even symbols to indicate
the size of an image or file to be downloaded.

And while the current version of Scratchpad doesn't let you
include video or sound clips in your pages, you can include
JPEG, GIF and virtually any type of bitmap image files.

With Scratchpad, you don't have to worry about the mysteries
of special syntax and layout provisions. The templates do away
with all major design chores. To establish a link to another
document, just fill in the URL field. Headlines, section headings,
and body text are formatted automatically. If you include your
e-mail address, Scratchpad will tag it so visitors can send
you mail simply by clicking.

That Special Touch

Copying your documents to a floppy disk (which can be done using
the Prodigy browser's Save button) lets you see the HTML tags
added to your document. You'll find this interesting and instructive.
Those who know some HTML and want to refine documents by adding
their own special touches can use the Freeform template to
paste in any material created with an HTML editor.

Some size restrictions apply to Prodigy-based personal pages
 Text boxes (individual blocks of text) are limited to about
4,600 bytes each, and a page can't contain more than 20 KB.
Each Prodigy member is allocated 1 MB of free server space
and can get up to 10 MB for an as-yet undetermined nominal
charge.

You must be logged on to the Prodigy service to build your Web
page, and the regular charges against your monthly membership
apply. If you exceed your allowable hours, the extra time is
billed to your account. In contrast, CompuServe and AOL let
you work offline to save money.

COMPUSERVE

the beta version of CompuServe's Home Page Wizard, which we
tested shortly before its release, does a first-rate job of
helping you create sophisticated-looking Web pages.

A series of dialog boxes gets you started. Give your page a
title, then fill in personal information, such as name, city
of residence, occupation, and hobbies. This data, which can
be displayed, if you choose, at the top of your home page,
is to give visitors to your site some idea of who you are.
With these prelims out of the way, you can choose to work with
either a blank page or a template-a prefabricated page that
you'll modify as you develop your own. If this is your first
Web page, templates provide a welcome assist.

Pull-down menus plus a selection of icon buttons across the
top of the screen constitute the major page-development tools.
The buttons automatically apply HTML formatting to elements
of your document. You can either click on a button to activate
its function or drag and drop it to the place on the page where
you want to work. Either way, a dialog box opens to accept
your input.

Want to create a headline? Drag the Headline icon to the top
of the page; in the Edit Headline dialog box, type your text
and click on the Styles tab to choose the desired type size
and alignment (left or center). Do the same to add body text
(except that you don't have a choice of type size). With text,
you can opt to have items centered or bulleted. Adding images
is easy, too. Choose a file from the limited selection provided
in Home Page Wizard, or import your own GIF or JPEG image.
Home Page Wizard lets you adjust image height and width by
pixels.

To forge links to other parts of your Web document, first enter
the link text, which is what visitors will click on to make
the jump; then click on the internal location, such as page
two of a multipage document. Setting up a link to another Web
site involves no more than supplying link text, typing in the
URL of the other site, and clicking OK.

If you want to get reactions and comments from your readers,
you can set up an e-mail link that provides them with a pre
addressed message form that will automatically go to your e
mailbox.

To view your page, click the Test button, which launches your
Web browser. When everything is just as you want it, click
the Publish button or select Publish Pages from the File menu.
The Publishing Wizard takes care of the rest.

The Home Page Wizard is available for free download, and CompuServe
members can place their Web pages online at no cost during
an introductory period. Remember: You'll have to pay the usual
connect time charges during the publishing, or posting, process.

AMERICA ONLINE

Compared to the fill-in-the-blanks simplicity of Prodigy's Scratchpad
offering, and the drag-and-drop richness of CompuServe's Home
Page Wizard builder, America Online's initial foray into personal
Web page building technology is problematic. The tool itself,
GNNpress, is a product of NaviSoft (a recently acquired AOL
subsidiary); we looked at a beta version. Although you can
download GNNpress from AOL, you'll need an account on GNN (Global
Network Navigator, AOL's Internet service subsidiary) to publish
your page; your AOL membership is of no use here.

Editor or Creator?

The program is billed as a combination authoring tool and Web
browser, but we found it to be more a first-generation HTML
editor than an easy-to-use Web page creator. The current version
is not intuitive for first-time users, and even fairly seasoned
Web page authors probably would prefer not to hassle with the
complexities imposed by GNNpress. For example, during our testing,
we were frequently unable to reach the GNNpress server using
its browser.

Creating a Web page with GNNpress is a lot like using a word
processor. As you work, you choose the appearance factors of
your document-heading sizes, bulleted lists, and paragraph
formatting, for example. And if you're editing a document,
just highlight text and delete it, or highlight it and begintyping
your new text.

Pull-down menus control most formatting. If you want to render
a title in bold characters, highlight it, choose Format, and
select Bold. Menu choices let you remove formatting, unlink
items, and create numbered, un-numbered, or "definition" lists
(like glossaries)

Spicing It Up

You also can draw borders around elements and include preformatted
text on your page. Dress up your page with horizontal rules
that span the entire page, but there's no way to specify their
placement or define their thickness.

GNNpress lets you create multiple pages and establish links
between them, but creating links to external Web sites, while
possible, isn't simple. To do this, you have to use the built
in browser to navigate to the desired page, click the CopyURL
button, create the link on your Web page, and paste in the
copied name. While it ensures accurate http addresses, it's
a lot of work-especially if you knew the address already.

You can build an e-mail form by copying text from a sample page
included with GNNpress, but again, there's no simple way to
create one on your own. If you wade through the HTML code,
you'll find that the mailto: command is used to do this, but
we couldn't find it explained in the documentation.

On the other hand, a number of GNNpress features are perfectly
easy to implement. For example, you can highlight a plain text
list and instantly convert it into a bulleted or numbered list.
Further, multiple text lines can be block indented (click BlockQuote
format), block indented with italics (Address format), or single
spaced (Preformatted format). Simple commands turn text into
bold, italic, underlined, or fixed pitch. And you can easily
import JPEG and GIF files.

Link-Watch

GNNpress provides one especially cool feature-the Check Links
option, which launches the GNNpress browser and checks to make
sure that all jumps are functioning as they should. The program
also includes some clip art, but it falls mostly into the bullets
and arrows category.

GNNpress' documentation is adequate, but not exceptional. Since
the help system is an HTML document rather than a Windows help
file, searching for a topic is slower than in a typical Windows
app-despite the file's table of contents. And while AOL lets
you design offline, you must be online to use the help system,
thus incurring the standard AOL fee.

Tips for Fledgling Pagemasters

By:
Joel T. Patz

As you plan your personal Web page, keep in mind the following
conventions and requirements that affect Web authors at all
levels:

 Storage space. Text doesn't take up a lot of room, but graphics
and especially sound files can eat up the disk space the provider
allots per user. Be sure to first find out what your storage
allotment is. Next, check the size of any images and sound
clips you're considering including on your page. Then you can
fiddle with the balance of space requirements to come up with
your best possible page.

 Considerate content. A Web page is not the place to insult
and alienate people. (If you must indulge in rancor, Usenet
is a more appropriate venue.) Hence, it's a good idea to avoid
potentially objectionable material, such as obscene or sexually
explicit language, bigoted or racist assertions-not to mention
anything outright illegal. Copyright infringement is another
area to be wary of: If you're using someone else's material,
make sure you're free to do so and give them credit for it.

 Design integrity. You face built-in design constraints in creating
a Web page, mostly imposed by the limitations of HTML. For
example, you can't change the font style for different paragraphs
in the same document. But as HTML continues to develop-and
HTML 3.0 is a big improvement-different backgrounds, colors,
fonts, lines, and more complex audio and graphics elements
will be added to our design palettes.

 "Browser shift." Different browsers see Web pages differently,
depending on which HTML features they support. As a result,
not everyone who views your page will necessarily see it exactly
as you do, particularly where special effects are concerned.
Some browsers might have difficulty reproducing backgrounds
and colors; tables and forms might pose a problem for others.
Solution: Test your page with several browsers. Usually, you'll
get a clear indication that major parts of a page aren't viewable
when you call it up; you might see an icon, for example, where
a full graphic display is supposed to appear.

Bridging the Gender gap--Sometimes it seems there are about
as many women online as you'd find in a Foreign Legion camp.
An expert on the topic explores some causes of the online gender
gap.

By:
JUDITH BROADHURST

The numbers are perplexing. Though women represent approximately
51 percent of the U.S. population, a recent Nielsen study shows
a 2-to-1 male/female ratio of Internet users. Other recent
studies of both online services and Internet users report that
women represent between 30 and 37 percent of total users. Though
these numbers reflect a significant improvement over 1994 statistics,
which pegged the female online population at 15 to 20 percent,
they're hardly encouraging. n One knowledgeable observer questions
the validity of the statistics. "What does that mean?" asks
Ruth Kaplan, a research assistant at the Institute for the
Future, a think tank based in Menlo Park, Calif. "Do they mean
women who have been online once? And does that mean they're
going online to download a map of San Diego because they're
going there next week, or are they participating in a Usenet
newsgroup about a health problem they have?"

On the surface, this gender gap doesn't make sense. After all,
even if you buy into the stereotype of women as technophobes,
that doesn't explain the disparity that exists even on the
easiest-to-use commercial services, such as America Online,
eWorld, and Prodigy. And even though more women are online
and using these big-name services, they're still not taking
full advantage of what's there, or using resources resourcefully.

"I can't stand the Internet. I see it as a huge time-waster,"
says a disillusioned America Online subscriber, who actually
has never used the Internet. She requests anonymity, however,
because her job requires her to eventually master such tools.

Nurture Fights Nature

Part of the reason women find themselves disenchanted with the
online experience stems from cultural influences.

Men tend to see computers as technotoys, which means fun, but
women think of them as mere machines related to work. These
contrasting mindsets developed during childhood, says Dr. Mary
Frances Stuck, a sociologist and assistant dean of arts and
sciences at the State University of New York at Oswego. "Boys
tear things apart and use them in different ways than what
they were intended for," Stuck says, "but girls tend not to
explore. They're very task-oriented."

Children often are introduced to computers by shred-em and shoot
em computer games, which turn girls off. According to a recent
Find/SVP study, however, this pattern appears to be shifting
because women-now more involved in buying and using home computers
tend to choose educational rather than game software for their
children.

Nevertheless, the prevailing attitude is still that computers
are "a male thing." "These kinds of biases are deeply ingrained
in our society," says Chuck Huff, an associate professor of
psychology at St. Olaf College, in Northfield, Minn.

And in the workplace, women largely are reticent about viewing
the computer as more than office equipment. The sample of women
we interviewed repeatedly say that they feel guilty if they
use their computers at work for anything other than what is
obviously "work." They seldom see browsing online services
for information as "real" work. Instead, many of them think
of it as the equivalent of chatting with a friend by phone
on company time.

But all that's just background for the nine principal factors
that inhibit women's online involvement. Admittedly, most of
them involve misperceptions and stereotypes:

1. Lack of time

To many women, computers are hardly a necessity. At work, differences
in time-management styles play a large part in this misperception.
"Men delegate far more, thus free up time," Stuck says. "Men
delegate, women do." And at home, "It's because women are still
doing the dishes and putting the kids to bed and doing the
errands during the evening hours when most people are online,"
says Janet Attard, who leads business forums on both GEnie
and America Online.

2. Dollars don't make sense

Then there's the combination money-indulgence factor. "Computers
are perceived as a luxury technology, and women still don't
make as much as men, even in the same jobs," says Ellen Balka,
assistant professor of women's studies at the Memorial University
of Newfoundland.

"Women are less eager to spend money on hobbies," adds Judy
Heim, author of I Lost My Baby, My Pickup, and My Guitar on
the Information Highway and Internet for Cats. "We consider
it self-indulgent. We feel guilty, thinking we really should
be spending the money on our kids or other loved ones."

3. Negative media

One of the major reasons more women are not online yet-along
with lack of time and money-is media mythology. A search for
"women" and "online services" on any magazine or newspaper
database invariably turns up a list of predictable stories
about sexual harassment, pedophiles, stalkers, cybersex, online
romances gone wrong, and the risks of using credit cards for
online shopping. These make for juicy copy, but the sensationalized
stories that distort reality have scared many women away.

4. The graphics-are-good fallacy

Graphics, though simple to use, don't necessarily offer the
allure you'd think. "I'm anti-chat and anti-graphics because
I think those are the most inefficient uses of online services,"
says Teresa Mears, a journalist, editor, and newsletter publisher
in Miami. "I use online networks to get information and make
contacts with people, and it takes more time to do that in
live chat or if you have to wait for graphics."

"More user-friendly and more graphical are not necessarily the
same. We fooled ourselves into believing that," Memorial University's
Balka says. "Fancy graphics are for marketing. They help sell
products, but they don't enhance the quality of interaction
with my colleagues."

5. Combat is not hospitable

Especially in Usenet newsgroups, women find the atmosphere hostile,
intimidating, or childish. Words like "one-upsmanship" and
"mental masturbation" come up a lot when women talk about their
impressions of online discussions. Lisa Kimball of The Meta
Network sums it up: "Women don't think of conversation as a
contact sport."

6. Technology's not a turn-on

Some men seem to equate the power of their computers with real
power, and see bandwidth, RAM, megahertz, and hard-drive size
as something akin to sexual prowess. But women are unimpressed
with technology for its own sake. As Paula Span wrote in The
Washington Post magazine, "Women treat computers like reliable
station wagons: Learn how to make them take you where you want
to go, and as long as they're functioning properly, who cares
about pistons and horsepower? Whereas guys-even those who never
learned how to change an oil filter-are enamored by computers,
want to play with them, upgrade them, fix them when they falter,
and compare theirs with the other guy's."

7. The "geek chic" stereotype

"Before I was online," says Esther Gwinnell, a psychiatrist
in Portland, Ore., "I'd imagined it as mostly people who build
computers, with pocket protectors and many pens. Boy, was I
wrong!" The techies are there, of course, but this is simply
an outdated, off-base impression that persists among the uninitiated.

8. Fear of an alien nation

Women are more worried than men that we're headed toward a society
in which people communicate mostly electronically. Many also
assume that communicating by computer is cold, impersonal,
rather weird, and the preoccupation of social misfits. Partly
to counter this, the online industry co-opted the term "community"
to hype chat rooms. Not coincidentally, that's where these
services make the most money, aside from online gaming.

"It sounds good, because it's a feel-good, '90s mentality, but
'community' in that sense is used as a marketing ploy," says
Leslie Regan Shade, a doctoral candidate at McGill University
in Ottawa, who is doing her dissertation on gender and virtual
communities.

9. Misdirected marketing

Marketers haven't figured out quite how to cater to women online.
"Women don't want to be ghettoized; they don't want a separate
set of services. If you set aside a finance forum for women,
they feel like something's missing there and go to the regular
finance forum instead," says Jodi DeLeon, product manager for
the Microsoft Network.

As Regan Shade observes, "Women don't want recipes and fashion
online. We want ways to use the technology in productive, constructive
ways. We want breast cancer information and support groups,
and sites like Virtual Sisterhood [on the Web] and the kind
of things that are coming out of the Beijing conference [the
U.N.'s Fourth International Conference on Women]. [Content
developers] think all content for women should be consumer
oriented."

What's most important to know is that women want to be talked
to as individuals, not just as women, says Carol Wallace, a
spokeswoman at Prodigy. "[Women] don't go online to have a
'woman experience'; they go online like anybody else."

Ironically, not one commercial service has made an effort to
reach out to women at women's conferences, associations, or
conventions of women business owners. Yet Echo, a small New
York City BBS founded and run by Stacy Horn, rivals all of
the multimillion-member services in percentage of women members
and half of Echo's sysops are women. Horn says she goes out
of her way to actively recruit women. "We send each new female
member a letter asking if they'd like to be assigned another
woman on Echo as a mentor," she says. "The mentors teach them
not just the commands, but the culture."

A More Integrated Future?

As women have moved into corporate management, women have influenced
the shift to the popular model of management by consensus,
which involves everybody affected in decisions. Memorial University's
Balka says she hopes for a similar humanizing influence as
more women participate online; this influence, she believes,
will result in less flaming, posturing and preening, and more
true communication.

The Institute for the Future's Kaplan adds that more conscious
choices about the content, culture, and structure of the online
world and related public policies need to be made. She and
others want to see a diversity of voices plan the Internet,
with steps taken to ensure people of all ages, genders, and
economic levels get easy, affordable online access and feel
welcome.

No medium of communication and information since the telephone
and television is likely to have such a profound impact on
education, politics, and the way we live and work as this one.
That's why it's so important that women-who are traditionally
said to be more verbally adept and better communicators-help
guide its direction rather than dismiss it all as hype and
hoopla.

On a more practical note, being online is becoming a must for
professionals. "If you're not wired or in some way reachable
online, you're going to fall out of so many informational loops
that are available," Echo's Horn says. "You used to have to
go to luncheons and cocktail parties to network. Now you have
to be online."

To be sure, men haven't posted any "No Women Allowed" signs
online. It's the sensationalized media hype, outmoded and off
base stereotypes, and plain stubborness of women themselves
that are the likely culprits.

It's not merely a matter of career consequences, or even the
growing distance between the haves and have-nots. Ultimately,
it comes down to power-but of the medium, not the machine.
Two decades ago, Michael Korda wrote in Power: How to Get It,
How to Use It: "The person who controls the computer is thus
in a singular position of power." That person gains power over
not just information, but people, he said.

Korda's book was published just three years after the first
public demonstration of what we now call the Internet, and
four years before the oldest commercial service, CompuServe,
existed. It's now up to women to put aside their own skepticism,
wariness and "yes-but" attitudes and heed his words.@

For Grrls' Eyes Only

By:
Judith H. Bernstein

There's a lack of women online, you hear? You wouldn't know
it from this New York City group.

In a loft in Manhattan's Silicon Alley, women chat as they arrange
folding chairs into rows and put out refreshments. Aliza Sherman,
wearing her Cybergrrl T-shirt, is seemingly everywhere at once,
greeting guests as they arrive to take part in a New Media
phenomenon.

This is a meeting of Webgrrls, which may be the oldest established
permanent floating organization for women in new media: It
was founded by Sherman last April. Back then, Webgrrls' first
meeting drew six participants; this meeting has drawn close
to 100. Founding the group was the culmination of Sherman's
eight years online and part of her professional commitment
to the field. (She also started CG Media, an online communications
and marketing company, a year ago.)

The purpose of Webgrrls, Sherman tells the women at the meeting,
"is to share; not to be competitive with each other, but to
offer others opportunity." Thus, the meeting is an open forum
in which each participant introduces herself, then declares
what skills, information, or support she seeks from the organization,
as well as what resources she can give in return.

In that spirit, business cards and e-mail addresses are traded
as one participant after another speaks: The Webmaster from
Scholastic needs HTML designers. Julie Denny, an Associated
Press reporter and a director/mediator with the Alliance for
Mediation & Conflict Resolution, wants to learn how to use
the Web to dig up research on conflict resolution in the workplace.
Attorneys, financial consultants, students, artists, designers,
editors, writers, techies, and the admittedly Web-clueless
are in attendance, as well as those looking for a sense of
community. "I'm looking for support from other working moms,
and I can give back my knowledge on the background and history
of the net," one woman says.

Sherman's regular e-mailings to members, as well as FeMiNa,
her "Yahoo-type" search tool of links appealing to women, and
Cybergrrls, her own Web site (http://www.cybergrrls.com/),
round out Webgrrls' resources.

It's Webgrrls' open forum, created to curb inhibitions, that
compels the group to limit its membership to women, according
to Sherman. "This is for women, about women. Women have different
needs in a group professional setting [than men do]," she says.
"This gives them an opportunity to open up in a noncompetitive
atmosphere. Women are more likely to want to share with each
other."

Does this approach seem exclusionary? "Women say, 'You're ghettoizing
us; pigeonholing us.' But not one woman who has attended these
meetings has said that," Sherman contends. In fact, Sherman
cites inquiries from women across the United States and around
the world about starting Webgrrls chapters in their own communities.

Sherman also says she's working on a survey of women on the
Web. And, despite the commonly cited statistics on the dearth
of women online, she says, "Companies should target women now
and offer them things to attract them to come online. I'm doing
this now, regardless of the numbers [of women actually online]."

FAQ: All the News That's Fit to Speak -- Talk all day if you want
all it takes is knowing the IRC code

By:
David A. Harvey

Other than searching for ways to get out of paying taxes, the
second most human of qualities separating us from the animals
is conversation. We can't get enough of it.

Digital chatter is as old as the net, but its first implementations
were limited to Talk, a grotesque one-on-one protocol run from
the Unix command line. It wasn't until 1988 that the digital
Babel known as Internet Relay Chat, or IRC, began. Designed
by Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi) as a replacement for
Talk on his BBS, the protocol and its clients spread to 60
countries and through a series of linked servers that now serve
hundreds of channels, thousands of topics, and tens of thousands
of responsive, real-time, live conversations.

For the technically curious, the workings behind IRC are defined
in the Network Working Group's Request For Comments (RFC) Number
1459 (ftp://cs-ftp.bu.edu/irc/support/rfc1459.txt)

What counts is that IRC allows one-to-one, one-to-many, and
many-to-many conversations. In IRC parlance, IRC itself refers
to the protocol; a server is a specific box (usually linked
to other servers) that implements the IRC protocol, along with
any server-specific rules; and a client is the software you
use to tap into IRC's scintillating discourse.

Channel Me In

The oldest and most trafficked IRC system is EFnet (http://irc.ucdavis.edu
efnet/), a cacophony of 11,000 users linked by 100 servers.

A band of netizens-sensitized to perceived privacy breeches
and lack of available bandwidth-staged an early revolt against
EFnet to form the UnderNet (http://irc.ucdavis.edu/undernet
), a smaller and more tight-knit community of IRCers. On average,
UnderNet includes 27 servers and a little less than 3,000 users.

Another IRC system, DALnet (http://irc.ucdavis.edu/dalnet/),
started as a role-playing-game alternative network. It's relatively
small and consequently cultish, averaging 130 users and 16
servers.

IRC networks are composed of channels, which are the equivalent
of chat rooms you can find on America Online, Prodigy, or CompuServe.
These networks carry thousands of channels dedicated to topics
ranging from cooking to high-energy particle physics.

Each channel is ruled by a channel operator-called a channelop
or op. Operators must maintain topicality, rid the channel
of abusive persons, and handle basic IRC functions. There's
no limit to the number of operators; most channels have several.

Time for Good Behavior

If you jump into the middle of an IRC channel and begin hurling
insults, you're likely to be booted from the channel, flamed,
or even banned from an entire server. Anonymous IRC conversations
aren't a ticket to repealing basic etiquette.

Neither does IRC etiquette stop at the obvious. Different channels
have different purposes and different rules, so listen before
you speak. Be especially mindful of structured channels (usually
business and academic) that may be set up to hold a news conference,
host a lecture, or field a structured Q&A session.

True privacy does not exist on IRC. Anybody can see what you
type, though the latest IRC clients make it possible to hold
fairly private, one-to-one discussions. Never type in passwords,
credit card numbers, or strange commands that a "helpful" stranger
suggests.

Before diving into IRC, it would be smart to read the IRC primer
(http://mistral.enst.fr/~pioch/IRC/IRCprimer/IRCprimer/IRCprimer.ht
ml) for a thorough discussion of IRC basics. If you want to
delve deeper, zip over to an excellent compendium of IRC resources
at both http://urth.acsu.buffalo.edu/irc/WWW/ircdocs.html and
http://www.escape.com/~ward/ircstuff.html. And, if chatting
is becoming a lifestyle, head to the alt.irc.whatever newsgroups
 You'll find topics that cover everything you need to know.

Executing Conversations

Like everything on the net, IRC requires a program that massages
your information to conform to the IRC protocol. The latest
and greatest is known as an ircII client; it supports everything
from chatting to exchanging files via DCC (Direct Client to
Client), playing sounds, and zapping a URL to a Web browser.

If you run Windows or Windows 95, browse over to Stroud's Consummate
WinSock App List (http://cwsapps.texas.net/phone.html) for
a roundup of IRC programs. Other platforms are stuck checking
the otherwise lame IRC FAQ (http://www.kei.com/irc.html)

Long-time IRCers disparage anything but plain, command-line
IRC programs. Ignore them. I mean, if you really would rather
type in /WHO #Twilight_Zone and watch a list scroll by at net
speed, fine. Personally, I'd rather point and click any day
of the week.

The best and easiest-to-use IRC clients run on graphical interfaces
and offer icon-driven support for the wealth of features supported
by ircII. These clients use scripting extensively; for uptight
servers, this can be a problem.

In the lingo of IRC, a script (or any other self-maintaining
program) is called a robot, or just a bot (http://www2.undernet.org
8080/~cs93jtl/unet_bot.txt). Bots are forbidden on some servers,
so, as a result, attempting to link to one of these servers
with an advanced ircII client may be impossible. If you get
an error message exclaiming, "Bots are not allowed" when you're
using a script-driven client, try another server location.

Windows users have been blessed with a cornucopia of superb
ircII clients. Best known is mIRC (http://sunsite.nijenrode.nl
ftp/pub/mirc/index.html), a multichannel-capable program that
supports file exchange, URL launching, audio, and operator
functions through pull-down menus and buttons. Netscape recently
released Netscape Chat (http://home.netscape.com/), which is
optimized to deal with URLs. It supports standard IRC and Netscape
IRC servers.

Unix heads are in good shape: You have a slew of command-line
ircII clients with full support for both interactive-only and
scripted IRC sessions. X-Window users are served by a small
but growing number of graphical clients.

If you're on a Mac (or another operating system, like VMS or
OS/2) it's slim pickings: the mostly command-line clients,
mostly unscripted support for IRC on these OSes pale beside
Windows and Unix.

Into the Future

I have seen the future of IRC, and it is virtual interactive
3-D. But don't take my word for it-check out Worlds Inc. (http
//www.worlds.net) and its latest Worlds Chat, now at Version
8. Worlds Chat calls on all the advanced features of ircII
clients (DCC, audio, and URL launching), and adds the ability
to navigate a fully 3-D world model using an avatar stand-in.

Another new effort, AlphaWorld, is found on CompuServe (you
can also get it from Stroud's list). AlphaWorld ups the 3-D
ante to include flying around and improved scenery. Tribal
Voice's PowWow (http://www.tribal.com/) stays 2-D but adds
in tours of the Web and voice.

What is clear is that, even more than the Web, IRC is evolving
into a true virtual community. With the ability to exchange
URLs, voice and data alongside real-time conferencing, IRC
is poised to become a prime focal point for the next generation
of Web usage.

Navigator: Getting Your Small Business Online--The world can be your small
business' marketplace

By:
Kate Gerwig

From a 300-square-foot shop in Pasadena, Calif., the owners
of Hot Hot Hot run a global business, shipping more than 100
kinds of hot sauce all over the world. In the process, they're
a model for small businesses that seek to burst the confines
of locality.

Further north, from a 10-foot by 10-foot basement room, Virtual
Vineyards opened its cyberdoors 14 months ago and began shipping
wine-supplied mostly by small California wineries-worldwide.

If you're thinking about placing your small business online,
or opening a virtual business, it pays to study the practices
of those that have gone before. Both Hot Hot Hot and Virtual
Vineyards have a lot more in common than the pursuit of gastronomic
excellence. Both are small businesses that successfully sell
products over the Internet. Their Web sites are friendly, informative,
and easy to navigate, and are persuasive enough to make the
most timid of taste buds try sauces like Nuclear Hell or encourage
those who confuse zinfandel with gew rztraminer to order specials
like "$99 of Wine on the Wall."

Because all Web sites are equally accessible, startup businesses
can exist alongside the Fortune 500 on a virtually level playing
field. But only a fraction of the more than 5 million small
 and medium-sized businesses in the United States are using
the Internet as an advertising, marketing, or sales tool.

Ticket to the World

If done properly, a small business' Web site can give a one
employee shop global presence with a few clicks of a mouse.
Hot Hot Hot proprietors Monica Bosserman Lopez and Perry Lopez,
who founded their walk-in business two years ago, say sharing
information with your clients is the essence of business success
on the Web.

"If you think you can put up a Web site and just get stuff [in],
it's not going to happen," Bosserman Lopez says. "You have
to understand what works because it's a very different style
of selling. Really successful Web sites give something back."

Both the hot sauce and wine online locations let you place orders.
Hot Hot Hot's site (http://www.hot.presence.com/g/p/H3/index.html)
generated 20 percent of the company's revenue last year. Virtual
Vineyards (http://www.virtualvin.com/), which exists only as
an online business, could be in the black in about a year,
according to company co-founder and self-described "cork dork"
Peter Granoff.

To develop a successful site, businesses first need to decide
what they want from an online location. Figure out whether
you want to enhance the company's image, generate sales leads,
or actually close sales. "You have to know who your target
market is, how you will contact users who express interest
in your product, and, if you're planning to close sales on
the net, how your customers will pay for online orders," says
Joel Maloff, an Internet consultant and author in Ann Arbor,
Mich.

Be realistic about the number of buyers vs. browsers at your
site. Bosserman Lopez says about 1 percent of the 30,000 surfers
who visit Hot Hot Hot each month actually place orders, "which
is as good as direct mail response rates."

A common lament from large and small businesses that load their
promotional materials on the Web is that nothing happens. "Just
putting up a site is like setting up shop in the middle of
a desert," Maloff says. Put your Internet address on your business
cards and stationery, he suggests. Then begin marketing your
site in ways that take advantage of the interactive medium.

At Virtual Advantage Inc. (http://www.virtualad.com/), a Web
design company in San Diego, founders Julie Bryant and Christine
Sheppard have created sites for several small businesses, which
use quizzes, competitions, cartoons, and e-mail to entice people
to revisit. "When you mess up a home page, it will be hard
to get people to come back again," Bryant says. Web pages need
to be quick, snappy, and compelling. Pages with too much text
turn visitors off.

Some Web designers have suggested that Virtual Vineyards redesign
its site using more complicated graphics. Virtual's Granoff
says he'd love to, but not until average modem speeds are faster
than 14.4 kbps. "Lots of stuff on the Internet is too rich
in graphics," he says. "If it takes you 30 minutes to access
a site, it's like inviting them into your store and then making
them wait half an hour."

Buy or Lease?

An effective Web site doesn't always come inexpensively, according
to Granoff, though he declined to say how much he's spent.
Virtual Vineyards has links on America Online and Prodigy,
a co-marketing agreement with CompuServe, and more online arrangements
in progress. The site is registered with search tools like
Yahoo and Lycos, and is thinking about doing some Web banner
advertising, Granoff says.

Still, cash-strapped businesses might be able to strike a deal.
Hot Hot Hot, for example, was able to work out a monthly payment
plan for being the first customer of Presence Information Design,
a Web design firm in Pasadena, Calif.

There are other creative ways for cash-poor small businesses
to get online. Gregory Wester, an analyst at the Boston-based
Yankee Group, suggests hooking up with an online restaurant
or shopping guide in your area. Boston's restaurant guide (http
//www.bWeb.com/) is a good example.

Some Internet access providers also have started offering special
pricing packages to small businesses. CERFnet offers small
businesses a 99-hours-for-$99 monthly package that includes
the tools for a basic, do-it-yourself Web site.

Global Village Communication Inc. (http://info.globalvillage.com
), a Sunnyvale, Calif., modem maker and Internet access provider,
has staked out the small and medium-sized business market with
turnkey net access packages that include an online template
for a plug-and-play Web site. "Most people don't have the internal
technology, so we provide a complete solution," says Steven
Eng, senior product marketing manager for Global Village's
Internet Services division. Performance Technology Inc. (http
//www.perftech.com/), in Austin, Texas, also sells a turnkey
system called Instant Internet, which provides a small-business'
network with secure Internet access via modem, ISDN, or a faster
connection.

Deciding where to store pages is another issue for small businesses.
Web pages designed by Virtual Advantage are stored for customers
on servers at CERFnet (http://www.cerfnet.com/), a California
and Arizona regional access provider. This means CERFnet's
network guarantees pages will be accessible to users seven
days a week, 24 hours a day. CERFnet spokesman Andy Markem
suggests small businesses stay out of the server purchasing
and maintenance business, comparing it to publishing a magazine
just to advertise your products and services.

Virtual Vineyards, however, owns its own server and does its
own engineering work in-house. It helps, of course, to know
that Virtual co-founder Robert Olson was an engineer at Silicon
Graphics Inc. before he shifted to the online wine arena.

Regardless of the hardware you use and the search engines you
list with, having a well-designed site may be the best advertising
you can have, according to Hot Hot Hot's Bosserman Lopez. "Other
sites will want to link to you-and your customers will come
back," she says. And that's a good step on the road to growing
a small businesses into a larger one.

Power Tools: Your Site's Got the Look--Your page can look sharp with the
right background, clip art, and icons

By:
Rich Santalesa

Take any visually rich site, strip the background out, pop the
icons off and dump the pictures out, and what remains? Basically,
the equivalent of a piece of typed paper. Plain text, plain
screen.

In any media, graphics make the difference between a merely
informative work and one packing the visual punch of a prime
Picasso. Luckily, the Web and every online service is stuffed
with useful graphic tools, libraries, and resources. If your
Web page or site is on the visually anemic side, a solid strategy
for tuning and tweaking is as simple as B, C, I.

No, BCI isn't a scandal-ridden bank. Rather it stands for Background,
Clip art, and Icons. Adding the right doses of all three can
completely make over your Web site.

Loading Up on Backgrounds

When building a house, you need a solid foundation. The same
holds for your Web site, where the page background acts as
a common foundation for your site. One of the smartest enhancements
to hit the Web, background images are an effective way to stamp
your site with a coherent corporate or personal seal.

If you haven't seen backgrounds, you're likely using an ancient
browser. When fed a small graphics file, the background tag
seamlessly tiles the graphic to create a wallpaper effect. With
the right graphic, logo or image, the results can be stunning.

Keep in mind that different platforms can and do map colors
differently. I've seen background images that looked perfectly
fine on a Mac yet were completely washed out, or displayed
unexpected colors, on a PC, and vice versa. Don't just assume
that if you see the image fine everyone else will also. Test
as much as you can with different browsers and systems.

Also, keep your background file small. A good role of thumb
is to never exceed 40 KB for any page image. If your graphic
file is larger, then consider using two separate versions-a
low-resolution image to speed loading and a high-resolution
file that can load in the background or when clicked.

For its part, Microsoft, in true Microsoft style, has added
a modification to the background command in its Internet Explorer
2.0 that lets you create what Microsoft dubs "watermarks."
A watermark is simply a background that stays put. With traditional
backgrounds, whenever you scroll the screen you scroll the
background.

By adding a bgproperties=fixed option to the background tag,
Explorer recognizes that the background image should stay put
when using a corporate logo or ad, for instance. It's easier
to visualize than to explain. For more details on Explorer
and its new tags, pop over to http://www.microsoft.com/windows
ie/ie20html.htm.

Though any GIF can be considered background material, the Web
holds many collections of background pages that should help
you in your quest for the perfect background and texture. Netscape
itself maintains a basic background collection at http://home.netscape.com
assist/net_sites/bg/backgrounds.html. None of Netscape's backgrounds
will win your site an award, but they're better than nothing.

For seriously cool backgrounds, you'll need to dig a bit deeper
into the online world's art archives, or consider creating
your own images. As always, a good place to start your quest
is at the doorstep of the net's various search engines, such
as Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com), Lycos (http://www.lycos.com),
Excite (http://www.excite.com), InfoSeek (http://www.infoseek.com),
or Webcrawler (http://www.Webcrawler.com). Each has a variety
of graphic categories, and searching on the keywords backgrounds,
clip art and icons will turn up numerous pages offering backgrounds,
such as the Terry Gould graphics collection (http://www.netaccess.on.ca
~kestrel/list.html.)

Coloring Your Clip Art

Once you've fitted your page with a sizzling background, it's
time to perform some graphic fine-tuning. Using graphic elements
above and beyond backgrounds typically means turning to existing
images or clip art libraries and collections.

If you're comfortable using Photoshop or another graphics program,
it's an easy matter to whip up batches of your own images.
When you look at your page and start dancing because things
look so cool, it's a safe bet you've hit upon what you want.

An easy way to start feeling that happy foot-tingling is to
fly into the Web Weavers Warren page, which is one of the best
collections of links to graphics, backgrounds, icons and art
(http://fox.nstn.ca/~tmonk/weaver/iconimag.html). If you can't
find something of interest here, then it's time to hang up
your Web browser.

Another longtime collection of clip art is Sandra's Clipart
Server at http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/sjl/clipart.html. Most
of the images offered aren't going to set your heart fluttering,
but for graphics in a pinch Sandra's served up some filling
selections. Likewise, Grahame's Graphics for Home Pages at
http://www.computan.on.ca/~grahame/graphics.html contains hundreds
of useful buttons, icons and other graphics.

Don't overlook the obvious when searching for graphics. Checking
for art at the home pages of graphic software companies is
a smart and safe bet. For instance, MetaTools (formerly HSC)
at http://www.hsc.com, Corel at http://www.corel.com and others
display and demo a wide variety of art created with their programs.
Each also sells inexpensive, yet well-done, collections of
clip art on CD-ROM.

Icons Galore

While clip art adds context and meaning to your Web site, icons,
graphic lines and buttons provide the graphic glue to tie your
site together. As hard as it is to believe, there are people
on the Web who seem to do nothing but create free art for others
to use. Take advantage of their generosity.

For instance, a good starting point for gathering icons is,
again, the Web Weavers Warren page, or the Icon Browser page
(http://www.cli.di.unipi.it/iconbrowser/icons.html). Though
the Icon Browser page isn't well designed in terms of usage,
with a bit of effort you'll walk away with whatever you need.

Last, if you come across an icon that you simply can't live
without, send the page's owner an e-mail asking for permission
to use it. More often than not you'll be pleasantly surprised
to find the owner doesn't mind if you grab a copy for yourself,
but always ask.

Tools for All

In the end, the best sites all use some home-generated art.
If you don't already have a collection of graphic tools, converters,
and add-ons, try the following software and shareware libraries

Virtual Software Library (http://vsl.cnet.com)-a massive gathering
of 130,000 software files from the 22 largest shareware and
freeware archives on the Internet; The Father of Shareware
(http://www.halcyon.com/knopf/jim)-a site by one of the fathers
of the shareware scene that links to many other shareware collections;
and The Software Site (http://softsite.com/)-a killer collection
of software for all platforms. If you only visit one graphic
tool site, this isn't a bad choice.

Webmaster: Long-Range Web Planning -- Plan hard or watch your Web site
die. It's the new Webmaster code

By:
Jonathan Gross

Nothing moves faster than the computer industry. Yesterday's
hot system is today's ho-hum computer, and today's "standard"
is tomorrow's forgotten application programming interface.
The same rule holds true for emerging Web technologies.

During the next 12 months, Webmasters will face the difficult
task of deciding which of the up-and-coming Web technologies
should be on their sites. They'll also have to figure out how
to pay for them, and, even more vital, how to best manage it
all. Choose right and you'll ride the wave of the next year;
choose wrong and your site will be forever playing catch-up.
What do you need to keep in mind? Here are the top items to
factor into your Web planning.

HotJava

HotJava promises to bring sophisticated animation and more to
the Web via "applets," or programs written in the Java programming
language. Applets are included (like images) in HTML pages.

What does this mean to the person hosting a large Web site?
Not much, actually. Since the Java code is downloaded and run
on the client system, there is no additional overhead placed
on the host CPU. Java applets also are a bit smaller than many
images, and so the bandwidth requirements are minimal. Writing
applets, however, is a different story. If you intend to add
HotJava to your site, start scoping out the local C++ talent.

For more information, visit http://www.javasoft.com/faq2.html#g1,
or find a copy of John Decembers' book Presenting Java for
a general overview of Java.

Security

As the Internet has grown, commercial-grade security has become
vital. Whether you're talking about a firewall that protects
your entire internal network or a secure-transaction Web server,
security is never far from a Webmaster's thoughts.

As a matter of course, firewalls come in two flavors-packet
filtering and proxy-based. The correct type for your network
depends on the security decisions and policies you set. Although
the software needed to build a firewall on the Internet can
be obtained for free, configuration is a serious business-even
for the network savvy.

Turnkey firewalls that combine hardware and software as a unified
package start at around $10,000. That may seem expensive, but
it's a solid and often cost-effective alternative to piecing
together your own.

Netscape's server, as well as others, allows secure transactions
to be made between client and server, enabling credit card
orders and other sensitive information to be passed via the
HyperText Transfer Protocol. Right now there are many applications
that use credit cards as a possible method of payment. This
will be a field of development to watch closely.

Hardware and Technology

As always, outside developments in hardware and technology mean
steady planning back at the server. As faster modems replace
the existing base of V.32 and V.32bis modems, space hogs such
as video and audio files (MPEG, AVI, etc.) will begin flooding
server drives. Seriously audit your disk space usage, as well
as your line bandwidth capacity.

Control and Regulation

As the net grows, so will the need for regulation and control,
though it may not fall in the hands we'd like. For instance,
as aspects previously under government control move over to
for-profit organizations, such as the InterNIC, a $2 billion
U.S. government defense contractor in control of the root nameservers,
the Internet will change steadily. The recent imposition of
fees for domain names is one example of the type of charges
that might be imposed and gradually applied to other aspects
of the Internet. It behooves all system administrators and
Web presence providers to stay abreast of developments in the
arena.

Database Integration

If you're not running a database behind your Web pages, you're
missing one of the best Web tools around. Numerous database
solutions are available now, such as Next's WebObjects and
MiniSQL and its W3 query interface W3_mSQL, which is a single
Common Gateway Interface program that acts as a query generator.

In certain situations, storing all Web elements in a database
can be an effective way for the Webmaster to control revisions
and content, and ease the task of Web site administration.
Storing your Web contents in a database also can offer an extra
degree of security in various circumstances.

However, keep in mind that if the query engine and the database
run on the same system as your Web server, there could be a
significant draw on the CPU power of that machine. All right,
perhaps not a significant drain if you happen to be running
your Web server on an Onyx or DEC 300-MHz Alpha. But for those
of us making use of the Intel flavor of Windows NT, smaller
Sun workstations, Linux, or another desktop-sized machine,
this will be a consideration.

VRML

Virtual Reality Modeling Language is an ASCII-based language
that describes three-dimensional worlds. VRML isn't a weekend
project. Object inlining will be used in VRML even more than
in HTML documents, so the load placed on the server, especially
as multiconnection browsers are developed, will be high in
terms of bandwidth, CPU load, and, of course, disk space and
access. Large VRML worlds may have to be distributed across
several servers in order to achieve acceptable load limits.

If you are going to be implementing VRML on a large scale, you
would be wise to look into additional servers. More information
is available from the VRML Architecture Group (http://vrml.wired.com
VAG/) and the VRML Repository (http://www.sdsc.edu/SDSC/Partners
vrml/)

HTML

For almost two years, various organizations have been pushing
to create a single HTML standard. Various drafts of these proposals
have circulated: HTML+, HTML 2.0, and now HTML 3.0. But even
as these standards are argued and mulled over, non-standards,
such as Microsoft's and Netscape's extensions to HTML, are
becoming pervasive.

As America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, the Microsoft Network,
and other online services increasingly supply access to Internet
services, there will be a corresponding increase in hits by
their proprietary browsers. These browsers are mostly HTML
2.0 compliant, and are fairly picky about interpreting HTML
documents per the standards set out at the World Wide Web Consortium
(http://www.w3.org/)

To reach as many people as possible with your pages, test your
designs using as many browsers as possible. Though Netscape
is the browser king, your documents are certain to be viewed
by a number of browsers that do not cope well with Netscape
extensions. Plan accordingly.

As the end of this year looms on the horizon, make time to scope
out the year that lies ahead. Plan your network configurations
carefully, keep up with new innovations, build something worthwhile,
and most of all, have a good time doing it.

in building Web sites, Internet security implementations, and
scuba diving. He can be reached at wseditor@ssc.com.

CyberGuide: COMPUTERWARE

By:
Kathleen Sands

 
INFO CENTRAL

OK, we have a confession to make. We're information junkies.
That makes the All-in-One Search Page a very dangerous place
for us. William Cross' collection of forms-based Internet search
tools has so many links to huge databases and powerful search
engines that we start salivating just thinking about it. Sure,
the site comes in handy when we're researching CyberGuide,
but it's also maddeningly distracting. Forget about getting
any real work done. We're busy looking up an old friend via
MIT's finger gateway, tracing an elusive bit of Macintosh shareware,
plugging in the local weather station's code for a temperature
check, calling up Henry V's rousing St. Crispian's Day speech
from The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, and-well, you
get the idea. But with easy access to Yahoo, Lycos, and Veronica,
along with the less-familiar net reference sites, can you blame
us? (Our only complaint: Not every form is accompanied by a
how-to-search explanation.)

OK, a second confession. We tend to put off until tomorrow what
we can do today.Maybe this site is too good for journalists
with a proclivity toward procrastination.

CyberGuide: EARTH MATTERS

By:
Rebecca Rohan

 
CRY WOLF

When the moon is full, do you check over your shoulder whenever
you hear a strange noise? Maybe all those werewolf movies have
given the Canis lupus a bad rap. According to Wolf Haven International,
"not a single documented case exists of a wolf having killed
or even severely maimed anyone in the wild."

At its Web site, Wolf Haven, a 13-year-old nonprofit organization,
provides an education about wolves as well as how to protect
and preserve them. You can get to know more than 30 of these
predators-with names like Little John, Princess Lilypad, and
Hambone. (Their cuddly photos are more likely to elicit sighs
instead of screams.) There's a program that lets you "adopt"
a wolf, too. In doing so, you'll receive an adoption certificate,
a color photo and biography of your adoptee, and a silk Wolf
Haven bookmark. Membership packages for Wolf Haven are available,
which include a quarterly magazine and unlimited visiting privileges
at the Tenino, Wash., wolf sanctuary.

Visitors to the site also are invited to attend a summer Howl
In at the sanctuary, where they can enjoy musicians, storytelling,
and a campfire marshmallow roast. Sounds like something to
howl about.

CyberGuide: GOOD READS

By:
Adam Martini

 
WRITE STUFF

Every journalist who picks up a pen or labors behind a keyboard
knows the significance of the Pulitzer Prize. Presented annually
by Columbia University-and named after Joseph Pulitzer, a renowned
publisher during the 19th century-this annual award has been
acknowledging achievements in American journalism since 1917.

Now you can read the articles that netted a select group of
journalists the coveted prize for 1995. Check out the series
by Brian Donovan and Stephanie Saul from Newsday, a Long Island,
N.Y., newspaper, that revealed disability pension abuses by
local police. It captured the Pulitzer for investigative reporting.
A distinguished example of beat reporting can be found in the
series on Washington politics and the national scene, filed
by David Shribman from The Boston Globe.

Overall, Columbia presented 14 Pulitzer prizes in the journalism
category. Unfortunately, the Letters and Drama category, consisting
of books, plays, and poetry, won't give you the pleasure of
reading winning entries. However, the sound samples from composer
Morton Gould's winning "Stringmusic," makes up for it. You'll
be sorry if you write this one off!

GOING PUBLIC

If PBS Doesn't Do It, Who Will?" The Public Broadcasting Service's
new motto is a sobering one. What will massive cuts in public
television funding mean to PBS' reliable, high-quality lineup
of child- ren's, cultural, educational, nature, news, public
affairs, science, and skills programming? More pledge breaks
at the home of Mystery!, Masterpiece Theatre, and Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood? Perish the thought!

On PBS Online, you'll learn about PBS' mission and future. Take
a gander at What's on PBS?, a handy table serving monthly listings
and program home pages. Bill Nye, the Science Guy's page is
fun for kids, but Mister Rogers' page seems to be talking to
Mom and Dad. Like some educational programming, many of these
Web pages are informative, if a bit stuffy. (The Rock and Roll
page is an exception, with its animated, burning guitar!)

We vote for more original online content to complement PBS'
shows. New York City's WNET page, for instance, hosted "trumpet
virtuoso" Wynton Marsalis for a live chat in conjunction with
Marsalis On Music. Click on a map for a look at your local
PBS station and-if you're lucky-schedules and home pages.

When you venture outdoors into the cold, crisp winter air, you
want clothes that look cool but keep you warm.

Trek over to L.L. Bean's online catalog. It's loaded with easy

by fax or phone, 24 hours a day. Sorry, no online order forms

Now that you're wearing your new Gore-Tex Day Hikers and lightweight
fleece jacket, with a pioneer pack over your shoulder and a
Pocket Survival Tool tucked in your jacket, are you all dressed
up with no place to go? L.L. Bean's detailed Park Search has
a multitude of suggestions for you: nearly 900 national parks
and forests, state parks, and other great outdoor spots across
the United States. Search by region, outdoor activity, and
season-you'll find the best places to make use of your new
apparel and accessories. Next stop, the Outdoor Sports section.
It provides helpful hints and a guide to the outdoors.

So, now that you're all set, why don't you go take a hike?

DR.'S ORDERS

Good health is something most of us take for granted-until it
suddenly disappears. Sometimes, our bodies falls victim to
illness without warning. Other times, we run ourselves ragged
either too much work or too much play.

Regardless, one easy (and germ-free) way to stay healthy is
to visit Health on America Online. Here you'll find over-the
counter information on a variety of subjects, including Diet,
Exercise and Fitness, Eyes and Vision, and Men's and Women's
Health. A double-click on Eyes and Vision, for example, will
bring into focus links to relevant articles, a message board,
a chat room, and a software library for further research. This
site also offers a heavy dose of attention to AIDS and HIV,
including a daily summary with the latest news.

Many of the topics discussed at Health deal with diseases that
are out of our hands, but which can be controlled to some extent.
You'll find folders on cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis,
and learning and physical disabilities, where you can read
about how to deal with these problems and the stress that accompanies
them.

You don't need an insurance plan for a check-up on this site.
And while you're at it, pop a vitamin C for safe measure.

COMMUNITY

Think globally; act locally. Have you heard the phrase so often
it's lost its meaning? Well, the Contact Center Network is
trying to bring the idea back home-to your neighborhood. The
group's home page explains its mission: to create community
based "contact centers," supported by regional and national
ones, where you can drop in, get to know your neighbors, and
find out how to contribute to causes-far away or close to home
that interest you. For a typical scenario at a center, link
to a Day in the Life.

Like the centers, the group's home page also serves as an information
clearinghouse on volunteerism, linking you to more than 2,500
directories, publications, and nonprofit organizations. You
won't find fancy graphics, just comprehensive resources simply
and sensibly arranged.

Look into international organizations such as UNICEF and Doctors
Without Borders, or browse by country. U.S. resources are arranged
by state. Have an issue in mind? Greenpeace and the Rainforest
Action Network are under Environment, and Habitat for Humanity
is under Homelessness and Housing. The Contact Center Network
plans to add a search engine to the directory. If you have
any resources, go ahead and pitch in.

CyberGuide: RELATIONSHIPS

By:
Rebecca Rohan

 
CULTURE TOUCH

What's new in weddings? Something very old. For African-American
couples planning all-out "African-centered" weddings, or for
those just wanting to sprinkle some culture into their ceremonies,
the Online African Wedding Guide explains the meaning behind
the tradition.

The guide details the responsibilities of each wedding participant.
In African weddings, for example, the best man is known as
the "warrior." Carrying a shield, his job is to protect the
bonding of the bride's and groom's families. There's also a
listing of symbols and what they represent in a marriage, including
wine, wheat, and pepper. The guide offers links to help you
pick out quality fabrics for your outfit, and tips on how to
economize on wedding expenses. You'll even find the Lord's
Prayer in Swahili. We were impressed that a few potentially
sticky, '90's-style situations were addressed: incorporating
African tradition into an interracial marriage and how to involve
children from previous marriages.

One of the sweetest symbols we found here bears a simple message
that can apply to all marriages, regardless of culture: "Love
does not get lost on its way home."

NOTABLE

Music appreciation class flashback: Scratchy records of awful
arias forced on you by a tuneless teacher who looked just like
that bust of a dead composer sitting on your class' piano.
But now you're all grown up-and you have a sneaking suspicion
there's more to life than Pearl Jam. If you're too awed by
the classical music mystique to know where to start or to ask
for help, open your ears to Classical Net, where Web maestro
Dave Lampson guides you through the "basic repertoire of works
that have, over time, become central to the Western tradition
of music, and recommended recordings/performances of these
works." You don't need a snobbish attitude or scholarly approach.
"All that is required is a desire to explore and discover new
musical territory," he says.

Explore the ethereal airs of medieval mystic Hildegarde von
Bingen, baroque master J.S. Bach's demonstration of the "Art
of the Fugue," the unabashed romanticism of Claude Debussy,
or Philip Glass' breathtakingly modern "Einstein on the Beach."
(No, Counting Crows didn't write it!) No audio archives, but
histories, composer data, searchable indexes, and links to
a symphony of net resources make Classical Net a well-orchestrated
delight.

CyberGuide: SPORTING LIFE

By:
Adam Martini

 
HOOP DREAMS

Leave it to the National Basketball Association to produce a
dazzling Web page, replete with the perfect blend of game results,
team news, player profiles, transactions, and schedules. Sure,
NBA.com, the league's official home page, is a clever promotional
tool. But it also will score big points with its fans.

Complete with a library of real-time videos and sound files,
NBA.com is as breathtaking as Orlando Magic's super point guard
Anfernee Hardaway. And speaking of "Penny," check out the Player
Directory for Hardaway's vitals and career statistics (along
with the other pros')

Are you a transplanted basketball fan unable to follow your
favorite team because you live on enemy turf? NBA.com covers
all 29 teams in detail. And with feature columns on international
basketball, NBA.com reaches a worldwide audience. Other features
worth a mention are the illustrated referee guide and the NBA
merchandise store.

It would be nice, however, to see a tribute to the legends of
the game who paved the way for today's stars and the success
of the NBA. How about a "Legend's Guide" or record book? Oh
well, you know what they say in the NBA: Nobody's perfect-except
for Michael Jordan.

1,000 topic areas. The accent is on business and technology
intelligence, so you'll get a business overview for 19 sectors

Net.Dialog: Cerfing the Net -- Interconnection is the key to cooperation,
says one of the fathers of the Internet.

By:
Bob Berger

Aside from the O.J. trial, nothing inflamed the public imagination
last year like the Internet.

It popped up in every form of media, in every discussion of
business and leisure, at every cocktail party. Suddenly you
were out of touch if you weren't plugged in.

Vinton Cerf was there at the beginning. A principal programmer
for the ARPAnet project in the 1960s (a precursor to the Internet)
and a co-developer of the now-ubiquitous networking protocol
TCP/IP, he more recently served as president of the Internet
Society and was named one of People magazine's "25 Most Intriguing
Persons" in 1994. The 52-year-old Cerf was already plugged
in when some of us were in diapers.

Currently MCI's senior vice president of data architecture,
Cerf is a thin, mercurial man who seems energetic enough to
power his own laptop. He sat down at a small conference table
and talked to us practically non-stop about what has been for
him a crusade as well as a career.

Q: Is the phrase "surfing the net" derived from your last name?

A: There was a company in San Diego called General Atomics that
got into the networking business and decided to call itself
surf.net. It turns out another company in the Netherlands had
a similarly named service. So these guys called themselves
the California Educational Research Foundation Network.

Q:That spells cerf.net.

A: Exactly. Then somebody thought, "Hey, what if Vint minds?"
So I got a call and I confess that I hesitated a minute before
happily signing off on it. Soon after that, out in San Diego,
they were hawking T-shirts with "cerfing the net."

Q:Were you there for the net's birth?

A:There are different views of when things are born. Last year
there was a big celebration of the 25th anniversary of the
Internet, though ARPAnet and the Internet were kind of blurred
in that.

Q:Wasn't ARPAnet the beginning?

A:Partly. In 1969, as part of the Department of Defense, ARPA
[Advanced Research Projects Agency] was exploring packet switching
in the hope of keeping its computer networks up in case of
nuclear war. Around 1972, packet radio and packet satellite
programs also got started at ARPA, and it was only in the context
of these and other networks that the whole question of interconnection,
or "internetting," came up.

Bob Kahn, who had been one of the chief architects of ARPAnet,
recognized the need for this interconnection and came out to
Stanford, where I was teaching. He posed this problem: How
could all these things be interconnected without allowing any
of the networks to be changed or any of the host computers
to know what was going on inside the networks while being connected?

Well, we came up with TCP/IP. So I think the birth of the Internet
was 1973. Others think it started with Paul Baran's original
packet switching papers in 1962. I suspect the public thinks
it started in 1994, when it was suddenly thrust upon their
unsuspecting consciousness.

Q: You've been at this since the stone age of computers. Why
did you initially get involved?

A: I'm a programmer in my bones! I get a rush making a complex
artificial world do what I actually program it to do. Now,
imagine trying to get a diverse set of computers and networks
all over the country to internet seamlessly so that a program
running on one machine could effectively interface with a program
running on another, and without having to know what was going
on inside of either and to be robust and to work when parts
of the network were being blown up or an enemy was using jamming
devices.

Remember, this was originally intended for military applications.
Not only did I have to make it work, but work during and after
a nuclear war. Well, show me a more complicated challenge than
that!

Q:The Electronic Frontier Foundation gave you the Pioneer Award
in 1993. It seems to be the guardian of a certain morality
on the Internet. I wonder if you embrace its precepts.

A: First, let me substitute the word "ethic" for "morality."
I feel more comfortable with that.

Second, you have to realize that the origins of this whole thing
evolved in the academic community. ARPA provided the money,
but it was the academic community that did the research, which
was at first a very big problem. Every year, all these scientists
would ask for their own computers, plus they would jealously
guard their research. The situation became so competitive without
sharing that it was almost anti-productive.

Well, ARPA wanted to get more research for its buck, so it insisted
that ARPAnet be used as a tool in the research-in other words,
a way to get on the other guy's computer and run his software
on it without ferreting out his choicest secrets.

A marvelous side effect occurred. With this technological safeguard,
people started to loosen up. They started to cooperate. Frankly,
that's how you make progress in science: You share your results
so other people can validate them. In fact, that's how you
make progress anywhere. Well, this ethic of cooperating and
sharing, for the most part, continues on the Internet today.

Q: You wrote an article for the Internet Society called "Life
in a New World." How different will life in the future of cyberspace
be?

A: Very different. The net is a new infrastructure, blending
mass media and personal interaction. So we will have to learn
how to adapt our behavior and our laws to cope with that, especially
given the Internet's global qualities. Someday in the next
decade, the Internet may be comparable in size to today's telephone
network. At that scale I'll bet there'll be many, many, more
surprises-surprises we won't be able to imagine.

One day we may be wearing computers-and think of the wonderful
word play that will create: softwear, hardwear, and so forth.
And as these devices become more common, it will be quite sensible
to network them. So in the middle of the next decade, we may
have networks to download a new program for our microwave to
make it smarter about how it softens the ice cream. Things
like that.

Life will become a software rather than hardware thing-and our
human flexibility and facility and evolvability will be forced
to change dramatically to accommodate being so "plugged in."

Contributing editor Bob Berger is the author of the Dr. Risk
mystery series, published by Dell.

 THREE-WAY SPLIT TO COST AT&T $4,000M


AT&T has released details of the lay-offs to be made and costs
incurred as a result of its planned reorganisation into three
companies (issue 192).

The company is to take a $6,000m charge against its fourth
quarter figures to cover the cost of its break-up, which entails
the redundancy of nearly 40,000 more employees. Around 30,000 of
the redundancies will be compulsory, following a poor response by
employees to its voluntary buy-out package at the end of last
year. Around 70% of these cuts will be made by the end of this
year, with the rest following within three years.

After tax, the charge - which covers facility close-downs and
asset write-downs as well as layoffs - will result in a charge of
$4,000m, or around $2.50 per share. As the company reported
profits of $4,700m for 1994, it may still manage a positive
result despite the charge. The charges include around $2,600m
pre-tax for redundancy pay and related costs, $1,700m in asset
write-downs, and $1,100m for closing, selling or consolidating
facilities.

Most affected by the announcement will be the company that is to
keep the AT&T name - the telephone service company - and the new
systems and technology company. AT&T Global Information
Solutions, formerly NCR, escapes relatively lightly, thanks to
the fact that it cut 8,500 people from the payroll in September.

The majority of the cuts will be in US-based operations and will
include around 100,000 corporate-wide jobs in areas such as
information systems, personnel and financial operations.

The company also plans to reduce the value of some assets,
including its Unitel Inc Canadian telecommunications venture and
several international units. It will modify some service
offerings, entailing the write-down of the value of some
proprietary software and hardware, and will also write down the
value of some unneeded network facilities such as microwave
towers and will refocus its undersea cable operations.

The cuts were in line with expectations and were well-received by
the market, where shares jumped $2.75 to $67.50 in early trading
after the announcement.

AT&T also says it is on track to file with the Securities &
Exchange Commission for an initial public offering for the
systems and technology company, and still expects to complete the
transaction by the end of the year.

 GE TO SPIN OFF EDS


Electronic Data Systems (EDS) Corp, based in Plano, Texas, could
be an independent company again as soon as the end of next month:
the US Internal Revenue Service has given its confirmation that
the proposed spin-off of the company to its Class E shareholders
by its parent General Motors (GM) Corp will be tax-free. GM
announced its intention to spin off EDS last August (issue 186)
following fruitless talks about a merger with BT Plc in May 1993
(issue 072) and Sprint Corp a year later (issue 123).

The deal still needs shareholder approval, and that could prove a
problem since GM Class E shareholders will see their shares
converted into those of the stand-alone company, but GM and Class
H holders have to approve the deal as well. Electronic Data
Systems' current market value is $25,000m, 10 times the $2,500m
the GM paid for it in 1984.

To qualify for tax-free status, the Detroit firm had to convince
the revenue men that the transaction has a legitimate business
purpose.

 ARTISOFT DIVERSIFIES WITH TRITON BUY


Tucson, Arizona-based Artisoft, Inc. has acquired Triton
Technologies Inc., a developer of remote control technology based
in Iselin, New Jersey. The cash transaction is valued at around
$11.6m.

The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase. According to
Artisoft, a "substantial" percentage of the purchase price for
Triton, and for the recently- acquired Synergy Solutions, Inc, is
attributed to in-process technology and will be charged to
operations in the current fiscal quarter.

Triton Technologies was founded in 1985. Under the CoSession
brand name, it produces remote control software allowing PCs to
be controlled remotely for OEMs including IBM Corp, NEC
Technologies Inc and Zenith Data Systems Corp. CoSession for
Windows 6.0, Triton's latest product release, began shipping
earlier late last year, offering increased file transfer rates,
multitasking capabilities and multiprotocol call waiting.
According to Artisoft, the Triton remote control technology fits
well with its recently-acquired modem/phone line sharing
technology.

Kurt Scheel, vp and cfo for Artisoft, sees the acquisition is a
natural extension to the company's strategy announced last year,
to exit the hardware business and focus on software: that
decision culminated in Artisoft's decision to divest itself of
Eagle Technologies Inc (issue 159) which it had bought it just
one year previously.

Sales channels were another reason why the fit was good,
according to Scheel - since  Triton has concentrated on OEM
sales, Artisoft feels that it can open up new markets by selling
Triton products through its existing channels, and conversely,
the deal will give Artisoft a foot in the door of the OEM market
for its existing product range.

Scheel denies that the diversification represents any de-
emphasising of Artisoft's flagship LANtastic network operating
system: "we're not de-emphasising that business so much as
diversifying our dependence on it" he says.

 COURT HEARS HAYES REORGANISATION PLAN


The US Bankruptcy Court of Georgia is in the middle of
confirmation hearings for Atlanta, Georgia-based Hayes
Microcomputer Products Inc's reorganisation plan, although it
will be some time before any decision is reached, due to factors
such as the speed of testimonies, and the US government shutdown.

Hayes representatives have been on the stand, but no decision
will be reached before the Court has also heard the alternative
plans put forward by US Robotics Inc (issue 197) and Diamond
Multimedia Systems Inc (issue 204).

The next hearing has been set for Thursday January 11th.

 NET LICENSING DEAL WITH CISCO EXPANDED


Redwood City, California-based Network Equipment Technologies
(NET) Inc has expanded its six year-old agreement with Cisco
Systems Inc by licensing the full suite of the latter's
Internetwork Operating System (IOS), and agreeing to resell the
full range of Cisco products globally. Through the original
agreement, NET licensed Cisco's router source code, which was
subsequently incorporated into the LAN/WAN Exchange module for
the company's IDNX multiservice bandwidth manager (issue 133).
NET now wants to expand that to include the other features of the
IOS, and in this way provide increased integration between its
wide area IDNX product, and Cisco-based LANs.

With this in mind, and as part of the reseller agreement, NET is
now also to make Cisco routers part of its preferred product
portfolio under its new Vista Architecture strategy (issue 184).
This agreement will also see NET providing consultancy services
for LAN design, and contract service.

While the IOS licensing agreement is indefinite, according to a
spokesman, the reseller agreement will run for two years although
NET has "every expectation that it will be renewed". Cisco was
picked as a result of its market leadership, said the spokesman,
who added that for this reason it is unlikely that NET will enter
into any similar deals with other router manufacturers.

 TYLINK OFFERS HDSL MODULE FOR MR2300


Norton, Massachussetts-based TyLink Corp has announced the
availability of an optional HDSL (high bit-rate digital
subscriber loop) Module for its MR2300 high-speed digital line
driver. The product is designed to allow users to take advantage
of their existing unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cabling, to
achieve data rates of up to T1 (1.544Mbps) over distances up to
12,000 feet.

According to TyLink, it works by allowing the delivery of an
outbound signal on the same pair of wires on which the return
signal is received: the transmitted signal is cancelled by the
receiver by precisely predicting the amount of signal echo and
subtracting it from the overall input signal. HDSL-based products
are designed to tolerate crosstalk and operate not only on
continuous unobstructed pairs of wires, but also on cables with
mixed wire gauges and bridge taps.

The TyLink MR2300 HDSL Module supports data rates from 672Kbps up
to 1.544Mbps, with the timing derived from an internal DTE clock.
The company says its MR2300 HDSL Module allows customers to
standardise on a single line driver for fibre-optic, STP, and UTP
applications. Different modules can be mixed and matched in a
single rack-mountable MR2300 chassis which can house up to ten
cards. Alternatively, the same modules can be used as stand-alone
units for remote sites.

The MR2300 HDSL Module costs $1,695 for the card version and
$2,695 for the stand-alone version; both are available now.

* TyLink also announced the appointment of Dick Swee as vice
president of engineering. Swee will be responsible for the
development of TyLink's entire line of digital access products.
Swee joins from UB Networks, where he held the same position.

 STRATACOM ADDS SVC SUPPORT TO BPX


San Jose, California-based StrataCom Inc has announced a new
software release for its BPX Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
switches, claiming among other things that it is the first to
support Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs) across the wide area.
However, StrataCom is far from being first, since General
DataComm has had full support for SVCs on its Apex product line
(issue 161) since last September; Northern Telecom implemented it
back in June on its Magellan Vector product; and Cascade's new
500 switch (see Product News, page two) also features SVCs, and
is in beta test now with volume shipments due by the end of this
quarter - StrataCom has yet to commence beta tests of its new
release.

StrataCom says that its ATM SVCs will support ATM user-to-network
(UNI) interfaces ranging from T1/E1 (1.544Mbps/ 2.0Mbps) and
T3/E3 (45Mbps/34Mbps) up to OC-3/STM-1 (155Mbps). Support for
both UNI 3.0 and 3.1 is claimed, with translation betweeen the
two, while the company is also  planning support for ATM SVC
signalling for ATM Frame UNI and ATM Inverse Multiplexed (AIMUX)
interfaces this quarter. StrataCom is also to support the Interim
Inter-Switch Signalling Protocol (IISP) for interoperability with
other vendors' ATM switches, and the Interim Local Management
Interface protocol for ATM connection management.

StrataCom is also adding new security features to its software,
including address screening of both source and destination by
port through a list of authorised or unauthorised addresses.
Additionally, the company has committed itself to implementing
the ATM security features currently under development by the ATM
Forum's Security Working Group.

 IBM DEVELOPING NEW FAST ETHERNET TECHNOLOGY


IBM Corp is working on a technology that would allow users to run
Fast Ethernet over the vast installed base of Category 3 UTP
wiring. Details are sparse, but it is thought to centre on new
repeater technology to combat the noise problems inherent with
Category 3.

On the downside, however, it is also believed to require a new
brand of network adapters which are specifically modified for the
cabling medium. IBM has presented the technology to the IEEE for
consideration as a standard, although this is unlikely to come to
fruition before next year at the earliest.

There is no word on when commercial products can be expected from
IBM.

 STARWORKS FOR HP-UX ANNOUNCED


Not content with speeding up its StarWorks system (issue 205),
Starlight Networks Inc, Mountain View, California, has
implemented its NetWare-based StarWorks digital video networking
software under HP-UX. The company has also received a major
marketing boost with the news that as a result, Hewlett-Packard
Co will bundle Starlight's software with all of its systems.

Starlight has also developed a new version of its StarWare
NetWare Loadable Module for NetWare networks, StarWare 2.0.
StarWare 2.0 costs from $5,000 for 10 users to $35,000 for 100,
and it is shipping now. A media server preconfigured with
StarWare on Hewlett's NetServer supporting 50 concurrent users
and storing 20 hours of MPEG-1 video costs $28,000.

StarWare 2.0, which supports the same clients and networking
middleware as StarWorks, will enable users to start on StarWare
on the NetServer and scale up to StarWorks for HP-UX. It will be
available in 1996. Hewlett-Packard and Starlight will develop a
Unix-based client that formats video signals for screens.

Both companies plan to integrate Starlight's video software with
other Hewlett-Packard products, and to develop enterprise
multimedia applications in video training and information-on-
demand. StarWorks has recently been implemented on IBM Corp's
RS/6000.

 NOVELL SHIPS WEB SERVER EARLY


Fullfilling and more its promise, because the thing was set for
launch next quarter, Novell Inc started shipping its NetWare Web
Server, software that turns NetWare 4.1 servers into World Wide
Web publishing servers for external and in-house use, just before
Christmas.

It says the Web Server builds on the distributed services of
NetWare, including the security and management features of
NetWare Directory Services, to create "a powerful, easy way to
use the Internet for internal and external publishing." It
supports symmetric multiprocessing and is designed to install
out-of-the-box under the NetWare 4.1 network operating system.

The list price is $1,000.

 NORTEL TO SELL STRUCTURED WIRING BUSINESS


Northern Telecom has agreed to sell its cable and structured
wiring business to Pittsburgh-based Cable Design Technologies
(CDT) for approximately $90m.

The deal covers Northern Telecom's communications cable and IBDN
structured network wiring business, including its DynaTraX and
OptimaX products. CDT says it will keep on all the 800-odd
employees affected by the transaction. It will acquire Northern
Telecom's Kingston, Ontario facility, and will lease around 30%
of the Laurentian and Lachine facilities in Montreal. These
Canadian operations will function as an autonomous subsidiary of
CDT.

Northern Telecom says the sale is in line with its plans,
announced some years ago, to focus on core product lines falling
under the heading of networking solutions. A spokesman commented:
"We wanted to find a partner to whom this particular business
would be core, so that all 800 people would be kept on". He said
no further divestitures were expected in the near future.

 FRANCE TELECOM MULLS POLISH LEGAL ACTION


France Telecom will start arbitration proceedings against Poland
if the government refuses to grant its Polish joint venture,
Centertel SA, licence to expand operations: its partner in the
venture, Ameritech Corp, has already begun proceedings over the
government's failure to give Centertel, now Poland's sole
cellular operator, a licence to build a digital cellular network.
France Telecom said it would start action if it did not get
agreement by the end of December. It reckons that Centertel, in
which each has a 24.5% stake, should get a licence under its 1991
letter of intent agreed the government. The government, however,
argues the letter is not binding and a new telecoms law forces it
to organise a new tender for two cellular licences.

France Telecom said it would be ready to pay a licence fee
(expected to be about $128m) as required by the tender,but
Poland's TPSA said it would not allow Centertel to join the
tender, in which applying companies had to present bids to the
communications ministry on January 3, because of high investment
costs involved.

Analysts said that even if Centertel entered the tender, its
chances would be slim, because a telecoms law envisages
demonopolisation of the telephone market. Centertel has activated
about 75,000 cellular phones since its creation in 1991 but its
high charges brought complaints it had been using its sole
operator's position to boost profit.

The government has said it will go ahead with the tender despite
the complaints; France Telecom invested $50m in Poland only
because it was sure Centertel would be allowed to expand, but
says without a digital licence it will no longer be competitive.

 US TELECOMMUNICATIONS BILL IN DOUBT


Prospects for speedy passage of the US telecommunications reform
bill are more clouded again after House and Senate leaders
indicated that they might try to revamp the proposed bill, a

 JSB REFOCUSSING SEES IT BETTING ON THE CORPORATE INTRANET


Congleton, Cheshire-based JSB Computer Systems Ltd, the company
that claims it was behind the introduction of the common TCP/IP
interface Windows Socket, has refocussed its business to aim at
the corporate Intranet.

The firm, preparing to launch an integrated Intranet suite of
programs this month, is delighted that Bill Gates used the word
Intranet in his Internet strategy briefing in November. So
powerful is his word, it reckons, that between now and the end of
this month the world will have begun to clamour for Intranet
products.

Steve Purdham, managing director of JSB's European division, said
the biggest problem facing the company is educating information
technology people that the Intranet concept is simple but very
effective - and has nothing to do with Notes. He said many
companies using internal E-mail believe they already have an
Intranet, but are not harnessing the Internet-style technology to
disseminate corporate information. For example using ordinary E-
mail, the company would mail a document to all users, regardless
of its use to them. Using Web technology, the company would
merely mail users a message, telling them which Web page contains
the relevant document.

JSB's Intranet suite will consist of what the company calls an
'end user-comfortable' interface, as distinct from an icon-based
graphical interface. Purdham says the icon-based interface was
the best that could be done with low resolution screens and
existing technology, but now there is no need to be bound by it
as a standard. JSB is offering a multimedia kiosk-style
interface, written using the Internet HyperText Mark-up Language.
This approach enables users to see a photograph of their office,
with doors leading to the accounts department for example, which
they can click on for access to the accounts system on the
server. Within the accounts department they may see photographs
of an order book, an invoice book, a customer book, and then
choose which book they wish to use.

Each company can customise this interface by scanning in pictures
or photographs appropriate to its own operation. Behind the
kiosk, JSB has written its own Web browser using Mosaic Web
software licensed from Spyglass Inc. The fully integrated suite
also consists of E-mail, and the File Transfer Protocol. However
JSB said that each is available as a component, and any company
already with a Netscape Communications Corp World Wide Web
browser would still be able to use this, with other components
from JSB's suite.

The kiosk-style front end is also for sale as a separate entity.
The kiosk, available any day now, will run under Windows 3.X, 95
and NT. The rest of the client suite, Web browser, mail and File
Transfer Protocol, will be available for Windows95 and NT only,
at the end of the month. JSB will also offer a server suite, for
Santa Cruz Unix and AIX at present, which includes an alpha
browser for users with dumb terminals. Prices are promised this
month, but should be $100-$200 per user for the client software
suite and less than $1,000 for the server suite.

Forrester Research. The report comes amid a flurry of hype as
valuations of Netscape Communications Corp, the two-year-old Web
browser company that turned its first profit in the September
quarter and will definitely report a loss next time, soared into
the $6,200m stratosphere before slipping back a little.

The report is forecasting a $9,000m Internet infrastructure
market, a $1,800m consumer market, a $4,500m business information
market and an on-line shopping and trading market worth $14,000m.

 C&W TRIES TO HURRY YOUNG & ROSS PAYOFF


According to a report in The Daily Telegraph, Cable & Wireless is
attempting to accelerate negotiations over compensation for its
two former senior executives before a special meeting of
shareholders on January 15. Last November C&W chairman and his
arch-rival, ceo James Ross, were forced to resign after an
acrimonious board-room battle (issue 201).

The board is understood to have agreed to pay compensation to
Lord Young, although he had no service contract. The amount is
believed to be well below the #2m-#4m said to have been claimed
by Lord Young. He has been offered less than a year's salary,
along with pension entitlement and part of share options worth
#1.7m. Lord Young's pension is believed to have been fully
funded, although specialists estimate C&W will have to set aside
around #2m to provide him with a payment equivalent to a third of
last year's salary of #465,000.

James Ross, has yet to finalise his severance terms.

 COMPUSERVE MADE TO LIMIT ACCESS...


H&R Block Inc's CompuServe Inc online service provider has bowed
to pressure from the German government and temporarily suspended
worldwide access to more than 200 Internet newsgroups, in
response to a direct mandate from the prosecutor's office in
Germany. The decision was made after German government officials
investigating illegal material on the Internet, including child
pornography and other pornographic material for adults,
identified the newsgroups as illegal under German law.

CompuServe, which provides Internet access in over 100 countries,
says it does not have the capability to suspend materials on a
country-by-country basis - but the lock-out could raise big
freedom of speech issues in the US if the Germans ever get around
to enforcing their onerous laws in the same manner, because many
right-wing US news groups would likely be deemed to be
unacceptable.

The freedom of speech issues are mitigated by the fact that any
German wanting to access the banned newsgroups can simply go in
via an Internet access provider not operating in Germany.

 NETSCAPE PROMISES THERE WILL BE "DOG-FIGHT" WITH MICROSOFT


Netscape Communications Corp has promised a high-profile "dog-
fight" as Microsoft Corp unwraps a dozen Internet-related
products for what many are calling 'the platform of the future.'

The day after Microsoft's wide-ranging Internet product
announcement last month (issue 204), Netscape CEO James Barksdale
told the Price Waterhouse software industry forum in Redwood
City, California, "It will be a dog-fight, no doubt about it." He
doubted, however, that Netscape would ever have the dominance of
the Internet that Microsoft has of the operating system market:
"We don't propose that we're ever going to be the 800-pound
gorilla."

But at Microsoft's launch the day before, CEO Bill Gates was
careful to avoid the name of the one company that leads most
Internet stories. "To write Microsoft out of the Internet
equation, as many people have done, was pure lunacy," said
Stephen Auditore, President of analyst firm, Zona Research Inc.
"More important than what was said at Microsoft's announcement,
was what was not said - Netscape."

Gates wants to use Microsoft's overwhelming dominance of the
operating system sector to become a leading player on the
Internet. But Barksdale was not put out. "I think they
(Microsoft) will have to win out on features and functionality,"
he said, adding that Microsoft's operating system, which
dominates 80% of the world's computers, did not justify its claim
to be able to command whole segments of the software industry.
"Most people are tired of being obligated, controlled by,
licensed by and tied down to one company. It's a tough fight -
I'll grant you that. But we're brave," he said, introducing a
previously unknown player: "We're well financed and we believe
that God is on our side."

Separately, Netscape has announced the first winners of its 'bugs
bounty', a programme that rewards users who tell Netscape of
major faults in its software (odd that a company should so
proudly boast its underachievement). A pair of software sleuths -
Scott Weston from Australia, Paul Kocher from San Francisco -
each won $1,000 for finding security gaps in Netscape Navigator.

Weston found that Sun Microsystems Inc's on-line language
JavaScript could extract the history of a user's on-line session,
including credit card information. Cryptography expert Kocher
found holes that would enable people to crack the Public Key
encryption by timing exactly how long each encryption was taking
- a method known to reveal some encryption keys. Kocher is
currently working with Netscape to help patch the fault.

The bounty programme hastily followed September's successful hack
into the security code of the Navigator software, unearthing
supposedly secret credit card transactions. As a result of this,
the company decided to offer cash to anyone who could come up
with similar bugs in test versions of Navigator 2.0.

Thus far, Netscape claims the two winners are the only ones to
come up with significant security bugs, although it also awarded
gifts to 50 other entrants for reporting other bugs. All known
bugs are now fixed, it claims. "By rewarding users for quickly
identifying and reporting bugs back to us, this programme is
encouraging what is perhaps the most extensive, open review of
beta software in the industry," the company proudly boasted.

 AOL PREPARES FOR ITS UK LAUNCH


America On-Line Inc is gearing up for its UK launch this month
with prices low enough to give European Internet access providers
cause for concern. The European service, christened AOL UK to
avoid confusion with rivals UK Online and Europe Online, will
undercut prices severely for infrequent users of the Internet.

Exact prices are confidential, but the company claims they will
be lower than those in America, where customers pay no membership
fees, a monthly fee of $10 for five hours, and $3 for each hour
thereafter. This compares with prices among UK providers of #10
to #15 a month, many of which charge a flat start-up fee of up to
#50.

But CityScape Ltd's managing director, Clive Feather, who charges
#50 start-up, #15 a month for unlimited access and 1Mb of Web
space for subscribers, does not worry about AOL UK. "People only
need to use the Internet for 10 hours a month to make these
prices comparable to ours," he said. "Our studies suggest people
spend an hour a day on the Net."

AOL UK disagrees, suggesting an average of seven hours a month,
although it admitted to some accounts spending up to $1,500. "We
have our own therapy groups on AOL," said a spokesperson. A
merger of proprietary services, such as CompuServe Inc, with the
unregulated Internet is the future for on-line customers,
according to newly installed AOL UK md, Jonathan Bulkeley. "We're
already the largest Internet provider in the world," he said,
alluding to the four million subscribers who have access to the
World Wide Web through the AOL browser - or any other. "If you
don't like our browser, use someone else's," said Bulkeley.

In line with its US founder, AOL UK will target consumers
exclusively - "it is not our intention to target businesses,"
said Bulkeley - with a completely re-vamped interface for Europe
including the voice of actress Joanna Lumley and the ability for
consumers to publish their own pages with AOL UK's own publisher
software, NaviSoft. AOL UK will cover 80% of the UK at speeds of
28.8Kbps, with full coverage in the Spring.

EIAJ PROJECT VALUE OF 1990 PRODUCTION AT 23.90 TRILLION YEN+

     The Electronic Industries Association of Japan
(E IAJ) released its "1990 Production Forecasts for the
Japanese Electronics Industry" on December 20, 1989. This
report projects that the value of the industry's output in
1990 will rise 5.7% over the previous year to reach nearly
23.98 trillion yen. A breakdown by product category shows
that industrial electronic equipment production is expected
to expand 9.4%, to 11.95 trillion yen, and will play
leading role in the overall growth of production. In terms
of value, this market will account for half of the
electronic industry's total output. Production of
electronic components and devices is expected to rise 3%,
to 7.83 trillion yen, though the rate of growth will be
lower than last year's. The forecast for consumer
electronic equipment shows production edging up only a
slight 0.9%, to just u nder 4.20 trillion yen.
    Total production of the electronics industry in 1989 is
estimated at 22.68 trillion yen, a gain of 6.7%
on the year. Meanwhile, the consumer electronic equipment
sector and general electronic components sector are not
expected to show such rosy results compared with the
forecasts made a year ago. But thanks to the growth seen
for industrial electronic equipment and semiconductors,
the overall output of the industry in 1989 is estimated to
expand pretty much as initially forecast.
    An outline of the 1989 production estimates and 1990
forecasts for the,electronics  industry is given below.

1989 Production Estimates+

      The Japanese economy sustained steady growth in
1989, supported by increased capital investment in the
private sector and strong consumer spending. The U.S. and
European economies also continued to expand, but at a
slower pace. With this economic environment as a backdrop,
the output of the Japanese electronics industry showed
robust growth.
     Looking at individual product segments, production of
industrial electronic equipment is estimated at 10.92
trillion yen, an increase of 10.2%, which reflects vigorous
capital spending. This segment is now approaching an 11
trillion yen  market in annual terms. The main driving
force behind the expansion in this sector is the
double-digit growth seen for computer equipment including
office and personal computers. Production of electronic
components and devices is estimated at 7.6 trillion yen,
a rise of 7.5% over 1988. This figure reflects sluggish
demand, from consumer electronic equipment manufactures,
despite the growth in sales of components for industrial
electronic equipment and for new multi-function,
compact product offerings. Production of consumer
electronic equipment is estimated at 4.16 trillion yen, a
drop of 2.4% from the previous year's level. This decline
is due to the downturn in domestic demand, which had shown
favorable expansion in previous years, and to increased
offshore production volumes by Japanese manufacturers. For
the first time ever, consumer electronic equipment is
expected to account for less than 20% of the electronic
industry's total output.

1990 Production Outlook+

     The annual output of the electronics industry is
projected to rise 5.7%, to nearly 23.98 yen.
     Projections made for individual product sectors
indicate that industrial electronic equipment will once
again be the leading factor behind the industry's expanding
output. Production in this sector is projected to climb
9.4%, to 11.95 trillion yen. This increase reflects
vigorous capital investment plans for information systems,
including computers and communications equipment.
     Production of electronic components and
devices is expected to stand at 7.83 trillion yen, as
the annual growth rate drops off to 3.0%. This
slowdown is attributed to the bottoming out of
the growth rate for semiconductors and to
increased production of electronic equipment
overseas. These factors will more than offset the
continued expansion of demand for industrial
electronic equipment components, the growing
range of component applications and launches of
high value-added products.
    Consumer electronic equipment production is
expected to remain almost flat, edging up only by
developing new products that are tailored to 0.9%, to
4.20 trillion yen. This minuscule growth the needs of
consumers and serve to enrich their projection reflects the
continuation of expanding imports and sluggish exports due
to rising production volumes overseas, as well as the
absence of any factors that could substantially boost
domestic output. Bright spots in the outlook are expected
to include the growing popularity in the domestic
market of new products, such as camcorders and video disk
players and expanding demand both at home and abroad for
high value-added products.
     The supply-and-demand structure in the global
electronics industry is gradually being transformed
worldwide. Some of the factors at work here include the
rising offshore production volumes of Japanese
manufacturers, the growth of competitors in the newly
industrializing economies (NIEs) of Asia and the steps
being taken to cope with integration of the EC market in
1992. Amidst these changes, the production system in the
domestic market is also undergoing a period of transition.
While future growth is expected in all product segments, it
is projected that growth differences among various market
sectors will become more obvious in 1990's production
figures.
    The following is an outline of the forecasts made for
individual product segments.

1990 Production outlook -2- +

(1) Consumer electronic equipment
     In the domestic market for consumer electronic
equipment, steady growth is expected for video equipment
owing to the spreading popularity of such new media as
satellite and high-definition broadcasting and video disk
players. Products like camcorders and CD players, which
incorporate state-of-the-art technologies, are also
projected to show strong advances. Offsetting these growth
factors will be a gradual decline in exports due to
the continued expansion of production overseas. As a
result, output of consumer electronic equipment is expected
to edge up only a slight 0.9%, to 4.2 trillion yen.
Although worldwide demand for high value-added products
will continue to advance, and there are numerous products
with excellent growth potential, these factors will not
be strong enough to boost production in the domestic
market.
     Domestic production of consumer electronic equipment
is now at a major turning point as a result of the
expanding offshore production volumes of Japanese
manufacturers. An important challenge facing the Japanese
electronics industry in the years ahead will be to
stimulate demand by developing ne products that are
tailored to the needs of consumers and serve to enrich
their lifestyles.
(2) Industrial electronic equipment
     The 1990 forecast for industrial electronic
equipment calls for production to rise 9.4%, to 11.95
trillion yen.  The projections made individual categories
are outlined below.
     1)Radio communications systems
          Output of radio communications systems in
1990 is expected to increase 11.1%, to 987.7 billion yen.
Backed mainly by strong domestic demand, this increase will
exceed 1989's growth rate. Private-sector demand for radio
communications equipment is projected to show double-digit
growth, reflecting strong demand for car telephones, pocket
pagers and terminal equipment, as well as the increased
demand for base stations. Moreover, the launching of
private-sector communications satellites (JC-SAT and
Superbird) will usher in an era of full-fledged satellite
communications.   This is expected to stimulate increased
demand for satellite communications equipment in certain
businesses, including the education field, and also among
cable TV companies for the supply of programming. Strong
demand for radio communications systems is also expected
from the government sector, particularly from the Defense
Agency.
          Production of mobile communications equipment for
vehicles is projected to rise 19.3%, to 177.8
billion yen. This segment is expected to see the startup of
new cellular telephone companies in the Tohoku, Hokuriku
and Hokkaido regions, intensifying competition with NTT
over car telephone services and rates. This should lead to
a more active car telephone market and further penetration
of car telephone services. The MCA radio communications
sector is presently facing a line capacity shortage in the
Tokyo metropolitan area and a new system operating in the
quasimicrowave bandwidth is scheduled to be implemented in
 1990.
          Demand for marine communications equipment is
expected from the merchant shipping and shipbuilding
industries as a result of increased cargo movement due to
the economic upturn.  While demand from the Defense Agency
is projected to drop off gradually, other government
agencies are expected to place new and replacement orders
for experimental and training vessels. As a result, the
output of marine communications equipment is projected to
increase 4.8%, to 24.1 billion yen.
          Stable demand is forecast for aircraft
communications equipment, centering on the Mid Term
Defense Program of the Defense Agency.
          Production of radio application equipment is
expected to advance steadily to 285.8 billion yen, up 11%
over 1989, reflecting strong demand from the New Kansai
International Airport project, in addition to orders from
the Ministry of Transport and other government agencies.
     2)Electronic application equipment
          The forecast calls for electronic application
equipment production to increase 11.3%, to nearly 7.3
trillion yen. Within this sector, output of computers and
related equipment is expected to reach 6.36 trillion yen,
up 11.6%, about the same growth rate as In 1989. This
increase will be supported by continued active demand for
personal and office computers and other core products.
          Production of TV monitors for industrial use is
expected to show a 12% rise, climbing to 136.7 billion yen.
Supporting this growth will be a double-digit increase in
domestic demand for monitors used in supervision
applications (e.g. traffic control systems, production
lines, financial institutions and retail stores) and in
inspection and measurement applications (e.g. automation of
visual inspection systems and dimension and profile
measurement systems). Output of ultrasonic application
equipment is projected to climb to 181.9 billion yen, a
favorable advance of 10.8%, centering around medical
equipment demand.
     3) Electric measuring instrumentation
     The 1990 forecast for electric measuring
instrumentation production calls for a firm gain of 7.2%,
with output rising to 698.2 billion yen. Oscilloscopes are
expected to register double-digit growth supported by an
increase in more sophisticated models as a result of the
further penetration of digital oscilloscopes and the
development of new office automation and factory automation
equipment. However, due to the bottoming out of growth in
the semiconductor sector in 1990, demand is expected to be
sluggish for electronic tubes, semiconductors and IC
measuring devices, which, together, account for
approximately 30% of the electric measuring instrumentation
market. As a result, this market will slip to single-digit
growth in contrast to its double-digit expansion in 1989.
     4) Electronic business machines
     Production of electronic business machines is expected
to rise 6.2%, to 1.08 trillion yen, led mainly by continued
strong demand in the domestic market.
     Electronic calculators are projected to show continued
double-digit   growth, sustained by product offerings
featuring expanded functions, such as electronic memo
books, and by consumer preferences for more sophisticated
products.
     Word processor output is expected to show favorable
growth, buoyed by firm domestic demand. Copy machine
production is projected to grow favorably overall. Orders
in the domestic market are likely to rise as a result of
increased demand from small and medium-sized businesses
and replacement demand stemming from the shift to higher
grade models. This will be offset, however, by slower
export growth as Japanese manufacturers expand their
offshore production volumes. Production of cash registers
is forecast to show solid growth, supported primarily by
demand for point of sale terminals, as the special demand
for new equipment capable of handling sales tax
computations has run its course.
(3) Electronic components
     The 1990 forecast for electronic components calls for
production to rise 2.9% over the previous year, to 3.29
trillion yen. Demand is expected to remain strong for
components used in industrial electronic equipment, such
as office automation, information processing and
communications systems. A key point in this segment will be
whether the introduction of new products can rejuvenate
demand in the video and audio equipment markets.
      Passive component production is projected to show a
small 2.6% increase, rising to 1.24 trillion yen. Further
advances are expected for highdensity surface-mounted
equipment and composition technologies, in response to
changing equipment needs. Manufacturers will be working
to concentrate technologies, enhance reliability,
diversify product lines and create higher valueadded
products.
     Production of functional components is expected to
register a slight gain of 1.7%, rising to 416.4 billion
yen. The forecast for mechanical component production calls
for continued solid growth, with output rising 4.7%, to
1.07 trillion yen.
(4) Active devices
     The 1990 production forecast for active devices shows
a rise of 2.2%, with output advancing to 4.35 trillion yen.
Semiconductors, which account for nearly 80% of this
market, have tended so far to show a four-year growth
cycle. Based on past experience, 1990 is expected to be the
year when active device production bottoms out.
     In the macroeconomic picture for 1990, the U.S.
economy is expected to experience a soft landing, while
domestic demand remains strong in Japan. As a result, a
period of moderate adjustment is foreseen, with a downward
trend overall. The production trend for active components
is expected to follow this basic pattern, as a shallow
bottoming out is projected to occur in mid-1990, followed
by an upturn during the second half of the year.
     In the electronic tubes category, domestic production
is expected to shift from cathode-ray tubes for color
televisions (CRTS) to cathode-ray tubes for color displays
(CDTs). Output of the former tubes is expected to decline,
owing to expanding offshore production volumes of Japanese
manufacturers and growing competition with the Asian NIES,
while production of the latter tubes is projected to show
steady growth due to the increase in high value-added
products. Production of display tubes, which has continued
to show relatively high growth, is expected to sustain
double-digit expansion, supported by solid demand for
industrial electronic equipment and the widening range of
applications for these tubes. As a result, output of
electronic tubes in 1990 is expected to remain firm,
registering a slight increase of 0.9%, to 684.5 billion
yen.
     Discrete semiconductor devices are projected to show a
production gain of 1.8%, rising to 665.3 billion yen. This
forecast reflects a slowdown in demand for consumer
electronic equipment, which should be partially offset by
favorable demand in the industrial electronic equipment
market.
     Production of semiconductor ICs is forecast. at
2.75 trillion yen, up 2.4%, but sharply off from the 18.7%
growth rate in 1989. While output is not likely to decline,
1990 is seen as being a period of moderate adjustment.
     MOS digital ICs are projected to show sluggish
production expansion, rising only 2.9% in 1990, far below
the 1989 growth level of 28.2%. Demand should be stimulated
by the introduction of more sophisticated microcomputer
ICs, such as 32-bit, high-speed, multi-gate devices, and
higher valuueadded memory products, including faster, more
highly integrated devices. However, the market as a whole
is expected to grow slowly because of uncertainties
regarding the supply-and-demand balance and future market
conditions.
     Output of hybrid ICs is projected to grow steadily in
1990 to 252.5 billion yen, an increase of 5.4% over 1989.
Because of the nature of custom-made products, demand is
not expected to be influenced significantly by overall
market conditions.
     Production of liquid crystal devices is pro jected to
show strong growth of 27.7%, climbing to 185.6 billion yen.
This favorable expansion will be supported by the rapid
shift from watch and calculator applications to large LCDs
for personal computers, word processors and other products.
Another supporting factor will be the growing demand for
color LCD devices.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INTRODUCTION OF THREE NEW DIGITAL RADIO SYSTEMS+

    -- Technical Requirements for Introduction of
three New Digital Radio Systems --

On January 22, the Telecommunications Technol-
ogy Council (TTC) submitted its final report to
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
concerning "Technical Requirements for Fixed
Digital Microwave Radio Networks". The report
recommends the introduction of three new sys-
tems: a medium-capacity systqm that provides
increased circuit capacity for public service net-
works, a system for telecommunications enter-
prises that uses the existing submicrowave band,
and a new small-capacity system to replace the
current public service system.
       Microwave radio is used for private communi-
cation, by national and municipal self-governing
bodies and public   institutions for disaster preven-
tion and maintenance of public order, and by commercial
entities for provision of electric power, gas and railway
communications. At present, public service have practical
use of up to the telephone circuit equivalent of 576
channels. However, in order to respond to the recent rapid
increase in amounts of information transmitted and the
need for image transmission due to integration of social
activities and the developing information society, the
introduction of a new radio system that provides about 1.5
times larger capacity than the existing system is desired.
      In addition, due to the rapid increase in demand for
mobile communication, as well as for car telephone service,
there is a significant shortage of available frequencies
for mobile communication service, so use of part of the
submicrowave band (2 GHz band) is being considered for
mobile communication service. Therefore, it has become
necessary to sequentially shift the small-capacity,
fixed circuits used for telecommunication service and
public service in the submicrowave band to higher
frequencies. For these reasons, the Teleommunications
Technology Council concluded in its final report that the
technical requirements for introduction of three new
systems should be as listed in Table 1.
      For telecommunication service use, however, a
large-capacity digital radio system that utilizes the
world's first 256 quadrature amplitude modulation system,
an epoch making technology developed by NTT, has been in
operation since December of last year.

NTT Pocket Pagers Pass the 3 Million Unit Mark+

     NTT recently announced that, as of the end of December
1989, the number of subscriptions for its pocket pager
services broke the 3 million level. (Total subscriptions
for the 30 new pocket pager companies: 1.05 million.)
      NTT's pocket pager service started in the 23  wards
of Tokyo in July 1968, was extended to Osaka in 1969, and
to Nagoya and Yokohama in 1970. At present, it is available
in most cities throughout Japan.
     The number of pocket pager subscriptions  exceeded 0.5
million in FY '75, reached 1 million in FY '80, passed 2
million in FY '85, then broke the 3 million level at the
end of December last year.
      Introduction of new services included the  start of
dual-call service in 1982, numeric-display pocket pagers in
April 1987, and fixed-statement display, pen-type and
card-type pagers in December 1988. There have also been
reductions in usage charges and deposits. In addition.
NTT had been developing various new services, such as
multi-area service, since November of last year.
     A breakdown of the 3 million subscriptions shows that
about two thirds of them are for "call only" (tone-only)
service, but there has recently been a significant increase
in the number of subscriptions for numeric-display and
pen-type pagers.
      NTT is planning to reduce its monthly charges for
pocket pager service on March 1 of this year. Charges for
tone-only service will be reduced from 2,500 yen to 2,000
yen, for numeric-display service from 2,900 yen to 2,600
yen, and fixedstatement-display service from 3,300 yen to
2,900 yen. In addition, those subscribers with contracts
for 31 or more units, will no longer have to pay a  deposit
for the 31st and succeeding sets. The monthly charge for
dual-call service will be reduced to 100 yen from the

NTT to Purchase Base Station Transmitters for
 Pocket Paging Service from Quintron of the U.S.+

      On February 5, NTT announced that it will  purchase
base station transmitters for radio paging service from
Quintron Corporation of the U.S., marking the first time
for the company to buy pocket paging service equipment from
a foreign source. The procurement announcement was placed
in Kampo, the Government Gazette, on December 21,' 1989 to
solicit additional suppliers and, based on technological
and price considerations, Quintron was selected, The
procurement order is expected to amount to about 400
million yen per year for Quintron.
      At present, NTT provides pocket paging service to
more than three million subscribers throughout Japan. The
equipment to be procured from Quintron will be set up at
radio base stations in certain service districts to send
information to pocket pagers carried by users.
     Quintron 'is an exclusive manufacturer and developer
of base station transmitters for radio paging service,
etc., and has its headquarters in Quincy, Illinois. The
company became a whollyowned subsidiary of Glenayre
Electronics Ltd. of Canada last year. Quintron products are
highly respected for both quality and reliability in the
U.S. market.                                (No. 103-2-3)

NTT Succeeds in Trial Production of Miniature
High-Performance Optical Fiber Amplifier+

      On January 25, NTT announced that it has succeeded in
the trial production of a miniature highperformance optical
fiber amplifier with an amplification factor exceeding
2,000.
     NTT has been conducting research on optical fiber
amplifiers to enable direct amplification of optical
signals through the use of optical fiber injected with
erbium (erbium-doped fiber). Thus, NTT's prototype system
uses erbium-doped fiber manufactured using vapor-phase
axial deposition (VAD) technology developed by NTT for
production of low-loss optical fiber and a newly devel-
oped semiconductor laser to supply energy to the optical
fiber amplifier. The volume of the prototype device is 36
cc, which is about one third the size of a pack of
cigarettes.
     When this amplifier is put to practical use, it can
easily be set up in a narrow space, such as inside optical
transmission equipment or optical relay devices. It is also
expected to contribute significantly to the extending of
relay distance and to the increasing of transmission speed
to the ultrahigh-speed range. With its broad general
purpose capabilities, this amplifier should have a wide
application range, including CATV and various optical
measuring installations.
     NTT has already succeeded in doubling the repeater
spacing (to 212 kilometers) of its current optical
transmission system using an optical fiber amplifier at 1.8
Gb/s, which proves the effectiveness of optical fiber
amplifiers.             (No. 103-2-4)

Recent Trends at KDD
    -- KDD to jointly Offer Port-PLAN with BT and MCI-- +

      On February 6, KDD announced that it has concluded
agreements with BT of England and MCI of the U.S. for the
joint offering of Port-PLAN (company communication network
service) and will start providing that service from the
middle of this year.
     According to the agreements, both BT and MCI will set
up digital voice switching devices (ICXs), which KDD was
the first in the world to develop, as their core facilities
for this service. The ICX is a switching system that
provides for various  type of communication, such as
facsimile and voice communication, as well as message
communication. The system enables construction of an
economical international incompany communication network
that can easily and quickly respond to user demand using
facilities installed in KDD, BT and MCI, without the
Port-PLAN user being required to posses related facilities
normally required for an international communication
network.
     Port-PLAN is a ready-made network service that
utilizes a previously established KDD leased circuit
service in response to user's demand, and was started on
August 1, 1989.
     Until now, in order to utilize Port-PLAN, the user had
to provide his own facilities on the overseas side.
Now, however, the offering of PortPLAN by BT and MCI makes
it possible for the application of a global network that
integrates various communication media in three countries
(Japan, England and the U.S.A.). In addition, maintenance
of the network is provided on a 24 hour basis for the
highest reliability.
     The leased system that is the core for the network
provides individual ports and trunks by media, including
voice, facsimile, data and teletype, with each leased
system connected by high-speed digital leased circuits
(Hi-BITLINK), which has extremely high reliability. Users
can easily and quickly construct a leased network just by
connection through a domestic circuit to the center facil-
ity in each country. In addition, the system can flexibly
respond to an increase or decrease in the amount Of
communication handled , or expand/update the network
configuration just by changing ports or trunks, thus
allowing users to apply the communication system that most
economically merits their demand. The leased system for the
overseas side are set up in London and Piscataway, New
Jersey.

--PC ISDN Board Compatible with OSI Communication
              and VAX ISDN Board Put to Practical Use--+

     On January 31, KDD announced that it had succeeded in
developing and putting to practical use the world's first
ISDN board compatible with personal computer OSI
communication, which enables communication between
different types of computers by connecting with ISDN. KDD
has also succeeded in putting to practical use Japan's
first ISDN board for the VAX minicomputers produced by DEC.
The board enables communcation between VAX units or
terminals in remote areas through ISDN.
    OSI Plus Corp., a KDD subsidiary, has been charged with
commercialization of both ISDN boards, with sales starting
on February 1.
     A description of the two boards follows.
(1) OSI-compatible PC ISDN board
     When combined with an OSI layer 5 board, which is
already commercially available, this board enables the use
of an all-purpose personal computer for OSI communication,
including high-speed file transfer and message
communication, through KDD's international ISDN service
or NTT's INS-Net 64. It also provides for multi-media
communication by simultaneous communication of voice and
data or voice and images, through the use of two B channels
(Refer to Figures 1, 2).
     OSI Plus Corp., the original distributor, has combined
this board with an OSI layer 5 board and will sell the
combined unit as "u-OSI/ISDN". It consists of two boards,
each with its own CPU, and must be installed in two
expansion slots in the personal computer for use. At
present boards are only available for, NEC 9801 Series
computers, but boards for other personal computers and work
stations are under development. The unit is priced at
590,000 yen, with shipping scheduled to start on May 1.
(2) VAX ISDN board
     This board was developed by KDD in cooperation with
ABIT Corp. It provides for direct connection to DEC's VAX
mini-computer, which is in use throughout the world, and is
simply installed in an expansion slot in the VAX. enables
high-speed file transfer and host access with VAX or other
terminals through an ISDN from the terminal or a telephone
coupler connected to the VAX or directly to the board.
(Refer to Figure 3).
     OSI Plus sells this board as a "VIT1000 ISDN Interface
Board", and it is priced at 800,000 yen for the basic
system, which includes the main board, an expansion
interface box and accessories. Various options are also
available, including a 64/56 Kb/s V.11 interface unit
(25,000 yen) and a 4-board asynchronous interface expansion
unlit (100,000 yen). Shipping is expected to start on April
2.
     The DEC minicomputers with which the VIT1000 can be
used include the Micro VAX Series and the VAX Station
Series. The product can be used to construct a broadband
LAN through an ISDN by connecting VAX networks or LANs that
use the VAX.              (No. 103-2-6)

--KDD joint U.S. INFONET by Investment by Investment--+

      On January 11, KDD announced that it has obtained a 5%
share of INFONET Service Corp., a U.S. data communication
company whose other stock holders are major
telecommunication carriers in Europe and the Asia/Pacific
region, from Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC), a U.S.
information communication software company. KDD will also
dispatch one executive to join the company. This
joining-by-investment will allow KDD to respond more
flexibly to demands for international data communication
service in cooperation with the other telecommunication
carriers that are already stockholders in the company.
     Currently, Mitsui Knowledge Industry Co. (MKI), a
subsidiary of Mitsui & Co., Ltd., is offering INFONET
service in Japan. However, KDD is studying possible methods
of offering INFONET service in the future in cooperation
with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and MKI.
     INFONET Service Corp. was established in 1970 as a
division of CSC. At present, it provides data communication
and information processing services both inside the U.S.
and internationally. In 1988, INFONET separated from CSC
and became an independent company, and telecommunication
carriers in Europe and the Asia/Oceania region have been
joining the company by investment in succession. With
KDD's investment at this time, major telecommunications
carriers in the U.S., Europe and the Asia and Pacific
region will jointly own and operate INFONET.

Matsushita Electric Industrial Develops High-Capacity,
Compact Central Earth Station for Video and Data Signals+

      On January 16, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
announced that it had developed a compact, high-
performance radio system for use in satellite com-
munication central earth stations. The new radio
system gives the central earth stations the capabil-
ity to transmit both video and data signals, as well
as increasing maintainability.
    The system is capable of transmitting multiple
carrier data signals and a broadband video signal at
the same time, so it is expected to have positive
effect on the promotion and diffusion of satellite-
based multimedia communication networks, which
are considered to have serious potential in the
future. Until now, it has been necessary to transmit
and receive the two types of signals using separate
systems.
    The satellite communication central earth
station provides the core functions for the data
communication network and controls the network,
which is composed of multiple VSATS. Therefore,
the equipment used must provide high perform-
ance and be highly reliable. Recently, there has
also been increasing demand for reduction of
required installation space. That is, what is
required now is a more compact system with
increased maintainability.
    The same is true for satellite-based multi-
media communication networks. That is, construc-
tion of such a system requires development of
a small earth station capable of transmitting both
multiple carrier data signals and a broadband video
signals.
    Matsushita's new system has been developed
in response to these requirements. Its primary
features include (1) a compact system with excel-
lent maintainability that can be set up and
operated in simple mini-shelters. (2) capability
to simultaneously transmit both data and video
signals for construction of a multimedia communi-
cation network, and (3) a future-oriented design
that provides flexible system configuration and
high performance capable of sending high-defini-
tion TV signals. The system is expected to find
significant application of these features in (1)
central earth stations for VSAT data communica-
tion   networks,    (2) central earth stations for
satellite news gathering (SNG), and (3) satellite
communication entral earth stations for various
private networks.

has developed the BX-2 Complex Tie-Line System, a dealing
system that provides the world's fastest access, and will
initiate sales of the new system on April 1st.
     The BX-2 is provided with an abundance of functions to
meet the needs of the entire dealing market, including
short-term investment companies, banks and securities
companies, and can be used to construct a system that is
most suitable for the specific application, with system
sizes ranging from medium to large, thus giving the
impression of an order-made system. Maximum capacity of the
BX-2 is 4,000 circuits (2,000 circuits if touch screens are
used) and 512 operating stands.

     The price for a standard configuration, which consists
of 200 lines including leased line, station line and PBX
line and 50 operating stands, ranges from 80 to 150 million
yen (excluding consumption tax and installation cost).
     The major features of the BX-2 are (1) adoption of a
distributed control system, (2) the world's fastest access
for all-digital circuits and the fastest information
delivery speed, (3) adoption of touch screens to realize
smaller operating stands, and (4) an abundance of module
panels that can be flexibly assembled to provide the feel
of a custommade dealing board.
     Iwatsu expects to sell 50 systems and 2,000 operating
stands in the next year.

ATM IN THE PUBLIC NETWORK:
WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR, WHO WILL DELIVER IT?

By Lawrence Gasman
Senior Contributing Editor

Just as the recent fuss over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) as
a transport technology for enterprise networking hubs was eclipsing
ATM's role in the public network, Sprint's announcement that it has
won a major government contract to supply ATM services has put
the subject of ATM in public networks back in the limelight.  Some
important questions are being raised:

"What is the relationship between ATM services and the carriers'
pre-broadband SMDS (switched multimegabit data service) and
frame relay services?"

"Who will be the leaders in the ATM market?"

"What is the relationship between private and public ATM?"

Answering the first of these questions is made more difficult by the
insistence, in most discussions of ATM, that ATM is one thing when
it really is two.  ATM is a switch/multiplexing technology that may
be deployed in the central office or on customer premises.  ATM is
also a future service provided by a carrier.  As a service, ATM
provides access to an ATM switch-ing/multiplexing fabric in much
the same way that ISDN provides access to an Nx64 Time-Division
Multiplexed (TDM) switching fabric.

As a switching/multiplexing technology there is no conflict between
ATM, on the one hand, and frame relay and SMDS, on the other.
On the contrary, ATM switches are the ideal switching technology
to underpin frame relay or SMDS.  StrataCom, the company that
pioneered frame relay switches, is well advanced in transitioning its
non-standard cell-based switches to ATM, for example.  But as a
service, ATM is a potential serious rival to SMDS and frame relay.

Even at this early stage of ATM development, this rivalry is
becoming apparent.  Sprint won its ATM service contract with the
Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration in competition with AT&T and MCI, both of which
apparently planned to service the contract with SMDS or something
like it (see separate story).

And the overlap between ATM and earlier services has become
greater because of the recent specification by the ATM Forum
which includes a DS-3 (45 Mbps) interface to ATM.  Previously, the
only standard interfaces to ATM were the CCITT's OC-3 (155
Mbps) and OC-12 (620 Mbps) interfaces defined for the ATM
Layer of Broadband ISDN.

OC-3 and OC-12 are overkill for today's wide-area network
applications.  DS-3 is about right.  SMDS also works at rates up to
DS-3.  In fact, the ATM Forum's DS-3 interface and the SMDS
interface both borrow heavily from the work done for the IEEE's
802.6 Metropolitan Area Network.  Frame relay still operates at
rates of DS-1 and below, but BT North America (and perhaps other
carriers) may force frame relay up to DS-3.

DS-3 SMDS and "native" ATM services operating at DS-3 rates
have a lot in common.  But it remains unclear how well SMDS
would support applications involving real-time voice and/or real-
time video.  There probably would be no major problem with
running voice/video over SMDS, but SMDS is being marketed
primarily as a data-oriented LAN (local area network)
internetworking service, while ATM specifically was designed to
support virtually every kind of communications mode.  Many people
believe that multimedia communications--a combination of voice,
text, still-image, animation, and full-motion video--will be the "killer
application" for ATM.

Sprint is well positioned to exploit the multimedia-over-ATM
opportunity.  Not only will it be supplying the Energy Department
and NASA with ATM services, but it is also a major participant in
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's MAGIC test
bed.  Here Sprint will supply ATM backbone service for a
visualization application (visualization networking has many of the
same characteristics as multimedia).

Finally, Sprint is the market leader in the videoconferencing services
business.  And videoconferencing may well emerge as a vital
component of multimedia.

But the die is not yet cast.  MCI and AT&T have well-advanced
broadband plans, although ATM does not seem to be as central to
their plans as to Sprint's.  WilTel, on the other hand, has always
said that it wants to have an ATM backbone in place by 1993, and
WilTel's role may take on new significance if it forms a relationship
with British Telecom as expected.  Also, at the time of writing, the
Sprint DOE/NASA contract was not absolutely finalized.  So,
Sprint's ATM lead still could be lost.

The ATM-based public carrier switch market is wide open.  Of the
three major central office switch vendors--AT&T, Northern
Telecom, and Siemens Stromberg-Carlson--none has yet to
announce the availability of a full-scale ATM central office switch.
In fact, the nearest thing to an ATM central office switch these days
is Fujitsu's FETEX-150.

Fujitsu never has had a presence in the U.S. central office switch
market, but it has used its early adoption of ATM to leverage the
FETEX-150 into several important broadband trials--including U S
WEST's COMPASS trial, which some believe will help set the
pattern for future Bell company broadband switch purchases.  The
FETEX-150 is also in trials with BellSouth and NYNEX.  A couple
of months back, NYNEX installed a FETEX-150 in its R&D lab,
claiming that it had the "world's first hybrid/ATM fabric."

It seems that almost every telecommunications equipment and
computer company has plans for an ATM product of some kind.
There are lots of plans, but few products.  And, of course, most of
the products are aimed at private networks rather than the public
carriers' networks, which brings us to the final question raised at the
beginning of this article:  What will be the relationship between
ATM equipment in the public network and ATM elements in
private networks?

ATM began as a technology for public networks--the transport
technology for broadband ISDN.  Now, however, it is believed that
ATM will find its first commercial applications in multimedia LANs
and in private network hubs.  The truth is that ATM probably
simultaneously will start to appear in islands in all segments of the
network, with public data carriers accounting for a significant slice
of ATM activity.

But despite all the fuss about ATM and promises of ATM products
and services, the fact is that ATM in any form is still not quite here
as a widely available commercial reality.  That will not happen until
1993.

SPRINT WINS $50,000,000 CONTRACT TO UPGRADE
ENERGY, NASA RESEARCH NETWORKS TO ATM

The Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration have selected Sprint Corp. to provide broadband
communications services needed to upgrade three of their national
research data networks to asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
technology.  Estimated to be worth more than $50,000,000 over the
next five years, the contract makes Sprint the first carrier to provide
wide-area ATM service, DoE said.

Slated for the upgrade are DoE's Energy Sciences Network (ESnet),
and NASA's AEROnet and Science Internet systems.  These
networks provide high-speed, nationwide, and international data
communications to support various open research and educational
programs in energy, aeronautics, space, and earth science.

ATM service will be provided to the ESnet on an "early availability"
basis, while it generally is "not expected to be widely commercially
available before 1994," Sprint said.  The activity is funded under the
federal High-Performance Computing and Communications
Program.  Working with Sprint on the contract is TRW of Redondo
Beach, Calif., which will provide new broadband access switches
developed by its Space Communications Division; Cisco Systems of
Menlo Park, Calif., a manufacturer of network routers; and Digital
Equipment Corp. of Maynard, Mass.

BELLCORE ISSUES ATM/BROADBAND ISDN
GENERIC REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTS FOR COMMENT

Public network deployment of Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM)/broadband integrated service digital network (BISDN)
capabilities came another step closer with Bell Communications
Research's issuance of three technical advisories.  It released
documents on "broadband switching system generic criteria" (TA-
NWT-001110); "broadband ISDN physical interface specifications"
(TA-NWT-001112); and "broadband ISDN transfer protocol generic
criteria" (TA-NWT-001113).

The first document describes the telecommunications switching
system capabilities required, including user and network interfaces,
internetworking, services supported, operations functions, usage
parameter control, and performance.  The second proposes the
generic requirements for the BISDN user-to-network interface and
the network-to-network interface.  And the third provides proposed
generic requirements on how information is carried through the
BISDN network.  It focuses on services provided by each layer of
the protocol, functions performed to provide these services, and
interactions between functions.

The advisories are being circulated for industry comment before
being finalized as Bellcore Technical References, and Bellcore
expects that work will continue into next year.  Steve Walters,
Bellcore's BISDN project manager, said that the advisories "are a
critical step in BISDN deployment in that they contain generic
requirements needed by suppliers so they can build initial BISDN
network equipment."

FRAME RELAY FORUM RATIFIES NETWORK-TO-
NETWORK INTERFACE; SPRINT's TAFFEL IS NEW HEAD OF FORUM

The Frame Relay Forum has ratified a network-to-network interface
(NNI) implementation agreement for permanent virtual circuit
(PVC)-based frame relay networks.  "The effect of this milestone
agreement will be to extend the geographic reach of frame relay
networking by permitting both public-to-public as well as private-to-
public network interconnections," said Alan Taffel, the forum's new
President and Chairman.  Mr. Taffel, Director-product marketing at
Sprint Corp., succeeds Thomas H. Jones, formerly of Netrix Corp.
Mr. Jones recently resigned his forum post when he left Netrix to
become Vice President-marketing for Microdyne Corp., which is not
a member of the forum.

The NNI agreement is based upon a similar user-to-network
interface (UNI) implementation pact approved by the forum earlier
this year.  "The NNI agreement, however, addresses new areas such
as bi-directional procedures for PVC management signaling and
congestion control," the forum noted.  The agreement now will be
forwarded to the Open Systems Interconnection Implementor's
Workshop (OIW), including the OIW's Asian and European arms,
for ratification.  It also will be submitted for inclusion in the
Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile, as was done
previously for the UNI agreement.  According to the Frame Relay
Forum, this approach "is likely to be followed by other industry
forums, such as the ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) Forum."

Meanwhile, the Frame Relay Forum's Technical Committee has
generated draft implementation agreements on multiprotocol
interconnection over frame relay and on switched virtual circuit
frame relay services.  Earlier, a service description for frame relay
multicast was developed.

The forum is a non-profit corporation dedicated to promoting the
acceptance and implementation of frame relay based on national
and international standards.


While the forum is not a standards-making body, its technical
committees provide liaison with the standards bodies.

The forum just established two new chapters--one based in Rennes,
France (for Europe) and one headquartered in New South Wales
(for Australia).  There are plans to form a chapter in Asia.

MFS PRESIDENT SEES FCC's EXPANDED
INTERCONNECTION DECISION
AS `ESSENTIAL BUILDING BLOCK' FOR DISMANTLING
LOCAL TELCO MONOPOLY

(At its open meeting Sept, 17, the FCC took several actions that will
hasten the end of the local exchange monopoly in the U.S.  The
centerpiece of its package of decisions was the adoption of rules
allowing telco competitors and users to physically collocate their
transmission equipment in telco central offices.  The FCC said that
interconnectors and local telcos would be free to negotiate "virtual"
collocation agreements as well.  Telcos were directed to file tariffs
outlining all terms of their special access interconnections, including
charges.  Interconnection for switched transport is being considered
in a separate FCC proceeding.

In an interview at TDR's offices the same week, the head of a
competitive access provider that had urged the FCC to look into the
matter discussed the competitive era emerging.)

While MFS Communications Co., Inc., President Royce J. Holland
did not expect a "perfect" FCC decision on expanded
interconnection with local telco facilities, he views the agency's
recent decision as an "essential building block" for dismantling the
"$90 billion local exchange monopoly."  Mr. Holland, who also is
President and Chief Executive Officer of MFS, Inc., described the
regulatory process as "analog," not "digital"; he explained that
changes in the system are "incremental rather than all at once."

He predicted a "five- to eight- or nine-year" period before the
outstanding major issues would be resolved and the breakup of the
local loop monopoly would occur.  He likened the natural monopoly
or franchise concept to the Berlin Wall, which was built to keep
people in as well as out.  "Modern telecommunications should not
look like the old East Germany," he said.

"We're getting a lot of inquiries today about customized network
solutions throughout metropolitan areas," Mr. Holland said.  "This is
primarily for data transmission, to link workstations and PCs with
mainframes, to link workstations together, for shooting images and
data back and forth across town.  In other words, we're talking
about replacing the automobile as a vehicle for transmission with a
high-speed link.  With interconnection, we can provide that one-stop
shopping to a particular business."


For example, he said, suppose there is a business with its
headquarters in downtown Chicago, a high-speed data center in the
O'Hare airport area, and three regional offices in Evanston, Joliet,
and St. Charles.  Today, MFS would be able to serve only the
headquarters and the data center with its fiber optic network.  But
with interconnection authority, MFS could add the three "remote"
sites.

In other words, the company would be able to interconnect these
sites with the Bell company in the serving wire center for each
location, lease DS1 channel termination circuits from the Bell
company, install its own routers on the customer's premises, and
allow the customer to access the mainframes and work stations
elsewhere, Mr. Holland said.  He promised that the company's MFS
Datanet, Inc., subsidiary soon would begin making announcements
regarding high-speed data projects.

Mr. Holland noted a "changing perception" in the industry, whereby
local telecommunications services "are being regarded as strategic
and tactical weapons for businesses to gain competitive advantages."
Several MFS customers, in fact, are employing "unique" image
processing and other high-speed data applications for services such
as Ethernet and Token-Ring channel extensions, he said.  But he
added that confidentiality agreements prohibit him from disclosing
more details.

He noted that MFS's goal is not to be the "second telephone
company."  Rather, the company's objective is to become the
"leading nationwide provider of voice, data, and video services to
businesses, government, and professional organizations," he said.
He did not see MFS's role as analogous to that of MCI
Telecommunications Corp. vis-a-vis AT&T.  He saw it more like
that of IBM Corp. and Electronic Data Systems in relation to the
industry.  "We're more on the trunk side of the PBX than the line
side," he said, adding that the role of the "second phone company" is
better played by the cable TV industry, which primarily serves
residences rather than businesses.

The authority to interconnect to local exchange carrier (LEC)
facilities means "significantly expanded competition for special
access" services and "LATA-wide ubiquity" in the 14 metropolitan
markets that MFS currently serves, Mr. Holland said.  He noted
that these "first-tier" cities include the nation's 10 largest special
access and private line markets.

But with interconnection authority, MFS could justify expanding its
facilities and even "start looking at second-tier cities" such as
Nashville, Salt Lake City, and Phoenix, Mr. Holland said.  "With
interconnection," he explained, "all of a sudden, you now have
LATA-wide ubiquity.  And now you can actually go out and address
the total market and phase in your network as you get market
share."

Without interconnection, however, only the largest markets will
enjoy the benefits of competition, he said.  "In fact, if you were
starting from scratch in the CAP (competitive access provider)
business today, you'd want to count the number of stock exchanges
in a city.  That probably is directly related to the volume of special
access circuits and local private lines--which is probably as good an
indicator (of market potential) as any," he explained.

Despite the emphasis on large metropolitan areas, MFS has not
divorced itself from what might be called "third-tier" markets served
by small independent telephone companies.

One of MFS's customers is the Minnesota Equal Access Network, a
group of independent telcos that is establishing a network that
"basically bypasses U S WEST," Mr. Holland said.  "What we do on
a city-wide scale, independents are doing on a statewide scale," he
added.

He said that MFS is involved in discussions with a number of
independents--"especially those near metropolitan areas that are
interested in using our services to get downtown."  He explained
that MFS already is providing a certain group of independents with
"diverse fiber routing from their territory" to a certain metro area.
But he said he could not disclose details because the parties
involved were not ready to make an announcement.  He believed
that CAPs and independents are "natural allies" because both have a
"difficult time" dealing with the Bell companies.

Pointing to a Connecticut Research study, Mr. Holland said that
1992 CAP revenues are estimated to be approximately $250,000,000.
MFS is "about half the industry; we're going to do $125,000,000 this
year," he said.  He added that MFS's investment totals $250,000,000-
-"again about half the industry."  The other half of the CAP industry
includes cable TV companies (approximately 40%) and small,
regional CAPs (5%-10%).  Titled "Alternate Local Transport:  A
Total Industry Report," the Connecticut Research study projects
that CAP revenues will reach $1.2 billion by 1995.  Contact Dick
Tomlinson at 203/659-0009.

Mr. Holland said he believes that MFS can maintain its share of the
CAP industry because it has the financial resources, can support
new product development, and has high standards for its own
network.  Following interconnection authority for CAPs, a relatively
rapid resolution of local dial-tone, switched access, interLATA toll,
and number portability issues is likely, he predicted.  By the end of
the decade, he predicted that all of the local exchange market would
be deregulated, competitive access would be a multibillion-dollar
industry, and CAPs would have a 35% share of the market.

FOCUS ON USERS
SURVEY SHOWS USE OF MULTIPLE LANs IS UP 30%,
BUT SPENDING FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS REMAINS
FLAT

While the installation of local area networks has increased
dramatically during the past year, overall spending on
telecommunications has been flat, a survey of nearly 800 North
American business and government telecom users has shown.  The
t
n726
fourth annual survey, conducted by Deloitte & Touche's
Telecommunications Group, revealed that more than 90% of the
respondents' organizations now have multiple LANs installed,
compared to 60% a year ago.

Communications managers cited "network management" as the most
important technical issue they face today.  Networks are expanding,
reflecting the consolidation of separate networks and the merger of
companies into single, large entities.  In addition, single
departments with corporate-wide telecom responsibilities are being
created.

The survey showed that telecom spending as a percentage of
revenue increased from 3% to 7%, depending upon the industry,
but that actual telecom expenditures generally remained constant,
increasing an average of 1.2% in 1991 across all industries.
Telecom spending in the government and financial services sectors
increased the most, 11%.  The manufacturing, services, and retail
industries decreased their telecom spending by an average of 9%.
Operating budgets for telecommunications averaged about 4.5 times
the capital budget across all industries, up from 4 times in 1991.
Salaries and personnel costs, the single largest budget component,
accounted for 27% of operating budgets.  Long distance, leased line,
and local access charges collectively accounted for 45%.  Twice as
many respondents--30%--reported having international responsibility
and coverage as in previous years.

Marco Bonilla, a partner in Deloitte & Touche's telecom practice,
said that "Despite the fact that 39% of the respondents indicated
that they had investigated enterprise-wide network management
products, not one, single enterprise network management system
currently exists among the responding companies."  According to the
survey, 88% of the respondents have one or more network products
and actively manage voice and/or data communications networks.
The most prominent wide-area network products in use are IBM
Netview, Racal-Milgo CMS, System Center Net/Master, and Codex.

A number of key network management issues were highlighted by
respondents.  These include:

The integration of networks and management products that
originally were not designed to work together;

An historical lack of internal company standards regarding
communications equipment;

An increased investment in telecommunications and the
requirement to protect that investment; and a general lack of well-
defined, open international standards on which to build network
management systems.

As for LAN design and operations, the average number of LANs
installed within the surveyed organizations was 48, each with 23
workstations on average.  Mr. Bonilla suggested that "This portends
an increase in the complexity of network services and expertise that
must be provided by the organizations responsible for LAN-related
technology deployment and operations, which may or may not be
the MIS/telecommunications department."

The use of LANs and LAN-based technology is prevalent within
most organizations, but "metrics for evaluating the performance,
availability, responsiveness, and data integrity of LAN-based systems
are informal at best and frequently don't exist at all," Deloitte &
Touche reported.  It said that a "lot of firefighting" has been the
result, and, consequently, companies "are not thinking about
tomorrow."  Yet increased reliance on communications means that
"the cost of service interruptions and degradation will rise as
productivity and revenues decline," Mr. Bonilla stated.  The
implication is that telecom planning and performance measures
must become a management priority in the near future.

While many new technologies have the potential to affect the
directions and strategies for LANs and LAN-based technologies,
survey respondents indicated that the following, in descending order,
will have the greatest impact:

Client/server applications (92%); Electronic image management
(91%); and Wireless LAN technology (73%).

Client/server applications are being used by 33% of the respondents,
though typically not for mission-critical applications yet.  Another
56% reported that they are evaluating the potential benefits of
client/server applications.  Respondents also indicated that such
applications currently make up less than 10% of their organization's
application portfolio (by number of applications).  Glenn James,
who developed the survey for Deloitte & Touche, said that
"Nevertheless, as the lack of internal expertise and mature products
is overcome, client/server applications will become a mainstream
design and delivery mechanism."

Deloitte & Touche said that "High-bandwidth metropolitan and
wide-area networks (greater than T-1) are not yet extensive in any
industry other than financial services (banking and brokerage
services) and education.  However, several industries and individual
companies report that they are investigating or planning such
networks within the next two years.  Products including frame relay,
FDDI, and SMDS are the most likely means of satisfying these
high-bandwidth requirements.

"Application development, particularly as it relates to the LAN and
workstation environment, and LAN-to-LAN communications will
force the implementation of these higher-bandwidth products and
services.  Projected rapid price decreases over the next few years for
some network services and communications hardware will allow
justification of projects that are currently not feasible or that can
only be marginally rationalized."  Contact Mr. Bonilla at Deloitte &
Touche, 285 Peachtree Center Ave., Suite 2000, Atlanta, Ga. 30303.

NETWORK NEWS
MCI TOUTS USE OF SIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT
PROTOCOL FOR FRAME RELAY NETWORK MONITORING

MCI Communications Corp. says it is the first carrier to introduce a
frame relay management system based on a Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP).  MCI's Frame Relay Customer
Network Management (CNM) system collects and displays service
performance and alarm monitoring information on demand.  "With
CNM, customers obtain a variety of network information including
alarms on network equipment, permanent virtual circuits, and access
lines, as well as statistics on frame and byte counts, input and
output errors, and comparable information from MCI-provided
customer premise equipment," MCI said.

The information is provided through a CNM server over MCI's
frame relay network to the customer workstation using standard
SNMP and MCI's Enterprise-Defined Management Information
Base, which defines the information data base available to the
customer, MCI noted.

"Because the information is provided in a standard-compliant
format, customers' existing workstations can be used to process this
information and can be configured to support other network
management elements of their wide-area networks as well as
monitor LAN activity.  This eliminates the need for separate LAN
management systems," it added.

CNM became available Oct. 1 on a limited basis and is planned for
general commercial availability in the first quarter of 1993.

While MCI has not made final decisions on pricing, it noted plans
"to charge standard installation fees based on the level of
installation support required and recurring charges ranging from
approximately $300 to $2000 per month, depending upon the
workstation and network management package selected."  MCI
plans to enhance CNM capabilities for use with its future virtual
private data services, and to incorporate it or similar capabilities
into other MCI data network management products--such as
Integrated Network Management Service--over time, depending on
market demand.

AT&T PLANS TO OFFER INTEGRATED ACCESS
FOR PUBLIC NETWORK ISDN/PRIVATE NETWORK
SERVICES

AT&T has announced a new feature that will allow customers to
access both public switched ISDN (integrated services digital
network) and private network services on a single high-speed T-1
(1.544 megabits per second) facility.  With the new Primary Rate
Interface Static Integrated Network Access (PRI SINA) feature,
"smaller locations that could not justify the cost of separate access
facilities can be more innovative in their use of applications such as
local area network interconnection and videoconferencing," said
Richard Campbell, AT&T's ISDN product manager.

The cost efficiencies of PRI SINA can be enhanced when used with
Call-By-Call service selection, "an additional AT&T ISDN feature
that allows customers to select the switched services to be used on
each access channel on a call-by-call basis," AT&T said.  It also
noted that "Together with intelligent switching multiplexers, such as
the Teleos NetworkHub, PRI SINA can provide even further
efficiencies and cost savings.  The Teleos NetworkHub can allocate
private line overflow onto switched service lines on demand."

A trial of PRI SINA and the Teleos NetworkHub currently is being
conducted by 3M, Teleos Communications, Inc., and AT&T.  Begun
in May, the trial provides switched and private network connections
between three 3M locations in the U.S.  The Teleos NetworkHubs
aggregate traffic onto a single T-1 facility at each location and
allocate individual channels at each location to meet the location's
voice, data, and video needs.  The trial's applications combine
videoconferencing, local area network interconnection, voice
communications, and access to a private X.25 data network.

AT&T emphasized that "Instead of buying more private line
capacity for peak traffic overflow, a company like 3M can save
money by using PRI SINA and the NetworkHub to move peak data
traffic onto public switched network services as needed.  3M also is
able to consolidate several AT&T services onto one highly
manageable high-performance digital access facility."  The trial will
evaluate "operational readiness and key reliability measures" prior to
AT&T making PRI SINA widely available in September.  To use
PRI SINA, customers need an M-24 service function in the AT&T
central office, AT&T noted.  There is a monthly $150 charge for the
function.

NEBRASKA TELCOs, UNIVERSITY, GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES COOPERATE ON FRAME RELAY NETWORK

The Nebraska Telephone Association (NTA) has begun phasing into
service a frame relay data network for the state.  Frame relay
centers already are in operation in Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island,
Norfolk, North Platte, Alliance, and O'Neill.  The Public Service
Commission helped coordinate the project, which required
cooperative efforts by the government, University of Nebraska, and
NTA's 40 local exchange carrier members.  NTA Chairman Norm
Osland said that "An up-to-date telecommunications network is
viewed as critical to the economic development of Nebraska.  We're
pleased that the state is working with the private sector to see that
Nebraska can continue to maintain its leadership position in the
area of telecommunications."

Expected to make early use of the system are the state's Library
Commission, the Department of Education, the University of
Nebraska Medical Center, and local libraries, schools, and hospitals.
Private-sector entities expected to use the service include financial
institutions and multi-location businesses.

TECHNOLOGY
TEST OF LOCAL EXCHANGE/INTEREXCHANGE NETWORK
INTEROPERABILITY FOR ISDN IS SUCCESSFUL

The first interstate call testing MCI Telecommunications Corp.'s
ISDN (integrated services digital network)-capable network and the
access capabilities of two phone companies was completed
successfully.  The test call was initiated from a New Jersey Bell
Telephone Co. switch in Holmdel, N.J., to New York Telephone
Co.'s West Street location in New York City over long distance lines
provided by MCI.

"The trial involved routing and signaling for both voice and data
calls using local switches made by two different manufacturers," Bell
Communications Research reported.  The call, which was part of a
four-phase testing program looking toward introduction of a
nationwide ISDN network this fall, marked the start of testing to
confirm the interoperability of local exchange and interexchange
networks for ISDN transmission and signaling.

Testing is scheduled to begin soon between the Holmdel switch and
BellSouth Telecommunications switches in Atlanta; AT&T's
interexchange network will be used.  The third phase of testing,
which will be ongoing until later this month, will involve calls
between switches in the 20 cities that will be part of the initial
national ISDN network.  In the final phase during October and
November, user-to-user applications will be tested.  Earlier, Bellcore
and manufacturers tested switches and various network components.

RAD NETWORK DEVICES GETS PATENT FOR
`SOURCE ROUTING TRANSPARENT' PROTOCOL

RAD Network Devices, Inc., has been granted a U.S. patent for the
technology that permits the "source routing transparent" (SRT)
algorithm.  SRT is an emerging bridge standard for both FDDI
(fiber distributed data interface) and Token-Ring LANs.  It
simultaneously supports user stations employing the "source routing"
and the "transparent routing" methods, allowing LANs in mixed
environments to communicate with each other regardless of their
bridging schemes.

RAD Network Devices, of Huntington Beach, Calif., explained that
"To network managers and their companies, this results in
tremendous cost savings by eliminating the need for multiple bridges
and separate lines to support the different LAN internetwork
traffic."  The SRT algorithm "allows both the transparent and
source-routing methods to exist within the media access control
(MAC) layer," it added.  "SRT handles both the existing MAC layer
bridging protocols by differentiating between these two methods on
a frame-by-frame basis, as the packet is routed."  The SRT concept
has been adopted by an Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers standards committee, which is in the process of approving
SRT as an addendum to the existing IEEE 802.1D local bridge
standard.

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR, ADAPTIVE CORP.
REACH ATM TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT

National Semiconductor has signed an ATM (asynchronous transfer
mode) technology development agreement with ADAPTIVE Corp,
a majority-owned subsidiary of Network Equipment Technologies,
Inc.  The pact makes National the first LAN semiconductor
company to endorse ATM technology, and the announcement marks
the first in a series of steps in National's strategy to focus on
multimedia computers and high-speed networks.  Under the
agreement, ADAPTIVE's ATM interface technology will be licensed
to form the basis of future chipsets from National.

Charles Carinalli, Chief Technical Officer and Executive VP of
National's Communications and Computing Group, said that "This
is just one of a number of revolutionary networking announcements
that you will see from National over the coming year that cover the
full spectrum of desktop platforms from PCs to workstations.  ATM
is the long-term strategic solution for seamless global networking.
We see it as a perfect complement to our multimedia enhancement
strategies for Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI" (fiber distributed
data interface).

The companies explained that "The appeal of ATM to the LAN
industry is based on the premise that today's data-only networks are
becoming congested and increasingly difficult to design, administer,
and manage.  ATM allows the construction of very high-
performance/capacity workgroups and backbones that will reduce
these problems and support emerging multimedia applications."

BELLCORE OFFERING TECHNICAL AUDITING
SERVICES DIRECTLY TO EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS

Bell Communications Research has started offering technical
auditing services directly to suppliers of network and end-user
equipment for SMDS (switched multimegabit data service) and
frame relay PVC (permanent virtual circuit) services.  In the past,
Bellcore generally conducted technical analyses of a supplier's
products only at the request of its Bell company owners.

Michael Koblentz, Bellcore's Director-data communications
technical analysis, said that "The successful widespread deployment
of both frame relay and SMDS services--and their ultimate
usefulness to customers--depends heavily on multi-vendor
interoperability and equipment conformance to service
requirements.  This analysis, provided directly to suppliers, can help
speed this deployment, facilitating the ongoing migration from
private data networks to public data networks."

For both frame relay and Bellcore tests and SMDS, Bellcore tests
a vendor's product for compliance
For both frame relay and SMDS, Bellcore tests a vendor's product
for compliance with industry standards or Bellcore's generic
requirements.  The analysis covers traffic and protocol conformance
testing across the interface between a customer's equipment and the
telecom network.  Testing is accomplished using Bellcore-developed
systems that simulate multiple end users.  Bellcore pointed out that
although its technical audit "provides an objective analysis of a
product, it does not imply Bellcore's approval, certification,

CrossComm Corp. of Marlborough, Mass., says that the new
software release for its ILAN Universal Router enables network
managers, for the first time, to provide "reliable transport" of IBM
SNA (Systems Network Architecture) network traffic over a
corporate internetwork of local and wide-area networks.  ILAN
Release 5.04 "solves the problem of reliably combining mainframe
(SNA/Synchronous Data Link Control) traffic with LAN traffic over
the same wide-area network," it reports.  ILAN 5.04 can examine
SNA and LAN traffic and set transmission priorities based on a
wide range of criteria.  CrossComm notes that while some other
router vendors have announced an intention to provide this
capability, it is the first to deliver the capability.

WORLD WIDE WEB SITE CREATION MADE EASY

ElectriCiti Inc., a San Diego based Internet service provider,
has developed PowerStation, a combination of software and
services that allows individuals and businesses to easily
establish their own presence on the World Wide Web.
Christopher Alan, president of ElectriCiti, emphasized
"Previously, Internet 'home pages' were only available to
those with programming skills. The last technical barrier has
fallen. Those who can use a computer can create their own Web
site using PowerStation's point and click interface and
publish it on the Internet for one full year for just $495."

Alan believes that the company's new PowerStation package
represents a pivotal innovation in the way businesses and
individuals will participate in the growth of the Internet.
"Ben Franklin was fond of saying 'Freedom of the press
belongs to those who own one!"' said Alan. He is convinced
that easy access to the power of publishing on the World Wide
Web means added freedom of expression for individuals and
businesses of all sizes.

The Internet's growth is exploding because people are
realizing that it gives them an opportunity to have a voice on
the new electronic frontier.  College students are putting
their resumes on the Web, businesses are putting product
brochures and catalogs on the Web, community activists are
promoting their activities on the Web. Most other
communication tools such as television, radio, and print media
are very expensive to use. On the World Wide Web you can reach
millions of people, for just a few hundred dollars."

Alan predicts that any organization that currently
distributes information on paper will find the Web a
compelling alternative to the US mail. His chief argument is
one of economics "When you take a look at the cost of
delivering information on paper and compare that to the cost
of delivering information on-line you begin to realize that a
shift in the delivery method is inevitable. The only question
remaining is whether you are going to be on the leading edge
or the trailing edge of the trend."

The PowerStation program allows users to automatically
generate home pages, electronic business cards, resumes,
brochures, portfolio pages and interactive order forms. The
program also includes Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts
which enables users to receive orders from customers or to
program graphic images to act like "point and click" maps.

PowerStation includes five megabytes of Web site space on
ElectriCiti's network of high-speed Sun Sparcstations. The
site can be linked to thousands of other Web sites available
on the global Internet accessible by tens of millions of
Internet users.

ElectriCiti's art director Brad Pennock explains that in
addition to automatically generating the HTML programming
code used to create Web sites, PowerStation guides users
through the process of making their sites more visually
appealing. "The software assists users by providing a palette
of coordinated colors and a large library of professional
quality graphics. A sophisticated interactive multimedia
experience can be created by combining text, full-color
graphics, entry forms, sound and video."

PowerStation was created by an unusual team of software
engineers-most still in high school and college. Senior
software engineer Timothy Kimball is a sixteen year old
student at Gompers High School. Programmer Greg Hamerly worked
full time on the project between graduating from Poway High
School and entering Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Donna Whitlock
works full time at ElectriCiti as a systems analyst while on a
work practicum from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.

Christopher Alan, president of ElectriCiti, believes that
high school and college students offer an untapped potential
for developing high-tech progrwns and has given students key
roles since the company's beginning three years ago.
ElectriCiti evolved from a community service organization
comprised of students and programmers who had teamed up to
promote technical literacy among grade school and high school
students.

Alan named his young group of software developers "The
Watchmakers" in honor of a group of students at MIT who helped
build Project Athena, MIT's landmark distributed computing
experiment which established the first campus-wide Internet.
The Watchmakers at ElectriCiti, like their namesakes at MIT,
work as peers, not underlings. The team continues to play an
integral part in developing the company's cutting-edge
technology.

Alan is most proud of the fact that the PowerStation team
achieved the goal he set out for them-to give people the
power to create their own personal or business Web site with
just a few simple clicks of the mouse.

Members of the PowerStation development team are quick to
point out that unlike other Web publishing editors, the
ElectriCiti package gives users the ability to make their Web
sites available on the Internet. Other Internet providers
furnish the space but require users to create pages by writing
HTML code. In contrast, ElectriCiti's new PowerStation
achieves both goals in one easy to use, low priced package.
PowerStation is available for the Microsoft Windows and Apple
Macintosh and Power Macintosh computer platforms.

PowerStation may be previewed on the Internet by accessing
ElectriCiti's Web site at http:Hwww.electriciti.com.

ElectriCiti provides Internet services throughout the United
States. The company's software and service packages are avail-
able directly from ElectriCiti and from computer retail
stores. ElectriCiti maintains offices in San Diego, Orange
County, Los Angeles, and Santa Clara.

SET OF INTERNET SERVICES INTRODUCED

Comprehensive Full-Level Service & Support For The Internet

Digital Equipment has announced its Internet Services Roadmap,
a comprehensive set of Internet services designed to provide
Internet users and service providers with every level of
service and support required to operate effectively and
securely on the Internet.

Included in this Internet Services Roadmap is a portfolio of
18 types of consulting, security, training and support
services from Digital, whose years of Internet-related
experience and total breadth of global service capabilities
are unmatched by any other single vendor.

These services include systems integration services to help
customers plan business applications and develop or integrate
solutions related to the Internet; network services to assist
customers to establish the network infrastructure required for
Internet access; and outsourcing services for those customers
who do not want to manage Internet-specific servers in-house.

Customers Speak

While Digital customers may be operating at all levels of
involvement on the Internet, they consistently express high
regard in their assessment of Digital's breadth of Internet
service and support capabilities.

"We needed to get our Web product to market very quickly.
Digital was the one-stop shop where we could get Internet
application development, systems integration, outsourcing,
systems management, and top-notch technology. Digital not only
supplied the expertise to do the job, they agreed to manage
all aspects of the Web site's operation." (John Zahner, Vice
President of Business Development, Individual, Inc.,
Burlington, Massachusetts).

"Information is USADATA's primary business. Digital's
technology leadership in utilizing the Internet for
information distribution, combined with their leading edge
Alpha hardware, provided us with the right partner to move our
information business into the 21st century. The knowledge,
experience, and eagerness that Digital engineers brought to
our project confirmed our confidence in their ability to
provide best-in-class Internet solutions." (Rick Murphy,
President, USADATA, Inc. New York, New York).

"Digital's support is very strong, especially in the
networking and workstation areas. They are a major player on
the Internet and a big support of the Internet community"
(Martin Dubetz, Director of Academic Computing and Networking,
Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri).

"I was intrigued with the Internet, but had no idea how to get
my business on-line. So I asked Digital to help me get
started. All of a sudden, I was getting orders from people
around the world, with daily orders from as far away as
Sydney, Australia. Orders can come in at any time of the day
or night, and I don't even have to be on-line." (Jean
Schroeder, Owner, Future Fantasy Bookstore, Palo Alto,
California).

Foremost among the portfolio of Internet services offered by
Digital is its full range of Internet Security & Firewall
Services, followed by its Internet Network Services, Internet
Collaboration Services, Web Server Management, and Web
Information Architecture Service.

All services in Digital's Internet Services Roadmap are
available immediately, and may be ordered singly or in any
combination required. Most are custom priced, several are
fixed price or one-time charges, and they range from one-day
seminars for top management to turnkey management of all
Internet resources. Details are available from any Digital
sales office.

"HTMLSCRIPT" MAKES WEB SERVER
APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT EASIER

(San Diego, CA) Volant Corporation, of San Diego, CA,
has introduced an easy-to-use language for Web Servers called
htmlscript.  Completely browser independent, htmlscript allows
users to develop powerful interactive web pages in a server
safe environment.

Said Joe Austin, CEO Of Volant, "htmlscript solves the
fundamental problem of allowing Web Publishers to produce
sophisticated back-end programs without having to leave the
HTML environment. It's easy to use, powerful, and intuitive.
Site Administrators who have been hesitant to let their users
fully exploit the power of the Web can now let their users
develop applications without compromising system integrity."

The product is installed as a standard CGI application and
provides multiple administrative controls. Users can freely
mix HTML and htmlscript tags in their files. Once executed, it
achieves it's browser independence by operating as a
preprocessor so that it only outputs HTML code. The
htmlscript tags provide the capability to do logic,

DERWENT REACTION SERVICE INTRODUCED

Searching Derwent's reaction chemistry online by chemical
structures now possible. Derwent North America introduces its
state-of-the-art chemical reaction database for organic
chemists - the Derwent Reaction Service.  This unique Service
fulfills the information needs of chemists by offering
worldwide chemical reaction information of the highest
quality, in a variety of user-friendly formats.

"The great strength of Derwent's reaction collection is that
it adds only truly novel reactions - about 3,000 reactions
each year out of the millions reported" said Mike Harvey,
Senior Vice President of Intellectual Property for Derwent.
"This means that chemists will now have the ability to search
a comprehensive database and retrieve information on new,
reactions, rather than a series of examples of well-known
reactions" added Harvey.

The Derwent Reaction Service brings together key references
on novel synthetic methods from worldwide scientific and
patent literature. Derwent chemists have compiled this
information using strict selection criteria. This guarantees
that the database contains new reactions, synthetically-useful
modifications of known methods, and details of over 60,000
novel methods from the past twenty years. Each record
features an English-language abstract as well as reactions,
conditions, and structural formulas.

The Derwent Reaction Service is available in-house as a
monthly journal, online, or on CD-ROM. The entire backfile of
reactions found in the DRS is also available on CD-ROM. The
online file - DJSMonline - will be available to all STN users
after its launch at Online Information 1995 in December.

All Derwent Reaction Service products take their name from the
monthly journal (Derwent Journal of Synthetic Methods) and are
an extension and adaptation of Theilheimer's Synthetic
Methods of Organic Chemistry.

Information professionals, research chemists, lecturers and
students can choose the information product, or combination of
products, that meet their specific needs. They may prefer the
journal or CD-ROM for current awareness browsing, the online
database for structure searches, or the backfile CD-ROM for
compact archiving and information browsing.

For more than 40 years Derwent North America, a leading
international scientific and technical provider within Thomson
Business Information, has been providing mission-critical
information to chemists, scientists, companies and research
institutions throughout the world.

Hearing Impaired Community, Wireless Industry Meet During
Summit to Find Solutions to Incompatibility, Interference
Problems

Wednesday kicked off a two day summit between members of the
wireless industry, the hearing impaired and hearing aid
manufacturers.  These diverse groups, at odds lately with each
other over issues of compatibility, met for two days at the
Hearing Aid Compatibility and Accessibility to Digital Wireless
Telecommunications Summit Meeting to discuss and explore avenues
for creating greater access to wireless telecommunications for
the hard of hearing population.
     Jay Kitchen, president of the Personal Communications
Industry Association (PCIA), opened the standing room only summit
by emphasizing that the wireless industry undertook the summit
not because it was mandated to do so, but because it was the
right thing to do.
     Kitchen encouraged attendees to set an example for
politicians and work quickly to build consensus and find
solutions to the problems of interference and incompatibility
between the wireless industry and the hearing impaired community.

     FCC Chairman Reed Hundt delivered the summit's opening
address.  He called the summit the "finest group of its kind that
has been assembled in the area of communications."  He added that
he was proud to see the communications industry come together
with representatives from the hearing impaired community to work
together in a spirit of cooperation.
     While new FCC Wireless Bureau Chief Michele Farquhar and
some of her staff were on hand for Hundt's opening remarks, they
could not stay and participate in the summit  because of the
government shutdown, Farquhar and her staff are authorized to
work on auctions only and could not stay to add their input and
represent the FCC in the meetings.
     Hundt called the summit the "right time and the right place
to pursue these issues," and he said the FCC will do what the
summit concludes it should do in order to make it possible and
practical for the hearing impaired to use wireless
telecommunications devices.  The FCC expects specific action
items to come out of the summit, he said, expressing his
confidence that the assembled group would find the right
solutions and that his agency would implement them so that all
Americans can be part of the Information Age. Time is of the
essence, Hundt said, as it is imperative that solutions to
incompatibility problems be found before the telecom industry
progresses any further.
     The companies that comprise the wireless industry face
incredible competitive pressures, Hundt told the audience, and it
is hard for those not directly involved with the industry to
sympathize with the pressure they are under.  He encouraged the
hearing impaired community to work with the wireless industry and
to be open to compromise so that a solution that is agreeable to
both sides can be worked out.
     The alternative, Hundt obliquely implied, would be having
the government step in and mandate solutions, which would likely
satisfy no one.  That point was reemphasized later in the day by
another speaker, Dr. Elizabeth Jacobson, deputy director of the
Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the Food and Drug
Administration.  Dr. Jacobson's office regulates medical devices,
such as hearing aids, and devices that emit radiation, such as
cellular telephones.  She said a non regulatory approach to
solving the problem of interference and incompatibility would be
faster and cheaper than getting the government involved and
encouraged both sides to work together to find their own
solution.

All Wireless Technologies Can Cause Interference, One Panelist
Said

     In the summit's first panel, George Schmitt, president of
Omnipoint Communications, said every wireless technology, whether
it is  CDMA, TDMA, DECT or GSM, can, in some circumstances, cause
problems with some hearing aids that are not well designed,
because all wireless technologies pulse, thus interfering with
hearing aids.  However, he said finding a solution to the problem
of interference is "absolutely do able," if mobile phone and
hearing aid manufacturers join forces with wireless operators and
help solve the problem.
     Schmitt responded to the charge that the wireless industry
has ignored the hard of hearing population, which some said
comprises 10 percent of the American population.  Because it is a
minority, Schmitt said that he does not believe any wireless
operator would be "dumb enough" to ignore the 10 percent of the
American population that is hard of hearing.
     Schmitt told the audience not to forget people with other
disabilities when discussing issues of accessibility to wireless
technology.  People with vision loss and physical handicaps have
as much of a right to use wireless technology as hard of hearing
people do, he said.  Schmitt added that the problem with
interference between wireless devices and hearing aids has been
exaggerated.  "The problem is not as severe as people make it out
to be," he said.

Representatives from the Hearing Impaired, Disabled Community
Discuss Incompatibility, Interference Issues At Summit

Two afternoon panels at Wednesday's Hearing Aid Compatibility and
Accessibility to Digital Wireless Telecommunications Summit
Meeting were made up of representatives from the hearing impaired
community who were on hand to educate the audience, especially
those from the wireless industry, about the problems they face
when trying to use wireless technology.
     On the first panel, "Understanding Hearing Loss,"  otologist
Dr. Stephen Epstein, presented information about the prevalence
and demographics of hearing loss in the United States.
     According to Dr. Epstein, 28 million Americans suffer from
some form of hearing loss and several million of them use a
hearing aid or some form of device that enables them to hear.
With the aging of the Baby Boomer generation, Epstein said his
figure of 28 million is likely to double in the coming 10 years.
Not only will the Boomers not go into old age peacefully, he said
they also won't go without their gadgets, further emphasizing the
need to make wireless devices hearing aid compatible.
     The following panel, "Access to Telecommunications,"
included a taped demonstration of what some hearing aid users
experience when they try to use wireless telephones.  Dr. Mead
Killion, president of Etymotic Research and an adjunct professor
of audiology at Northwestern University, conducted the
demonstration using a CDMA phone, a digital cellular phone and a
GSM based Sprint Spectrum phone.
     By placing a hearing aid that had a microphone implanted in
it in one of his ears, he was able to demonstrate to attendees
the kinds of interference that can occur with some wireless
phones.  In a few instances there was no interference, but in
several others the interference was loud enough to make it
impossible for Killion to hear the person he was calling.

Retro Fit Solutions Place a Poor Second to Designing Technology
to Be Compatible From the Beginning, Panelist Said

     Deborah Kaplan, vice president of the World Institute on
Disability, sat on the "Understanding Hearing Loss" panel.  She
is a member of the Clinton administration's Advisory Council on
the National Information Infrastructure and an advocate for
universal design, a theory and practice of designing everything
from buildings to telephones that emphasizes designing equipment
and services for the fullest range of human function  in other
words, creating things that can be used by the largest number of
people, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.  Curb
cuts, cuts made in sidewalk curbs, are an example of universal
design, as they allow people who are walking, confined to wheel
chairs, pushing strollers, pulling luggage and riding bicycles to
get onto and off a sidewalk without having to "jump" the curb.
     Kaplan lamented that the summit was focusing on retro fit
solutions to its problems instead of universal design.  Retro fit
solutions place a poor second to solutions that were designed and
implemented before a product ever leaves its testing phase, she
said.  Retro fit solutions do not tend to be affordable, elegant
or terribly useable, she said.  According to Kaplan, the problem
of incompatibility between wireless devices and hearing aids is
not just about technology, it is about the wireless industry's
failure to take its technology out of the laboratory and test it
on real human beings.
     When developing products for consumer consumption, companies
must ask themselves who will be using the product before, not
after, they have developed it, Kaplan said.  Failing to ask that
question may put companies in the position of having to ask
themselves questions about retro fitting:  How much will it cost
and who will pay for retro fit solutions?  Will it be comfortable
for users?  How difficult will it be to implement?
     Speaking to those members of the audience representing the
wireless industry, Kaplan advised them to put disabled people in
their focus groups and make them their beta testers, so as to
prevent problems like this in the future.   If wireless
telephones had been designed with hearing aid compatibility from
the beginning, the industry could have avoided many problems, she
said.

Informal Experiment Finds Some Hearing Aid Users Experience
Interference, Some Do Not

     Brenda Battat, deputy executive director for the educational
organization Self Help for Hard of Hearing People (SHHH),
discussed an  informal and unscientific test she had conducted
using a Sprint Spectrum phone.  She asked people that wore in
the ear hearing aids, behind the ear hearing aids, ear canal
devices and cochlear implants to use the phone and tell her what,
if any, interference they experienced.  She said all the behind
the ear device wearers who tested the phone experienced
interference.  Of the four in the ear device users she polled,
two experienced interference and two did not.  Those wearing in
the ear canal hearing devices also experienced interference, as
did the two she tested using cochlear implants.  Battat said she
also had her subjects try the phone using one of the external
phone devices, which are supposed to make wireless phones hearing
aid compatible.  While the device did work in that it enabled the
hearing aid users to hear the person on the other end of the
line, she said it did nothing to mitigate the interference they
experienced.
     Battat also refuted a claim made earlier in the day by Tom
Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association (CTIA) regarding the number of wireless phone
manufacturers that produce hearing aid compatible phones.
Wheeler stated that 25 wireless phone manufacturers are building
hearing aid compatible phones.  Battat said that only two
companies produce such phones, while the rest build in hearing
aid compatibility as a retro fit.m

United Airlines and GTE Airfone teamed to allow certain
passengers the ability to receive calls at their seat without
making any prior arrangements.  While it has been possible for
airline passengers to make calls from their seats for a couple of
years, this program allows United Airlines' Mileage Plus Premier
members to receive calls on United planes.  After being seated,
passengers remove the Airfone handset, slide their United Premier
card down the side of the handset and enter their seat number.
This activates the phone and lets GTE Airfone's system know where
the passenger is located.  When a call is placed to a passenger
on the plane, the handset will ring and the seat number of the
recipient will be displayed on the phone's screen.

AirTouch Communications acquired the assets of Message Center
Beepers, a privately held paging company with more than 345,000
subscribers, primarily in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey,
New York and Pennsylvania.  Financial terms of the deal were not
disclosed.

Geotek and Hughes Network Systems inked a deal calling for Hughes
to extend to Geotek a two year, approximately $25 million line of
credit for Geotek to acquire additional 900 MHz spectrum in the
United States.  The deal is a continuation of  a  strategic
partnership formed by th D AMPS/AMPS wireless system in the
Ukraine, in conjunction with the region's privately owned
operator, Digital Cellular Communication of Ukraine.  The service
will provide service in Donetsk, an industrial region with 5.5
million people.  Ericsson's system will combine fixed and mobile
wireless communication service with the capacity to cover between
6,000 and 7,000 subscribers.  Both the fixed and mobile services
will use the same base stations.  The order includes a mobile
switching center and several RBS 882 base stations.  The first
test call on the system is scheduled for March, and commercial
operation is set for launch in May.  Financial details of the
deal were not available.

Six companies from China and Singapore formed the Asia Pacific
Mobile Telecom Project to provide mobile phone services to any

four Chinese government organizations and two Singapore partners:
China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General, China
Aerospace Corp., China Unicom Satellite Telecom, China
Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp, Singapore Telecom
and Singapore Technologies Telemedia.  With its cost estimated at
between US$500 million and US$800 million, it is envisioned that
the project will allow mobile phone users to make calls from
anywhere in the Asia Pacific region.  The project will begin
operation in 1998, providing "seamless" phone usage from Pakistan
to Japan and covering almost half the world's population, a
spokesman said.

C-BLOCK AUCTION TOTAL PASSES $1.2 BILLION IN FOUR ROUNDS; BIDDING TO
RESUME JAN. 5

         Bidders in the C-block auction rocketed the net bid total to
$1.21 billion in the first four rounds before bidding closed Dec. 21
for the holidays.  The bidding competition at this early stage has
been fierce compared with the A/B-block PCS auction, which took 13
rounds and a move to more stringent bidding requirements to break the
$1 billion mark.  The C-block auction for the 493 licenses will resume
Jan. 5.
         As predicted by a number of industry insiders (PCS WEEK, Dec. 13,
pp. 1-3), the top markets have been the scene of the most furious
activity.  For example, Washington, D.C.-based DCR PCS Inc. placed a
first round high bid of $11.3 million for the Chicago basic trading
area (BTA), only to have the lead taken by GWI PCS Inc. in round two
for $15.8 million.  PCS 2000 L.P. then upped the ante to $61.4 million
in round three.  Round four saw DCR take another shot at the lucrative
Chicago license with a bid of $70.3 million, or $8.59 per potential
subscriber in the market.  Several other markets, such as Miami and
New York, have seen similar activity.
         High bids for round four included $203 million for New York by
PCS 2000; $112.5 million for Los Angeles by GWI; $53 million for
Philadelphia by NextWave Personal Communications Inc., headed by
former Qualcomm Inc. executive Allen Salmasi; $48.75 million for San
Francisco by GWI; and $46.5 million for the Boston license by PCS
2000.

  ...Bidders Still Adjusting to Complex Auction

         In spite of the auction's frenzied pace, both auction watchers
and participants say that it is too early to predict any outcomes. 
"It's always so hard to tell [in the beginning] because there are so
many changes," said Peter Nighswander, a PCS analyst at Malarkey-
Taylor Associates/Economic and Management Consultants International
Inc.  "Companies drop out [and] consolidate, so at the end of [the
auction, the environment] looks different than when it started."
Kevin Christiano, spokesman for NextWave and an analyst for
Washington-based Freedom Technologies Inc., said his company was not
reading too much into the results of the auction.  "Right now I think
there's a feeling-out process ... [because] the complexity is a lot
greater than the A/B-block auction," he said.  "To the extent that
companies are just trying to get acclimated to this new auction
environment and that there are many bidders that are not quite as
sophisticated, it's hard to read a lot from the first four rounds."
Christiano noted, however, that the activity in the top markets may
cause them to close much sooner than the rest of the licenses. 
Bidders that were shut out of those licenses but still determined not
to come away empty-handed may use their money on secondary markets,
thus precipitously raising the prices for those licenses.  Some of
these companies may inherit the "winner's curse," Christiano said. 

  ...What Is PCS 2000?

Certainly the biggest surprise of the first four rounds has been the
aggressive bidding strategy of PCS 2000, a Puerto Rico-based
partnership that has caught the attention of the PCS industry ever
since it deposited $50 million for the C-block auction.  As of round
four, PCS 2000 had placed net high bids totaling more than $442
million--$185 million more than its closest competitor, GWI.  PCS 2000
had an astonishing 124 high bids in that round, covering most of the
Eastern United States.  
PCS 2000 is a unique arrangement of 1,641 equity partners developed
and managed by Unicom Corp., the major general partner and 25 percent
owner.  "Unicom is a Puerto Rican corporation that was incorporated
for [the purpose of bidding in the auction] four years ago," said
Javier Lamoso, company president.
According to Lamoso, the company raised money by selling "limited
partnership units" to wealthy families and individuals, investment
companies, small partnerships, trust funds and pension plans.  "[The
investors] are from all over the continental United States."  PCS
2000's Form 175 application noted that none of these partners owns
more than 3 percent of the company.
Lamoso would not divulge PCS 2000's market plans because he did not
want to signal the partnership's true motives to other players.  He
explained that losers in the auction could claim in court that PCS
2000 implicitly colluded with other bidders by naming the markets it
wants, thus raising the value of those markets for other players.  "If
I tell you what our strategy is or what markets we are looking for,
I'm afraid of being accused of signaling because of the way the FCC
has interpreted the SEC's rules on this," Lamoso said.  "I want to
avoid any hint of implied collusion."

EQUIPMENT SUPPLY DEALS MOVE SLOWLY AS C-BLOCK AUCTION BEGINS

     Major PCS equipment contracts and agreements have all but halted
in the months preceding the C-block auction.  Only a few PCS
operators, such as Omnipoint Communications Inc., have forged pacts
with vendors. 
     The chart below comes with a few caveats:  Many of the deals
shown below are agreements or memoranda of understanding, not ironclad
contracts.  In addition, if we have missed any major PCS supply deals,

THE LONG, STRANGE TRIP OF THE C-BLOCK AUCTION

    The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 gave the FCC
authority to conduct auctions for PCS licenses and directed the
commission to ensure that "designated entities" (DEs)--small
businesses, women- and minority-owned enterprises, and rural telephone
companies--could participate in the bidding.  The FCC subsequently
allocated 120 MHz of spectrum in six licensing blocks for broadband
PCS.  The so-called entrepreneurs' block or, simply, the C-block--493
30-MHz basic trading area (BTA) licenses--was reserved for DEs.
During the past year, however, the courts--in taking a new tack on
affirmative action--threw a wrench into government's efforts to allow
small players to compete with "deep pockets" in the broadband PCS
auction arena.  What follows is the long, strange trip of the C-block
auction that we documented
this past year in PCS WEEK.  (The dates below refer to the issue dates
of this newsletter.)

  ...TEC v. FCC

    Jan. 5:  The FCC announced that the C-block auction would begin
April 17, or 30 days after the close of the A/B-block auction,
whichever was later. 
Short form applications were due Feb. 28.
    Feb. 22:  Telephone Electronics Corp., a rural telephone holding
company, asked the D.C. Circuit to bar the commission from setting a
short-form filing deadline for the C-block auction.  TEC challenged
the $125 million cap on annual revenues for C-block applicants as well
as the race- and gender-based preferences for DEs.  In short, TEC
wanted the FCC to apply the revenue cap to its operating companies
instead of itself so that it would be eligible 
to bid.  Arguably, TEC's affirmative action argument was an attempt to
leverage its case.
    March 22:  The D.C. Circuit granted TEC's stay request and set oral
argument for Sept. 28.
    April 26:  TEC dropped the case after forging a deal with PCS
PrimeCo L.P. to partition the New Orleans/Baton Rouge major trading
area (MTA).

  ...Adarand v. Pena

    June 14:  The Supreme Court, in a narrow 5-4 decision, threw a
wrench
 into federal affirmative action programs in Adarand v. Pena.  The
court ruled that race- and gender-based preferences had to be
"narrowly tailored" to
serve a "compelling government interest."  Adarand was remanded to the
Tenth Circuit.
    June 21:  The FCC postponed the C-block filing deadline but
insisted that the auction would begin on time--Aug. 2.
    June 28:  The FCC granted the A/B-block licenses and adopted a
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would eliminate race- and
gender-based preferences for C-block applicants.

  ...Omnipoint v. FCC

    July 26:  In its Sixth Report and Order, the FCC modified the C-
block 
rules to eliminate women and minority preferences, and to expand the
"49 percent equity exception" to all eligible applicants.  This
exception allowed investors, including large companies, to hold 49.9
percent ownership stakes in DEs.  Pioneer's preference winner
Omnipoint Corp., owner of the A-block license for the New York MTA,
objected.
    Aug. 2:  The D.C. Circuit granted Omnipoint's emergency stay
request.  Omnipoint had argued that the expansion of the 49 percent
equity exception 
to all C-block applicants did not allow enough time for "non-women/mi-
nority" 
entities to take advantage of it.  The constitutional argument was
that the FCC's decision violated the Fifth Amendment's equal
protection clause.  Omnipoint also argued that the FCC violated the
Administrative Procedure Act by not allowing appropriate time for
public comment.
    Aug. 16:  The FCC postponed the C-block auction indefinitely as the
D.C. Circuit set Sept. 28 as the date for oral argument on the
Omnipoint case.
    Sept. 20:  The House Commerce Committee passed a measure endorsing
the FCC's C-block rules and requiring the agency to begin the auction
by Dec. 4.
        Oct. 4:  Following oral argument, the D.C. Circuit lifted its
stay.  
In a 2-1 decision, the court essentially decided that Omnipoint, an A-
block license holder, would not be harmed by expansion of the 49
percent exception in the C-block rules.  Almost immediately, the FCC
set Dec. 11 as the starting date for the auction.

  ...Cincinnati Bell v. FCC

    Oct. 25:  Radiofone Inc. asked the Sixth Circuit to stay the
auction 
in a long-pending case regarding the FCC's cellular/PCS cross-
ownership rules.  Brought by Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. [CSN],
BellSouth Corp. [BLS] and Radiofone, the consolidated cases attacked
the commission's rules for cellular eligibility, attribution, and
structural separation.  The Sixth Circuit 
granted the stay until it ruled on the issues.  Under the FCC's 
eligibility rules, Radiofone was prohibited from bidding on PCS
licenses in three Louisiana BTAs because of its cellular holdings in
the same areas.
    Nov. 1:  At the request of the FCC, Supreme Court Justice John Paul
Stevens vacated the stay imposed by the Sixth Circuit.  And the full
Supreme Court rejected Radiofone's emergency petition to overturn
Stevens.  Thus, the FCC was able to proceed with the Dec. 11 starting
date for the auction.  The FCC had argued that Radiofone could bid on
the Louisiana BTAs so long as it later complied with any rules that
the commission adopted.
    Nov. 15:  The Sixth Circuit remanded the Cincinnati Bell case, with
instructions for the FCC to conduct further proceedings.  The
commission decided to proceed with the Dec. 11 auction date.
    Nov. 22:  The shutdown of the federal government over the budget
crisis prompted the FCC to reschedule the auction starting date for
Dec. 18.  Meanwhile, Radiofone asked the Sixth Circuit to clarify that
its remand order meant that the FCC had to postpone the auction until
the agency completed a rulemaking on the PCS/cellular cross-ownership
issues.  Radiofone argued that if it bid on the Louisiana BTAs, there
was no guarantee that it would not be subject to future penalties or
forfeitures. 
    Dec. 6:  The Sixth Circuit issued a mandate, stating simply that it
had remanded the case to the FCC for further proceedings.  The court
did not address Radiofone's request or even mention the auction.  The
FCC determined that it could proceed with the Dec. 18 starting date.
    Dec. 13:  The FCC inadvertently sent proprietary financial
information from three companies, including Radiofone, to some C-block
applicants.  Separately, Radiofone again asked the FCC to stay the
auction and open an expedited rulemaking on the PCS/cellular cross-
ownership rules.  In addition, Radiofone filed a supplemental
memorandum with the Sixth Circuit, arguing that the court had the
power to enforce its mandate via contempt, mandamus or other
appropriate orders or writs.
    Dec. 20:  The C-block auction began despite the second shutdown of
the federal government.

INDUSTRY CANADA GRANTS FOUR PCS LICENSES, HOLDS BACK TWO

     Four Canadian PCS hopefuls received their Christmas presents a
week early when Industry Canada granted them licenses on Dec. 18 (PCS
WEEK, Dec. 20, 1995, p. 1).  The Canadian regulatory agency handed two
30 MHz licenses to specialized mobile radio (SMR) operator Clearnet
Communications Inc. and MicroCell 1-2-1 Inc.  The two 10 MHz licenses
went to cellular operator Rogers Cantel Mobile Inc. and Mobility
Canada--a nationwide alliance of local exchange carriers' cellular
subsidiaries.
    The four winners beat 15 other candidates for the licenses
ostensibly because they came closest to meeting Industry Canada's
policy objectives for PCS, which included the stimulation of
additional choices in mobile services similar to cellular and the
support of new technologies; the provision of new and innovative
services at 2 GHz, rather than mere provision of upbanded cellular
services; nationwide and worldwide roaming for Canadian citizens; non-
discriminatory access to the networks in order to allow third parties
to resell services; and the promotion of jobs and investment in
Canada.

  ...MicroCell Was Heavy Favorite, Insiders Say

    Although many in the Canadian PCS industry assumed that the 10 MHz
licenses would go to Cantel and Mobility Canada, the 30 MHz licenses
were harder to call.  According to a number of sources that spoke to
us before Industry Canada's announcement, MicroCell was the heavy
favorite for one of the licenses.
    In a news release following the licensing announcement, MicroCell
said that the government endorsed its open-network concept, under
which it will allow any company interested in reselling PCS to access
its system.  "We will allow access to our network to all companies and
entrepreneurs who want to market PCS," said Andre Tremblay, MicroCell
president and CEO.
    In addition, MicroCell promised to create a $90 million (Canadian)
research and development fund "aimed at backing the projects of
entrepreneurs who could not otherwise participate in PCS development. 
"We are prepared to finance innovative projects," explained Tremblay. 
"Those who have good ideas for new PCS applications are invited to
knock at our door."
    MicroCell has chosen the global system for mobile communications-
base PCS-1900 technology for its network and has supply agreements
with L.M. Ericsson AB and Northern Telecom Ltd..

  ...Clearnet Sees PCS Complementing ESMR

    The other 30 MHz winner, Clearnet, believes that it edged out the
other candidates based on its preparation for PCS buildout as well as
its experience with SMR.
    Over the past year, the company has raised more than $250 million
in capital for the construction of both its PCS and enhanced SMR
(ESMR) networks. 
    "We have had an objective to be the third major wireless service
provider [in Canada] since the company announced [Motorola's equity
stake in Clearnet] in February 1994," said George Cope, Clearnet
president and CEO, during a press conference conducted the day after
Industry Canada granted the licenses.  "I think we've now gone a long
way to enhance our position there."
    Clearnet also views PCS as the consumer complement to its ESMR
business services.  The company is in the process of completing the
first phase of its ESMR system buildout that will cover a region from
Quebec City to Windsor. Clearnet expects to begin commercial service
in mid-1996.
    "We have our business communications network--our ESMR network--
which is focused ... particularly on enhanced services all in one
handset," said Cope.  
"We view PCS as complementing [ESMR] as a product that will be able to
focus on the mass consumer market."
    Clearnet also intends to save a great deal on its PCS construction
costs by combining PCS with its ESMR system wherever possible.  These
savings will be passed on to the consumer, Cope said.  "We believe
that we also will be the lowest-cost PCS provider of the [two 30 MHz
licensees]," he added.
    The Pickering, Ontario-based company built out all of its ESMR
sites with the capability to carry PCS equipment as well, Cope
explained.  "A significant part of the total cost in designing a
wireless system are the soft costs of the sites--we won't have to
incur those costs a second time," he said.
    In addition, Cope said that Clearnet intends to share some of the
leased lines with both services.  Billing services for PCS will come
from the same company that Clearnet is using for ESMR, he said. 

  ...What About the Other Two Licenses?

    In its news release on PCS licensing, Industry Canada did not
comment on the fate of the remaining 30 MHz and 10 MHz licenses,
leaving many of those companies that did not receive licenses
wondering if there still was a chance to get into the market in the
next few years.  Industry Canada retained the right to hold back
licenses if it believed that there were not enough qualified
candidates, or if the agency determined that the Canadian market could
not sustain six PCS players.
    According to Kirk Hamilton, vice president of corporate and
government affairs for paging operator and PCS applicant TeleZone
Corp., Industry Canada has not given his company any indication of
what will happen to the licenses.  "They basically issued the licenses
and went off on holiday," he said.  "We hope to get some answers in
the new year."
    As for the future, Hamilton said that TeleZone will be looking for
other wireless opportunities as they come up.  But in the near term,
"our primary objective is to get access to the license that's still
unawarded at this time."

T1 DEVELOPS GUIDELINES TO ADDRESS PCS SECURITY

    The Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions' Committee
T1-Telecommunications recently completed guidelines to address user
privacy and other security issues involving PCS.  Among other things,
the guidelines call for five common security requirements, including
user authentication, the ability to conceal a user's location to
prevent eavesdropping, bearer and signalling channel privacy for all
wireless terminals, user data stored in "smart cards," and the
exchange of security information among different PCS networks.  (Bob

INTERCEL PREPARES TO LAUNCH STOCK, NOTE OFFERINGS TO FINANCE PCS
BUILDOUT

     West Point, Ga.-based InterCel Inc. anticipates spending $110
million this year to build out Powertel PCS Partners L.P.'s PCS
markets, followed by an additional commitment of $150 million in 1997.
    In its latest annual report, the company disclosed that it plans to
make concurrent public offerings of stock and notes during the first
quarter of 1996.
    Approximate amounts raised from these offerings will be $115.5
million and $150 million, respectively.  Cash interest on the notes
will not be payable before 2001.  InterCel also is negotiating a $20
million revolving credit facility.

  ...Offerings Coincide With InterCel's Buyout of Powertel

    The offerings are being undertaken in conjunction with the cellular
operator's plans to acquire Powertel, a privately held consortium in
which InterCel already is a major participant (PCS WEEK, June 28,
1995, p. 7).
    The three licenses that Powertel won in the A/B-block auction cover
parts of nine Southeastern states with 9 million potential subscribers
or "pops."  After the initial phase of its buildout, Powertel will
serve 55 percent of the pops in its major trading areas, InterCel
said.
    InterCel chose global system for mobile communications-based PCS-
1900 as its technology standard last August (PCS WEEK, Aug. 30, 1995,
p. 7), but has yet to announce equipment contracts.

  ...Equipment Vendor Negotiations Continue 

    At our deadline, the company was continuing negotiations with
equipment supplier candidates regarding vendor financing.  "The
company currently believes that vendor financing may provide a
significant amount of the capital required for its PCS system,"
InterCel's annual report said.
    While noting that its cellular operations have achieved "positive
operating income," InterCel warned that management "expects to incur
significant operating losses beginning in 1996 as it develops and
constructs the PCS network and builds the PCS customer base."

'NET LOOMS OVER $10B FRAME RELAY MARKET

The Internet is making a move to de-throne frame relay and
private networks as the premiere venues for data communications.
But fear not.  All is not lost yet for frame relay.  Unresolved
security and efficiency issues are keeping the Internet protocol
(IP) networks from competing directly with private networks.  So
by responding rapidly to customer dynamics and keeping an eye on
quality, there still is time for the long-distance carriers to
score some cash in this $10 billion market.

"The Internet would be more of a complement or an augmentation
to frame relay," Carolyn Tommie, a product manager with AT&T's
Interspan frame relay service, told The Report On AT&T.

Industry players see no signs of the frame relay business
slowing down.  The industry saw triple-digit growth last year
and is expected to grow 100 percent next year.

"There has been an absolute explosion in this business as
businesses reorganize and applications are pushed out from the
desktop to the local area network [LAN]," Bart Westberg,
director of advanced data services at Sprint, told RATT.

One of the things that makes frame relay so attractive to data
customers, and thus such a hot business, is the cost/performance
ratio.  Since with frame relay, data travels in short bursts
over the network as opposed to in a steady stream, the customer
pays only for the time he uses the network.  Westberg told RATT
that especially for "many-to-many connectivity," the price
performance of the service is a big selling point.

But a wolf is at the door.  A study by Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., reports the Internet's cost advantage could be
just the arrow that pierces AT&T's heel in frame relay.  The
study says the Internet's cost advantage and flexibility will
leave private networks without any advantage by 2000.

However, Sprint's Westberg is confident that cost isn't the only
issue customers consider.  Although frame relay is cost-
effective, customers value quality of service above price when
choosing a carrier, he said.

"You've got to focus on the performance of the service,
technical service and network reliability.  You are dealing with
informed buyers, technical buyers," Westberg told RATT.

AT&T's Tommie agrees and adds that disaster recovery is an
advantage that frame relay has over the Internet.

"As customers switch mission-critical data, the carrier must be
able to back the service up in a number of ways.  You have to
give the customers more than one precautionary option," she told
RATT.  These options don't currently exist on the Internet, she
added.

Furthermore, Tom Pincince, an analyst with Forrester Research,
said Internet security is simply a red herring, and that public
networks can be just as secure as private networks.

William Callahan, a senior manager of broadband data marketing
at MCI, told RATT Internet security issues are on the verge of
being resolved.  He predicted that with the continuation of
firewall activity, the Internet will be as secure as frame relay
networks by the end of next year.

"But right now, [security] is why many businesses don't feel
comfortable with the Internet.  Thye are more comfortable with
frame relay," Callahan said.

Secure, yes, but perhaps not yet as efficient.  And that
efficiency problem could keep the IP networks at bay while the
long-distance carriers plot their next move, Pincince told RATT.

"Business users must be assured that mail sent is mail received
and that the multibillion dollar funds transfer does not get
pushed aside by the teenager downloading sports scores from
ESPN's Web site," he said.

That next move for interexchange carriers, Pincince advised,
should be to offer frame relay and Internet access in unison,
and perhaps eventually to wean customers off of frame relay.  At
least for the next few years, businesses should use both private
and public networks for data communications.

That challenge opens the door for a cohesive strategy of frame
relay and IP offerings.  Companies can send the bulk of their
data over the IP network and use the private, frame relay
network for sensitive information.

"Afterall, people use both the Postal Service and Federal
Express," Pincince told RATT.

AT&T now offers an Internet-connectivity option with Interspan
service.  It also provides its customers access to AT&T
WorldNet, which is a more comprehensive Internet offering than
that offered with Interspan.  Tommie said including Internet
access in conjunction with frame relay is vital because it
creates synergy between the two protocols.

"The Internet also has bursty use.  Someone may use the Internet
to pull down a large file.  Then another person in the company
may use it later for e-mail, but there never is a steady stream
of Internet use for the same function," Tommie said.

Sprint also is tying Internet backbone into its frame relay
offering.

"The underlying technology of the Internet is PCIC.  You have to
have a network to access the Internet.  ATM could be that
backbone [and we would try to provide it.]  It all depends on
how you position your service to meet your customers' demands.
It is not really a direct cannibalization of your business,"
Westberg told RATT.

Perhaps the company best suited for the evolution of frame
relay, and to challenge AT&T in data, is MCI, according to
Forrester's Pincince.  He said MCI has agility and a good
network backbone, and is not bogged down by a huge customer
base.  As a result, MCI will be able to get all of its customer
up to speed on new services faster than big fat AT&T, Pincince
said.

MCI's Callahan said that company has packaged Internet gateway
services together with frame relay since April.

"That gives our customers the ability to go back and forth
between the two. The two can peacefully co-exist," Callahan told
RATT.

Still, even as the Internet threatens frame relay today,
tomorrow could be a very different story and the two could still
play very well together.

"What will be the Internet of five years from now?  Five years
from now, corporations may rely on the Internet more for e-mail
than anything else," Mike Grubb, group manager of data services
at Sprint told RATT.  "And new applications and customer
requirements will drive frame relay service.  One type of
service is more suitable to the Internet and others to frame
relay."

Another way the carriers can slow the industry's progression is
to expand their customer base.  The market for frame relay
services doesn't have to end with Fortune 500 companies.
Although Sprint's main marketing thrust is aimed at mid- to
upper-tier companies, smaller companies also can be an
attractive customer.

"Anytime you've got multiple sites that you need to connect,
frame relay is a viable alternative.  Smaller companies are
getting into connectivity and pulling [Sprint's] focus down
somewhat," Westberg told RATT.

AT&T's Tommie said that company's customer breadth also is
across the board. Interspan has customers with as few as two
ports and as many as 1,000.

"Don't assume that [frame relay] should be targeted at large
companies only," Tommie said.

But carriers have to keep their eye on the ball to keep this
customer base happy than the average voice customer, Sprint's
Grubb told RATT.

"Voice technology is understood [by the customer] and not
evolving that much.  But data technology is a fast moving target
with ATM and ISDN and other technologies coming along.  The
demand for the technology is growing at least as fast as the
technology," Grubb said.

POOR BUYOUT RESPONSE WON'T HURT AT&T'S STRATEGY, ANALYSTS SAY

At first glance, the response to AT&T's management-buyout offer
seems weak - only 2,600 of the estimated 78,000 managers have
accepted to date.  But shed no tears for AT&T.  Analysts say the
company still will look good when it becomes a pure service
organization and begins to plot its invasion of the Bell
companies' local territory.

"Things are going as planned.  There are no surprises here.
AT&T likes to do things in a way that doesn't disrupt the system
that much," Brian Adamik, an analyst with the Yankee Group in
Boston, told The Report On AT&T.

Adamik said AT&T still will need to downsize in order to
transform itself into a purely service organization, but he is
unsure how deep the cutbacks will go.

He suggested that perhaps instead of layoffs AT&T will undergo a
redeployment of management from its headquarters out "into the
field," especially in light of its recent announcement to
aggressively pursue local markets.

"[AT&T will have to] de-centralize the business and put the
decisions out in the field.  Especially in product development,"
Adamik said.

An AT&T spokesman told RATT the company originally projected
about 4 percent of employees would take the offering.  The
number of people who had accepted by press time was just about
on target for AT&T, the spokesman said.

"It's not as attractive an offer as some would have liked,"
Yankee Group analyst Rob Rich told RATT.  Rich said he expects
the number to increase slightly before the end of the month.

The buyout will not eliminate the need for layoffs, however.
AT&T spokesman Burke Stinson told RATT it was meant only to ease
the company into telling some managers, beginning this month,
that they no longer have an assignment.

Rich said AT&T wasn't wiping as many costs off the books as it
would like, and that factor will cost the company some money.
But by the time the new company starts, the balance sheets
should look good so AT&T should be able to get low-interest
financing as a result, he said.

The deadline for accepting the buyout package was Friday; AT&T
should have the final numbers Tuesday.

COMMISSION GIVES GO AHEAD TO $4 BILLION INVESTMENT IN SPRINT

After much ado, Sprint finally got the nod from the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) for its 20 percent sale to
France Telecom (FT) and Deutsche Telekom (DT).   Analysts say
this green light finally will put Sprint on equal footing with
AT&T and MCI on an international playing field - a field where
it currently lacks a presence.

"Sprint has been the weak sister among the big three [as far as
the international markets].  It had less facilities and
operations than AT&T and MCI," David Yedwab, an analyst with
Parsippany, N.J.-based consultancy Eastern Management told The
Report On AT&T last week.

Yedwab said MCI's partnership with British Telecom gave it a
strong international presence and AT&T's various partnerships
around the globe position it well on an international basis
also.  Sprint had been lacking such a strategic position, he
said, but not any more.

"This will put Sprint directly in the contest," Yedwab added.

The next step for Sprint and MCI is to see which can establish a
Pacific Rim presence to rival AT&T's, Yedwab said.

But let's not forget about the $4 billion plus change Sprint
stands to receive as part of this deal.  Yedwab said that cash
will go a long way toward Sprint's PCS investment - perhaps
giving the company a big boost over AT&T in the personal
communications field.  It also will help Sprint's investment in
a broadband network, an area in which Yedwab said Sprint is
falling behind AT&T and MCI.

Although the French and German telecom markets failed the FCC's
new test of market openness, the commission approved the $4.2
billion investment.

The FCC said that, in this case, it would give greater weight to
other factors, particularly how the cash infusion would enhance
the number-three long distance company's competitive position in
the United States.  Sprint has made major investments in the
States in personal communications service (PCS), a service seen
as a strong competitor to cellular.

The other factor is that French and German leaders have
committed to the FCC in writing that they will open their
telecom markets to competition in 1998.  If they fail to do so,
the FCC stands ready to revoke its approval of the deal, several
commissioners warned.

But the FCC also imposed several caveats, including banning
Sprint from increasing its capacity on its routes between the
United States and France and Germany.  That restriction is one
of several that exceed those imposed by a consent decree Sprint
has signed with the Department of Justice (DoJ).  It will go
away when switched voice resale and an alternative telecom
infrastructure are available in France and Germany.

A Sprint spokesman told The Report On AT&T it would have to
review the language in the FCC order with its partners before
commenting on the conditions.  Unfortunately, the recent
government shutdown has stalled the release of the language, and
the spokesman didn't expect to see anything from the FCC until
after the New Year.

The deal still must be cleared by the European Community as
well.

LONG-DISTANCE

This special report - the first in a new Report On AT&T series
of insider looks at key MCI operations - gives you the valuable
strategic information on the telecom company's plans in such
areas as network services, long-distance, electronic commerce
and wireless strategies.  In future issues of RATT, you'll get
these in-depth reports on other MCI operations as well as
reports on the goings-on at AT&T and Sprint.  If you've got an
area of particular interest, please give Executive Editor Kim

NetworkMCI Services: 1994-1995

MCI's strategic centerpiece, its ubiquitous networkMCI, seeks to
define the continuing evolution of MCI from a long-distance
company into a broad-based purveyor of services targeted to a
market where telecom, computing, entertainment and information
services are converging into an estimated $1 trillion business
opportunity.  Beyond that, networkMCI is more than a strategic
vision; it also is a developmental plan that features the
introduction of services in incremental steps to gain a leading
position as an overall provider of communications and
information services.

* MCI on the Internet *

The Internet is central to MCI's plan.  In 1995 there were an
estimated 25 million active Internet e-mail users, between 7
million and 10 million users with full Internet access and 4
million people who use the World Wide Web, an Internet
navigational tool.  The Wall Street Journal estimated that
commerce on the Internet, actually a supernetwork comprising
40,000 independent but connected networks, could reach the $100
million level as early as late 1995.

MCI has long been involved with the development of the Internet,
the network aspects of which are addressed in Chapter Six of
this report.  In terms of providing access to and service via
the Internet, MCI has introduced two service offerings since
mid-1994 which enhance Internet connectivity, as well as PC-
based applications:  the internetMCI software package and
marketplaceMCI.  In turn, both of these are wrapped within
networkMCI Business, a composite information and communications
package.  In addition, in 1994 MCI introduced internetMCI Access
Service which targets the larger education, government, and
business communities with a range of Internet access services,
as well as expanded e-mail service which allows Internet users
to utilize MCI Mail.

* networkMCI Business *

networkMCI Business is a Windows-based communications and
information software package targeted to the small and medium-
sized business community.  Originally introduced in October
1994, the latest version 3.0 was debuted at the COMDEX trade
show in Atlanta in April 1995.  In conjunction with the 1994
launch of the product, MCI reported incremental expenses of $70
million that contributed to an increase in operating expenses in
1994.  Although the software package is touted as an integrated
information and communications package, it is in reality a group
of separate applications linked only by Windows.

Introduced commercially in late September 1995, the package
features infoMCI, conferenceMCI, marketplaceMCI, faxMCI, e-
mailMCI, networkMCI paging and internetMCI.  The package is the
result of collaboration with numerous firms:  internetMCI was
developed in cooperation with Netscape Communications, FTP
Software and RSA Data Security; e-mailMCI is a licensed
application from ConnectSoft; networkMCI Paging is provided via
a reselling agreement with SkyTel; and faxMCI is a licensed
version of Delrina's WinFax PRO.  Other collaborators include
PictureTel Corp., Databeam Corp, FYI Online and Image Technology
Inc.

MCI indicated that the latest version of the package would be
provided free of charge to existing customers and run at the
price of $100 for new customers.  Further, the company indicated
the new offering would be accompanied by a drop in the monthly
subscription rate of $65 ($50 for Vnet, Vision or Preferred
customers) to $45 ($35 for Vnet, Vision and Preferred
customers).  Some of the standard components of the networkMCI
Business software package are also offered independently.

internetMCI - a "load and go" Internet access and navigation
software package which is also offered independently for $39.95
plus monthly access charges.  The offering provides local and
toll-free dial-up and graphical user interface (GUI) point-and-
click navigation.

marketplaceMCI - a multimedia on-line catalog and business
purchasing service providing businesses a new way to distribute
product information and facilitate on-line sales.  Brought
online in March 1995, marketplaceMCI opened with 14
"storefronts" to comprise an electronic mall:  Dun & Bradstreet
Information Services, Hammacher Schlemmer & Co., Office Max
Inc.; Intercontinental Florists, Danmark International, PC Zone
and Mac Zone, Reiter's Scientific & Professional Books, QUALCOMM
Inc., Reveal Computer Products, Covey, Proxima Inc., Doneckers,
FTP Software Inc. and National Wildlife Galleries Inc.  MCI
indicated that several more companies will open shops in the
electronic mall including: Aetna Life and Casualty, Amtrak,
Borders Inc., Dell Computers, Healthrider, Sara Lee, Tiger
Direct and Timberland.  The site is made possible by RSA Data
Security Inc.'s public-key cryptography which encrypts all
transactions involving sensitive information such as credit-card
numbers.  MCI has also taken measures to ensure the security of
the merchant web-site contents.

infoMCI - delivers to the customer news stories twice a day, as
well as instant news flashes on breaking stories.  The
information delivered is based upon a customer-defined profile.
The customer can select one industry category from a list of 25,
and specify key terms within an industry or company.  The
announced offering will also include business retrospective
search capabilities, weekly industry summaries, and special
business news reports.

conferenceMCI  - employing the yet-to-be-adopted T.120 document
and conferencing "standard", this tool allows people in
disparate locations to share documents including spreadsheets
and art for collaborative efforts.  conferenceMCI allows for the
connection of up to 24 locations, as well as simultaneous voice
and document conferencing.  Optional video conferencing is
available, but requires either the purchase or lease of needed
desktop video equipment.

e-mailMCI - provides users access to e-mail and gateways to
numerous other e-mail services.

faxMCI - provides the ability to send and receive faxes via the
PC from any Windows application.

* internetMCI Access Service *

internetMCI Access Service was introduced in mid-1994 and geared
to the education, government and business communities.  MCI
offers a variety of access services, including dedicated access
at 9.6 Kbps, 14.4 Kbps or 28.8 Kbps and switched access at the
same speeds; direct connect, a private line-like connection at
speeds from 9.6 Kbps to 45 Mbps; and frame relay.  In addition,
MCI announced that by the end of 1995 it planned to make
available high-speed access via Hyperstream ATM and Hyperstream
SMDS.

AT&T AND BIRLA GROUP WIN TWO CELLULAR LICENSES IN INDIA

AT&T and its partner in India, the Aditya V. Birla Group,
recently got the go-ahead to build infrastructure and to provide
cellular service in two regions in that country.

The regions AT&T won are Gujarat and Mahahashtra.  The licenses
are considered two of the more lucrative in India, with 43
million potential subscribers and 74 million potential
subscribers, respectively.

The companies, operating under the name Birla Communications
Ltd, bid on the licenses last June and received confirmation of
the award in early November.  Last month the partners signed a
final licensing agreement and plunked down a $90 million, first
year, licensing payment to the government.

AT&T filed an application with New Jersey regulators recently,
asking for the green light to offer local service to consumers
and businesses in that state.  The New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities last month began discussing opening the market for
local service.  AT&T, in the filing, outlined the general terms

service in the Garden State, including reselling services from
the incumbent RBOC, Bell Atlantic.

The petition also called for number portability and intraLATA
presubscription in local competition.  The New Jersey request
comes at the same time as similar petitions in Maryland and

NEW YEAR WILL FEATURE SATELLITE BROADCASTING, MOBILE SERVICES 

     Direct-to-home (DTH) satellite broadcast services will be one of
the top stories during the next 12 months--for the third straight
year--along with progress in developing global, mobile satellite
communication systems and new, more reliable launch vehicles, an array
of industry leaders told SATELLITE NEWS last week in our annual Look-
ahead Survey.
     Satellite broadcasting equipment has become the fastest-selling
product in consumer electronics history and shows no signs of slowing
as deep-pocketed companies attempt to launch such services throughout
the world in '96, sources said.  And, the rush for others to provide
global, mobile services by 2000 will intensify as those systems
prepare to launch their first satellites on rockets that suffered some
failures in '95.
     Chuck Hewitt, president of the Satellite Broadcasting and
Communications Association (SBCA), said, "We think 1996 will see
continued expansion of the
direct-to-home industry with the introduction of several new players. 
That expansion includes the successful launch of the EchoStar
Communications Corp. system [see related story on p. 1] and the soon-
to-be introduced AlphaStar DTH system.  These new systems will
continue to expand the level of choice available to the consumer. 
And, we'll see the introduction of additional, niche market
programming services which will be unique to the satellite
marketplace.  Many of those programs will not be available on cable."
     A similar bullish view about DTH was offered by Bruce Crockett,
president and CEO of Comsat Corp..
     "Comsat's recent $100 million contract with News Corp. to provide
direct-to-home broadcasting in Latin America demonstrates that DTH
continues to expand in every region of the world," Crockett said. 
"News Corp. is repeating the success it has enjoyed in Europe and
Asia.  At the same time, DirecTv created the market in the U.S. and
now is being joined by other operators like PrimeStar and Echostar.
     "All of these pioneers have set the stage for a booming
international business in the second half of the '90s.  Eastern
Europe, India, the Middle East, and Africa are hot markets to watch,"
Crockett said.
     DirecTv, a unit of GM Hughes Electronics Corp., reached 1 million
subscribers for its direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service in the
United States this year, said Donald Cromer, president of Hughes Space
and Communications Co.  For '96, the big story will be progress in
developing satellite systems, such as Hughes' Spaceway project, to
offer interactive bandwidth applications, he said.

  ...Money, Money, Money Will Decide Winners in '96

     "For 1996, the story is going to be money, money, money--DBS
auctions, fundraising for the Big LEOs and other satellite ventures,
and whether Constellation Communications, American Mobile Satellite
Corp. and Ellipsat make their financial showing to obtain Big LEO
licenses by the end of January 1996," said Tim Logue, a space and
telecommunications analyst with the law firm Reid & Priest, of
Washington, D.C.
     Logue continued, "I believe the financial markets are
increasingly sophisticated about satellite communications.  That
means, however, that they are much less likely to be bowled over by
'gee whiz' types of presentations.  They understand the business and
understand full well the high risks involved.
     "Therefore, satellite companies have to do a better job of
presenting their business cases and offerings to the financial
community.  Anything that would reduce risk would be helpful, as well,
like improving launch vehicle reliability," Logue added.
     Hewitt said, "We believe that Wall Street's understanding of the
role that satellite communication plays in the Information
Superhighway has increased substantially in the past 12-18 months.  In
particular, SBCA has developed Wall 
Street's understanding of the direct-to-home marketplace through our
association's SkyForum conference that is held twice a year in New
York."
     The financial community is starting to recognize the growth
potential of satellite systems, Cromer said.
     ICO Global Communications Inc., a for-profit, spin-off of the
world's mobile satellite consortium Inmarsat, raised $1.4 billion from
its Signatories.  and was forced to turn away hundreds of millions of
dollars from some 40 investors interested in backing the
organization's planned 12-satellite, $2.6 billion system to provide
global, mobile communications (SN, Jan. 23, 1995, pp. 1-3).  Hughes
became an ICO investor late last year.
     "The $5.7 billion backlog in satellite orders for Hughes--double
last year's backlog--is some indication that new ventures are finding
the capital needed for satellite communications systems," Cromer said.

  ...Financing Generally Is Tight, Tight, Tight

     "Some, however, such as Iridium [Inc.] and Globalstar pulled
their [debt] offerings soon after they were released," Cromer said. 
"I believe financial backing will continue to become available in the
future as more satellite programs are proven and business cases are
demonstrated."
     Bruce Gerding, managing director of Odyssey Telecommunications
International Inc., said, "As more satellite financing deals are
brought to market, investors are beginning to understand them better
and deals are getting done, as evidenced by the completion in 1995 of
the PanAmSat, Orion and Globalstar initial public offerings and the
PanAmSat high-yield offering, among others.  Although some satellite
financing attempts failed this year, I believe that financial backing
will become more available in the future as risks are better
understood and more properly structured satellite deals are brought to
market."
     A less-optimistic view was offered by Ahmad Ghais, a satellite
industry consultant and the former director of engineering and
operations at Inmarsat.  Ghais warned financial markets may not become
more generous in the future.
     "Financial markets will recognize that not all contenders have
staying power, so they will be very selective in backing them," Ghais
said.  "That will lead to a shake out, beginning visibly in '96.  Who
will survive?  That is the question financing sources will need the
most expert help on."   
     Another consultant, Ed Martin, a former executive with Comsat
Corp., said, "Only a few, at most, of the new systems will achieve
financial success." 

  ...WRC 95 Spurs Optimism

     Many prospective global, mobile communications systems gained
immensely from the allocation of substantial spectrum for their
services at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-95) that
ended Nov. 12.
     Russell Daggatt, president of Teledesic Corp., said, "WRC has
left us very optimistic about the future.  We now are prepared to move
forward with the project.  I would expect us to bring on a few key
partners in '96.  The objective in '96 is not so much money, because
we are adequately capitalized for the time being, but we need to begin
putting our global partnership into shape."
     Odyssey's Gerding added: "WRC-95 showed terrific cooperation
between the satellite industry and the U.S. government delegation.  As
a result of their successful efforts, Odyssey has obtained its
frequencies, as planned; that accomplishment has been well received by
our backers."
     Scott Harris, chief of the FCC's International Bureau, said, "The
success of the U.S. delegation at WRC-95, which built upon and
expanded past successes, was another giant step forward for global
satellite systems.  This success was evidenced not only by the
spectrum allocated, but also in the commitment to such systems
demonstrated by the vast majority of ITU member states."
     Ghais countered, however, the allocations do not preclude
disputes erupting between satellite and terrestrial users that must
share the spectrum.
     Joseph Krabacher, managing director of Informcosmosconsult LLC,
agreed.
     "We are concerned about the broadband MSS frequency allocation
due to anticipated technical coordination problems and the potential
for a company such as Teledesic to obtain monopolistic advantages,"
Krabacher said.
     Informcosmosconsult is a U.S.-based marketing and legal
consulting firm that represents a number of Russian government and
industry clients.
     The SBCA's Hewitt said, "With the Satellite Industry Association
operating as an independent arm of the SBCA, and having
representatives on the SBCA board of directors, we're very pleased to
see the satellite-related spectrum allocations that were granted by
WRC-95."

  ...Launch Reliability Remains in Question

     Many observers thought one of the biggest stories of the past 12
to 18 months was the partial or total failure of at least one launch
each by Arianespace, Lockheed Martin Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
Orbital Sciences Corp., EER Systems Inc. and China Great Wall Corp. 
New rockets intended to carry small- and mid-sized commercial payloads
performed the worst with three consecutive failures (SN, Oct. 30,
1995, pp. 1-3).
     Irving Goldstein, director general and CEO of Intelsat, said
launchers needed to become far more reliable in the future.  And those
launchers also must provide their services at a reasonable cost, he
added.  Some launchers are charging upward of $100 million for each
launch.
     "Even though satellite communications is a relatively mature
industry, there still is a fair amount of risk associated with getting
spacecraft into orbit and in service for their entire lifetime,"
Goldstein said.  "Over the past year, the industry has experienced its
share of launch vehicle failures and delays, complicating an already
tight overall industry launch manifest.  While there have been some
positive trends, such as [Lockheed's] expanding launch capabilities
and progress on the Ariane 5, there still is considerable room to
improve the range of launch vehicle choices, scheduling options and
costs."
     He Xing, vice general manager of the space division at China
Great Wall, said 1996 will be an important year for new rockets that
launch big payloads.
     "The more powerful major launch vehicles, such as Ariane 5, Long
March 3B and 3C, will all experience their maiden flights, and
something new will also be brought about with Delta 3, Zenit and
Proton," Xing said.  "The world will suddenly receive such a large
number of new launch vehicles.  Fortunately or unfortunately, the
satellite operators will find it very difficult to distinguish and to
choose their favorite launch services package."

  ...Orbital Slot Disputes Will Spark Litigation in '96

     One negative development that will emerge this year is the
problem of orbital congestion between satellites, said Delbert Smith,
a partner with the Washington, D.C., law firm Reed Smith Shaw &
McClay.
     "I'm predicting the first, formal litigation or arbitration will
take place in 1996 dealing with disputed orbital arc locations," Smith
said.  "We've come very close in the recent past with four or five
instances of orbital arc disputes.  Each of these times the disputes
have been settled at the 11th hour through negotiation and
coordination.  Now, the stakes are much larger.
     "The companies are much bigger and their markets are much larger,
particularly for broadcasters.  These are major corporate entities. 
They have much to lose, and therefore the protection of their
corporate assets will become a prime motivating factor in their
ability to continue to raise financing."
     Past disputes about orbital positions largely have been limited
to technical issues, not commercial ones, Smith said.

U.S. DELEGATION WINS WRC-95 BATTLES WITH LOBBYING CAMPAIGN

     The U.S. delegation to the World Radiocommunication Conference
(WRC 95) last fall gained critical new spectrum allocations for some
proposed, global mobile telephony services, but used some
unconventional lobbying activities previously not seen at any of the
past conferences, some satellite industry insiders said.
     In one instance, the U.S. pressured other delegations to support
an allocation for Teledesic Corp., the U.S.-based company that plans
to offer broadband communication services via 840 low-Earth-orbit
satellites by 2001.
     Teledesic aided its cause by serving members of the various
delegations an assortment of goodies that included pizza, beer, ice
cream, tote bags, hats and notebooks, said Leslie Taylor, who heads
the Bethesda, Md.-based satellite consulting firm Leslie Taylor
Associates Inc.

  ...Promising Free Service Usually Works, Too!

     The strategy worked because the WRC allocated 400 MHz in Ka-band
for non-geostationary fixed services, such as Teledesic.  And, the
allocation of an additional 100 MHz for such services was placed on
the agenda for WRC-97.
     Teledesic won another victory when the conference adopted a
precedent-setting "freeze" on the filing of new geostationary or non-
geostationary fixed satellite services (FSS) before the end of WRC-97,
Taylor said.  That gives Teledesic extra time to win votes for the
additional 100 MHz allocation.
     To curry further backing, Teledesic promised two years of free
service in certain parts of the world, Taylor added.  Teledesic
President Russell Daggatt said his system won broad support on its
merits.
     The U.S. negotiators pressed their counterparts from other
countries for quick action on a number of key mobile satellite
spectrum allocations, said Taylor, who accompanied the U.S. delegation
in Geneva.
     Although the lobbying was cranked up at this WRC, FCC
Commissioner Susan Ness said the U.S. achieved some important gains
for Teledesic and others.  Ness praised delegation head Amb. Brian
Fontes for winning support on several key issues for U.S. mobile
satellite ventures.  Ness was part of the delegation.

FCC CLEARS PATH FOR FCC DBS AUCTIONS FOR JANUARY 18

     FCC commissioners voted unanimously late last month to hold the
long-awaited and much-anticipated auctions for 52 DBS channels split
between the 110 degrees W and 148 degrees W orbital slots on Jan. 18.
     Commissioners also voted to restrict current DBS operators from
participating in the auction.  A "single spectrum cap" will limit
companies from controlling more than one full-continental U.S. orbital
slot.  As a result, DirecTv Inc., EchoStar Corp. and United States
Satellite Broadcasting Co. Inc. (USSB), as well as other DBS
permittees, will not be allowed to bid on the frequencies unless they
divest their other licenses.
     The commission, however, did not prevent cable TV companies and
multiple system operators (MSOs) from bidding on the valuable
spectrum.
     A host of communications giants are thought to be interested in
bidding on the frequencies including, MCI Corp., backed by Rupert
Murdoch, Bell Atlantic Corp., Nynex Corp., U S West, BellSouth Corp.
and, of course, TeleCommunications Inc., the nation's largest cable
MSO.
     Indeed, MCI already has announced it will open the auctions, the
first in the history of the satellite industry, with an initial bid of
$175 million.

  ...How Will the Auctions Be Conducted?

     The electronic auctions will be held in sequential, multiple
rounds that will grant two permits, one for 28 channels at 110 degrees
W and the other for 24 frequencies at 148 degrees W--the spectrum
formerly licensed to Advanced Communications Corp., of Little Rock,
Ark., and Tempo Satellite Corp.

SATELLITE SPOTLIGHT: NEW SAT-BASED TRACKING SYSTEM INTRODUCED

     Fairfax, Va.-based Arrowhead Space & Telecommunications Inc.
(Arrowhead) has introduced a new vehicle monitoring and security
system (VMSS).  The new product will be available through Arrowhead
Technologies Inc., a division of Arrowhead Space & Telecommunications,
located in Newport News, Va.
     The VMSS is designed to solve two short- and long-haul trucking
problems: trailer hijacking and cargo theft.  It also functions as a
dynamic location device providing real time automatic updates
displayed on high-resolution maps.
     Arrowhead said the benefits of VMSS include reduced cargo
insurance premiums, improved loss control and less pass-through of
costs resulting from theft.  The VMSS is incident-driven and can be
interfaced with a wide variety of nationwide communications networks. 
The entire system is battery operated and completely independent of a
trailer's electrical system.
     "VMSS is an extension of our automated vehicle location product,"
said Mary Ann Elliott, president and CEO of Arrowhead.  "With VMSS, a
firm can determine a vehicle's exact location, status of the engine,
accumulated mileage, intrusion and security status.  It's the
difference between a home burgler alarm and a full-home monitoring and
security system."
     VMSS combines a computer processor, a global positioning system
(GPS) receiver, up to 24 sensor alarms, eight analog and six digital
inputs.  The entire system occupies a space approximately five inches
square and two inches deep.  The system also provides all weather
positions, heading and time information.  (Arrowhead Space &
Telecommunications Inc., 3040 Williams Drive, Suite 201, Fairfax, VA

BILL GATES ENVISIONS WALLET PCS AS A WAY TO USE TELEDESIC SYSTEM

     Billionaire businessman Bill Gates recently shared his dream
about developing wallet-sized personal computers that people could
carry anywhere to use with his planned Teledesic Corp. satellite
system.
     The Teledesic system, which Gates and telecommunications mogul
Craig McCaw are backing with seed money, is intended to provide
global, broadband communications services via a constellation of 840
low-Earth-orbit satellites beginning in 2001.  Gates envisions the
"wallet PCs" becoming one of many products that would use his proposed
system.
     Those wallet PCs would contain people's credit cards, tickets,
phone numbers, keys and additional information, said Gates, the
founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp. , of Redmond, Wash.
     "All of that literally will be available when you have a wireless
network in place," Gates said during a recent Smithsonian Institution
speech here.
     Craig Mundie, senior vice president of the consumer systems
division at Microsoft Corp., told SATELLITE NEWS Editor Paul Dykewicz,
"The advantage of Teledesic is it has the prospect of becoming a
broadband equivalent to cellular. I think there are other advantages,
particularly in lesser-developed countries.  But, there still is not
enough capacity in the satellite system to see that as an alternative
for the fiber optic network that we would have on the ground.
     Wallet PCs clearly would need to use some form of a broadband
delivery system, said Mundie, who added Teledesic could be one of the
answers.
     "Today, it doesn't exist," Mundie said.  "It might take Teledesic
or something akin to that to produce that kind of capability.  Our
goal is to write software for these families of products.  We're real
advocates of any communications technology that produces more
connectivity between communications and computers.  It gives us an
opportunity to write more software."

  ...Wallet PCs Are a Futuristic Concept

     Jon Magill, group product manager of Microsoft's personal systems
division, said wallet PCs are a "futuristic concept, not a product or
project announcement."
     "Coverage provided by satellite networks certainly would enable
people to go anywhere in the world," Magill said.  "But, more cost-
effective local wireless solutions would probably be the kind of
things you would see sooner rather than later."
     The wallet PCs could take various forms.  The PCs may include a
video screen and easily fit into a person's pocket, Magill said. 
Microsoft likely would not manufacture the PCs, since its specialty is
software.
     The applications of a wallet PC could include electronic commerce
or interacting with ATMs at local banks, Magill said.  The wallet also
could carry digitized photographs of family members, he added.  A
wallet PC could be the size of a pager or a personal organizer, Magill
said.
     "It also could be an extension of the watch that we worked on
with Timex not too long ago," Magill said.  "You could imagine it
taking on a form factor not too dissimilar from a checkbook."
     Magill said the device would need to be small enough for people
to carry it with them all the time.  The PC also would serve as an
electronic badge that provide identification for people, he added.
     "It could also have some interactions with a house," Magill said. 
"When a person approaches his or her home, the device could signal for
the garage door to open and the house lights to turn on."
     Magill added, "It can take away many of the mundane things that
we need to do day-to-day."

U.S. PLANS TO UPDATE LAUNCH PACT WITH RUSSIA TO CREATE PARITY

     U.S. government officials are expected to offer Russia an
opportunity to launch up to 20 U.S. commercial payloads into
geostationary orbit by the end of 2001.
     Indeed, negotiators from the two countries likely will meet in
the coming months, well-placed sources said.
     Such an offer would give Russia a similar deal to the one reached
last month with the Ukraine and another deal struck last year between
China and the United States, the sources said.  However, the U.S.
position has yet to be finalized and no firm dates have been set to
begin talks with the Russians, the sources added.
     The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has not issued a
formal U.S.  position about what Russia will be offered in any such
talks.  However, some senior officials in the Clinton administration
support giving the Russians parity with the Ukraine and China, which
have received permission to launch up to 20 U.S. commercial payloads
each into geostationary orbit by the end of 2001.
     Russia currently has a deal that limits it to nine launches of
U.S. commercial satellites by the end of 2001.  The gap has caused the
Russians to call for a review of their deal.  Such a request likely
will be honored early this year.
     On the other hand, McDonnell Douglas Corp. officials have
complained their company's plans to develop a Delta 3 rocket have been
undermined by the U.S. policy of rapidly increasing the number of
foreign launches of U.S. commercial satellites during the last two
years.  Launchers from non-market countries receive subsidies from
their governments that give them an unfair pricing advantage, those
McDonnell Douglas officials charge.

  ...U.S. Official Defends Deal

     Frank Weaver, associate administrator for the Transportation
Department's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST), said
the agreement includes a variety of pricing factors to ensure an even
playing field.
     "The purpose of that [language] is just to ensure that our
providers have been given fair consideration," Weaver said.  "That
will not necessarily stop a satellite service provider from going
forward [and using a foreign launcher].  But we do want to make sure
that the U.S. launch industry has an opportunity to be fairly
considered in the deployment of anything."
     The latest U.S. launch pact allows the Ukraine to win up to five
contracts for geostationary launches.  An additional 11 GEO launches
also could be won by an international partnership with Ukrainian
participation.
     Those 11 sea-based launches would be conducted by a joint venture
that includes a subsidiary of the Boeing Co. [BA] (SN, Dec. 18, 1995,
p. 10).  Up to four other launches--three involving the Boeing
venture--may be permitted if the demand for launches grows during the
life of the agreement.
     Boeing, which will manage the joint venture, must obtain a
license to conduct launches on behalf of the partnership, Weaver said
in a recent news briefing about the deal.  Boeing's joint venture
includes Russia's RSC Energia, the Ukraine's NPO Yuzhnoye and Norway's
Kvaerner a.s.
     The partnership is intended to build a launch infrastructure on
an ocean-going platform and conduct launches from international waters
in the Pacific Ocean.  The U.S. government had refused to allow the
partnership to launch any U.S. commercial payloads until the trade
deal with the Ukraine had been reached.
     In contrast, Lockheed Martin Corp. is not required to obtain a
license for its role as the marketing agent for launches provided by
Russia's Khrunichev Enterprise and NPO Energia.
Commercial Satellites Play Role in Bosnia Space-based assets, many of
them owned and operated by commercial entities, will play a vital role
in the U.S.-led NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, a U.S. Air Force
official said recently.  A mixed fleet of commercial and military
satellites are being used for a variety of applications, including
communications and reconnaissance, said Maj. Gen. David Vesely,
commander of the 14th Air Force.  Heavy demands on the military's own
communications system--the Defense Satellite Communications System
(DSCS)--during Operation Desert Storm demonstrated the need for more
bandwidth during large-scale operations, reports our sister
publication DEFENSE DAILY.  Since then, the Pentagon has begun to
exploit the capabilities of commercial satellites for some of its
communications needs, especially for high data-rate transmissions,
Pentagon officials said.  DSCS is being augmented by commercial
communications satellites and those owned by NATO for Bosnian mission. 
These satellites recently have undergone "minor repositioning" to
optimize their use in the Bosnian theater, Vesely said.  The military
also is using commercial remote sensing systems, in addition to its
own reconnaissance satellites, in support of the Bosnia mission. 
Multispectral imagery provided by the Spot satellite system, owned by
Spot Image Corp., already is being fed directly into the European
theater from Ramstein Air Base in Germany, and plans are currently in
the works to set up a similar feed from U.S. Landsat satellites. 
Other space-based assets at use in the Bosnian theater include
military and commercial weather satellites, and the Pentagon's Global
Positioning Satellite (GPS) system.

SATELLITE BRIEFS

McDonnell Douglas Conducts Tests on Potential EELV Engine
     McDonnell Douglas Corp. successfully completed tests for a liquid
hydrogen, liquid oxygen rocket engine that the company hopes to use in
its Delta 4 family of boosters being developed for the U.S. Air
Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, the company
said recently.  The tests, which occurred in October at NASA's
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., were conducted on
the RS-68 engine built by Rockwell Corp. subsidiary Rocketdyne. 
Rocketdyne is working with Mac-Dac to develop the main engine for the
Delta 4 boosters.  The tests involved varying the mixture ratios of
the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to determine combustion
efficiencies.  Four industry teams--Alliant Techsystems, Boeing Inc.,
Lockheed Martin Corp., and Mac-Dac--are engaged in low-cost concept
validation studies, the first phase of the EELV effort to develop a
single family of launch vehicles and reduce space launch operations by
25 to 50 percent.

Ariane 5 Debut Set for May 1996
     After last month's successful test of the cryogenic main stage to
be used in Europe's Ariane 5 launch vehicle, Arianespace has set a May
7 target date for the rocket's inaugural launch.  Another
qualification test of the main stage is set for this month, and a
first report of the launcher qualification review begun this past June
will be delivered in February, according to the European Space Agency.

AT&T Tridom and ViaSat Ink Pact to Develop New VSAT/Mesh-DAMA Systems
     AT&T Tridom and ViaSat Inc. announced an agreement recently to
develop new products jointly for domestic and international VSAT
customers.  Under the agreement, AT&T Tridom and ViaSat will integrate
their hardware and software technologies to develop VSAT/Mesh-DAMA
(demand assigned multiple access) systems.  AT&T Tridom will begin
offering the new systems in the first quarter of this year as an
enhancement to its line of high-capacity VSAT data transmission
systems and voice networks.  (AT&T Tridom, 908/221-4178.)

Uniden Introduces Its DSS System
     Fort Worth, Texas-based Uniden America Corp. has introduced the
Uniden-brand Digital Satellite System (DSS) hardware.  The Uniden
units feature event 
timers, front displays and channel access and universal remote
controls.  The company said these features will increase consumer
demand for the hardware.  "Uniden has always had the biggest share of
the C-band market," said Tony Mirabelli, Uniden's vice president of
   Uniden's UDS 200 DSS Hardware   marketing.  "We know what features

brand DSS receiver."  (Uniden America Corp., 4700 Amon Carter Blvd.,
Ft. Worth, TX 76155, 817/858-3300.)

British Telecom Opens Gateway for Access to PanAmSat
     British Telecom opened an earth station in the United Kingdom
that will enable broadcasters to access PanAmSat Corp.'s PAS 4
satellite.  The PAS 4 footprint covers Africa, Asia, Europe, the
Indian subcontinent and the Middle East.  BT and PanAmSat also have a
joint marketing deal to attract broadcast customers; the two
companies' first customer is Doordarshan, India's national
broadcaster.  Separately, Hong Kong-based Television Broadcasts
Limited International (TBLI) chose PanAmSat's PAS 2 satellite for C-
band broadcasting.  The company already leases a Ku-band transponder
on PAS 2.  TVBI will uplink its programming from Hong Kong for
distribution throughout Asia.  (PanAmSat, 203/622-6664.)

Global Access Expands Asian, European Operations 
     Global Access Telecommunications Services Inc., the Boston-based
provider of satellite and fiber broadcast services, opened an office
in Singapore to coordinate its Asia-Pacific business.  The office will
handle broadcast services for clients including ESPN in Singapore,
Hong Kong's Star TV and Japan's Fuji Television and Nippon Television. 
Telecom veteran Simon Patch will head Global Access' Asian subsidiary,
Global Satellite and Video Services (Asia) Pte Ltd.
Separately, Global Access launched European broadcast services from
its United Kingdom subsidiary.  Previously the company served Europe
from its U.S. office.  The company also announced a bulk buy of C- and
Ku-band transponder capacity off PanAmSat Corp.'s  four satellites.

Primestar-commissioned Survey Puts Whoopi and Tom at the Top
     A recent survey conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide for Primestar
Partners found actors Whoopi Goldberg and Tom Hanks top the list of
actors Americans most want to see in a new holiday movie.  The movie
"Miracle on 34th Street" came first in the favorite holiday movie
sweepstakes, while in the animated-movie derby, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer" swept the competition with a commanding 60 percent favorite
rating.  "Rudolph" has been seen approximately 2.5 billion times by
U.S. adults, the study found.  "At Primestar, we know that movies are
as much a part of the holidays as gift-giving and turkey, which is why
American families can find so many of their favorite holiday movie
selections on our digital TV entertainment service," said a Primestar
executive in a statement.
(Primestar Partners, 610/617-5446.)

DirecTv Expands Free Hotel Service
     Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary DirecTv Inc. expanded its
"free-to-guest" hotel programming packages, with the Best Western
International hotel chain signing up as its first customer.  Best
Western is scheduled to begin offering the service this month.  Other
target areas include hospitals, dormitories and office buildings.

           Welcome to the first issue of THE SPECTRUM REPORT, the
latest addition to the Phillips Publishing, Inc. family of
newsletters.
           The battle for radio frequency among competing services
is heating up, and the issues surrounding its allocation are
becoming increasingly critical to all services that use spectrum.
Spectrum issues are a growing concern to the readers of
INDUSTRIAL COMMUNICATIONS, PCN NEWS, SATELLITE NEWS, MOBILE
SATELLITE NEWS, DBS NEWS and MOBILE PHONE NEWS.  To give our
readers the breadth of perspective needed to protect their
interests in this battle, THE SPECTRUM REPORT provides
comprehensive news and analysis on spectrum allocation issues
across all services.
           Every other week, THE SPECTRUM REPORT will provide the
most in-depth coverage of issues critical to the global
allocation of frequency including regulatory actions, WARC '92,
new technologies and international coverage.  Now here's the
news:

BROADCASTERS MAY BE HIT WITH SPECTRUM TAX; NAB READY TO FIGHT

           The Treasury Department is rumored to be drafting
spectrum tax legislation to combat the growing deficit; the
National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) said it is prepared to
fight.  The federal government is "desperate for money" and on
the surface this is an attractive idea, NAB spokesman Walt Wurfel
told THE SPECTRUM REPORT.  The Congressional Budget Office
estimated the deficit for fiscal year 1991 at $253 billion and
$262 billion the following year.
           Administration officials had drafted similar
legislation last year in an effort to cut the budget deficit by
$50 billion.  Under the previous plan, most stations would be
required to pay 5% of their annual revenue for use of the
spectrum.  Smaller broadcasters--television stations generating
less than $2 million in annual revenues and radio stations making
less than $100,000 per year--would be required to pay 2.5% of
their revenues.
           "It's pretty clear that once on the table, you never
get off the table," Wurfel said.  We feel it will be part of the
budget plan in some way, he added.
           The NAB is opposed to a spectrum tax, said Wurfel.  "We
don't believe it would be fair to tax broadcasters because
broadcasters provide a lot of community service," he told us.
           Wurfel said he wanted to make it clear that NAB is
opposed to a tax--a fee assessed annually on all broadcasters.  A
tax is not the same as a spectrum fee such as a one time charge
on newly unallocated spectrum, he said.
           "That's not to say we are for fees of any kind or [for]
spectrum auctions--we've never really been enthusiastic about
anything that represents fees on spectrum," Wurfel told us.
           Wurfel said there will be hearings in the spring.
"Some believe we need to pay more than simply providing public
service.  We'll be preparing for these hearings and discussions
on the Hill to point out what broadcasters do for the community
and the responsibilities we take--which is the way we pay for
spectrum," he said.
           The bill is said to be drafted so that it would fall
under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance and House Ways and
Means Committees rather than the Commerce Committees.
Broadcasters also are against this set-up of the bill because the
Commerce Committee handles broadcast issues and thus, has a
better understanding of the industry.
           NAB said the first place it expects to see spectrum
fees is when President Bush sends his budget to Congress--the
first Monday in February.  It has been rumored that the president
will mention it in his State of the Union address but, Wurfel
said that "it's an outside chance."

The Dingell Bill Will Come to Life Again This Year

           Although broadcasters may be hit by a spectrum tax,
some good news still may come for other spectrum users in the
legislative process.  Dennis Fitzgibbons, spokesman for House and
Energy Commerce Committee, told THE SPECTRUM REPORT that the bill
introduced by House Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D-
Mich.) will, indeed, be introduced again early this session.  "It
will be much the same bill as before," Fitzgibbons told us.
           The Dingell bill, if passed, will free up some 200 MHz
of government-owned spectrum.  The bill passed the House last
year but not the Senate.  "Essentially the bill sets up a
mechanism in which commercial users could use the spectrum," said
Fitzgibbons.
           "For 20 years or more there has been talk of some type
of transfer of federal spectrum to the private sector.  This is
the first concrete move in that direction.  We have to recognize
John Dingell for his foresight," E.B. Kitchen, president of the
National Association of Business & Educational Radio told us.

Kitchen: Auctions May Have Held the Dingell Bill Up Last Year

           Kitchen said he believed the bill faired well by
passing the House but not the Senate, and that he was
"optimistic" that it will pass the next time.  "The hangup was
the whole issue of auctions.  The bill had language that
prohibited the auction of the 200 MHz of government spectrum and
the Republicans did not want that limitation--they wanted that
option," said Kitchen.
           The bill probably will be reintroduced without that
language, Kitchen speculated.  If the bill does not include the
auction clause, Kitchen said he believed the bill will pass.
           "I would rather have the Dingell bill pass even without
the auction exclusion.  We'll fight the auction battle another
day," added Kitchen.
           Hearings and mark-ups for the Dingell bill probably
will occur in February, Fitzgibbons told us.

FCC RADIO CHIEF SAYS TECHNOLOGY
GREATEST HOPE IN SPECTRUM FIGHT

           Emphasizing the need for improved technologies and more
efficient use of existing radio spectrum, Ralph Haller, chief of
the FCC's Private Radio Bureau said, "the current lack of
spectrum has troublesome competitive implications for our
country."
     Speaking at the recent general membership session of the
Special Industrial Radio Service Association Inc. (SIRSA) in San
Diego, Calif., Haller stressed the importance of radio.  "When
economic times are tough, radio's ability to save time and money
assumes ever greater importance," he said.
     Haller pointed to several time saving devices of the radio
including radio controlled traffic lights that enable traffic to
flow more quickly, security devices that call the police when
someone steals your car and vast pipeline networks across the
United States which are controlled remotely via radio links.
Haller said radio also offers new technologies for the future.
For instance, up-to-date maps displayed on the dashboard of cars
and personal communication devices.  But, he said the downside to
"all of these nifty new uses" is that they require spectrum.
           "For those of you out there who are accustomed to
thinking about radio frequencies in proprietary terms, I think it
is going to be harder and harder to maintain high walls around
`your' frequencies," said Haller.  As spectrum becomes more
valuable, those who don't use their frequencies will find
themselves under pressure from those who have an immediate and
pressing need for them," he added.

What are the Answers?

           Haller said there probably will be a need for channel
pools to serve the radio users with similar interests.  The
National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA), a unit of the Commerce Department, is encouraging federal
agencies to pool their channels to operate trunked systems.  NTIA
has released a request for proposals that might result in trunked
multi-user systems that are managed by private companies.
           "I also think that more spectrum sharing will be one
response to try to accommodate these needs," said Haller, "and I
don't necessarily mean sharing in the traditional sense."  By
using digital packet radio to fill pockets of otherwise dead air
time (the pauses between the words of natural speech),
individuals can increase the amount of frequency sharing without
a perceptible increase in channel congestion, said Haller.
           "Technology, of course, is the greatest hope for
spectrum salvation," he said.  Haller said the FCC is examining
time division multiple access (TDMA) digital modulation and code
division multiple access (CDMA) technologies to "create" more
spectrum.
           The new transmission schemes, CDMA and TDMA, are
associated most often with personal communication services.
"There is pressure for the U.S. to do even more in this fast
moving area lest we fall behind Europe and Japan," he said.

The FCC Supports New Technologies Through Pioneer Preference

           Haller said the FCC is faced with the task of "trying
to find new ways to do more with less."  The FCC is trying to
accommodate new services through pioneer preference--giving
pioneers of new communication services a preference in the
spectrum allocation process.
           The private radio version of this pioneer's preference
recently was adopted by the FCC.  The commission proposed that
people who find an idle private radio channel that is subject to
FCC takeback be rewarded for their efforts by getting "first
crack" at being licensed on that channel, said Haller.  "In
effect, valuable unused radio spectrum could be recycled," he
explained.
           Another way the Private Radio Bureau is trying to do
more with less is through conditional licensing processing.
Applicants on certain shared private radio frequencies may, if
they certify to having met specific criteria, can begin operation
under temporary authority immediately upon sending their license
documents to the FCC, said Haller.
           In order to "create" more spectrum, said Haller, the
FCC is looking at the possibility of refarming the spectrum below
450 MHz.  "This spectrum is almost always shared and often
crowded--with new technology, we should be able to bring relief
to users," he said.
           Additionally, Haller said the FCC recently concluded an
agreement with the Department of Communications of Canada to use
frequencies in the 821-824/866-869 MHz (public safety) and the
896-901/935-940 MHz (business and industrial land transportation)
bands within 87 miles of the United States and Canadian border.
           "Licensing in the bands can begin immediately which
should result in improved mobile communications service to the
public," said Haller.

What Can Spectrum Users Do?

           The FCC is not the only party with a role to play in
fostering technological advances, innovation, better regulation
and wiser use of the spectrum, said Haller.  As the demand for
spectrum increases, Haller said the FCC will be forced to
encourage spectrum efficiency, even to demand it.
           "I encourage you to start thinking in terms of radio as
a scarce resource than as a box with an antenna that is a minor
adjunct to your main business."

PUBLIC SAFETY LEANING TOWARD FDMA DIGITAL STANDARD

           NEW YORK CITY--Project 25, the brainchild of Associated
Public-Safety Communications Officers (APCO), together with the
National Association of State Telecommunications Directors
(NASTD) and various governmental agencies, is leaning heavily
toward choosing frequency division multiple access (FDMA) in its
quest for a digital standard for public safety radio.
           "[Project 25] made a decision that the future [digital]
public safety systems will use FDMA [frequency division multiple
access], providing an immediate improvement of 2-1," Stuart
Meyer, Project 25 committee member, told an audience recently at
the Technical Symposium at the Radio Club of America's 81st
Anniversary Dinner, held at the New York Athletic Club.
           J. Sharpe Smith, editor of our sister publication
INDUSTRIAL COMMUNICATIONS, was at the dinner and reports that as
soon as better voice coding is developed, a 4-1 spectrum
improvement will be achieved.
           The technical committee of Project 25 has recommended
FDMA, and the steering committee has given its blessing but it
wants more information about which modulation scheme will be
chosen.  The modulation scheme choices include c/4 BPQSK and 4-
Level FSK [frequency shift key].  c/4 requires linear amplifiers,
while the other method does not.

Spectrum Shortage Spurred Digital Standards Development

           In 1988, Congress mandated 6 MHz more spectrum in the
800 MHz band.  Since then, Public Safety has run low of spectrum,
and in some metropolitan areas, has run out.  The FCC has
countered calls for more spectrum allocation with a challenge to
improve spectrum efficiency.  Project 25 was Public Safety's
answer to the FCC.  It probably will go back to the FCC with
suggestions in the next 12-18 months, which may lead to a Notice
of Proposed Rule Making.
           "The FCC has come out with a Notice of Inquiry and said
to Public Safety, `you folks made out pretty good with this
federally mandated spectrum, but what are you going to do about
tomorrow?'" Meyer said.  "The commission went on to suggest that
Public Safety look at more spectrally efficient modulation
techniques in the future."  National Public Safety Planning
Advisory Committee (NPSPAC) developed a channel splitting plan,
from 25-12.5 KHz, which provided an easily implementable plan in
the past.  Meyer, a member of NPSPAC, described the formulation
of digital standards as the next step.
           The committee considered 3 access schemes: code
division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access
(TDMA) and FDMA.  Project 25's major concerns include spectrum
efficiency, encryption and quality of signal.  The committee
decided that CDMA would not fill the needs of Public Safety and
government radio.  "We cannot use CDMA because it requires large
contiguous blocks of spectrum, which we don't have," said Art
McDole, project steering board member and technical advisor.
           TDMA, while popular with the cellular industry, has
some special requirements that hurt it in the Public Safety
arena.  TDMA requires a central controller to select the time
slot.  "When we are looking at a dozen independent police
stations, with a few mobiles each, that don't want to work into a
common system, we start to get problems with TDMA," McDole said.
Another problem of TDMA is its need for linear amplifiers, which
are not as efficient as Class C amplifiers or non-linear
amplifiers, McDole added.
           "We've done a tremendous amount of work with the
manufacturers, weighing the merits of FDMA versus TDMA," McDole
said.  "We have not taken a positive and final action...but we
are leaning heavily toward FDMA, because of the problems of
adapting TDMA to [Public Safety]."

FDMA is Good for Starters

           "FDMA fits into our current time constraints.  It isn't
the step forward that we hoped for.  It is a short-term answer.
What we are looking for is a clear migration to advanced
technology to improve spectrum efficiency," said Craig Jorgensen,
NASTD immediate past president.  "Theoretically, TDMA helps us
with spectrum efficiency, but the linear amplifiers are a
critical issue to power consumption."  There is some question
about a non-ionizing radiation problem with TDMA, which could
cause cell tissue damage to the user, but it hasn't been proven
yet, Jorgensen added.
           "We want to find a migration path to new technology, 4-
5 years down the line, to be more spectrally efficient,"
Jorgensen said.  "We also want flexibility within the standard to
allow for enhanced features."
           Why have standards?  "First, we must intercommunicate.
We must be able to talk with each other during a disaster," said
McDole.
           "There are a thousand reasons that we can't have one
system that can't talk to another."  Standards also allow a user
to have multiple sources and possibly lower prices.

Group Will Study How Digital Modulation Affects Spectrum
Requirements

           Project 25, which has been in existence for one year,
has a steering committee, currently co-chaired by John Powell,
APCO vice president, and Jorgensen.  The steering committee,
which will make the final decision, consists of 3 members of each
organization and 3 members from the federal government.  Two
subcommittees were established under the steering committee: a
technical group and a spectrum group.
           "I think that we've gotten into a huge, huge arena,"
said McDole.  "Recognizing the scope of what we have to do, I
think that we've made excellent progress."
           The technical group is responsible for working out all
of the details of the standard relating to access and modulation
methods.  The spectrum group is concentrating on the logistics of
migrating from analog to digital technology and how it will
affect the spectrum requirements.  Each subcommittee is open to
industry participation.
           "All of the manufacturers are represented on both of
the committees, and we have input from all of the branches of the
federal government," McDole said.  "A number of manufacturers,
including GE and Motorola, have made presentations to the Project
25 committee."

TIA Will Help to Formulate Standards

           In an FCC filing, Project 25 said it looked forward to
working with the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA),
but it officially has not begun its relationship with the
association.  TIA is a trade organization that makes it possible
for competing manufacturers to meet in the same room and help
formulate standards and avoid antitrust problems.       Once the
standard is written, project principals are hoping for industry
acceptance, not a mandated standard.
           "[TIA has] offered help to assist them, but it is still
waiting for their response," Meyer said.  Jorgensen anticipates
that TIA will be brought in as early as mid-February, and he
called the participation of the association "critical" to the
success of the venture.

WARC CHALLENGE--FINDING SPECTRUM FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES

           The World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC)
challenge in 1992, said Bob Raish with the law firm Fletcher,
Heald and Hildreth, is to decide how to superimpose all the new
communications technology upon a spectrum that is totally
allocated.
           Raish, speaking at the recent forum, "WARC '92:
Allocations for the Year 2000 and Beyond," sponsored by the
Washington Annenburg Program, said the most critical focus will
be on the 1-3 GHz band where new technology requirements already
exist for a substantial portion
and where the "have or have not" confrontation is the greatest
due to industry interests.
           "There must be a balance between spectrum accommodation
and technological advancement," said Raish.  Raish also said the
United States faces a dilemma: whether it should keep up with
competition or remain entrenched.
           Travis Marshall, senior vice president and director of
government relations at Motorola, said the market should drive
allocations, not technology.
           "The mobile radio is an explosive growth area doubling
spectrum needs every 5 years," said Marshall.
           However, Michael Rau of the National Association for
Broadcasters (NAB) did not seem as optimistic about the effects
of WARC '92.  Rau said U.S. broadcasters do not need the WARC.
"The WARC issue concerns satellite-delivered high-definition
television (HDTV)," said Rau.  NAB does not believe HDTV is
needed in the United States.
           Rau also said that he did not feel the United States
should adopt a position that favors entrepreneurial technology,
especially if that technology duplicates existing services that
are meeting consumers needs.  "The U.S. should focus on pragmatic
policy rather than idealistic or theoretical frameworks," added
Rau.  Look for more coverage on the WARC forum in our next
issue.

(MSTV) recently filed comments to the FCC addressing the proposal to
use the UHF band for the developing digital audio broadcasting (DAB)
service.  MSTV said "there is one clear certainty: advanced
television (ATV) and DAB cannot `share' the UHF television band."
MSTV said that industry has invested billions in the development of
ATV transmission systems and tens of millions in the development and
installation of testing and evaluation capabilities.  "It is now
certain that terrestrial ATV will require every last remaining piece
of the UHF band in major markets for years to come," said MSTV in its

band were not contemplated, sharing of the band with existing NTSC
stations "would be costly and impractical."  (The Association for

           *Nynex Corp. recently submitted its comments to the FCC
discussing the spectrum allocation requirements for personal
communication services (PCS).  Nynex said it agreed with the
commission in its view that an exclusive allocation for land
mobile services and specifically personal portable wireless
services is neither necessary nor appropriate.       "As recent
advances in the cellular industry demonstrate, technology and a
flexible regulatory approach can assist in making more efficient
use of existing spectrum to provide a range of quality services
such as personal communication services," said Nynex in its
comments.  Nynex also said the deployment of a technology that
permits the sharing of frequencies is "a more practical and
viable approach to the development of new wireless service
offerings" than the WARC proposal.  The WARC proposal would
require the reallocation of frequencies on an exclusive basis.
Nynex has applied to the FCC for an experimental license to test
the feasibility of sharing spectrum in the 1850-1990 MHz range
with other licensees through the use of spread spectrum
techniques.  (Nynex Corp., 1113 West Chester Ave., White Plains,

HUGHES NETWORK SYSTEMS SUPPORTS THE NEW TDMA TECHNOLOGY

           Hughes Network Systems (HNS) recently announced that it
will manufacture cellular telephones using the radical new TDMA-
compatible technology, Extended Time Division Multiple Access (E-
TDMA) technology, which is promising 15 times analog capacity,
from International Mobile Machines Corp. (IMM).
           HNS will create a nationwide cellular services network,
offering customers one-stop shopping for cellular phones at
General Motors dealers.  The company, owned by GM Hughes
Electronics, will offer dual-mode phones, switches and cell site
equipment on a turnkey basis to carriers.  HNS will supply the
switches through a long-term agreement with France-based Alcatel.
           "Everyone is vigorously trying to update the technology
and increase  spectrum efficiency," said Robert Wysor,
consultant, Economic & Management Consultants Inc. (EMCI).  "In
the long run, that is very good for the industry."

A `Voice Activated Channel' Will Employ Unused Channel Capacity

           E-TDMA achieves 15 times analog capacity versus 3 times
analog, which is the current TDMA expectation, by using digital
speech interpolation (DSI).  This technique assigns the channel
only when the person is speaking.  In other words, time slots are
only assigned during actual talk time.  In any 2-way
communication, 65% of the channel capacity goes unused, because
while one person speaks the other channel remains silent.  IMM's
answer to the dilemma of accessing that unused capacity could be
called a "voice-activated channel."
           "The Hughes proposal will only assign a channel to
someone when they are speaking," said George Calhoun, IMM senior
vice president.  "So when they are not speaking, they don't take
up any part of [the] channel."
           In the existing TDMA technology, a user receives a
periodic time slot whether he is speaking or not, and silence is
broadcast to the one who is talking.  E-TDMA takes advantage of
the silent time slots.

Hughes' Phones Will be Compatible with Current Standard

           The Hughes dual-mode phones will be compatible with the
industry standard.  "It uses the same slot structure [6-slots],
same channel structure, same 30 KHz bandwidth, as in IS-54.  It
fits within that framework without any modification.  It uses the
slots for different purposes, and some of the control information
is different but it is allowed by the standard," Calhoun said.
           "IS-54 provides the framework in which other things can
be implemented, but it's certainly not the end of the line.  The
belief that CDMA was 20 times and TDMA was 3 times was simply
wrong," said Calhoun.

Universal Service, Federal Preemption Are Focus Of NCSL Meeting

     State and local governments should monitor provisions in
pending federal telecommunications legislation that could preempt
their authority over carriers within their jurisdictions, panelists
told the National Conference of State Legislatures  during a
meeting of the group's Assembly on Federal Issues held last month
in Washington.  Speakers also discussed whether definitions of
universal service should embrace "advanced" telecom services,
including Internet access.

     In a hearing held by NCSL's Agriculture and Trade Committee,
Clayton Parker, Director-intergovernmental affairs in the Office of
U.S. Trade Representative, said the U.S. is prepared to "freeze"
state-level telecom regulations at their current level as part of
the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations over
basic telecom services.  

     The offer to freeze state regulation is contingent on U.S.
trading partners' agreeing to liberalize their own markets. 
Meanwhile, the federal government would have to obtain consensus on
the proposal from the states, Mr. Parker said.  He noted that
passage of federal telecom legislation would render the offer moot.

     At a Commerce and Communications Committee hearing, Debra
Berlyn, Executive Director of the National Association of State
Utility Consumer Advocates, told state legislators that "effective
competition will protect ratepayers and offer them more benefits
than regulation" will.  But deregulation without effective
competition is "the worst of all possible worlds" for ratepayers,
she added.  

     State legislators should "look in their own backyards" to find
the "most interesting, innovative" developments in telecom markets,
said Jamie Cooper, Associate Director of the Center for Policy
Alternatives in Washington.  In conjunction with the Benton
Foundation, the center this month is issuing a progress report
detailing what states are doing to develop telecom infrastructure,
promote uses of new technology, and encourage innovation, Ms.
Cooper said.

     Jeffrey A. Chester, Executive Director of the Washington-based
Center for Media Education, said universal service should include
access to personal computers and online services, he said.  

     "Electronic redlining"--the exclusion of low-income areas when
deploying advanced services--is a real concern for CME.  Privacy is
another concern, and it is an issue "that the feds are not going to
deal with," Mr. Chester added.  Scott Cooper,
Manager-telecommunications policy for Intel Corp., said, "People
need more bandwidth than they can get over analog copper wire."

     But Mary Rouleau, Director-state legislation for the American
Association of Retired Persons, urged legislators to look at claims
that investment in network upgrades are "demand-driven."  She
suggested that such upgrades are being made "on spec" and that
ratepayers--who may not want advanced services--will have to pay
for them.  Richard L. Cimerman, Director-state telecommunications
association affairs for the National Cable Television Association,
echoed that concern.  He said proposals to include broadband
offerings in the definition of universal service will amount to a
$78 million "tax" on ratepayers.

     The National Governors' Association wants Congress to ensure
that federal legislation will not affect any state rules on
intraLATA (local access and transport area) toll presubscription
that already are in effect, said Tim Masanz, NGA's Group
Director-economic development and commerce.  He noted that four
states--Arizona, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania--
either recently have acted, or are about to act, on this issue.

     Kevin McCarty, Assistant Executive Director-energy,
transportation, and communications for the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, said the federal legislative debate "has created the idea
that there is something special" about telecom service providers as
occupants of public rights-of-way.  Under the competitive market
model, "we will be retrofitting public thoroughfares" to an extent
never before seen, allowing new market entrants use of those
rights-of-way, he said.  Companies are going to Congress and asking
for the same free use of public rights-of-way that was given to
telcos "a hundred years ago," he added.

     Mary McDermott, Vice President-regulatory affairs for the U.S.
Telephone Association, argued that while competition should replace
regulation as the "paradigm" for the industry, it is important to
ensure universal service.  "In many places competition can ensure
affordable service, but not everywhere," she added.  

     Language in the pending federal legislation should be
clarified to ensure that states retain jurisdiction over intrastate
universal service funds, said Lee Palagyi, an Ohio Public Utilities
Commission staff member representing the views of the National
Association of State Utility Regulators.

     Bob Fogel, Assistant Legislative Director of the National
Association of Counties, said local government representatives are
"pretty close" to an agreement with the wireless industry on zoning
authority for cellular and personal communications service (PCS)
towers.  

     Nicholas W. Allard, Counsel to the Wireless Cable Association
International, suggested that state and local governments
increasingly are viewing telecom service providers as a source of
revenue.  He warned that new taxes can be "duplicative" of existing
ones, saying, "Whenever you hear the phrase 'level the playing
field,' you should hold on to something, because you're about to be
tilted over."

MCI Asks N.Y. PSC for 'Neutral' USF, Wants NYNEX Price Plan Set
Aside

     Attacking NYNEX-New York on two fronts, MCI Telecommunications
Corp. has asked the New York Public Service Commission to
reconsider whether the telephone company needs a universal service
subsidy and has requested that a state court overturn the PSC's
approval of NYNEX's performance-based regulation plan.  MCI
submitted to the PSC data from a universal service cost study it
said showed that NYNEX's residential local exchange revenues are
more than two times the economic costs it incurs to provide basic
local exchange service.

     NYNEX's annual revenues from residential services amount to
$1.6 billion, but its total costs to provide those services equal
$640 million, MCI said.  The study indicated that a "limited"
universal service fund of about $10 million per year "is needed to
allow local competition to develop in the high-cost areas" of
NYNEX's service territory.  MCI asked the PSC to develop a
"competitively neutral mechanism to collect and distribute
universal service subsidies where they are truly needed."

     The universal service cost study "confirms what MCI has long
maintained:  NYNEX overcharges its own customers and long distance
companies, does not need a subsidy to deliver basic local service
at affordable rates, and uses those excessive revenues, in part, to
support its other competitive ventures as well as to realize
excessive profit," said Donna Sorgi, Director-state regulatory and
government affairs for MCI's Eastern Region.

     The study found the average cost of service in New York City
to be $7 per residential customer, while NYNEX receives an average
of $26.85 in revenues per customer, MCI said.  Meanwhile, in some
rural areas--particularly in upstate New York--the cost of service
may be as high as $40 per month, while revenues "may only be around
$16 per month."  Those are areas that "actually need" a universal
service subsidy, MCI said.

     MCI's research undercuts NYNEX's reasoning that "enormous
overcharges for access fees" are needed to provide subsidies for
universal service, MCI argued.  According to a chart released by
MCI, NYNEX's performance-based regulatory plan allows it to charge
5.6 cents per minute for intrastate access to its network, while
its "economic cost" to provide that service is 1 cent per minute
(see chart).  

     In its Dec. 18 filing with the commission, MCI also submitted
the "Benchmark Cost Model" it developed in conjunction with NYNEX,
Sprint Corp., and U S WEST, Inc.  That model was filed in an FCC
proceeding on revising universal service support programs (SLCR,
Oct. 20, 1995).  The model "produces 'benchmark' costs for the
provision of basic telephone service in each census block group
within a state," MCI told the PSC.

     Applying the model to New York yields a statewide average cost
for basic universal service of $12.02 per month, compared with a
nationwide average of $16.71 per month, MCI reported.

     MCI also sought a suspension of "the 'play or pay'
intercarrier compensation rates currently in effect in [NYNEX's]
Tariff No. 914."  It added, "There is no factual basis to support
the commission's arbitrary classification of local exchange
competitors as either 'players' or 'payers,' based upon the
untested and unproven assumption that residential service requires
a subsidy from other services."  MCI asked the commission to reopen
an earlier stage of its proceeding on universal service and the
transition to competitive local exchange markets.

MCI Asks Court To Reject NYNEX Regulatory Plan

     On Dec. 18 MCI asked the New York State Supreme Court (County
of Albany) to set aside portions of the PSC's order in "Track 2" of
its incentive regulation proceeding (case no. 92-C-0665), in which
the PSC had approved NYNEX's performance-based regulatory plan. 
MCI alleged that the commissioners had reached their decision on
the plan "in private session in violation of the Open Meetings
Law."

     MCI also asked the court to set aside those portions of the
commission's "Track 1" order in the same proceeding that allowed
NYNEX to "continue to collect $153.3 million in revenues in excess
of its annual revenue requirement"--the revenue required to recoup
its costs and provide a "reasonable return" to investors.  The PSC
had ordered NYNEX to "set aside" those funds "to be used in
accordance with commission determinations to be made in the future
to fund incentives for [NYNEX] to improve its performance," MCI
told the court.  All but $27 million of the set-aside funds have
been released to NYNEX as service-quality incentive awards, it
added.  The price targets the PSC set for certain services were
"based on a wholly untested and unproven assumption that local
residential service requires a subsidy from those services," MCI
said.

     A NYNEX spokesman said MCI is making "the same tired, old,
muddled argument that is as inaccurate today as it was" two years
ago, when work on NYNEX's performance-based regulation plan began. 
"MCI is simply looking for an access rate reduction that is deeper
than it got under the plan," which took effect in September, he
said.  The plan "strikes a good balance" between competitors,
NYNEX, the state, and consumers, who will see about $2 billion in
local exchange and toll rate reductions over seven years, he added.

Utilities Share Problems of State, Local Agencies in Relocating
from 2 GHz Band

By M.J. Richter

     Like many state and local government agencies, numerous member
companies of UTC (formerly known as the Utilities
Telecommunications Council) are incumbent licensees in the 2
gigahertz microwave band.  Also like state and local government
entities, these investor-owned and publicly owned utilities,
electric cooperatives, municipal utility departments, and natural
gas pipeline companies traditionally have used their 2 GHz
microwave radio systems for their internal operations, rather than
for revenue-producing services.  In a recent interview with SLCR,
UTC staff attorney Thomas Goode explained how the FCC's decision to
reallocate the 2 GHz spectrum to personal communications service
(PCS) operators is affecting many of the association's nearly 2,000
member companies. 

     SLCR:  What does the FCC's decision mean for the day-to-day
operations of UTC member companies, which rely heavily on their 2
GHz microwave radio systems for internal communications?

     Goode:  The microwave systems that they now operate in the 2
GHz bands have not been replaced for some period of time, because
UTC member companies have been waiting for resolution of the status
of this particular band, to see whether it would be reclassified
for use by the PCS licensees.  There's been a lot of uncertainty
about what the rules would be, how long they would have to move
out, whether they'd have to bear the cost themselves.  So there
hasn't been as much activity as there probably normally would have
been concerning the replacement of analog systems with digital
systems.

     There has been some movement from the band, simply to get out
of that [uncertain] situation and get to another band--the 6 GHz
band, for instance.

     There are some that have waited, and now they're in a position
where they are co-primary in the bands, which means they can stay
there forever, at least according to current FCC rules.  But they
have to deal with the issue of involuntary relocation at the hands
of PCS licensees.

     SLCR:  If they're co-primary and therefore can stay forever if
they want to, what if a PCS licensee wants the bands they're on?

     Goode:  Essentially, the way the rules work now, the PCS
licensee can operate on the band to the extent that he does not
interfere with an incumbent licensee.  And they are co-primary with
the incumbent licensee.  Now, if the PCS licensees are unable to
operate without causing interference to an incumbent licensee, or
do not want to deal with the hassle of having to work around the
incumbent system, they can enter into mandatory negotiations--force
the incumbent to come to the table and discuss the relocation
terms.

     If they cannot come to a mutually agreeable resolution or
relocation agreement, the PCS licensees can force the incumbent
out.  They can go to the FCC and request an involuntary relocation
of an incumbent system.  

     If they do that, they have to pay all costs associated with
the relocation; they have to move the incumbent to another band;
they have to make sure that the facilities they give them are
comparable to what the incumbent had in the 2 GHz bands; they have
to guarantee that the replacement is seamless, that this whole
transition process out of the 2 GHz band does not disrupt the
incumbent's. . .communications.

     SLCR:  To date, have any UTC members that are incumbent
licensees of that spectrum successfully negotiated their relocation
with PCS providers?

     Goode:  Yes, a number have.  [The negotiated terms and
conditions] are subject in most cases to a nondisclosure agreement. 
I could definitely say, however, that a number of successful
negotiations have occurred--and are occurring right now.  Not only
have they done it but, from what we've heard from the industry,
both sides have been very happy with what they've gotten out of
some of these agreements.

     SLCR:  Are they attempting to negotiate whole-system
changeouts, or are UTC members making piecemeal arrangements with
multiple PCS licensees?

     Goode:  Both.  The answer to that question depends on the
incumbents, what their systems are like and what they're looking
for out of this whole transition process.  Some incumbent systems
are structured such that they cannot tolerate a piecemeal
relocation.  Every time you relocate a single link, you have a
potential for disrupting the entire system.  Some of these systems
are providing such vital communications under. . .such unique
technical constraints that they need to be relocated entirely at
one time, a whole-system changeout.

     Others are looking simply to relocate certain links, and their
systems either are more robust or they're able to somehow engineer
around [any problems].  I know that both [types of relocation] are
happening.

     SLCR:  What do UTC members think of the FCC's proposed
$400,000 cap on the recovery by PCS licensees of the costs they
incur in relocating incumbent users, e.g., UTC members?

     Goode:  Our members are very concerned about this $400,000 cap
because the incumbent microwave systems are unique.  There is no
easy way to quantify how much it would take to move a [given]
system.   Without analyzing each individual system, the costs are
going to vary greatly from one system to another. . .

     When you put a cap on reimbursement costs, even though it
doesn't directly affect how much money can be paid to an incumbent-
-because the cap is only on what the PCS provider can seek from
other PCS providers--there is going to be a fairly direct causal
relationship between that cap and how much a licensee will pay to
relocate a link.  [PCS licensees] will be cognizant of the fact
that they only get reimbursed up to a certain amount, and they're
going to be pushing to keep the amount of money that they pay under
that.

     SLCR:  How are incumbent UTC licensees determining the
market-based value of their microwave operations?

     Goode:  I think the main focus has not been on the fair-market
value, as much as on the replacement value.  Basically, when
incumbents are in negotiations with a PCS provider, they're looking
at two different elements of the costs--or the value--of the
replacement.  One, they're looking at the replacement facilities: 
Where do they need to go?  What will that facility look like?  What
are the costs associated with moving, for instance, from a 2 GHz
system to a 6 GHz system--hardware, software, labor charges, all
the elements that are built into the replacement?  The other
element is the value [or price] that a PCS licensee is willing to
pay to get up and running more quickly than it otherwise might. 
And that is something that requires an analysis of what the value
of time is to a PCS licensee.

     SLCR:  At this point in the negotiation/relocation process, do
UTC members believe the FCC's two-year transition period for
"voluntary negotiations" is long enough?

     Goode:  I would guess that most members are happy with that
period, because they are guaranteed a one-year mandatory period, so
they can negotiate after that.  This voluntary negotiation period
gives them a time to prepare for this negotiation, to do the
studies and whatnot, to be in a position that when they are
required--if they ever are required to negotiate during the
mandatory period--they will have the necessary information.

     This two-year voluntary period is fixed, and the mandatory
period is not.  The mandatory period is a one-year period, but it
doesn't start until the incumbent receives a written notification
from the PCS licensee that they want to negotiate.  

     SLCR:  Do UTC members believe that voluntary negotiations
between the PCS industry and incumbent 2 GHz users will be
successful, or do they think the FCC will have "to impose" some
relocation agreements?

     Goode:  I think most members have very positive feelings that
they will be successful in negotiating a relocation agreement and
that they will reach a voluntary agreement without having to be
forced out of the band.  

     There's a lot of optimism that if a reasonable offer is made,
they can and will try not only to meet the needs/wishes of the PCS
licensee in relocating from the band, but also to offer other
services, such as certain infrastructure--dark fiber, cell sites,
other types of services that will further the PCS deployment.  I
think there's a lot of optimism among our members that it will end
up being a win-win situation for both parties.

APC, Maryland Agency Face PCS Interference Questions

     American Personal Communications has rejected claims that its
personal communications service (PCS) system is interfering with
the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In a recent
letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration (MTA) stated
that the new wireless service has caused "serious interference" to
the communications operations of light rail and bus services
operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations.  

     The letter was made public by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing
incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz
spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it had
distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.

     Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, expressed
concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to "politicize" the
effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to other spectrum bands. 
The FCC recently clarified rules governing relocation efforts,
further defining "good faith" negotiations between licensees.

     The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions last
fall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transit
communications systems.  "These communications interruptions have
posed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated. 
The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs incurred as
a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Brown
declined to comment further on the interference problems, noting
that it involves "a possible issue of litigation."

     Ms. Schelle told SLCR that interference problems with the mass
transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to the MTA,
an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have reported no
public-safety problems resulting from interference between the two
radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a responsibility to
respond to frequency coordination notices in a timely manner, the
attorney added.  The MTA received at least six such letters
indicating that APC planned to test its PCS system, he said, but
MTA officials failed to respond to a single one.

     "Microwave licensees that ignore frequency coordination
notices do so at their own peril," the APC attorney stated.  "PCS
licensees can only protect licensed facilities if they are informed
of the complete parameters of those facilities' operations.  APC
fully protected the facilities represented on MTA's FCC license and
could not have known, without being informed by MTA, that MTA is
operating at a variance from those parameters."

Cable TV Interests Sue Chicago Over 7% 'Amusement Tax'

     The cable TV industry has followed through on threats to sue
Chicago over a 7% "amusement tax" to be applied to the gross
receipts of companies offering video services and certain forms of
live entertainment (SLCR, Dec. 1, 1995).  As previously reported,
the Chicago City Council adopted an ordinance imposing the tax
effective Jan. 1.  Cable TV companies oppose the amusement tax
because they already pay local franchise fees, and satellite TV
operators oppose it because they have no "local" facilities. 
Companies in both industries fear that other cities may impose
similar taxes.

     Communications and Cable of Chicago, Inc., LaSalle
Telecommunications, Inc., and South Chicago Cable, Inc.
(collectively Chicago Cable TV) and the Cable Television and
Communications Association of Illinois have filed a joint lawsuit
(case no. 95CH0011919) against the city of Chicago in the Circuit
Court of Cook County, Ill.  In a memorandum supporting their
"motion for preliminary injunction," the plaintiffs argued that the
newly adopted amusement tax "singles out" cable TV operators and
other providers of electronically delivered programming.  But they
noted that it does not tax "the broadcast television industry and
other members of the press and print media that deliver" similar
programming to Chicago residents.

     Seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, they
said application of the amusement tax "upon selected modes of
speech violates the equal protection clauses of the United States
and Illinois constitutions, as well as the First Amendment rights
of [the] plaintiffs and their subscribers."  In a statement, they
expressed concern that imposing a tax on the estimated 33% of
Chicago residents who subscribe to cable TV service "places a
disproportionate and unfair burden on them to fund services that
benefit the city's entire population."  They recommended that
Chicago undertake further research on the issue before establishing
tax precedents "that potentially could cover everything from online
computer services to home shopping to hotel movie systems."

Pennsylvania Cable TV-Led Coalition's FiberSpan Concept Hasn't Been
Realized

By Judith Freeman Mills

     A year after a communications industry coalition--dominated by
cable TV concerns--acquired the rights to the FiberSpan
Pennsylvania broadband infrastructure concept from the Pennsylvania
Cable TV Association, the project seems all but dead.  The plan to
offer an array of  21st century telecom services in Pennsylvania by
interconnecting the state's cable TV systems "is not going forward
as originally planned," said Hal Estelle, FiberSpan's former Chief
Operating Officer and now a consultant to the project.  Although
the concept is changing, it "still exists," he emphasized.

     The FiberSpan project was created by the state cable TV
association in response to proposals--including legislative
initiatives--for a statewide, fiber optic distance-learning and
telemedicine network.  The proposed legislation would have mandated
telephone company investments in such a network.  The telcos
estimated it would cost them $20 billion to $30 billion to build
the network.  [Legislation was passed in 1993 that allows the
state's telcos to adopt alternative regulation if they submit plans
to the Public Utility Commission for implementing a broadband
network by the year 2015.--Ed.]

     The original goal for FiberSpan was to link all cable headends
in Pennsylvania using fiber optic cables, augmented as needed with
microwave, satellite, and coaxial connections to ensure universal
access to the infrastructure.  The network would offer broadband
delivery of two-way video, data, and voice communications to
government buildings, schools, businesses, medical facilities, and
homes.  But the idea, seemingly simple in concept and technology,
proved more complicated when it came to economics and politics.

     After conducting research and development for the FiberSpan
concept, the state cable TV association sold its idea on Jan. 3,
1995, to the industry coalition, which includes a few phone
companies and energy utilities, as well as cable TV companies. 
FiberSpan Pennsylvania was transformed into a for-profit
corporation.  Jones Lightwave, a competitive access provider and
subsidiary of multiple system operator (MSO) Jones International
Ltd., was one of about 20 major equity investors.  Lightwave
President Wallace Griffen served as Chairman of the FiberSpan
board.

     Earlier this year a contract was drafted--but never signed--
for Jones Lightwave to build and manage the FiberSpan project.  For
the past several months FiberSpan officials have said a final
contract would be issued soon.  But last week they made no such
pronouncement.  While Mr. Estelle said the parties were discussing
a modified version of the FiberSpan Pennsylvania idea, other
project officials were more blunt, saying the idea would never
become a reality.

     "We are looking toward a possibility [that] FiberSpan will
play a role" in the infrastructure of Pennsylvania, Mr. Estelle
said.  "There is still an interest in developing
larger-than-regional infrastructures" and also in serving the
entire state "in some form or fashion."  Talks are continuing
"within the general framework" of the original idea, he continued.

     But he explained that there have been problems getting
FiberSpan's investors to agree on "how to set up the corporation
and the management structure."  In addition, he said, there have
been questions about "the changing nature of competition, changing
attitudes" and, significantly, "individual company plans for their
own regional networks."

     Asked if too many companies are involved in FiberSpan, Mr.
Estelle said, "You can't discount that."  But the number of
participants was not the core problem, he said, adding:  "It would
be more helpful if there was a more defined policy" from the state
government regarding statewide video, telephony, and data
communications.

     William Cologie, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Cable TV
Association, suggested that smaller independent cable operators
felt "a reluctance to relinquish control."  But despite the failure
of FiberSpan's participants to agree on the details of the planned
broadband infrastructure, the idea is still valid, he maintained. 
The idea "makes sense for companies such as Lenfest Communications
and Tele-Communications, Inc., that are rapidly consolidating" and
interconnecting their Pennsylvania operations, he added.  "Why
wouldn't it make sense for the independent operators to jump on,
too, he asked?"

     In the race to wire the state with two-way multimedia-capable
fiber optic lines, the FiberSpan participants still have "a couple
years' head start in terms of infrastructure" compared to Bell
Atlantic-Pennsylvania, the Bell operating company that serves much
of the state, Mr. Cologie said.  The cable TV association is not
considering taking on the FiberSpan effort again, he noted.

     Mr. Griffen said he remains on FiberSpan's board and is "still
hopeful" that an infrastructure based on the FiberSpan concept will
become a reality.  But he noted that cable TV companies, including
Jones, are finding their timetables for launching high-speed data,
telephony, and interactive video services to be more protracted
than originally expected.  The time spent on FiberSpan was not
wasted, because it benefited related projects being undertaken at
Jones, he said.

Regulators, Communications Industry Concerned about Transition
Ahead

By Victoria Mason, Editor of  SLCR's sister publication,
Telecommunications Reports

     Attempts to craft federal legislation reforming the 1934
Communications Act are having dramatic effects on all segments of
the communications industry, even before a bill is signed into law. 
The transition to a new industry structure already is in full
swing, and while the legislation will codify new competitive
principles and regulatory roles, in many respects it may be
outdated from the beginning.

     Instead of driving the current changes shaking the
communications world, activities on Capitol Hill are only
responding to the unique combination of technological, economic,
social, and political forces that have been shaping the industry's
future for some time.  But now, the pace has quickened.

     Participants at a recent conference sponsored by the KMB Video
Journal kept repeating the views of one panelist:  "The current
exercise may be irrelevant--a little bit like rearranging the deck
chairs on the Titanic."  The communications markets are in the
process of reorganizing themselves in fundamental ways.  What
Congress, a regulatory agency, or any company or industry segment
does at this point is likely to influence only the details.

     The legislative developments, however, are focusing greater
public attention on an industry that accounts for a major portion
of the nation's economy and that will have profound effects on how
Americans work and play, become educated, and receive health care
in the 21st century.  And for regulators and business executives,
the congressional debates have served as a "wake-up call":  There's
little time left for the perennial arguments about what the
industry should look like in the future, whether one businesses'
"level playing field" gives it advantages, and how to carve up a
market that is growing exponentially.

     Some regulators and industry executives are acknowledging that
the telecom world is moving in an irreversible direction--with or
without their blessings.  This is creating uneasiness in all
quarters.  Regulators are trying to redefine their roles for the
short term, and many wonder whether they'll have a long-term role. 
Business people are dreading the difficult decisions that come with
corporate reorganizing and downsizing, the never-ending demands for
greater efficiencies, and the industry's push into uncharted
territory.

     In discussions between industry officials and regulators, a
shift is occurring:  The focus is on the stark realities of change-
-the opportunities and problems it brings.  Quickly emerging is a
competitive industry structure in which carrier classifications
will be blurred or eliminated, and market entry and exit barriers
will fall.  Companies that historically have been defined by a
narrow set of products or services--and that have honored
franchises and carefully delineated service territories--are being
turned loose to move in any direction their managers choose.  Bell
companies and independent telcos will compete against each other;
interexchange carriers, competitive access providers, wireless
service providers, and global competitors also will be thrown into
the mix.

     What is being called "regulatory schizophrenia"--having an
announced U.S. policy favoring competition and open market entry,
while simultaneously favoring the preservation of universal service
at all cost--will have to be corrected.  But how?  It's clear that
a new blueprint is urgently needed, but government and business
leaders first must decide what they want the outcome to be.

The Legislation:  What It Does, What It Doesn't Do

     While most observers expect President Clinton to sign
legislation developed by the House-Senate conference committee,
they note that repeated attempts to revise the Communications Act
have failed over the years, often at the last minute.  Each time,
surprised industry lobbyists and Capitol Hill staffers have wailed,
"We were so close, and so much effort went into the process this
time around."

     History proves the Washington adage that it's always easier to
kill a piece of legislation than to get one signed into law.  The
current House and Senate bills, HR 1555 and S 652, are among the
most complex, far-reaching measures to be debated on Capitol Hill
in recent times.  In addition to updating the telephone and
broadcasting sections of the 1934 statute, they address industries
and economic sectors that didn't exist until relatively recently. 
Because the bills tackle so many issues--they "try to do everything
to and for everybody," one lobbyist says--the opportunities for
"mischief-making" are great.

     The direction of the broadly defined "communications industry"
is clear, however, and a massive industry restructuring will
continue to proceed with or without this specific legislation.  If
the current legislative attempt fails, all participants in the
process will be back later--as they have year after year for the
past two decades.

     U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene, who has had the
unenviable task of overseeing the 1982 antitrust consent decree
that bans the Bell companies from interLATA (local access and
transport area) markets and manufacturing, has been awaiting the
outcome of the legislative debate.  

     Several important requests for decree waivers are pending
before him--waivers that would allow local exchange/interexchange
competition experiments.  If communications legislation is not
signed into law, Judge Greene will move on those motions.

     Another "wild card" concerns the Bell companies' 1994 request
that the decree be vacated.  Judge Greene gave the Justice
Department one year to investigate the request, and its
recommendation was expected to be submitted early last September. 
The department's views still are awaited.  Its response is expected
to focus on the current state of competition in communications
markets, possibly fueling the fires on Capitol Hill.

     The current legislative debate, which has been more visible in
the national and local press than have past attempts to rewrite
national telecom policies, has highlighted the trend toward a
competitive model in all segments of communications.  It also has
eradicated age-old concepts about business segmentation and lines
of demarcation (i.e., company X is in the "telephone business,"
company Y is in the "entertainment business," and so on).

     How to define the markets of tomorrow is troublesome for the
Clinton administration, federal legislators, and state regulators. 
Because the bills outline an incremental approach to change that
already is occurring in many jurisdictions, they may be considered
"evolutionary" instead of "revolutionary."  The result will be
greater reliance on market forces and new types of involvement by
regulators.

     Regulators and the financial community have become aware that
even minor tinkering with this industry can have enormous ripple
effects throughout the nation's economy and social structure. 
Indeed, global effects are of concern.  The bills, which spell out
a national policy framework, seek to open communications markets to
more participants and to encourage the deployment of new
technologies and services.

     People involved in all sides of the debate believe that a
rewrite of the nation's communications statute must ensure that all
Americans have access to "new technologies" in addition to basic
telephony.  By the year 2000, 60% of new jobs will require skills
that only 20% of Americans have today.  The Clinton administration
says that, to ensure an adequately trained workforce, educational
institutions and libraries must have adequate access to the
national information infrastructure.

Technology:  Another Complicating Factor

     Overlaid on the political disputes is a shifting technology
scene that promises both solutions and more problems.  The
following technology trends point to major societal changes over
the next 10 years:

     *    Mobility:  People want the flexibility offered by mobile
communications.  This market demand eventually will allow wireless
and wireline services to achieve price and service-quality parity. 
Integrated networks offering seamless services and number
portability will circle the globe.  Separate voice and data lines,
fax lines, mobile phone equipment, and the like will become
unnecessary as single devices provide "integrated messaging."

     *    The Internet:  An increasing number of people pay $15 to
$20 per month for access to the Internet; some of them stay
connected for hours on end, while others have access for short
periods.  As the Internet becomes more popular, traffic congestion
and network crowding will become problems for network planners. 
And capabilities for voice telephony over the Internet will allow
"free" long distance calling, a situation interexchange carriers
can't do anything about.

     The rapid growth of Internet usage raises security issues and
has implications for a variety of transaction services targeted to
both consumers and businesses.  The Internet also will spawn new
"cottage industries," as in-home provision of information and other
services becomes lucrative.  Meanwhile, electronic commerce over
the Internet will lead to "disintermediation"--the elimination of
arbitrage or middlemen--in major segments of the economy.  On a
social level, Internet "chat groups" will allow the real-time
sharing of experiences without regard to geography (i.e., "virtual
parties" while a football game is in progress).

     *    Home Entertainment/Video:  This will develop as
asymmetric digital subscriber line technology evolves and broadband
networks are upgraded.  Predictions are that by the year 2005, two
fully robust networks--cable TV and telephony--will be capable of
delivering all types of services to the home.  

     "Intelligent agents" will find the information a consumer
wants, sorting and filtering massive amounts of data available on
numerous networks.  And "virtual reality" technologies will be
simplified for general consumer uses (for real estate shopping,
home decorating, or product testing, for example).  Telcos,
meanwhile, are expected to integrate vertically into the "content"
business.

     *    Deployment Speed:  Faster product life cycles will mean
faster changes in industry structures, business relationships, and
corporate leadership.

     These changes mean that policy-makers cannot continue drawing
those "bright red lines" around services and industry segments. 
Attempts to delineate which companies can get involved in which
services, and whether services are basic/enhanced or
regulated/unregulated will fail.  As LATA boundaries, franchise
areas, and other types of artificial geographic segmentation become
obsolete, rules will be applied to companies irrespective of the
specific technologies they employ.

How Regulators View the Transition

     Communications markets of tomorrow will be cost-driven,
market-driven, technology-driven, and customer-driven.  Although
aspects of the current regulatory system will remain during the
transition, there's a growing acknowledgment that regulation and
competition cannot coexist indefinitely.

     Meanwhile, the "Internet revolution" is causing many observers
to question the relevance of regulation at all, in any form.  What
the Internet and online services enable massive numbers of people
to do on a global basis also has serious implications for state and
national laws and borders.  These developments are external to the
narrowly focused U.S. debate about reorganizing portions of the
domestic communications industry.

     Regulatory agencies have existed for more than 100 years,
however.  During that time policy-makers have observed great
changes in technology and the business environment, emerging each
time with an updated list of responsibilities and a renewed mission
statement.  The changes ahead will be just as profound for
regulators as for the business community.  

     Nevertheless, some regulation is likely to continue as complex
new issues emerge (carrier and network interconnection is surfacing
as the next battlefield).  And states will retain an important role
as laboratories for regulatory and marketplace experiments.

     But regulators are worried.  They fear the political and
social problems that would result if the current disparities in
wealth and education are extended to communications, creating a
society of information "haves" and "have nots."  

     They wonder what is being done for--or to--consumers who don't
care about competitive models and only want affordable basic
telephone service.  Regulators are hoping for creative solutions.

     State regulators disagree about the effects of Communications
Act revision and the role of regulation in the future.  Some view
federal developments positively, believing that consumers, the
economy, and the nation's global competitiveness will benefit if
legislation is enacted.  They note that local exchange competition
initiatives already are forcing states to review how industries are
regulated.  Events in Washington, they say, are only formalizing a
process that's well under way.

     Others, however, worry that authority is being taken from
them, that their relationships with consumers and industry
officials and their understanding of local needs are being ignored,
and that federal preemption will disrupt activities progressing in
the states.  They want flexibility to address competition issues in
ways that reflect local conditions.  And, believing that rate
increases are inevitable, they want safeguards against "rate shock"
in areas that currently have extremely low rates.

     While national communications policy reforms definitely are
needed, the pendulum has swung too far toward an "inside the
Beltway" approach, some state representatives say.  Economic
development programs may be at stake:  A state needs the freedom to
adopt policies encouraging businesses to locate within its borders. 
If a state makes the right decisions, it will prosper economically. 
If it makes the wrong decisions, it will suffer the consequences. 
Regulators fear that detailed federal mandates will have a
"leveling" effect, making it difficult for individual state
economic development policies to be carried out.

     In some states, many consumer complaints involve interstate
matters over which the states have no jurisdiction.  Because
consumers generally believe federal authorities are inaccessible
and slow to act, they sometimes feel there has been no resolution
to their problems.  

     This situation has led to a suggestion that state public
service commissions become FCC "field offices" after federal
legislation is enacted.  Under this scenario, states would remain
closely involved at the local level, functioning as the federal
government's eyes and ears and having power to act on the federal
government's behalf.

     Also under review is whether the old common law concept of
"common carriage" can be sustained in a competitive environment. 
Public utilities historically have been viewed as "natural
monopolies," with economies of scope and scale that allowed one
company to serve the public interest more efficiently (cheaper)
than several could.  They provided "essential" services in a
nondiscriminatory fashion, and regulators protected the monopoly
status.  

     Regulators now are wondering if, in a competitive market, it
makes sense to characterize any communications company as a common
carrier.  The obligations imposed on public utilities can be
problematic when new market entrants don't appear to be "essential"
and all market players demand equitable treatment.

     Others believe common carriage concepts will remain because of
the public benefits flowing from them and the privileges enjoyed by
such carriers:  Carrier-customer contracts can be established
cheaply and easily through generic tariffs; common carriers have
easy access to public rights-of-way; and they have advantages when
legal liabilities are concerned.

     Regulatory roles and tools already are being revised to
address new demands, and further changes are ahead.  Regulators and
legislators must ensure that "quick fixes" so common during
transitions aren't relied upon long term.  "Sunset" provisions,
therefore, may be necessary to signal to all parties that the
search for permanent solutions should continue.

     Regulation historically has been "vertical," concentrating on
the relationship between carriers and their customers.  In the
future it will become more "horizontal," focusing on relationships
between carriers.  

     Instead of overseeing carrier rate bases or prices or
accounting practices, state regulators will be in charge of
certifying carriers and defining their obligations; addressing
local market entry/exit barriers; developing criteria for
"effective competition" in discrete markets; guaranteeing service
quality; making sure carriers adhere to certain technical
standards; guarding against discrimination between customers and
against competitors; protecting proprietary information about
customers; mediating in carrier-carrier and carrier-customer
disputes, which are expected to increase; and addressing consumer
protection issues and complaints.

     Consumer education and protection raise special concerns for
regulators, who are divided on questions concerning their future
role in these areas.  But everyone seems to agree that (1) consumer
education about communications issues has been handled very poorly
in the past, and (2) customer confusion will increase with the
advent of local exchange competition.  Regulators now wonder how
consumers will react if competition causes residential rates to go
up and business rates to drop.  How will the situation be explained
to them?  Who should take the lead in educating consumers about the
new industry structure?  And how are consumers to distinguish
between one company and another, between one service package and
another?

     Along with the choices available in competitive markets comes
consumer responsibility for the outcome.  Some regulators,
therefore, believe consumers should rely on government intervention
only in cases of fraud or other criminal conduct.  But in the
communications industry, shifting to a "let the buyer beware"
mindset may be slow in coming:  The industry structure is complex,
and many consumers are uncomfortable with technology. 
Nevertheless, in the future they may have to send
communications-related complaints to state attorneys general or the
courts.  Regulators, meanwhile, may target more resources to
collecting data that consumers need to make informed decisions
about communications services.

     Negotiated rulemaking and alternative dispute resolution
procedures are being explored widely, and their use in other
industries can be instructive for communications policy-makers. 
Crucial to successful use of these techniques are incentives for
industry participants to resolve differences themselves and firm
signals about the consequences if negotiations fail.  If regulatory
commissions become facilitators and arbitrators, they will need
employees trained in dispute-resolution procedures.

     The highly charged subject of staffing will be difficult for
commissions that in the future seek new types of employees--those
with backgrounds that are new to regulatory agencies (marketing,
for example).  Meanwhile, uncertainties about future regulatory
roles and the staff cutbacks currently being discussed in some
states are creating a serious management problem:  how to keep good
staff members now, and how to attract a new, highly adaptable type
of professional in the future.

Industry's Concerns: Reorganizations and Equities

     Communications industry officials share many of the
regulators' concerns and have several additional ones:

     *    Networks:  Networks must be modernized, and depreciation
rules must be changed to reflect faster write-offs.  Carriers favor
an evolutionary approach to modernization efforts, hoping to get
the maximum benefits from past investments.  And they want to
ensure that new and older networks, portions of which will exist
long into the future, are interoperable.  Telcos are concerned that
if they offer only a transmission pipe in the future, network
robustness and innovation will be lost.  They say that if the
public switched network (PSN) is unbundled and opened to all
service providers, proprietary network "intelligence" eventually
will be moved out of the PSN.  The value-added intelligence that
makes one network superior to another will reside elsewhere.

     *    Speed:  In the computer industry, extremely rapid product
cycles are the norm, and the telecom industry wants to move in that
direction.  The world won't wait for big, ponderous telecom
companies to make systematic decisions as in the past.  A faster
approach will be necessary to keep pace with entrepreneurs, and a
change in the telecom industry's public image also will be needed
(the public doesn't look to the telecom industry for innovation).

     *    Regulation:  Regulators don't allow the "trial and error"
necessary for development of new products and services, and some
companies currently are barred from offering certain services.  The
situation is further complicated by regulatory requirements that an
innovation be ubiquitous throughout a telco's service area.  

     Regulatory rules often handicap incumbents, making their
response to marketplace demands slow, cumbersome, and expensive. 
And regulators haven't been willing to address certain politically
charged issues--e.g., geographic rate deaveraging--that arise in a
competitive environment.

     *    If We Build It, Will They Come?  It's hard to justify two
(or three, if electric utilities are included) networks to the home
today, and consumer demand for new services remains speculative. 
No one knows whether consumers will spend their discretionary
income on communications/entertainment services, or if they'll have
the spare time to use many of the services envisioned.

     *    Convergence:  An extremely complex transition is taking
place.  Instead of the much-ballyhooed industry convergence
predicted earlier, partnerships will develop for the bundling and
branding of services.  Companies (or industry segments) are likely
to have an identity crisis, being unable to define who they are or
what business they're in.  Whoever is first to offer one-stop
shopping in a new market will have tremendous advantages.  But then
there will be a market shakeout and a bloody field of would-be
competitors.

     *    Wall Street:  Explaining the current changes to Wall
Street analysts, institutional investors, and individual
shareholders is difficult, especially when the communications
industry itself has no clear sense of what the future holds. 
Meanwhile, vast amounts of capital are flowing into and out of an
industry that's in transition, and stock values and risk
assessments are being determined by new criteria.  Dislocations and
confusion are heightened when not only companies but also entire
industries are being reorganized.

IDAHO STAFF, U S WEST AGREE ON SERVICE QUALITY SETTLEMENT

     Under a settlement agreement reached by the Idaho Public
Utilities Commission staff and U S WEST Communications, Inc., the
telephone company could be liable for civil penalties of $7,500 a
month until it reaches and maintains a specified standard for
service quality.  The parties submitted the agreement last month to
the commission for review, and the PUC could consider whether to
accept, modify, or reject it at a meeting slated for this month,
Donald L. Howell II, state Deputy Attorney General, told SLCR.  

     The PUC's current rules do not specify sanctions for the
company if it fails to meet the standard, which calls for resolving
at least 90% of all out-of-service trouble reports within 24 hours. 
Under the agreement, the penalties will be paid into the state's
general fund.

AMERITECH WINS EIGHTH, NINTH CABLE TV FRANCHISES

     Ameritech New Media Enterprises, Inc., is continuing to rack
up local cable TV franchise agreements throughout the Midwest.  The
Ameritech Corp. subsidiary recently won its eighth and ninth
franchises in Southgate, Mich., and Greendale, Wis.  It plans to
invest about $3.5 million to build a two-way interactive cable TV
system in Southgate and $1 million to build a similar system in
Greendale.  Construction on the systems will begin during the next
few months.

     Ameritech New Media previously secured six cable TV franchises
in Michigan (SLCR, Nov. 17, 1995) and one in Glendale Heights, Ill. 
Alleging that Ameritech is cross-subsidizing its cable TV systems
using telephone ratepayer funds, cable TV interests are seeking a
court order blocking further construction in Glendale Heights
(SLCR, Nov. 3 and Dec. 1, 1995).

     Meanwhile, Ameritech New Media has received permission to
begin building cable TV systems in Berea and Columbus, Ohio,
pending the finalization of franchise agreements in those cities. 
Overall, Ameritech New Media is engaged in franchise negotiations
with more than 40 communities in the Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee,
Cleveland, and Columbus areas.

PACIFIC BELL SEEKS APPROVAL TO DOUBLE ISDN RATES

     Pacific Bell has asked the California Public Utilities
Commission for permission to double the per-minute rates for its
integrated services digital network (ISDN) service and to add a
$125 installation fee.  The company said it needs the rate
increase--from 1 cent to 2 cents per minute--because of the
"exploding" demand for service in areas where it is costly to
install and maintain the service.

     ISDN use has until recently been concentrated near central
offices in metropolitan areas, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman said. 
But she said the increase in consumer use of the Internet and
online services--along with increasing popularity of telecommuting-
-has led to more residential installations.  The company's current
ISDN rates will remain in place pending the PUC's decision, which
could take six months or more, she added.

U S WEST MEETS COLORADO DEADLINE FOR SINGLE-PARTY SERVICE

     Avoiding a potential revenue loss of $550,000 a month, U S
WEST Communications, Inc., has converted all Colorado multi-party
lines to single-party service, meeting a Dec. 31 deadline.  The
conversions were required by the Public Utilities Commission's
orders in the second phase of the Rural Facilities Improvement
Program.  The company earlier had sought a waiver from the
requirement, indicating that it did not expect to complete the
conversions last month.

     The PUC had been considering late last year whether to direct
U S WEST to eliminate "tariff riders" which allow the telco to
recover the cost of the conversions.  The rider charges on
subscribers' bills represent $550,000 in monthly revenues, a U S
WEST spokesman told SLCR.  U S WEST said its employees made an
"extraordinary effort" to complete the upgrades by Dec. 31.

PA. BEATS FEDERAL PREEMPTION DEADLINE WITH INTRALATA ORDER

Pennsylvania has become the 17th state to order establishment of
intraLATA toll dialing parity, making it the last state likely
to beat a preemption deadline contained in the pending federal
telecom bill.

The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) has ordered all
telcos to implement intraLATA dialing parity during 1997.

By acting late last month, the PUC made it likely Pennsylvania
will be among the states escaping preemption under the intraLATA
toll dialing provisions of the pending federal telecom reform
legislation.

In its current form, the federal legislation would preempt any
multiLATA state that voted to order intraLATA toll dialing
parity after December 1995, until such time as the resident Bell
regional entered the interLATA long-distance market.  Single-
LATA states would be exempt from the preemption.  States that
acted prior to the cutoff date would be "grandfathered" and
their programs would be allowed to run to completion.

Under the PUC order, Bell Atlantic and other Pennsylvania telcos
with more than 250,000 lines must complete implementation by
July 1997, while smaller telcos have until the end of 1997.

The PUC went along with the November recommendations of an
administrative law judge (ALJ) for intraLATA parity, except on
the issue of timing.   The ALJ had wanted to give large telcos
just six months to comply, but Bell Atlantic successfully argued
for a longer implementation period, citing the need to make
network modifications that require relatively long lead times.

AT&T and MCI had opposed stretching the implementation period,
saying any extension would shield Bell Atlantic's near monopoly
in intraLATA toll from serious competition for the additional
time.

FIVE MORE STATES MAKE MOVES ON INTRALATA TOLL DIALING PARITY

In addition to Pennsylvania, the states of Michigan, Wisconsin,
Arizona, New Jersey and Indiana also got in under the federal
wire with various requests for intraLATA toll dialing parity.

In Michigan, regulators have asked federal authorities to grant
Ameritech the interLATA long-distance waivers required for the
telco to comply with inter- and intraLATA toll competition
mandates contained in a 1995 state telecom law.

The Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC) has petitioned for
a waiver of the federal interLATA service restrictions so that
Ameritech can comply with Michigan legislative toll competition
requirements that link provision of interLATA long-distance to
intraLATA toll dialing parity.

In a letter asking the U.S. Department of Justice to petition
U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene for interLATA relief,
the Michigan PSC said the requested waiver will enable Ameritech
Michigan to fulfill a directive in Michigan's 1995 state telecom
reform act that the company should begin providing intrastate
interLATA long-distance services as soon as possible, and be
offering such services to at least 50 percent of its customers
in competitive local markets by May of 1996.

Michigan Gov. John Engler Nov. 30, 1995, signed into law the
state telecom reform act (SB-722, Act 216) that, among other
things, prohibits mandatory implementation of full intraLATA
"1+" toll dialing parity in any market area where the serving
telco is not providing interLATA long-distance service.

In Ameritech's case, however, once that company receives federal
permission to begin interLATA service in Michigan, the 1995
state law makes intraLATA dialing parity mandatory immediately
in Ameritech market areas where interLATA service is legal and a
local exchange competitor has been certified.

Competitive local Ameritech markets include Grand Rapids and
Detroit.

The PSC implemented dialing parity for intraLATA WATS services
in 1991, and in August 1994 issued an order requiring Ameritech
to implement full dialing parity for all intraLATA interexchange
services by Jan. 1, 1996, an order that the telco still was
fighting to modify when the new state law was enacted.

The Michigan law also contains a directive to the Engler
administration and the PSC that they collectively pursue the
federal relief necessary to allow Ameritech to fulfill the state
law's toll competition provisions.

An Ameritech Michigan spokesman said the company fully supports
the state's efforts, but added that Ameritech will not be
providing any interLATA long-distance service in Michigan until
federal authorities issue a waiver or grant other relief from
the interLATA service ban.

The PSC is awaiting a reply from Justice before deciding its
next step.

In addition to the new waiver request submitted to the Justice
Department by the Michigan PSC, Ameritech has pending before
Judge Greene its own request for an interLATA service trial in
the Grand Rapids and Chicago LATAs, which Justice supports.

The big complicating factor in all this is what Congress will do
regarding interLATA relief for Ameritech and the other Bell
regionals when, or if, a final federal telecom bill emerges from
the House-Senate conference committee.

In Wisconsin, a state court has refused to stay a Public Service
Commission (PSC) order requiring Ameritech Wisconsin to begin
implementation of intraLATA dialing parity this month, with
completion of the process by July.

Dane County Circuit Court Judge Mori Krueger ruled that
Ameritech had not shown that it was incapable of fulfilling the
order or that it would suffer great harm if the PSC order were
implemented.

In Arizona, the Corporation Commission has given U S West and
other large telcos until April 20 to implement full intraLATA
toll dialing parity, as part of an order authorizing intraLATA
competitors to begin operations.

That deadline is about 10 weeks earlier than the original July
1, 1996, implementation deadline specified in the January 1995
order opening the intraLATA toll market to competition.

While the order did not detail the reasons behind the move, the
new date may have been a compromise to settle a pending dispute
between U S West and interexchange carriers over the validity of
intraLATA equal access requests filed by interexchange carriers
last summer when they applied for intraLATA certification.

The order authorizes AT&T and MCI to begin intraLATA toll
service; Sprint has a request for intraLATA authorization still
pending.

In the order authorizing the intraLATA competitors, the
commission also further streamlined regulation of interexchange
carrier services.  The new rules eliminate the 14-day notice
period for changes to toll discounts, allowing carriers to
modify or introduce toll discount plans the same day as notice
is given to the commission and the public.  However, no discount
can take the price below total service long run incremental
cost.

Changing the tariffed ceiling rates from which discounts are
figured still requires a commission review.

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities is scheduled to release
a proposed order for intraLATA toll presubscription Jan. 16.

Comments on that order will be taken until Feb. 15, after which
the board will decide whether to adopt or modify its proposal.
A final decision could come as early as mid-March.

In Indiana, the Utility Regulatory Commission has scheduled
evidentiary hearings Feb. 7-9 on a joint petition by four
interexchange carriers seeking establishment of full intraLATA
toll dialing parity.

The petition by AT&T, Sprint, LDDS Worldcom and LCI
International demands establishment of intraLATA parity as soon
as technically feasible.

Final prefiled material must be submitted by Jan. 17.  Final
post-hearing briefs are due March 8 with final reply briefs due
April 1.  Under its procedural rules, the commission must reach
a decision before July.

However, by acting in 1996, Indiana may find itself preempted by
the pending federal act.

STATES REGAIN SOME GROUND AS TELECOM BILL ENTERS HOME STRETCH

State utility commissions have retained some important areas of
authority over local telecom competition in a newly compromised
federal telecom act now getting the finishing touches in a
House-Senate conference committee in Congress.

But the federal act also will allow parties to seek Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) preemption of a state's actions
on grounds that they conflict with the federal law.

And the act gives the states no significant role in determining
whether a Bell company can enter the interLATA long-distance
market.

The final compromise between the differing House and Senate
versions of the act looks like it largely will hew to the House
version but with Senate language on some key issues such as
universal service, according to a 281-page draft obtained by
State Telephone Regulation Report.

Right now, the federal bill appears to be a compromise that
nobody really loves, but which the major interest groups think
they can live with.

The deal appears to be jelling as key factions release
statements endorsing the draft measure, including the
Telecommunications Industry Association, the National
Association of Broadcasters and the Alliance for Competitive
Telecommunications (which represents the Bell companies'
interests).

There's also been a lack of strenuous objection to the draft
from the United States Telephone Association (USTA) or the
Competitive Telecommunications Association (CompTel),  which
represents interexchange carrier interests.

Of course, there is always the possibility that further
jockeying among congressional leaders could upset the developing
accord or add to the time before the conference bill is put to a
floor vote in both chambers.

The draft conference bill requires states to remove all barriers
to competitive entry in telecom markets.  It also establishes
the checklist of services that all major telcos must make
available to competitors.

The bill allows states to set their own rules governing
competition, provided the state rules do not conflict with
federal rules and policies regarding competition.

The FCC must issue a set of national rules defining the
framework for interconnection, unbundling, resale and other
competition requirements within six months of the bill's
effective date.

Within the framework established by the FCC, states can
promulgate rules on interim number portability, access to
rights-of-way, reciprocal compensation and other issues.

But the bill allows the FCC to preempt a state rule if it
violates the federal bill's local competition requirements.

The bill makes physical on-site collocation the national default
option for network interconnection, but allows states the option
of letting a telco provide virtual, or offsite, collocation.

States also can exempt small telcos from competition
requirements where compliance with a particular provision would
be "unduly economically burdensome" or not technically feasible.

"Small" telcos are defined as those with fewer than than 2
percent of the nation's access lines.

The states retain jurisdiction over interconnection agreements
negotiated between local competitors and incumbents, and can
reject an agreement if it violates the public interest, among
other grounds.  If a state does not reject a proposed agreement
within 90 days, the pact automatically goes into effect.

If interconnection negotiations don't produce an agreement after
135 days of trying, a competitor can call on state regulators
for binding arbitration, where the state sets the rates and
implementation schedule.

If a state must set the rates for interconnection, transport and
termination, it must allow each carrier to recover its costs.

Although states "may include a reasonable profit" when setting
the rates, they cannot impose a rate-of-return ceiling on
interconnection services or penalize a provider that generates a
greater actual profit margin from such services.

However, the federal bill again allows the FCC to step in and
take charge of any interconnection proceeding upon a complaint
or other indication that a state is not regulating
interconnection services in a manner consistent with the federal
law.

Provisions barring states from imposing rate-of-return
regulation on noncompetitive services have been deleted from the
compromise measure.

On local resale, the legislation requires that all services a
telco retails also must be offered to resellers at wholesale.

The bill settles the wholesale discount squabbles by defining
wholesale rates as the retail rate minus costs such as billing,
collection and marketing that the telco avoids by selling to a
competitor.

States are allowed to bar local resellers from reselling
residential local service to business customers.

The legislation also mandates sharing of network facilities
where one telco, typically a smaller one, wants to rely on
specialized facilities of a larger telco in order to provide
services the small telco cannot afford to provide on its own.
But the bill says the small telco cannot force a large telco to
share facilities if the small company will use the shared
resources in the large telco's service territory.

The states retain jurisdiction over public safety requirements,
such as "911" emergency dialing systems, in a competitive local
marketplace.

State and local governments also retain their authority to
manage access to public rights-of-way, provided they don't
discriminate among carriers.

On universal service, the federal legislation allows state
regulators to determine which carriers will be eligible to
receive universal service subsidies from a fund, but requires
that all telecom providers contribute to the universal service
support system.

States can impose their own universal service requirements and
definitions of the universal service entitlement.  But those
requirements and definitions must be consistent with a national
policy framework to be established by a federal-state joint
board, acting under a set of principles embodied in the federal
legislation.

Such principles include a requirement that comparable rates and
services must be available in rural and urban areas.

Another principle to be embodied in universal service policy is
that public schools and libraries are entitled to a discount, to
be set by the FCC, on all telecom services.

This means providers will be able to seek compensation for their
losses on discounted school/library service through the
universal service fund.

While the states kept important areas of authority in the local
exchange, they did not fare so well in the federal bill's
sections on interexchange services.

The final bill does not give states a major role in the process
of approving interLATA long distance entry by the Bell

companies, and restricts the states' ability to require
intraLATA toll dialing parity.

The bill immediately lets a Bell company provide long distance
service between points outside its region, as well as
"incidental" interLATA long-distance connections used for its
other services such as cellular or video.

No FCC or state approval is required.

For authorizing Bell interLATA long- distance within the region,
the bill places the decision in the hands of the FCC, which must
find that Bell entry is in the public interest.

A Bell company can apply for in-region authority immediately;
the FCC has 90 days to decide.  The FCC can grant permission on
a state-by-state basis or region wide.

For each state, the applicant Bell company must show that at
least one facilities-based local exchange competitor is
operating in at least one city in the state.

The applicant must also show that it has made interconnection
available to competitors, offers nondiscriminatory access to
poles and conduits, and has unbundled local loops, interoffice
local transport and local switching.

The Bell also must demonstrate its willingness to offer services
for resale, provide reciprocal compensation and offer
competitors access to "911" services, directory assistance,
local operator call completion services, and white pages
directory listings.

Also, the Bell must offer number portability either by a state-
approved interim system or through full portability once the FCC
has issuesd the rules.

If after 10 months the Bell company has seen no local competitor
express serious interest in taking service under the state-
approved local interconnection provisions for a particular
state, or had only a taker that negotiated in bad faith, the
Bell can self-certify compliance with the competitive checklist
for that state.

The FCC must consult with the Department of Justice (DOJ) on a
Bell company's in-region interLATA application and must give
"substantial weight" to the DOJ's view, but the final FCC
decision does not have to conform to the DOJ opinion.

The bill does not permit a state to impose mandatory intraLATA
dialing parity on a Bell company until the telco enters the
interLATA long-distance business.

Single-LATA states, however, are exempt from this provision, as
are states that acted during or before December 1995.

Dialing parity, already in place in interLATA long-distance,
means the ability to place a call on a competing carrier's
network by dialing the same number of digits as needed to use
the incumbent carrier's network.

In other provisions, the bill also repeals a federal restriction
on the nation's 14 largest multistate electric utility
companies, which are regulated by a 1935 federal holding company
act that kept them from entering the telecom business.

These companies must establish a separate telecom subsidiary
that must obtain market entry permission from the FCC.

The parent electric utility cannot sell facilities or other
assets to the telecom unit without state approval.

All affiliate transactions between the parent and the subsidiary
are subject to audit by the state commissions, which can inspect
the books of parent and subsidiary alike.  The utility's telecom
subsidiary cannot issue its own stock or debt.  Nor can the
parent utility mortgage its operations to finance its telecom
operation.

The parent utility must also file reports with the FCC regarding
capitalization of the telecom venture.

The final federal bill allows a Bell company into manufacturing,
by means of a separate subsidiary, as soon as it is allowed to
provide interLATA long-distance.  A Bell operating company
cannot discriminate in any way in favor of the manufacturing
affiliate or its products.

For four years after enactment, the bill requires Bell
electronic publishing to be through a fully separate subsidiary
with its own marketplace identity.

The bill also bans all Bell companies other than Ameritech from
entering the alarm monitoring business for five years.
Ameritech already owns an alarm monitoring company, but would be
prohibited from acquiring any additional alarm companies for
five years.

The bill's sections on cable TV aim to give cable the
flexibility and profitability to compete against local telcos.

It deregulates cable rates for "upper tier" services at the
earlier of March 1999 or the date when "effective competition"
exists in a market, such as from a telco's video programming
services.

Small cable operators, those with fewer than 1 percent of all
U.S. cable subscribers, are rate deregulated immediately.

Until rates are deregulated, cable rate complaints to the FCC
can be made only by the local franchising authority.  And that
authority can't complain unless it has received subscriber
complaints within the first 90 days after a rate increase.

While retaining current federal regulations for wireless cable,
pure common carrier video systems and telco-owned cable TV
systems, the bill creates a new category called "open video
systems" where the transmission provider can own some of the
programming content.

Such open systems must leave one-third of the transmission
capacity open to other content providers.

Such systems are exempt from local franchise fees, but may be
assessed a local tax in lieu of the franchise fee.

The FCC has six months to write the rules governing this new
category of open video systems, and will decide telco
applications seeking this type of regulation.

Telcos under the bill cannot have more than a 10 percent
interest in a cable system in their service areas unless the FCC
issues a waiver.

Exceptions from this rule are made if the cable system serves a
rural area of under 35,000 population, or the telco itself has
below $100 million in annual revenues and the cable system has
less than 20,000 subscribers, or the cable system serves fewer
than 10 percent of the households in the telco's service area.

The bill also allows TV broadcasters to buy cable TV systems and
narrows sharply the grounds for the FCC to turn down renewal of
a broadcaster's license.  It also loosens current limits on how
many radio and TV stations one entity can own in the nation's 50
largest markets.

The bill also prohibits transmission of indecent as well as
obscene material over electronic networks under penalty of a
$100,000 fine and up to 10 years in jail.

And it requires TV manufacturers to include a special chip in
sets so that parents can program the TV to block display of
shows that carry high violence content ratings.

As a concession to opponents, the bill calls for expedited
judicial review of these provisions, meaning any appeals will go
directly from the federal district court to the U.S. Supreme
Court.

CALIF. PUC KICKS OFF LOCAL COMPETITION IN $7 BILLION MARKET

The California Public Utility Commission (PUC) last week kicked
off local exchange competition in the nation's largest local
telecom marketplace as it implemented rules for the 31 companies
authorized late last month to compete for    $7 billion in local
exchange revenues from 15 million access lines.

The PUC rules for open competition are similar to rules proposed
in July 1995 when the PUC began accepting certification
applications.

Although competition is now legal for all switched and non-
switched local services, it will be at least a few months before
the new entrants can actually begin advertising for customers
and delivering competitive service.

During the interim, new competitors will be negotiating
interconnection terms with incumbent telcos Pacific Bell and GTE
California, as well as preparing tariffs or price lists for
their services.

For the first year, terminating compensation will be addressed
through the bill-and-keep method, where the originating network
keeps all the charges for a local call.

The rules also protect consumers against unfair business
practices, for disclosure of rates and terms of service, and for
resolving complaints.

The PUC rules require all local providers to interconnect with
"911" answering points, and to the state telephone relay system
for the handicapped.

New providers also must offer a lifeline rate, and must provide
customers with a written confirmation of each sale in the same
language as the original sale was made.

The companies certified as local exchange competitors include
GTE California and Pacific Bell, which now are authorized to
compete for local exchange customers in each others' service
areas.

The others authorized to provide competitive local phone
services include:  Advantage Communications, Associated Group
Inc., AT&T, five local units of Brooks Fiber Inc., Cable Plus
Company, Century Telecom, Continental Telecom, Electric
Lightwave Inc., Fiber Data Systems, GST Lightwave, GST Pacific
Lightwave, GTE Intelligent Network Services, ICG Access
Services, Info-Tech Communications.

Also, Linkatel Pacific, MCImetro, MFS Intellenet, NewTelco,
Nextlink, Pac-West Telecom, three local units of Teleport
Communications Group, Viacom Communications and Winstar
Wireless.

The rules also protect consumers against unfair business
practices, for disclosure of rates and terms of service, and for
resolving complaints.

In addition to its interconnection, unbundling and public safety
requirements, the PUC also has expanded its bans against the
unlawful practice of "slamming" (unauthorized changes to the
presubscribed carrier) to include unauthorized changes in local
exchange provider.

Also, all local providers are prohibited from "redlining," or
designating certain neighborhoods as low priority for service
installations or repairs.

In a related action, the PUC says it will seek a bill in the
1996 California state legislature to allow implementation of a
state universal service fund that will subsidize companies
serving high-cost areas.

The PUC's proposed universal service support system calls for
giving customers in high-cost areas a phone bill credit for the
difference between what they pay and what it costs their local
provider to serve them.

The local telecom provider will be compensated from the
universal service fund.  Any local provider would be able to
receive payments from the fund, provided it is willing to serve
all the customers in an area.

Instead of traditional cost studies, the PUC proposes
determining the costs of local service through a proxy formula
based on population, terrain, climate, technology and loop
lengths.

If enabling legislation is passed, the PUC in June plans to
define the universal service entitlement, establish the revenue
source for the universal service fund, identify the high-cost
areas eligible for subsidy, designate the reference rates, and
prescribe a standard format for notifying customers about
services and rates.

SEVEN OTHER STATES TAKE STEPS ON THE ROAD TO LOCAL COMPETITION

California is not the only state with action in local
competition.  Colorado, Ohio, Michigan, Nebraska, Maryland,
Virgina and Illinois have seen movement on local competition
issues.

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) last week began a
series of evidentiary hearings, that will last until March, on
proposed rules for local exchange telephone competition.

Hearings will continue Jan. 12, 25 and 26; on each Thursday and
Friday in February, and March 7 and 8.  A proposed order is
expected around the first week in April.  The PUC must issue a
final order by May 31 in order for the rules to take effect July
1, as required under the state's 1995 local competition law.

A working group convened last June to find consensus on local
competition came to agreements on numbering portability and most
aspects of "911" provisioning, but on other local competition
issues was able only to outline alternative positions of the
major interest groups, which will be addressed during the
hearings.

Also figuring in the hearings will be public concern aired in a
series of public forums held around the state last fall.

Some issues raised in all 16 public sessions included concerns
that effective statewide local competition is an unrealistic
goal, and that less-wealthy or thinly populated areas will
suffer from diminished investment and attention in a competitive
market.

Rural residents were concerned that advanced telecom services
won't reach smaller communities, impairing their economic
development.

Many state residents recognized that the current definitions of
basic telephone service are 10 years behind technology, but most
don't want to pay for advanced capabilities until they are ready
to make  use of such services.

The forums showed most people recognize the need for a strong
government watchdog agency to police a competitive telecom
markeplace.

The forums also showed most people support the idea of a state
fund to preserve universal service, but that a sizeable minority
oppose any subsidized phone service rates.

Cincinnati Bell has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to void the
local exchange competition decisions of the Ohio Public
Utilities Commission, on grounds that the PUC exceeded its
statutory authority in approving local competition.

The telco contends that current law did not give the PUC the
right to issue the competitive local exchange certificate
granted to Time Warner Communications

in October for the 37 Ohio counties where Time Warner cable
systems operate, nor to certify any of the other local
competitors approved since then.

Under Cincinnati Bell's interpretation, the state legislature
must first pass enabling legislation giving the PUC the explicit
right to approve local competition.

Cincinnati Bell and other telcos previously asked the PUC to
reverse itself on authorizing local competition, but were
refused; Cincinnati Bell said its court appeal is the next step
provided by law.

In Virginia, MFS Communications became the first company to seek
switched basic exchange authority from the Corporation
Commission under a 1995 state law that allowed full local
competition as of Jan. 1.

MFS said it plans to offer one-stop-shopping for local and toll
services to smaller businesses in local exchanges of Bell
Atlantic and GTE.  MFS already provides non-switched services in
Richmond and Northern Virginia.

The commission has 180 days to rule on certification
applications.  The commission also is continuing to work on
local competition rules, with comments on resale issues due
March 1 and comments on universal service support due April 1.

AT&T has asked the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) for
authority to provide residential and business local service
statewide.

AT&T initially plans to resell local services of Bell Atlantic
but eventually wants to operate its own local exchange
facilities.

Before AT&T begins business operations, however, the company
said Maryland regulators must establish unrestricted resale and
cost-based wholesale prices, and implement interconnection
principles that guarantee access to other providers' networks on
fair and reasonable terms.

The Maryland PSC last week adopted some important rules for
implementing local competition in that state.

The commission established one of the lowest interconnection
rates in the country - a half-cent per minute.  This is far
below the 2.1 cents interim rate established more than a year
ago.

The commission rules also require interim numbering portability,
and require all providers to offer access to "911" services.

Under the rules, local competitors will be able to define their
own local calling areas.  They will not have to use the calling
areas established by Bell Atlantic.

Meanwhile, AT&T in Illinois has asked the Commerce Commission to
require Ameritech Illinois to offer deeper local resale
discounts comparable to the resale discounts that exist in the
long-distance business.

AT&T, which has been authorized in Illinois as a local exchange
provider, has been unable to negotiate a  satisfactory resale
agreement with Ameritech and wants the commission to impose more
favorable resale terms.

AT&T contends the 6 percent to 8 percent discounts offered in
Ameritech's wholesale local tariffs are insufficient to allow
AT&T to make money.  AT&T contended local wholesale rates for
resale should run closer to the 33 percent to 50 percent resale
discounts that AT&T says prevail in the long-distance business.

Also in Illinois, the Commerce Commission has approved a
petition by an affiliate of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems
(SBMS) to sell wireline local services under the Cellular One
brand name that is used for cellular service.

The authority granted to SBMS Illinois Services Inc., allows it
to offer wireline local services alongside existing cellu-

lar services in the Chicago LATA.  The company will be filing
its wireline local exchange tariffs soon.

SBMS also is authorized as a wireline provider in New York,
where it operates in Buffalo and Rochester under the Cellular
One name.  The company is eying Massachusetts, Maryland and
Washington, D.C., where it already operates cellular systems.

Under the FCC waiver that allows SBMS to bundle cellular and
wireline services outside the Southwestern Bell region, the
wireline local services are handled through a separate corporate
entity that shares facilties, systems, personnel and management
with the cellular operation.

In Michigan, an Ameritech business unit, formed to provide local
exchange services and interexchange services once the federal
interLATA restrictions are lifted, has withdrawn its application
before the Michigan PSC for authority to provide local services
in Grand Rapids and Detroit (STRR Sept. 21, 1995).

Ameritech Communications Inc. (ACI) asked the commission to
dismiss its application without prejudice, saying it did not
want to pursue the matter at this time.

ACI had anticipated providing services either under terms of a
trial interLATA waiver pending before Judge Harold Greene, or
under the federal telecom legislation.  ACI planned to target
customers who prefer one-stop shopping for an integrated package
of local and long-distance services.

The ACI certification application had raised difficult questions
about what kinds of state regulatory safeguards are required for
a traditional telephone company who is both a local competitor
and the local incumbent in the same city.

The Nebraska PSC has opened a rulemaking with the goal of
implementing full local exchange competition in 1997.

The PSC's goals are to begin certification of switched basic
exchange competitors by the start of 1997, with competitors to
begin operation in switched services by July 1997.

The PSC has proposed several conditions that must be met before
local markets become fully competitive.

Those include reasonable local rates, provision of full
intraLATA toll dialing parity, provision of local numbering
portability, and a support system to preserve universal service
in a competitive environment.  A procedural schedule will be
developed soon.

Nebraska allows partial local competition in private lines and
other non-switched local services, but up to now has not opened
the switched local services.

CARRIER TO BE INVESTIGATED

The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has decided to
take a more aggressive approach against slamming by keeping
carriers out of the state's markets who appear unfit to operate
or likely to operate illegally.

Accordingly, the PUC's safety and enforcement division has
recommended that the PUC reject a petitition by EqualNet
Communications for authority to provide intrastate interexchange
service in California.

According to the division, EqualNet should not be allowed into
California because it appears to be using deceptive and
misleading marketing practices, including slamming, which is the
unauthorized switching of a customer's presubscribed long
distance carrier.

In addition, said the division, EqualNet misrepresents itself as
being affiliated with AT&T in order to induce customers to
change.

During 1995, the PUC received 110 complaints against EqualNet
and, added the enforcement division, the company has been the
subject of slamming complaints in Illinois, Kansas and North
Carolina.

PRICE REGULATION REVAMPED

The California PUC has decided to freeze the rates of Pacific
Bell and GTE California through 1998.

For Pac Bell, the freeze takes effect immediately, but GTE will
have to make one final price adjustment under the old indexing
formula in 1996.  GTE rates will then be frozen for 1997 and
1998.

The two telcos had petitioned the PUC to eliminate the price-cap
indexing formula used to regulate rates under California's
hybrid system of price and earnings regulation for its big
telcos.

The formula pegs annual price adjustments to the gross domestic
product price index minus a 5 percent productivity factor.  With
the low inflation of recent years, the telcos have had to make
substantial rate cuts each year.

Rather than setting a productivity offset that is less than
inflation, which would have resulted in rate increases, the PUC
made the productivity offset equal to inflation.  This in effect
freezes rates.

TOLL PLAN WON'T BE DELAYED

The Florida Public Service Commission has denied motions from
interexchange carriers to delay implementation of a BellSouth
message-rate plan for intraLATA toll pricing.

The plan, to go into effect Jan. 15, sets a flat price of 25
cents for a residential intraLATA toll call, regardless of
distance, duration or time of day.  Business customers will pay
10 cents the first minute and  6 cents per additional minute.

The plan, said BellSouth, will reduce its intraLATA toll
revenues by around $25 million.

AT&T, MCI and other interexchange carriers wanted the starting
date delayed so the competitive implications of the plan could
be more fully explored.

VIDEO INTERESTS FIGHT TAX

Cable and satellite video providers have filed a suit in the
Illinois courts to overturn a Chicago city amusement tax applied
to video gross receipts.

The video companies say the 7 percent tax on gross revenues is
unconstitutional because it taxes a selected mode of electronic
speech while exempting other equivalent electronic channels of
expression such as TV broadcasting.

The tax also allegedly discriminates against cable subscribers
by assessing them extra to fund city services that benefit the
entire population.

The plaintiffs also contend the city tax, if upheld, would set a
dangerous precedent for local taxation of online information
services, home shopping networks and other electronic
information media.

Further, the cable companies argue the tax is double taxation of
cable by the city, since there is no credit given for the local
franchise taxes cable companies already pay.

COMPETITION, CRIME, PSC PRACTICES DOMINATE '95 STATE PHONE LAWS

Legislation addressing telephone competition, telephone crime,
and state regulatory practices and structures dominated state
lawmaking in 1995.

Of the 49 states that met in session in 1995 to consider close
to 1,000 proposed telecom-related bills, 38 states produced new
telecom laws, with legislation on competition, crime and
commission structures and practices accounting for 53 of the 92
measures that made it onto state lawbooks this year.

State legislatures in 1995 produced an unprecedented outpouring
of legislation relating to telephone competition and
deregulation; these closely related topics together accounted
for 26 of the 92 state laws passed.

But telephone crime and state regulatory structures also were a
focus for strong legislative activity in 1995.  These two areas
together accounted for another 27 new telecom laws in 1995.

Other areas that got significant legislative attention in the
1995 legislatures included "911" emergency dialing (eight laws),
physical telecom facilities and infrastructures (eight laws) and
telecom taxation (seven laws).

There also was a scattering of state legislation passed on
consumer protection, extended area service, privacy, special
needs of the handicapped, universal service and abuses by
telemarketers.  Although in past years each of these topics
would account for a significant number of state laws, in 1995
these areas collectively accounted for just 17 laws passed.

In the area of competition and deregulation, 13 states passed
major new laws that effectively abolished their telephone
companies' legal local exchange monopolies, threw all local
services open to competition, and allowed more lenient
regulation of competitors.

Another 10 states enacted lesser measures affecting the scope
and direction of ongoing competition and deregulation activity.

Many observers attribute the flood of major state competition
laws in 1995 to the highly preemptive federal telecom
legislation that almost made it through the 103d Congress in the
fall of 1994.

That 1994 legislation would have forced open all closed telecom
markets while preempting outright many aspects of state
authority in the local exchange, and would have made the
remainder of the state jurisdiction into a creature dominated by
the FCC.  That legislation passed the House and likely would
have passed the Senate if not for a last-minute lobbying logjam
thrown up by local exchange and interexchange carriers as they
fought over the issue of Bell company entry into the interLATA
long-distance market.

The strong support for telecom reform and competition in the
103d Congress foreshadowed the drive to pass a telecom bill in
the 104th Congress.  State interests hoped that a strong state
movement to accommodate competition would head off the
preemption "hawks" in Congress.  The rush of successful state
competition bills did help the states' cause, but perhaps not to
the extent the states had expected.

Although they vary greatly in their details, the major
competition laws en-acted in 1995 by Colorado, Florida, Georgia,
Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming have several
general attributes in common.

All specify explicit dates in 1995 or in 1996 for the start of
wide open local exchange competition, require certification of
local competitors, permit lenient regulation of new local
entrants, direct state regulators to develop local competition
and interconnection rules, and require universal service
support.

The laws of Florida, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming shield their smaller
telephone companies from local competition for time periods
ranging from three to 10 years.

These major state competition laws generally permit immediate
local service resale, except in Texas and Florida where local
resale is restricted while federal interLATA restrictions on
Bell and GTE remain in effect.

Except for Hawaii, these major laws generally allow regulators
flexibility to adopt price-based alternatives to rate-of-return
regulation for incumbent telephone companies.  Hawaii's law bars
telco price regulation until effective local competition is
established.

However, the laws in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa,
Minnesota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming prescribe explicit
structures for price-based regulation of incumbent telcos that
state regulators must follow.

In addition to the sweeping laws described above, other 1995
laws related to competition and deregulation include a
Connecticut law that sets definite procedural deadlines for the
local competition rulemakings required by the 1994 law that
legalized local competition.

A California law allows regulators the option to control
competitive market entry through registration instead of
certification.  Another California law requires regulators to
find that mergers and acquisitions won't impair competition and
that benefits of the deal will be split evenly between
shareholders and ratepayers.

Michigan enacted a law that simplifies competitive market entry,
mandates local interconnection, deregulates competitive services
and all rate reductions, and requires arbitration of minor
disputes, among other provisions.  This law replaces an expiring
1991 telecom regulation act.

Bucking the pro-competition trend, an Idaho law and a provision
within the 1995 Michigan law prohibit state imposition of
mandatory intraLATA toll dialing parity  requirements on a telco
that is prohibited by federal edict from intraLATA long-distance
service.

But in a direct challenge to federal authorities, the Michigan
law also requires Ameritech and GTE to begin intrastate
interLATA service in 1996.

Idaho deregulated telecom resellers, while North Dakota
deregulated payphones and terminal equipment.  Wisconsin and
North Dakota increased the maximum line size of small telcos
eligible for deregulation.

State commissions in Washington and Oregon gained legal
authority to adopt price-based alternative regulation systems
for telephone companies.

Bucking the pro-competition trend, an Idaho law and a provision
within the 1995 Michigan law prohibit state imposition of
mandatory intraLATA toll dialing parity requirements on a telco
that is prohibited by federal edict from providing interLATA
long-distance service.

After competition, a major area of state legislative activity in
1995 was phone crime, either where the phone service provider is
the victim of crime, or where telephone service is an instrument
for commission of other crimes.

State legislatures in 1995 took aim at theft of telecom services
in response to industry complaints that up to 40 percent of
cellular airtime is being stolen, that some 5 percent of the
households in a typical urban cable market are stealing cable
programming, and that present penalties are too weak to be
effective in deterring theft of phone, cellular and cable
services.

Phone crime laws in Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts,
North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington expanded previous law on
service theft to cover thefts of cellular and cable TV services.

These laws also increased penalties for all thefts of telecom
services and for enabling others to steal service, in many cases
upgrading the crime from a misdemeanor to a felony.

For example, Arizona's new theft-of-service law not only makes
phone service theft a felony.  It also denies parole or other
early release from confinement to any persons convicted of
stealing or enabling a theft where the crime involved more than
$100,000 worth of stolen telecom or utility service; they must
serve every day of the prescribed sentence.

A Massachusetts law sets the maximum penalty for theft of
telecom service at a $30,000 fine or 15 years in prison, while
an Oregon law sets the maximum penalty for stealing cellular
service, or enabling a cellular service theft, by means of an
unlawful "cloned" cellular phone at a $200,000 fine and 10 years
in prison.

Many of these new state phone crime laws also allow victims of
service theft to sue convicted perpetrators for civil damages.
In Washington state, a repeat offender now can be sued for
treble damages under the state's Criminal Profiteering Act.

Other new state laws addressing criminal uses of phones include
a Maine law allowing prosecutors to subpoena telephone
companies' customer call detail records where phone usage is
materially related to a criminal investigation.

A New Mexico law makes it a crime to use the telephone to
perpetrate telemarketing frauds, while Oregon and Virginia make
it a crime to call a "911" center for any purpose other than
reporting an actual emergency.

Georgia expands the crime of telephone harassment to include
"silent" harassing calls and phone calls intended to incite
minors to violence.

Legislation affecting the ways state commissions conduct their
business included laws in Tennessee and Texas that restructured
the state utility regulatory system.

Tennessee abolished the elected Public Service Commission,
effective July 1, 1996, and created a new appointed body, the
Tennessee Regulatory Authority, to take over regulation of
telecommunications and electric utilities; jurisdiction over
other regulated industries goes to other state agencies.

The new regulatory body is nonpartisan, and its members are
forbidden to engage in partisan politics while in office.

Texas passed a law recodifying the state utility regulatory act
into separate sections for telecommunications and other
utilities, so as to permit a reorganization of the Public
Utility Commission that structurally separates regulation of
telecommunications from regulation of electric companies and
other utilities.

The purpose is to separate telephone policy-making from that for
electric utilities as these respective industries become more
competitive.  Passage of the recodification law was required
before the legislature could pass the 1995 telephone competition
law.

Laws in Kansas and Oregon allow regulators to protect the
confidentiality of sensitive utility data that otherwise would
have to be disclosed under open records laws.

A New Mexico law allows regulators to levy administrative fines
on telecom providers for regulatory violations, while a Rhode
Island law requires establishment of regulatory fees for telecom
filings made by new types of provider.

Another Rhode Island law allows regulators to assess cable TV
companies for the costs of reviewing mergers, acquisitions and
other transfers of control, while a South Dakota law requires
all telephone exchange sales to be approved by the state
commission.

State lawmaking on infrastructure and phone facilities includes
laws in California and Connecticut, and provisions in the
telecom competition laws of Florida and Texas, all intended to
encourage the spread of advanced telecom facilities for distance
learning and/or telemedicine applications.

Laws in California and Nevada assert localities' rights to
assess fees on facilities-based telecom service providers for
use of public rights-of-way, although the Nevada law puts a cap
on the fees or annual fee increases localities can impose.

A Maryland law establishes a three-year pilot program to
encourage use of telecommuting by government agencies, while a
Massachusetts law authorizes a $75 million state bond issue to
finance a 12-year program to link all trial courts, police and
public safety agencies, and prosecution and defense attorneys to
a statewide computer network for judicial information, case
processing and trial management.

In legislation affecting "911" emergency dialing services, a
Washington state law requires shared tenant service systems and
school phone systems to provide "911" location identification by
1997 for each phone connected to the system.

An Oregon law requires "911' districts with multiple answering
centers to consolidate them into a single location by 2001,
while another Oregon "911" law allows "911" districts to sell
bonds to finance system improvements, with voter approval, and
levy a tax to cover debt service.

In telecom taxation, Virginia and Pennsylvania passed laws
allowing local governments to levy a 5 percent video gross
receipts tax in lieu of a local franchise fee on new video
service suppliers, such as telco video dial-tone services, that
would compete against the incumbent cable TV company.

As introduced, these bills would have permitted local gross
receipts taxation of providers who sell TV programming through
home satellite dishes and other forms of wireless video
programming distribution that do not use terrestrial rights-of-
way.

But in the face of lobbying by the direct-to-home satellite
industry, the tax bills were amended to exempt program suppliers
who use satellites and other wireless distribution systems.

Other noteworthy state telecom laws passed in 1995 include
Georgia and Arizona measures that extend wiretap protections to
include cellular and/or cordless phones.

Nebraska established a program to distribute adaptive telephone
equipment to qualifying low-income handicapped persons.

Oregon capped the phone bill surcharge that supports subsidized
lifeline phone services at an amount sufficient to cover six
months of demand, while raising by a dime the cap on the
surcharge that supports the state telecom relay service for the
deaf.

A Tennessee law requires telephone companies to provide county-
wide toll free calling by 1996, while a Virginia law permits
county-wide toll free calling for counties where the municipal
governments and a majority of affected subscribers support it.

California and Connecticut enacted consumer protection laws to
combat the unlawful practice of "slamming" - switching a
presubscribed interexchange carrier without the customer's
authorization.

Another California law prohibits telephone companies from
billing for calls placed to 800-number information services that
do not comply with FCC subscription regulations.

A Georgia law requires that printed solicitations for inclusion
in classified telephone advertising directories must clearly
state that the notice is not a bill.

One 1995 bill still hanging in there is a measure in Oklahoma to
authorize all forms of local exchange competition and permit
alternative price regulation.

It was introduced late in Oklahoma's 1995 session.  While
introduced too late to win passage in 1995, the bill managed to
garner enough support to be carried over to the 1996 session.

DEMOCRATS, BELLS SCORE ON TELECOM BILL - WHICH DEBUTS THIS WEEK

Casey Stengel would be proud.  Turns out Stengel's axiom "it
ain't over 'til it's over" applies as aptly to telecom reform
legislation as it does to baseball games.

Late last month, Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., chairman of the
House-Senate conference committee on the bill, thought he and
key committee members had struck a compromise that gave
concessions to the Clinton administration in order to avert a
threatened veto.  But when conservative Republicans heard about
the terms, they rebelled, forcing Pressler to call his deal just
a "framework agreement" and scuttling plans to bring the bill to
a pre-Christmas vote.

The new uncertainty left the bill vulnerable to more changes.
The latest draft of the bill is not public but a copy obtained
by Telco Business Report sister publication FCC Report shows
changes already have been made to Pressler's framework deal.
One of them is the removal of language that would have kept the
Bell companies from joint-marketing long-distance and local
service until a year after their local competitors were doing
so.

But, this time, it looks the deal will stick.  The Senate
Republican leadership is tacitly endorsing the new draft bill
and a key House Republican, Rep. Thomas Bliley of Virginia, is
calling on colleagues to vote for the revised measure.

Recognizing this, key sides in the yearlong battle have
curtailed their lobbying.  Jim Smith, president of the
Competitive Telecommunications Association, said his group of
local competitors doubts it will get the conference committee to
reverse itself and toughen a condition on Bell long-distance
entry.

At the United States Telephone Association, chief lobbyist Larry
Clinton said his group has given up hope of getting the
conference to undo a change to the bill that lets states use
rate of return regulation for competitive services.  The
provision was excised early last month by the conference
committee, which is producing a compromise version of the
telecom bills passed this summer by the House and Senate.

Another measure of how the deal is jelling:  Key factions are
releasing statements endorsing the new draft bill, even though
it has not been released.  Supporters include the
Telecommunications Industry Association, the Alliance for
Competitive Communications - the Bell's lobbying group - and the
National Association of Broadcasters.

The USTA and Comptel haven't issued statements, but Clinton said
he expects the USTA "will be OK" on the bill and Smith said his
group will find the bill "minimally acceptable" as long as it's
not changed more.

The heavy-hitters are checking their swings because they've
chalked up plenty of runs in this the last inning of bill's ball
game.  In recent days, the Bells have won the right to keep one
of their brethren, Ameritech, from expanding its alarm-
monitoring operations (TBR Dec. 18. 1995) beyond the company's
current holdings.  Ameritech, the only Bell the bill lets into
alarm monitoring - by "grandfathering" the company's current
holdings - now cannot expand its alarm monitoring presence until
after the five-year wait the bill imposes on all of the Bells
seeking to get into that line of business.

Ameritech's next alarm monitoring move was expected to be
outside of its territory.

The nation's 14 largest utility companies also scored by
convincing the conferees to let these federally regulated
utilities offer telecom services.

But the latest draft of the conference report - in effect, the
new telecom bill - shows that the biggest runs were scored by
the Democrats.  These include addition of a role for the
Department of Justice (DOJ) in assessing the long-distance entry

applications of the Bell companies.  Although the role is only
advisory, as the Senate bill originally offered, the change was
one of three called for by the White House when the
administration was threatening a veto.

Another recent change is adoption of the House bill's 35-percent
cap on the size of national audience that any one TV station
chain may accumulate.  The 35-percent cap, a part of the House
telecom bill added by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., addresses the
"media concentration" aspect of the bill, another prime White
House worry.

Those and other changes were added to the bill after a meeting
Dec. 13 between Pressler and Bliley and the two top Democrats on
the conference committee, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan and Sen.
Ernest Hollings of South Carolina.

For his part, sources say Hollings was able to convince Pressler
to remove from the bill entirely all language that would have
lifted the current 25-percent cap on foreign investment in FCC
licensees.

The next day, Pressler and Bliley were set to sell their deal to
House and Senate Republicans.  But that morning's newspapers
reported that Vice President Al Gore had endorsed the bill on
behalf of the Clinton administration, the entity most
conservative Republicans despise.

That error cost Pressler his run.  He was forced to call his
deal a "framework" - not an agreement - when key conferees,
including Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, the chairman of the House
telecom subcommittee and a key drafter of the House bill,
rebelled.  Fields released a statement saying, "There was no
deal" with the White House and then left to spend the holidays
with his family in Texas.

Fields likely will have to back down and vote for the conference
report, but at the moment all eyes are on House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga.  Rather than endorse the new bill, Gingrich has
called "time out," advising House Republicans to hold off on
voting on the conference report until after Congress returns to
session.  His staff said the speaker had not yet reviewed the
new language to see if it was sufficiently deregulatory.

Besides the new role for the DoJ in deciding Bell entry into
long-distance, other key aspects of the draft version of the
report are:

*  "Grandfathering" states that, as of Dec. 1995, require the
Bells to offer dialing parity,

*  Expedited judicial review of the bill's "cyberporn"
restrictions, and

*  Inclusion of the Senate bill's requirement that discounted
telecom service be offered to schools and libraries.  Now,
however, that requirement is part of the definition of universal
service itself, meaning that providers can seek compensation for
their loss via the universal service subsidy.

The DoJ's role on Bell long-distance entry will come as part of
the FCC's imposition of a public-interest test on Bell long-
distance applications, a concept taken from the Senate telecom
bill.  The FCC must give "substantial weight" to the DOJ's
assessment, but that assessment will not be decisive in itself,
the new version of the bill states.

The Pressler compromise also requires a Bell first to have a
facilities-based competitor in place - as the House wanted -and
give the FCC the power to test whether there is "actual and
demonstrable" local competition in the Bell's local market.  But
the Pressler framework agreement eliminates language adopted by
the conferees just days before that would have required Bell
long-distance entry to be predicated on the Bell facing
competition throughout each of its states, not just in one city
in each state.

The bill adopts the House bill's requirement that a Bell first
seek long-

distance entry by applying to its state commissions.  To be
certified by a state, a Bell must have met the bill's checklist
of unbundling and open access requirements and have a
facilities-based competitor in place in at least one location.
Gone is the language requiring a state to determine whether
local competition is prevalent "to an extent that demonstrates
that the telephone exchange market is competitive."

The bill does not require the Bells to provide dialing parity
until they enter the long-distance business, unless they operate
in a state that has only one LATA or which required the service
as of December 1995.  Dialing parity, already available in long-
distance, means the ability to place a local call on a competing
carrier's network by dialing the same number of digits as needed
by the local carrier's network.

The bill bans making indecent material available over electronic
networks, a hewing to the Senate bill's approach.  The bill's
penalties for sending "cyberporn" - a fine up to $100,000 and up
to 10 years in jail - are also the same as the Senate bill's,
but the draft bill uses the test of whether such material is
indecent, not the "harmful to minors" standard that has been
upheld by federal courts.

As a concession to opponents, the bill calls for expedited
judicial review of this provision, meaning that legal challenges
to the law will, if appealed, go directly from the federal
district court to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Contrary to the House version of the telecom bill, the draft
agreement has no language banning the FCC from regulating the
Internet or letting the FCC selectively lift the 25-percent cap
on foreign ownership of FCC licensees.  But these changes may be
subject to change.  The Senate appears willing to accept
Pressler's view that the latter matter should be dealt with via
separate legislation - he says a bill will be introduced this
spring - but some in the House are still pressing their fight to
return their foreign ownership language to the bill.

In the Senate, Pressler believes he has "a good majority" but
his compromise has won an ardent foe, fellow conferee Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.  A source with McCain's office told FCC Report,
"My boss and others were beside themselves" when they heard
about the framework agreement.  The deal, he said, was worked
out behind closed doors, with the Hollings, the ranking
Democratic Senator on the conference committee, carrying water
for the White House.

McCain voted against the Senate bill when it came to the floor
and now his staff hints he will use his considerable power as a
senator to slow the conference report's progress in the Senate
until he wins his revisions.

AVOID PROFIT LOSS BY CREATING A SAFETY NET FOR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

Telcos can avoid millions of dollars in profit loss by
monitoring errors in their accounts payable.

A new trend is developing whereby telcos and other
telecommunications companies are hiring auditing services to
double-check their books against overpayments, double payments
and missed sales.  Industrywide, telecom companies are estimated
to lose approximately $10 million to $20 million in profits due
to such accounting problems.

"In this industry, frequent corporate acquisitions and
divestitures, expanding geographic territories, numerous local
vendor relationships and multiple payables offices increase the
likelihood of profit loss," Ronald Loder, president and CEO of
Loder, Drew & Associates in

Irvine, Calif., recently told Telco Business Report.  Loder's
company handles such audits for roughly a dozen telcos, several
RBOCs and various telecom firms.

According to Loder, about 35 percent of the nation's Fortune
1,000 companies audit their accounts payable, item by item, to
recover overpaid funds and to establish systems and practices to
help reduce future profit loss.

"Absolutely every single company in the country is going through
a change right now," Loder said.  "And because everything is in
a state of flux, there are lots of accounts payable problems."

BellSouth Telecommunications, for example, had done what it
calls a "billing reconciliation" in which its central office
accounting procedures were reviewed for discrepancies.  The
process is similar to an audit, telco spokesman David Rogers
said, and was done to make sure the company wasn't losing money
through its accounting practices.

"There are no pending plans right now to have the process done
again," Rogers told TBR last week.  "But that doesn't mean there
aren't potential problems.  It's something that always has to be
looked at."

Loder, Drew & Associates provides its auditing services on a
contingency basis.  "We get paid 50 percent of what's
recovered," Loder said.

"And it's not unusual for us to recover $1 million in over-
payments for a telco," he added.  "That equates to $500,000 in
profit, which is tantamount to about $10 million in sales.  For
large or small companies, that's a lot of money."

Loder offers these five tips to ensure accurate accounts
payables:

*     Avoid manual check requests.  These are non-valued
transactions that require repeated attention from your payables
staff and often lead to errors.  "We've conducted more than
2,000 accounts payable audits and have uncovered numerous
payments that never appeared in the client's database because
they were written or logged by hand," Loder said.

*     Never pay from a copy of an invoice.  Loder said this is
the most common cause of double payments.  Vendors - local
equipment companies, network providers, computer programmers -
traditionally mail invoices directly to the central accounts
payable department.  In many cases, they send a copy of the
invoice by fax if they have not received payment after 10 days.
For telco companies that operate in several geographic regions
with multiple local vendors, these double invoices can amount to
hundreds of thousands of overpaid dollars, he said.

*     Be consistent when entering invoice numbers into the
accounts payable system.  Increasing use of advanced accounting
software has left gaping holes in telecom companies' payables
process, Loder explained.  His company's proprietary software,
for example, called Scansearch, cross-references invoices and
payments by vendor, category, product group and geographic
region and identifies errors that would otherwise be missed
without accurate invoice number tracking.  Inconsistent use of
invoice numbers leads to payment lapses, double payments and
over payments.  Be sure, Loder said, that every vendor payment
is directly tied to a specific invoice.

*     Avoid use of blanket purchase orders.  Every payment must
have a corresponding p.o. number and every p.o. number must have
a corresponding payment.  The key to error-free payment,
according to Loder, is careful tracking.  Numbered purchase
orders are essential to an orderly, traceable payables system.

*     Reconcile large vendor accounts frequently.  Loder said
his company's audits and subsequent reports indicate that
frequently reconciled vendor accounts allow for more efficient
cash management, improved vendor relations and accurate invoice-
to-payment tracking.

Accounts payable processing errors are one of the most common
sources of profit leaks within a company, and while "telcos are
very large corporations," Loder said, "they're less likely to
air their dirty laundry.  However, many now realize there are
real savings to be found out there."

IBM ALLIANCE ADVANCES AMERITECH'S DESKTOP SERVICES REACH

Ameritech and IBM have formed an alliance to give both companies
a stronger foothold in the swelling $30 billion desktop
computing market.

 Under terms of the new agreement, signed just before the
Christmas holiday, the telco and IBM will jointly market
integrated voice, data and video managed desktop services and
establish a 24-hour customer service facility to be operated by
Ameritech and IBM's Integrated Systems Solutions Corp (ISSC).
The one-stop center will support integrated voice, data and
video service line with a single phone call.

To achieve their goals, the companies together will provide $400
million during

the next seven years in desktop services to each other.  Both
Ameritech and IBM also stated they envision their alliance
growing during the next several years.

The creation of the alliance is Ameritech's response to the
transformation in

the telecommunications industry, Jack Reich, president of
Ameritech custom business services, said in announcing the
agreement.

"Ameritech is positioning itself to be at the forefront of
helping customers benefit from changes in technology," Reich
said.  "When we searched for the right partner to help us make
it happen, it was clear that IBM, and in particular ISSC, was
the perfect choice."

Ameritech and IBM plan to address the gamut of desktop services,
including telephones, printers, personal computers software,
wiring, local area networks, servers, videoconferencing,
equipment, fax equipment, voice mail, paging and wireless
equipment and technical support.

TIME WARNER ASKS PUCO TO INTERVENE WITH AMERITECH
INTERCONNECTION TALKS

After nearly a year of stale-mate with Ameritech over an
agreement to interconnect their telephone networks, Time Warner
Communications is asking the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(PUCO) to intervene.  Time Warner made the request for PUCO
intervention in its second 60-day report to the commission on
the status of interconnection negotiations with Ameritech and
other incumbent telcos.  The PUCO must approve certain rules
under which telcos will compete before TW enters the market.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS RAISES TELCO'S LARGEST DIVIDEND IN FIVE YEARS

The board of directors just before Christmas raised Ameritech's
quarterly dividend 6 percent to 53 cents per share, or $2.12 on
an annual basis.  This figure represents the largest dividend
increase since 1991 from Ameritech or any of the other six
regional Bell companies.  The increase is Ameritech's 12th
consecutive dividend increase in 12 years.

BELL ATLANTIC 'ONE STEP CLOSER' TO COMMERCIAL VDT IN TOMS RIVER

Bell Atlantic last week came "one step closer" to its goal of
delivering video dialtone (VDT) services to consumers in Toms
River.

Spokesman Harry Mitchell tells Telco Business Report the telco
has just completed hooking up the initial 200 customers who will
test the system for six to eight weeks without paying a monthly
fee.  The telco is about one-third of the way to its goal of
passing 38,000 homes with its all-digital network, according to
Mitchell.  Cost of the buildout is $1,700 per home, or $60
million to $70 million.

Although it is rosy about its VDT progress, the telco is seeing
red over the FCC's recent proposal to deregulate incumbent cable
competitor Adelphia Cable's Tier 1 service in Dover Township,
N.J., where Toms River is located, once Bell Atlantic begins to
provide commercial service there.  Several other telcos,
including the U S West, have filed comments with the FCC
regarding the situation.

TELCO PLANS GROWTH VIA NEW RETAIL BUSINESS ALIGNMENT

Southern New England Telephone aims to leverage its line of
products and services via a new retail business alignment that
seeks to provide customers with one-stop shopping for a variety
of needs.

The restructuring will revamp the telco's current structure of
independent business units, which sees each unit having its own
product development, marketing, and sales and advertising
functions.  SNET's retail operation will evolve into four
customer distribution channels and three product groups.

"This new alignment is another step toward offering customers
what they want: one-stop shopping for innovative packages that
ultimately may include a whole array of wireline, wireless,
information and entertainment services," Daniel Miglio, SNET
chairman and CEO, said.

Texas Agency Reconsiders Policy
For Local Exchange Service Resale 

     The Texas Public Utilities Commission has said it is
reconsidering whether to allow companies holding a "service
provider certificate of operating authority" (SPCOA) also to
offer facilities-based local exchange service.  When granting an
SPCOA to MFS Communications Co., Inc., late last year, the PUC
said it was authorizing MFS to provide service both as a reseller
and as a facilities-based provider (TCR, Nov. 23, 1995).

     At its meeting last week, however, the PUC delayed action on
Teleport Communications Group, Inc.'s application for an SPCOA. 
The commissioners needed time to reconsider whether SPCOA holders
should be allowed to combine resold and facilities-based service,
a PUC spokeswoman said.

     The Texas Legislature last year passed a telecom competition
law (TCR, May 25, 1995) allowing two types of local exchange
authorization:

(1) SPCOAs, which allow companies to resell services and

(2) "Certificates of operating authority" (COAs), which include
network build-out requirements.

     At last week's meeting two commissioners questioned whether
SPCOA holders should be able to provide services over their own
facilities, the spokeswoman said.  The PUC now will review the
legislative history to determine whether lawmakers meant for
SPCOA holders to provide facilities-based service, and it may
listen to tapes of the legislature discussing the issue, she
said.

     The concerns were triggered, in part, by a letter sent to
commissioners last October by two state legislators, who said the
law was not intended to allow SPCOA holders to provide
facilities-based service, the spokeswoman continued.  "At the
time, the commission didn't agree with the letter," she said. 
"But now [the commissioners] want to review that key piece to
this [issue]."

     The commission will address Teleport's application and the
SPCOA issue at a Jan. 24 meeting.  

     It could approve Teleport's application and allow MFS to
move forward, it could remand the issues to an administrative law
judge, or it could decide to study the matter further itself, the
spokeswoman said.

     J. Manning Lee, Senior Regulatory Counsel for Teleport, said
he was "hopeful" that the commission would stick to its initial
decision, which he said would allow end users to reap the
benefits of competition more quickly.  When MFS was granted an
SPCOA and the PUC said the company could combine resold and
facilities-based services, Teleport abandoned its plan to obtain
a COA and applied for an SPCOA instead.

     The SPCOA already granted to MFS "was not disturbed" by the
PUC's action, said Andrew Lipman, Senior Vice President-legal and
regulatory affairs at MFS.  

     "The PUC held unanimously that we could offer
facilities-based service [when it approved MFS' application]" Mr.
Lipman said.  "We've briefed this issue now eight separate
times."  He said the legislation clearly allows SPCOA holders to
resell services and provide facilities-based services and that
the legislative history will support this view.  

     In any event, legislative intentions "are not supposed to
supersede the actual legislation," Mr. Lipman said.  The
legislation was intended to prevent the largest interexchange
carriers from "taking advantage" of the SPCOA, he added.  "The
entire thrust of the legislation is to encourage infrastructure
development."

     The commission spokeswoman said reconsideration of the
matter is related partially to the PUC's rushed schedule for
considering applications.  The law requires the PUC to make
decisions regarding applications within 60 days of receiving
them, and the PUC had to consider several applications that were
submitted soon after the law passed.  

     Meanwhile, the commission has approved LCI International,
Inc.'s application for an SPCOA.  After it files tariffs and
negotiates pricing arrangements with Southwestern Bell Telephone
Co., LCI wants to bundle interexchange services and resold local
exchange services.  LCI has been authorized to provide local
exchange service to business customers in New York and has
applications pending in Illinois, Michigan (TCR, June 22, 1995),
and California (TCR, Sept. 14, 1995).

CLECs Applaud Arizona Agency Staff's 
Proposed Rules for Interconnection

     The staff of the Arizona Corporation Commission has proposed
rules covering interconnection arrangements between local
exchange carriers (LECs) and competitors, bringing enthusiastic
endorsements from competitive local exchange carriers.  The staff
proposal addresses service unbundling, points of interconnection,
mutual compensation arrangements, and number portability.  It
follows the commission's adoption of guidelines for opening local
exchange and intraLATA markets to competition (TCR, Jan. 5, 1995.
p. 9; and July 6, 1995).

     Public hearings on the staff proposal are expected to begin
in March.  The staff would require incumbent LECs to unbundle
network components "considered essential to the provision of
local exchange service."  A LEC would be required to provide
essential services "on the same terms and conditions that it
provides these facilities and services to itself."  Under the
proposal, essential services and features would include, but not
be limited to, the following:

     *    Termination of local and long distance calls;

     *    Interconnection with "911" services; and

     *    Access to numbering resources, dedicated channel
network access connections, and unbundled loops.

     The staff also would require incumbent LECs to provide
nondiscriminatory access to databases, and a mechanism would be
established for competitors to request that additional network
services or facilities be unbundled.  Incumbents would be
required to file tariffs for those services within 30 days of the
effective date of the rules.

     The prices for interconnection services, including access to
databases and other network functions, would be set at the
total-service long-run incremental cost (TSLRIC).  Incumbents
would be required to provide "floor" calculations for the
services "to ensure the avoidance of anticompetitive pricing
practices," the staff said.  In its retail price for each
service, the incumbent would be required to recover "the TSLRIC
of all nonessential--and the imputed prices of all essential--
services, facilities, components, functions or capabilities
provided, whether offered under a tariff or on a private-contract
basis."

     Local and extended area service traffic would be terminated
on a "mutual traffic exchange" or "bill-and-keep" basis for an
interim period of 36 months, allowing carriers to terminate each
others' traffic at no charge.  Other compensation arrangements
could be negotiated between carriers.  If carriers do not agree
on compensation for terminating calls, each carrier would be
required to file a tariff proposing a permanent compensation plan
within 24 months of the rules' effectiveness.  The staff said
charges outlined in such tariffs should not be usage-sensitive.

     Incumbent LECs and competitive carriers would be directed to
negotiate mutually agreeable interconnection points.  Each
carrier would be responsible for its own facilities to the point
of interconnection.  If an agreement cannot be reached, the party
responding to the request would have to notify the commission and
explain why interconnection at the requested point is impossible.

     The staff also proposed that incumbent LECs make number
portability available on an interim basis using existing services
such as call forwarding.  Carriers would be required to file
interim number portability tariffs within 30 days of approval of
the rules.  The commission staff would be required to recommend a
permanent solution by Jan. 31, 1997.

     U S WEST Communications Co. is challenging the state's
competition rules in court, with cases pending in the Arizona
Superior Court (Maricopa County) and the U.S. District Court for
the District of Arizona.  The federal court has stayed the case
until the state court issues a decision, a U S WEST spokesman
said.  No action has been taken in the state court.  

     The legal challenge encompasses the state's competition
rules in their entirety and would include the current
interconnection rule proposal, the spokesman said.  U S WEST
objects to the lack of evidentiary hearings on competition, and
it specifically opposes the bill-and-keep compensation proposal.

     Teleport Communications Group, Inc., applauded the proposal,
particularly the bill-and-keep compensation mechanism. 
"Bill-and-keep is a fair, simple, and competitively neutral
arrangement that enables new local carriers to develop their
networks," said Mike McHale, Teleport's Vice President and
General Manager in Arizona.  But he emphasized that the proposal
requires U S WEST's cooperation in reaching technical
interconnection arrangements.  "We hope U S WEST will be
cooperative in these negotiations," he said.  

     "However, its commitment to competition is questionable
given that it has filed suit against the [commission for its]
pro-competitive rules. . .In that suit, U S WEST claims it has
the right to be the exclusive provider of service for Arizona
customers."

     Meanwhile, Electric Lightwave, Inc., has asked the
commission for authorization to provide a full range of telecom
services.  It plans to provide switched local exchange,
intra-state long distance, and digital point-to-point services at
a variety of speeds, competing "head-to-head" with U S WEST
Communications, Inc., said Brian D. Thomas, ELI's Director-public
policy.

     ELI currently operates a fiber optic network providing
point-to-point, private, high-capacity service in Phoenix, Mr.
Thomas noted.  It probably would offer the new services in
Phoenix initially, with other parts of the state served later, he
added.  Because a state law protects independent telcos from
competition, ELI's application seeks authority to serve only
areas in which U S WEST operates.  The commission is expected to
act on the application in the first half of 1996, ELI said.

CLECs Say 'Phase II' of Md. Competition Rules
Offer 'Favorable' Rates for Interconnection

     In a decision praised immediately by competitive local
exchange carriers (CLECs), the Maryland Public Service Commission
has established interconnection rates, terms, and conditions for
carriers planning to compete in the provision of services to
business end users.  In an order in "Phase II" of its case No.
8584 local exchange competition proceeding, the commission said
that "an essential service such as interconnection should not be
priced as a premium."  CLECs said the rates set by the commission
are "favorable" for promoting competition.  The PSC also outlined
terms for offering unbundled network elements, established an
interim local number portability method, and began a separate
proceeding on universal service issues.

     The PSC authorized local exchange competition in the state
in 1994 when it approved MFS Intelenet, Inc.'s application for
permission to provide local exchange service (TCR, May 12, 1994). 
In the 1994 "Phase I" order in the docket 8584 proceeding, it
established interim rates and terms for reciprocal compensation
for call terminations.  It also ordered Bell Atlantic-Maryland to
interconnect with competing carriers' networks at its tandem and
central office switching facilities.

     In the subsequent Phase II of the proceeding, Bell Atlantic
had proposed a three-part interconnection rate structure: (1) a
per-minute rate mirroring intrastate, interexchange access
charges, minus the carrier common line charge; (2) a monthly
per-line rate designed to capture the difference between the
revenues received from the per-minute rate and Bell Atlantic's
costs for building a "ubiquitous network" in the state; and (3) a
universal service component to be determined in the universal
service proceeding.

     Bell Atlantic had said that MFS and other "co-carriers"
should be allowed to charge interconnection rates based on the
co-carriers' own costs.  It had opposed setting interconnection
rates for the co-carriers at levels matching its own rates,
citing the need to recover its investment in the "ubiquitous
network" it had built in Maryland and its role as the "carrier of
last resort."  CLECs, meanwhile, had proposed that all local
exchange service providers be required to charge each other the
same cost-based rates for interconnection.  They had argued that
establishing such reciprocal rates would be more efficient and
would promote fair competition.

     Saying that Bell Atlantic's proposal "misses the mark," the
commission ruled in its Phase II order that interconnection rates
paid by CLECs should provide "a contribution to"--but not full
recovery of--the telco's joint and common costs.  "The precedent
certainly does not support [Bell Atlantic's] proposal to recover
joint, common, and other costs [that are] many multiples in
excess of the actual incremental cost of interconnection," the
PSC said.  

     It also rejected calls by some CLECs for a "bill-and-keep"
intercarrier compensation method.  Citing a lack of data on
traffic volumes, it opted instead to establish a specific
interconnection rate to be paid by all carriers.

     The PSC decided to set rates higher for interconnection
provided at tandem switching offices, saying that such
interconnection is more costly for Bell Atlantic.  It adopted a
rate of 0.5 cents per minute of use (MOU) for interconnection at
Bell Atlantic's tandem offices and 0.3 cents per MOU for
interconnection at its end offices.  Bell Atlantic will pay the
same 0.3 cents per MOU rate for termination of calls on the
CLEC's networks.

     Those rates represent a reduction of about 75% from previous
interim rates, MFS Communications Co., Inc., said in a statement. 
In the absence of interconnection agreements, the Bell companies
have in the past levied charges on CLECs seeking interconnection
but have refused to compensate those CLECS for terminating calls
that originated on Bell company networks, MFS said.

     Teleport Communications Group, Inc., noted that it had
proposed a "flat-rated" compensation arrangement that would have
allowed carriers to purchase bulk units of capacity on Bell
Atlantic's network rather than paying per-MOU rates.  The
flat-rated arrangement "more accurately reflects a carriers' true
cost," Teleport said.  The commission rejected Teleport's
proposal, however, noting that most parties preferred an
MOU-based rate to a flat rate.  Carriers may institute flat-rate
arrangements by mutual agreement, the PSC added.  The commission
said it will review the effectiveness of its usage-based rate
system before reconsidering other rate schemes.

     The PSC also took up issues regarding unbundling of Bell
Atlantic's links and ports in its Phase II order.  Last year MFS
and Bell Atlantic jointly tested the provision of unbundled
voice-grade business dial-tone lines in Maryland.  Based on those
trials, Bell Atlantic had proposed tariffs (transmittals nos. 939
and 941) containing rates and terms for unbundled business links
and services connecting Bell Atlantic and CLEC facilities.  The
commission, however, rejected those tariff proposals, directing
the telco to resubmit new tariffs within 30 days based on a rate
structure proposed by the PSC's staff.

     Interim prices for unbundled links and ports should be set
at levels that would be less than or equal to the price of
equivalent elements of bundled local dial-tone service, the
commission said.  Under this method, the ratio between the prices
for unbundled links and ports would reflect the ratios between
the direct costs of providing the links and ports.  That will
allow Bell Atlantic to recover a "proportionate share" of the
amount it recovers through the current bundled dial-tone service
rates, while setting prices at a level that will allow CLECs to
compete, the PSC reasoned.

     To "mirror" the conditions under which Bell Atlantic
operates, the PSC prohibited CLECs from offering interLATA
services bundled with local exchange services.  CLECs had
contended that new entrants should be able to offer such service
packages because Bell Atlantic retains significant competitive
advantages over them.  The PSC said new market entrants may
provide interLATA services but cannot package them with local
exchange service until the interLATA line-of-business restriction
on Bell companies is removed.  CLECs were allowed to delay
providing equal access for intraLATA toll calls until Bell
Atlantic is required to do so.

Calif. PUC Proceeds with Local Competition Plans,
Approves Applications for Operating Authority

     The California Public Utilities Commission has taken several
steps toward implementing local exchange competition in the
state.  Late last year the PUC proposed an outline for universal
service support programs that would include a fund accessible to
competitive local exchange carriers serving high-cost areas.  The
commission also approved 31 applications for competitive local
exchange service authority and issued "interim final" rules
allowing facilities-based local exchange competition to begin
Jan. 1.  The rules are "largely the same" as the interim rules
proposed in July, the PUC said (TCR, Aug. 3, 1995).

     The PUC submitted to the state legislature its proposal to
continue supporting universal telephone service as competition
grows in local exchange markets.  If the legislature adopts the
proposal, the commission will finalize by June a definition of
basic service, establish a revenue source for a high-cost subsidy
fund, and identify high-cost areas.  

     The PUC already has proposed to use a "proxy model" as the
starting point for determining the costs of providing basic local
exchange service.  It would use the "Benchmark Cost Model"
submitted by MCI Telecommunications Corp., the NYNEX Corp.
telephone companies, Sprint Corp., and U S WEST, Inc., in
comments filed in the FCC's docket 80-286 joint board proceeding
on universal service programs (TCR, July 20, 1995).

     The commission also would create a "High Cost Voucher Fund"
to subsidize companies serving rural areas.  Customers in those
areas would receive credits on their monthly bills to "keep their
rates affordable no matter which company serving their area they
choose," the commission said.  The credits would equal the
difference between the rate paid by the customer and the cost to
serve that customer.  Companies would have to be willing to serve
all customers in a designated area to receive the subsidy, the
PUC said. 

     The PUC adopted "interim final rules" governing local
exchange competition.  Interim rules had been proposed last July,
and the commission had held hearings and solicited comments
before developing the current rules, said Richard Smith, an
adviser to Commissioner P. Gregory Conlon.  The rules will be in
effect at least through 1996 and may become permanent as of Jan.
1, 1997, he said.  Parties can petition the PUC to change the
rules while they remain in effect on an interim basis, Mr. Smith
said.

     The rules call for interconnection terms to be established
through contracts rather than tariffs.  The PUC "generally will
raise no objections" to interconnection arrangements unless they
are anticompetitive or raise other such concerns, said Mr. Smith. 
A list of "preferred outcomes" drafted by the PUC contains
guidelines for interconnection arrangements.  Those include
recommendations on the proper number of points and locations for
interconnection and the use of one-way and two-way trunking and
signaling protocols, he added.  There would be a "dispute
resolution process" to resolve interconnection problems between
companies.  Incumbent local exchange carriers also are prohibited
from "unilaterally terminating" interconnection with a
competitor, Mr. Smith said.  A "bill-and-keep" scheme will be
used on an interim basis for call-termination compensation, Mr.
Smith added.

     The PUC also approved 31 applications filed by companies
seeking to provide competitive local exchange service in
California, including AT&T Corp., Brooks Fiber Properties,
Electric Lightwave, Inc., ICG Access Services, Inc., MCImetro,
MFS Intelenet of California, Inc., and Teleport Communications
Group, Inc.  The PUC also gave GTE California and Pacific Bell
authority to provide facilities-based local exchange and
intraLATA toll services in each others' service areas beginning
Jan. 1.  A GTE spokesman said his company plans initially to
enter Pacific Bell's service area in Los Angeles and other areas
contiguous to its own service areas. 

     Meanwhile, a PUC administrative law judge has proposed rates
for interim number portability in the state.  Thomas ALJ Pulsifer
said Pacific Bell should be able to charge its competitors'
customers $1.88 per month, plus a one-time fee, to forward calls
through its network.  Pacific Bell had proposed charging
customers $3.25 per month for remote call forwarding.  Mr.
Pulsifer recommended cutting that rate "to reflect a $1.37
disallowance for the avoided retail costs of marketing and
customer service."  He recommended that GTE-California be able to
charge $3.40 monthly. 

     The PUC last year called for incumbent local exchange
carriers to use remote call forwarding or direct inward dialing
technologies as interim number portability solutions while an
industry task force proposes permanent solutions.  Existing
Pacific Bell and GTE tariffed rates for direct inward dialing are
"reasonable" and should remain in place, the ALJ said.  Under the
recommendation, customers could elect to pay either a one-time
fee of $31.75 for each number forwarded or $75.50 for the first
number and $10 for each additional number.  The PUC is expected
to consider the proposal this month, a spokesman said.

Conn. Agency Rejects SNET Cost Studies,
Sets Interim Local Service Resale Rates

     Saying that cost studies filed by the Southern New England
Telephone Co. (SNET) are "faulty," the Connecticut Department of
Public Utility Control has proposed interim rates for SNET's
unbundled network and wholesale basic local exchange service
offerings.  The department rejected SNET's rate proposal, which
in most cases would have set wholesale rates higher than SNET's
retail rates to end users.  It issued the draft interim rates to
prevent further delay of competition, it said.  The department
asked the telco to submit "accurate and complete" cost studies
for use in developing permanent rates.

     SNET filed tariffs last year with the DPUC proposing rates
for unbundled loops and ports and for a wholesale local exchange
service package that competitors could resell.  SNET proposed to
provide unbundled loops and the wholesale service package at
monthly rates that would vary according to four geographic
classifications:  "metro," urban, suburban, and rural.  

     In support of its proposed rates, SNET submitted a series of
cost studies.       The DPUC, however, said SNET's proposed rates
and charges were "set too high and may unduly limit competitive
participation by some competent and capable competitors."  It
found "substantive deficiencies" in SNET's cost studies,
including a failure to provide sufficient documentation and the
use of an improper allocation methodology for hybrid fiber
optic/coaxial cable network costs.

     The proposed interim rates would vary depending on the
geographic location, as SNET had proposed.  The interim wholesale
local exchange service rates for both business and residential
service would range from $12.08 per month in metro areas to
$16.87 in rural areas.  The current monthly rate for residential
local exchange service ranges from $14.53 for service in metro
areas to $11.53 for rural customers.  SNET had proposed wholesale
rates ranging from $15 for metro service up to as high as $26 for
rural service.

     For service to business customers, the current retail rates
range from $31.13 in rural areas to $39.23 for businesses in
metro areas.  SNET had proposed wholesale rates beginning at
$12.50 for metro business service and reaching $23.50 for rural
business service.  Those rates would not have included the $3.50
subscriber line charge that SNET is seeking to levy on
competitive local exchange carriers.

     The draft decision also included proposed interim wholesale
rates for unbundled loops ranging from $10.18 per month for metro
service to $15.33 for suburban service.  SNET had proposed a
range of unbundled loop rates from $12.00 in metro areas to
$22.50 in rural areas.  The current retail rate for unbundled
loops in all four geographic classifications is $22.55, the DPUC
said.  It directed SNET to file a volume discount plan for its
unbundled service offerings.  The interim rates will "encourage
the development of effective competition" and "provide the
necessary incentive to SNET to refile as quickly as possible an
acceptable set of costs and proposals" for permanent rates, the
department said.  Meanwhile, the PUC also released a draft plan
to place SNET under price cap regulation.  SNET requested the
change last March, citing competitive market changes in the
state.  The commission said the plan would give SNET flexibility
to compete effectively with carriers seeking to "cherry-pick" the
most lucrative customers and would reward the company for
reducing costs.

     The plan would categorize SNET services as either
"noncompetitive," "emerging competitive," or "competitive." 
Almost all SNET services would be presumed to be noncompetitive
initially, the PUC said.  The only offerings considered
competitive at the outset would be "800" service, wide-area
telephone service, and Centrex/digital Centrex services.  Those
were deemed competitive by state telecom legislation passed in
1994 (TCR, May 12, 1994).

     Prices for noncompetitive services would be banded; a price
ceiling would be set either at the existing price or, if the
product already is banded, at the existing upper limit of the
band.  The price floor would be based on total-service long-run
incremental costs (TSLRIC).  Basic local exchange services for
residences and businesses would be capped at current rates until
Jan. 1, 1998.

     SNET would be allowed downward pricing flexibility for all
products and would be able to propose service reclassifications. 
Once services are classified as "emerging competitive," they also
would be banded to provide pricing flexibility, the PUC said. 
The price floor for such services would be based on the TSLRIC;
SNET would propose price ceilings when it requests that a service
be reclassified as emerging competitive.  Services considered
competitive would be subject only to a price floor.

AT&T Gets Authority To Provide Local Service
In Chicago; Eyes Md., Conn., Wisc. Markets 

     AT&T Corp. has continued its move into local exchange
service markets, receiving authorization from the Illinois
Commerce Commission to provide local exchange service in the
Chicago LATA late last year.  AT&T also has applied for authority
to provide local exchange service to business and residential
customers in Maryland and Connecticut and said it plans to begin
offering local switched services in Wisconsin later this year.

     The carrier's entry into the Illinois market may be delayed,
however, if Ameritech-Illinois fails to offer reasonable
"wholesale" rates for the local exchange services AT&T plans to
resell, AT&T said.  The company is awaiting commission action on
a request that Ameritech be required to offer wholesale rates
that are "viable for use by resellers."  Ameritech had filed
proposed local exchange service resale tariffs following
agreements with U.S. Network Corp. and MFS Communications Co.,
Inc., to resell its services (TCR, Nov. 9 and Dec. 7, 1995).

     The tariffs feature sliding-scale discounts of 6% for
residential service and 10% for business service--with better
rates available to resellers making certain term and volume
commitments.  AT&T has claimed that Ameritech's proposed resale
tariffs would not allow it to compete effectively.  AT&T is
seeking wholesale rates that are 25% to 35% below the telco's
retail rates for local exchange service.

     Scott Etzler, AT&T Regional Vice President, said,
"Unfortunately, most potential Ameritech competitors have
discovered that being certified to offer local service and
actually providing that service to customers are two very
different things.  Ameritech executives seem to be saying that
they are willing to open their local exchange monopoly to small
competitors, but not those that could really deliver on the
promise of local service competition."  AT&T has yet to receive a
"satisfactory reply" from Ameritech since asking the telco to
develop wholesale rates more than six months ago, Mr. Etzler
said.  

     The delays prompted AT&T last month to ask the Illinois
commission to require Ameritech Corp. to offer local exchange
services to competitors for resale "at prices and terms that will
allow competitors to be successful in the marketplace."  Despite
the certification of six companies as potential competitors in
state, competition in Illinois for residential markets is "nearly
nonexistent," AT&T said.

     Meanwhile, AT&T has asked the Maryland Public Service
Commission for authority to provide local exchange service to
business and residential end users in the state.  AT&T said it
initially would resell Bell Atlantic-Maryland's services but
eventually would build its own network, "as market conditions and
opportunities develop."  It hopes to begin offering service by
mid-1996.  

     As expected, AT&T also asked the Connecticut Department of
Public Utility Control for authority to offer local exchange
service in the state.  The carrier announced plans last fall to
enter the state's residential and business local exchange markets
once the PUC established "wholesale" prices for resale of local
exchange service (TCR, Nov. 9, 1995).  The agency last month set
interim rates for the resale of Southern New England Telephone
Co.'s (SNET's) unbundled network and wholesale basic local
exchange offerings (see separate story).

     AT&T is "not completely satisfied" with the interim rates,
however.  A company spokesman said the rates for resale of local
exchange service to business are "conducive to real competition,"
but the residential service rates "represent a barrier to
competitive entry."  He stated that residential resale rates were
set "significantly above [SNET's] retail rate."  

     When the PUC adopted the interim rates, it directed SNET to
conduct new cost studies for the development of permanent resale
rates.  It also told SNET to develop a volume discount plan for
resellers.  Those measurers should improve the prospects for
competition in the state, the AT&T spokesman said.

     The company also announced plans this month to compete in
Wisconsin's local exchange markets, pending the adoption of local
exchange competition rules by that state's Public Service
Commission.  AT&T said it hopes to enter the state's markets by
the middle of this year.  AT&T also offers local exchange service
as part of the "Open Market Plan" in Rochester, N.Y. (TCR, March
16, 1995) and has won authority to provide such service in
Michigan (TCR, Nov. 23, 1995).

Telcos Fight Ohio Competition Rules;
Time Warner Seeks Rate Mediation

     Telephone companies in Ohio have continued their fight
against local exchange competition rules adopted in the state
last year (TCR, Oct. 12, 1995).  Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.
asked the Ohio Supreme Court late last year to overturn a
decision authorizing Time Warner Communications to provide local
exchange service, contending that the state legislature, not the
PUC, has the authority to allow such competition.  And in
comments on the proposed local competition rules submitted to the
PUC by staff last year, Ameritech-Ohio told the PUC that the
proposal would hurt consumers and provide unfair advantages to
the telco's competitors.

     The PUC last year granted Time Warner Communications a
certificate to provide local exchange service in the 37 Ohio
counties where it operates cable TV systems (TCR, Aug. 31, 1995). 
Cincinnati Bell and other local exchange carriers unsuccessfully
have requested that the PUC reverse its decision to give Time
Warner telephony service authority (TCR, Oct. 12, 1995).  

     Cincinnati Bell filed the appeal with the state Supreme
Court, saying it is the "next step" following the PUC's denial of
that request.  State law "clearly spells out the actions which
must be taken when policy changes [occur] that will affect
consumers," said Barbara J. Stonebraker, Senior Vice President of
Cincinnati Bell.

     Ameritech agreed that the proposed local competition rules
are unfair to incumbent local exchange carriers. In comments
filed with the PUC, James C. Smith, Ameritech-Ohio Vice
President-regulatory, said the proposals would "promote the
interests of competitors and make existing telephone companies
and consumers finances [the competitors'] entry into the local
phone business."

     The Office of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, however, said it
supported the staff's recommendations.  It offered additional
proposals, suggesting that the PUC develop a universal service
support mechanism for carriers providing service in high-cost and
low-income areas.  

     The office also proposed exempting small local exchange
carriers from rules allowing local exchange competition for three
years.  Each competitive local service provider should file
tariffs for "plain old telephone service," it said. 

     Meanwhile, Time Warner has expressed frustration over
Ameritech's intransigence in talks on interconnection issues,
asking the PUC to mediate negotiations.  Time Warner said
"technical" interconnection issues, but talks have hit a snag
over "economic" issues.  Time Warner requested PUC mediation in
its second 60-day report to the commission on the status of its
interconnection negotiations with Ameritech and other telephone
companies.

     Marsha R. Schermer, Vice President-Midwest region for Time
Warner, said Ameritech appears "unable or unwilling to negotiate"
a reasonable resolution of the remaining issues.  In its request
for mediation, Time Warner said, "Some [Ameritech] charges for
key services, for which there are not current substitutes, are
excessive."  Ameritech also has failed to provide "cost
justifications" and has proposed some one-time charges that are
"not appropriate," Time Warner added.  

     In its response, Ameritech said delays have been caused by
"new issues and demands," including Time Warner's "inappropriate
insistence" that all economic issues be resolved "in a manner
which insures a certain level of profitability for Time Warner." 
Ameritech said a final agreement can be reached on the remaining
issues, "if Time Warner is serious."

     Time Warner continued its attack on the telco this week by
asking the PUC to suspend Ameritech's alternative regulation
plan.  It also asked the PUC to order Ameritech to publish a
notice explaining that its alternative regulation has been
suspended.  The order also should compel Ameritech to enter into
an interim interconnection agreement with Time Warner and pay the
PUC's and Time Warner's legal and other expenses incurred in the
dispute, Time Warner said.

Ameritech-Michigan Proposes 
Local Exchange Resale Rates

     Ameritech-Michigan has filed an intrastate tariff proposing
rates for the resale of its local exchange services in Michigan. 
The tariff proposal, filed with the Public Service Commission,
offers "wholesale" discounts of up to 20% for some network
services.  Discounts would vary for different network elements
and services and would increase with volume and term commitments,
an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  The tariff, which is subject to
PSC approval, would become effective Feb. 1.

     Ameritech called the filing "another step" in meeting the
requirements of the recently passed Michigan Telecommunications
Act (TCR, Nov. 9, 1995).  The tariff includes a proposed 3%
wholesale discount on Ameritech's retail rates for local lines. 
Competitors also could take advantage of an 8% discount on local
usage rates for residential services and 11% discount on local
usage rates for business services.  The discount rate for
intraLATA (local access and transport area) toll services would
be 10% for both residential and business offerings, an Ameritech
spokeswoman said.  Competitors also would be able to purchase for
resale such enhanced features as Caller ID and voice mail, as
well as advanced business services such as Centrex and ISDN
(integrated services digital network) offerings.

TRA Official Heralds Resellers' Entry into Local
Markets, Sees Potential for Alliances with CLECs

     Until now, members of the Telecommunications Resellers
Association have been identified as either facilities-based or
"switchless" resellers of interexchange services.  But those
companies now appear poised to bring their experience to bear on
local exchange markets, joining facilities-based competitive
local exchange carriers (CLECs), cable TV companies, and large
interexchange carriers (IXCs) as potential competitors to
incumbent telephone companies.  TRA recently formed a committee
to help members explore local exchange market entry, and several
CLECs have joined the association.  TRA Executive Director Ernest
B. Kelly III recently spoke with TCR about the effect his group's
members may have on growing local exchange service competition.

     TCR:  Until now TRA has represented companies that resell
interexchange services--the only services really available for
resale, in practical terms.  What percentage of your members are
interested in entering local exchange resale markets?

     Kelly:  We've done surveys on that and found that it's
virtually 100%.  Companies that are in for the long haul. . .
realize that eventually, they're going to have to have a bundled
set of services.  And local telephone services are the key, the
linchpin, in taking the services they already are providing to
the next level.  

     [They are the key] to surviving the coming [market] changes. 
So our panel sessions that we do at our conferences, our local
resale council that we created--these are matters of tremendous
interest within TRA.  In sum, there's a lot of interest from our
members in knowing how and when they can offer local services.

     TCR:  Is local exchange resale fundamentally the same as
long distance resale in terms of reaching agreements with
underlying carriers?  Are experienced resellers--your members--
going to have an operational edge in reselling local exchange
services?

     Kelly:  Good questions.  In theory the relationship between
the underlying carrier and the reseller ought to be pretty much
the same.  In terms of what's going to happen in the real world,
in the world of practical experience, it's impossible to say for
sure because there's so little reselling of local services going
on right now.  We don't have any real basis on which to
[identify] any kind of trend, track record, or anything else. 
We'll just have to see.

     My guess is that there are going to be differences.  For one
thing, you're dealing with the question of universal service, and
we're not exactly sure how that's going to play out. . .So there
are a lot of subtle differences.  But the basic relationship
ought to be pretty much the same.  Hopefully there will enough
competition in local [exchange markets for] certain competitors
to want to utilize the resources of resellers.  

     Consider that resellers, which have been successful in the
long distance market, bring to the partnership an established
track record and an established customer base.  And those
customers are used to getting service from an alternative
supplier.  So you've knocked off a couple of the big [marketing]
impediments immediately because you've got a customer base that's
sophisticated in the world of resale and apparently has been
satisfied.

     It all really depends on whether the underlying carriers
view this as a true partnership with resellers--which is what we
would advocate--or whether they view it as a mandatory obligation
under certain rules and regulations established by the
government. . .In that case, you're going to have some problems.

     TCR:  That gets to my next question.  Relationships between
AT&T Corp. and some resellers have not always been cordial. 
There have been disputes and sometimes litigation.  Can we expect
to see a similarly rocky start to local exchange service resale?

     Kelly:  Let's get back to the point I just made.  If the
underlying carriers look at the relationship as a true
partnership, I think you'll see that harmonious relationships
will develop.  If they see it as some obligation they are
required to perform against their wishes or against their better
judgments, then you're going to have problems, because they won't
be working in consort with the reseller.  You know, an underlying
carrier has to look at a reseller as a partner, not as a
competitor. . .The ones that have done that have developed very
successful relationships with resellers. . .

     TCR:  I guess it depends on whether you view a reseller as
an alternative sales force that will generate revenues or as
somebody who's going to cut into your market share.

     Kelly:  In the case of AT&T [Corp.], at the time [of
divestiture], they had virtually the entire market.  For them,
I'm sure that resellers and other competitors simply represented
lost market share more than anything else.  That may be at the
heart of some of the problems.  

     The concern we have, I guess, is that the Bell companies are
going to have some of the same feelings or concerns and will not
want to work harmoniously with resellers.

     They'll service resellers, but they may not want to look at
them [as partners], which is what I'm advocating, and what our
association is really all about. . .On the other hand, they may
have seen that the problems that existed with some of AT&T's
resellers are problems that can be avoided if they take a true
partnership approach.

     TCR:  How necessary is local exchange competition for the
development of competition, overall?  How do you counter
arguments that only facilities-based competition will lead to a
true breakup of local exchange carriers' monopolies?

     Kelly:  Resale is going to be absolutely critical to the
initial surge of competition because it's going to take time,
money, and resources to develop competitive infrastructures. 
What the CAPs [competitive access providers] have out there right
now is great but it is just a scratch on the surface.  There's a
long, long way to go, and it's not going to happen over- night. 
We know that.

     On the other hand, I am one of those who believe that true
resale will flourish in the future only when we have ubiquitous,
competing, facilities-based companies out there.  That's when it
really will take off.  If you look at the experience gained from
the long distance market, AT&T initially offered resale at the
behest of the government. . .But it didn't really explode until
[WilTel, Inc.,] and [Sprint Communications Co. L.P.]--Sprint in
particular--laid down fiber optic cables with an abundance of
capacity.  

     That really required them, as a matter of business, to look
at alternative channels for marketing and sales.  That's where
the kick came.  And the same thing is going to happen in local
exchange markets, particularly for companies who are competing
against the entrenched former monopolists in the LEC [local
exchange carrier] community.

     TCR:  You've written articles on the potential for alliances
to be formed among CLECs and resellers.  Could you outline the
synergies between those companies?  How can resellers help the
CLECs or CAPs gain stronger positions in local exchange markets?

     Kelly:  I'm very much interested in forging a strong
relationship between our member companies and the competitive
local exchange carriers.  We're pleased to see that a number of
the CAPs, including some of the bigger ones, have joined TRA and
have now taken positions of leadership within our local resale
council.  We think it's absolutely essential that the CAPs take a
look at how they can utilize resellers.  

     I've described in some of our discussions here the kind of
synergies that naturally exist.  If you're a CAP with a
reasonably good system. . .of fiber rings around the country, you
can begin to look at resellers as a form of marketing and sales
[force] that can give you a quick shot at market share.

     Resellers reach into every nook and cranny in the U.S.  They
are more ubiquitous in terms of marketing and sales forces than
any of the CAPs are right now.  It only makes sense to
investigate thoroughly how these dynamic, entrepreneurial groups
can work together.  And that's what we're trying to do within
TRA.  We think those synergies will only increase, and I'm
beginning to see most of the CAPs recognizing that there's
potential here.  And that's very encouraging.

     TCR:  There's been a widely publicized debate over what
"wholesale" rate LECs should be allowed to charge for services
offered for resale.  AT&T is favoring something like a 30%
discount while most of the LECs are trying to hold it at
something less than 10%.  In your view, which position is more
economically defensible?

     Kelly:  Well, I'd rather come at that in a different way. 
First we want to see true cost-based approaches to ascertaining
what the cost of basic service should be.  There are a number of
different wholesale approaches that then can be taken.  In the
long distance industry, as you probably know, we have discounts
of up to 30% to 50%, depending on the volume and the kind of term
commitment you're willing to make.  The difficult thing here is
the question of universal service--how it will be funded and the
impact it will have on establishing some sort of true, cost-based
approach.

     I think any number of different wholesale approaches could
work, but we first have to get to what true cost-based pricing
is.  Our initial cut on that is that [the costs] probably are
going to be less than what the Bell companies are claiming at
this point.  If we can just tear aside the underbrush and get to
the true cost of providing local service, then we can at that
point begin to consider different wholesale or discount packages. 
That's what we're trying to accomplish.  I don't know how long
it's going to take; it's going to be different in every state and
region.  We'll just have to see whether that turns out to be one
of the big fights.  My guess is that it will be.

     TCR:  Has TRA taken a position--or what's your opinion--on
what costs or overhead factors should be included by LECs in
calculating wholesale rates?

     Kelly:  We've made any number of filings. . .in virtually
every state on this issue.  Obviously we've taken positions in
federal government proceedings--before the Congress, the
Commission, etc.  We're trying not to pick one approach over
another.  A number of the larger interexchange carriers have
suggested some good approaches to all this. . .A few key states
are going to lead the way on this--California, New York, and
Illinois come to mind. . .I think it's a little too early in the
process to say, "This is going to work and that's not going to
work."  I think flexibility right now is the best approach we
could take.

     TCR:  How would resale develop under terms currently
contained in the pending federal telecom legislation?  More
specifically, does the measure still contain a provision that
would hinder the ability of interexchange carriers to offer
bundled packages of long distance and resold local exchange
services?

      Kelly:  Bundled and unbundled [services] are addressed in
the legislation. . .Of course, since they still haven't passed
it, anything could change.  It doesn't matter if somebody says,
"We're only looking at certain parts of the bill affecting
broadcasting," if the bill is not put to bed, all provisions in
it are probably open to mischief.  So all of this has to have a
big asterisk next to it because what we've seen to date may not
be the end result.

     The resale language is OK.  We wanted some stronger resale
language in the legislation because we knew that  resale would be
the first place where competition would really take off.  I was
pleased, frankly, to see that resale has now become item number
one on the "competitive checklist."  

     It was always in the bill, but now it's a part of the
checklist, [meaning that] there have to be resale products--and
no impediments to resale--as a condition of the LECs' getting
into the [interLATA] long distance business.  That's good. 
That's very positive.

     TCR:  How about the joint-marketing provision?

     Kelly:  From TRA's perspective, 98% of the companies in our
association are going to be allowed to joint market because
they're not at the 5% threshold.  That was devised to keep AT&T,
MCI [Telecommunications Corp.] and Sprint from being able to come
out and joint market before the [Bell companies] were able to
joint market.  I don't see that prohibition applying to much of
our membership, which consists of small resellers with minimal
overall market share.

FCC Price Cap Changes Improperly Set
Rates 'Retroactively,' LECs Tell Court

     In setting "interim" price cap rules governing local
exchange carriers (LECs), the FCC "gerrymandered" the available
data on LEC earnings to support its own conclusion that
interstate access rates should be reduced, LECs have told a
federal court.  In oral arguments before the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington, attorneys said the Commission failed to
explain its actions last year setting new price cap "productivity
factors" and requiring LECs to "add back" the effect of previous
years' earnings "sharing" obligations (TCR, April 13, 1995).  The
FCC also erred by making its actions apply retroactively, they
added.

     Attorneys for the FCC and AT&T Corp. countered that the
agency had used its authority properly to establish rate-setting
mechanisms.  They said the rule changes applied only to LEC price
cap calculations for this year onward.

     Bell Atlantic Telephone Companies, et al., v. FCC
(consolidated cases beginning at no. 95-1217) stemmed from the
Commission's first order in the docket 94-1 LEC price cap
performance review proceeding.  Finding that it had made an error
in setting the original productivity factors (3.3% and 4.3%) in
1990, the Commission "reinitialized" the factors and required
LECs to make a one-time, downward correction in their price cap
indices for each year they had chosen the 3.3% factor.  

     The Commission also established, on an "interim" basis, new
productivity factors ranging from 4.0% to 5.3%.  The FCC since
has adopted a rulemaking notice seeking comments on the proper
methodology for setting "permanent" productivity factors.

     In its order, the FCC also altered the price cap rules'
definition of "exogenous" costs, ruling that LECs could include
in price cap calculations only those exogenous costs that
represent true "economic costs."  That ruling excluded exogenous
costs stemming from accounting changes to implement Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (post-employment benefits
or "OPEBs").  

     And in a separate order in docket 93-179, the Commission
ordered LECs to "add back" the effects of sharing obligations
incurred in previous years when they calculate current-year rates
of return.  The add-back rule also was applied to LEC "lower-end
adjustments" under the price cap rules.

     During the oral argument, the judges--Laurence H. Silberman,
James L. Buckley, and A. Raymond Randolph--viewed the LECs'
arguments with some skepticism.  Attorney Mark L. Evans,
representing the LECs on productivity factor and OPEBs issues,
said his clients object to the FCC's "cooking the books"--
selecting only data supporting its preconceived view.

     When it initiated the docket 94-1 price cap proceeding, the
Commission had pledged to weigh all available data concerning the
LECs' performance under the price cap rules, he said.  But in
considering productivity factors, it ignored data submitted by
the U.S. Telephone Association concerning the LECs' economic
performance during 1991 and 1992.  "The data didn't support the
conclusion it wanted," Mr. Evans said.  So "the FCC set about to
gerrymander the data to fit its conclusion."

     Mr. Evans said it was unreasonable for the agency not to
include in its consideration of the interim figures all relevant
data available--including the 1991-1992 data, "which the
Commission pretends doesn't exist."  He added that the FCC, while
disregarding that data, relied in part on new data to reach the
conclusion that the original productivity factors had been set
erroneously in 1990.  

     Judge Buckley recalled the FCC's conclusion that it should
not use the 1991-1992 data because that data had been received
with ex parte comments in docket 94-1.  The agency felt it could
not use the data without obtaining additional public comment. 
Mr. Evans said that rationale was spelled out only in the FCC's
brief in the case, not in its docket 94-1 order.  

LECs Say Add-Back Rule Was Adopted Improperly

     Representing LECs that appealed the add-back order, Paul T.
Cappuccio said the FCC "must explain the necessity for the
add-back rule in light of its statutory authority."  Those LECs
had argued that the new rule made revenue-sharing similar to a
"refund" ordered under rate-of-return regulation, although the
Communications Act allows refunds only if rates have been found
"unlawful."  Under the price cap rules, LEC rates are not held to
be unlawful even if the companies' earnings exceed the sharing
threshold, the LECs had pointed out.

     Mr. Cappuccio told the court that the FCC had failed to
explain why it implemented sharing initially without an add-back
mechanism and then reversed course and adopted the add-back rule. 
Judge Silberman asked, "Suppose the Commission interpreted the
prior sharing rule to say that it already required an add-back
process?"  In that case, the judge added, the FCC would not have
to adopt a new rule; it could merely clarify that its existing
rule required the add-back methodology. 

     The earnings "sharing" rule requires LECs earning above a
certain threshold to share part or all of their earnings with
ratepayers in the form of lowered price cap indices (PCIs) in the
following year.  

     The add-back rule requires that LECs reverse the effect of
that sharing when calculating earnings for the second year.  A
similar rule applies to the "low-end adjustment," which allows
LECs to raise their PCIs if they have earned below a certain rate
of return.

     The add-back rule effectively penalizes LECs twice for
earning above the sharing threshold, Mr. Cappuccio said.  Not
only must LECs incur sharing obligations, he said, but the
negative effects of those obligations are perpetuated in future
years. 

FCC Had Warned of Price Cap Changes, Ingle Says

     Addressing the productivity factor issue, FCC attorney John
Ingle recalled that when it implemented the price cap plan in
1990, the FCC had promised to review the rules after four years. 
It did so partly out of concern over whether the proper
productivity factors had been established, he said.  Judge
Silberman asked whether the LECs could have been allowed to
present "economic earnings" data to supplement the "accounting"
rate-of-return data the agency used to calculate productivity
offsets.  Mr. Ingle said such data may have been included in the
1991-1992 information submitted by USTA.

     He disagreed with Mr. Evans' view that the FCC simply had
ignored that data.  "I think the Commission was very receptive to
much of the data and the methodology USTA was suggesting," he
said.  But because the data was submitted only a few weeks before
the order was adopted, the FCC did not have time to make certain
that the data was reliable enough to be incorporated into the
order.  It did not rule out use of the data--or USTA's proposed
methodology for deriving productivity factors--in future orders
in the proceeding, Mr. Ingle said.  The FCC simply decided that
it should seek further comment on them first.

     Addressing the add-back issue, Mr. Ingle explained that
earnings sharing differs from rate refunds under rate-of-return
regulation.  Judge Silberman sought to clarify that sharing does
not directly require LECs to reduce rates, but only to lower
PCIs.  

     So to the extent that LEC rates are below the price cap
ceilings, sharing would not have any real effect on them, he
said.  "You could go for five years without any change in dollar
figures," the judge said.  "Why isn't the Commission making this
argument?" he asked.

     Representing AT&T Corp., Gene C. Schaerr argued that the FCC
had the right to adopt the add-back mechanism as an "accounting
function" that corrects "distortions" caused by the sharing
rules.  He termed "voodoo accounting" the LECs' argument that
they are somehow doubly penalized under the add-back rule.  Judge
Silberman asked, "Isn't it a fact that the Commission is mixing
earnings and revenues?  Isn't that the core issue?"

     Mr. Schaerr compared the LECs to a hypothetical government
employee who finds he has not had enough income withheld during
1994 for income taxes.  The employee then convinces the IRS to
simply deduct the amount due from his paycheck during 1995. 
Then, when it comes time to calculate his total income for that
year, the employee claims that the amount deducted should not be
included as income "because he didn't actually receive the cash,"
Mr. Schaerr said.

     He disputed the LECs' argument that the FCC had engaged in
retroactive ratemaking in altering the price cap rules.  The LECs
are merely attempting to expand the range of rate-setting actions
that courts will regard as retroactive, he said.  But Judge
Silberman countered with his own hypothetical situation. 
"Suppose Congress passed a tax law that says, `If you sold a
house in the past five years, your. . .income tax rate will go
up,'" he said.  Mr. Schaerr said that would be improperly
retroactive.  "But I'm following exactly your framework for
retroactivity," Judge Silberman said.

     Speaking to reporters after the oral argument, Mary
McDermott, Vice President-legal and regulatory affairs for USTA,
said the FCC's action clearly had retroactive effects.  She noted
that the decision to implement the one-time "reinitialization" of
price caps applied only to LECs that had chosen a 3.3%
productivity factor in any of the years from 1991 to 1994.  As a
result of that reinitialization, the LECs had to reduce their
access charges by about $400 million--purely as a result of
choices they had made before the FCC's order, she said.  The LECs
could not have known during those years that their decisions
would lead to rate reductions, she added.

TEXAS RULES

     The Texas Public Utility Commission has adopted an initial
set of rules implementing telecom legislation enacted in the
state last year (TCR, March 16, 1995; April 27, 1995; and May 25,
1995).  

     Included in the rules adopted last month are provisions
requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to provide
directories and directory listings for customers of competitive
local service providers.  

     The rule allows individual companies to negotiate the
pricing for such offerings.  It also issued rules implementing
the legislature's mandate to deregulate telephone cooperatives
and grant small local exchange carriers regulatory flexibility.

ARIZONA AUTHORIZES IntraLATA TOLL CARRIERS

     The Arizona Corporation Commission has approved applications
by AT&T Corp. and MCI Telecommunications Corp. for authority to
provide intraLATA toll service in competition with local exchange
carriers.  The commission also adopted rules requiring LECs to
implement intraLATA equal access by April 20.  Until then,
callers must use "dial-around" access codes to place toll calls
using AT&T's or MCI's networks.

     The commission said Sprint Communications Co. L.P.'s
application for intraLATA toll service authority remains pending,
and other applications are expected.  The decision followed the
commission's approval last year of rules allowing new market
entrants to compete in Arizona's local exchange and intraLATA
toll service markets (TCR, July 6, 1995).

N.J. PROCEEDING

     The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has opened a
proceeding to investigate allowing local exchange competition in
the state and proposed rules to allow intraLATA toll
presubscription.  

     IntraLATA toll competition has been allowed in the state
since 1994, but users have been required to dial access codes to
reach their preferred service provider.  

     The board proposed rules for intraLATA pre-subscription
because "we believe that having to dial a five-digit code does
not assure effective competition," said BPU President Herbert H.
Tate Jr.

WISCONSIN ORDER

     Dane County (Wisc.) Circuit Court Judge Mori Krueger has
upheld a Wisconsin Public Service Commission order requiring
Ameritech-Wisconsin to provide intraLATA (local access and
transport area) toll equal access, a PSC spokesman said. 
Ameritech had asked the court to stay the order.  

     Wisconsin customers have been able to reach competing
carriers by using "dial-around" access codes.  The ruling allowed
customers to presubscribe to a designated carrier as of Jan. 1.

NEBRASKA BEGINS LOCAL COMPETITION PROCEEDING

     The Nebraska Public Service Commission has begun a
rulemaking proceeding to allow local exchange competition in the
state by July 1, 1997.  Hearings have been scheduled for early
next year on how to implement competition rules.  

     The PSC has proposed that several "preconditions" be met
before local exchange markets are made competitive.  Those
include providing service at a reasonable price, providing
intraLATA equal access, providing local number portability, and
ensuring universal service.  The commission plans to allow
competitors to file applications for local exchange service
authority as of Jan. 1, 1997.

CALIFORNIA COMPLAINT

     A coalition of local exchange competitors has filed a
complaint urging the California Public Utilities Commission to
reject parts of a recent interconnection agreement between
Pacific Bell and MFS Communications Co., Inc. (TCR, Nov. 23,
1995).  

     The California Telecommunications Coalition--which includes
AT&T Corp., MCI Telecommunications Corp., and Teleport
Communications Group, Inc.--told the PUC that the pact will set
an inappropriate precedent for other interconnection agreements
because MFS plans to serve only business users.  

     Pacific Bell also may attempt to use the agreement to show
that it has met a precondition for entry into the interLATA
service market, the coalition said.

FLORIDA PSC APPROVES NUMBER PORTABILITY PLAN

     The Florida Public Service Commission has approved a plan to
use remote call forwarding as an interim mechanism to provide
local number portability beginning Jan. 1.  Competitors must pay
incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) a nonrecurring charge of
$10 and a recurring charge of $1 per month per line for the
service.  Additional paths cost 50 cents per month, the PSC said. 
The commission said LECs also can provide interim number
portability through a "flexible direct inward dialing" system if
interconnecting competitors prefer.  

     The PSC rejected calls by incumbent LECs to implement an
interim universal service system for the state.  A commission
spokeswoman said, however, that LECs can petition the PSC for
relief from universal service obligations if they show that
competition had "eroded their ability" to meet those obligations.

PA. PRESUBSCRIPTION

     Adopting the recommendation of an Administrative Law Judge,
the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission has voted unanimously
to allow presubscription of carriers for intraLATA toll calling
(TCR, Dec. 7, 1995).  

     The PUC offered a concession to local exchange carriers
(LECs), however, mandating a longer implementation period than
the ALJ had recommended.  Pennsylvania callers now must use "dial
around" access codes ("10XXX" or "800"-number codes) to reach
short-haul toll service providers other than their LEC.

SBC CELLULAR AFFILIATE AUTHORIZED IN CHICAGO

     The Illinois Commerce Commission has authorized an SBC
Communications, Inc., affiliate to offer land-line local exchange
service in the greater Chicago area, enabling it to compete
directly with Ameritech-Illinois.  SBMS Illinois Services, Inc.,
an affiliate of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc. (SBMS),
will offer wireline services under the Cellular One brand name--
the same name SBMS uses to market cellular service in Chicago.

     SBC aggressively is exploring local exchange markets outside
its traditional five-state territory, an SBC spokesman said.  The
company is particularly interested in bundling cellular and
wireline services in markets where it already operates cellular
systems, including Boston, Baltimore, and Washington, he said.

MFS IN VIRGINIA

     MFS Communications Co., Inc., has become the first carrier
to seek authority to provide competitive local exchange services
in Virginia, filing an application with the State Corporation
Commission last month.  

     MFS said it would offer services in exchanges served by Bell
Atlantic-Virginia and GTE-Virginia, including those in Richmond
and the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.  State legislation
enacted last year allowed local exchange competition to begin
Jan. 1 (TCR, Feb. 16, 1995).

BROOKS ACQUIRES ENGINEERING AND CONSULTING OPERATIONS

     Competitive local exchange carrier Brooks Fiber Properties,
Inc., has acquired the domestic consulting and engineering
business of its affiliate, Brooks Telecommunications, Inc.  The
international operations of Brooks Telecom will be spun off into
a new company, Brooks Telecommunications International, Inc.  The
transaction will make Brooks Fiber a "full-service"
telecommunications provider, the company said.  Brooks
Telecommunications had owned 15% of Brooks Fiber, a company
spokesman said.

     Meanwhile, Brooks Fiber Communications has reached an
interim agreement to interconnect with NYNEX-New England's local
exchange network in Springfield, Mass.  The companies set
reciprocal compensation rates for call termination and agreed on
an interim local number portability arrangement.

PART 69 WAIVER

     AT&T Corp. has asked the FCC to approve conditionally
Pacific Bell's request for a waiver of the Commission's part 69
access charge rules to bill end-user common line (EUCL) and
presubscription-change charges to competitive carriers.  

     AT&T asked that Pacific Bell be required to adhere to its
stated plan to charge resellers an EUCL rate that would vary
according to the re-sellers' different end users.  

     Pacific Bell also should not be allowed to "double recover"
local loop costs by recovering the same costs in both intrastate
and interstate charges, AT&T said.

MFS SEEKS RULING ON INTERCONNECTION 

     MFS Communications Co., Inc., has asked the FCC to require
local exchange carriers (LECs) to allow interconnection for
Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), interoffice mileage, and
"Type 2" cellular services.  In a petition for declaratory
ruling, MFS also asked the agency to require LECs to offer
"cross-connects to all of the LECs' other access services upon
bona fide requests."      MFS said several LECs have rejected
requests to offer cross-connects for additional LEC services,
making the interconnection process "unduly burdensome."

     In comments on the petition, MCI Telecommunications Corp.
backed the MFS request.  But in its comments, GTE Corp. told the
FCC that granting the petition would "grant MFS access to prices
for call termination or originating access below" those outlined
in the part 69 access charge rules.

WISCONSIN PSC CHAIRMAN ELECTED NARUC PRESIDENT

Cheryl L. Parrino, chairman of the Public Service Commission
of Wisconsin (PSC) was elected president of the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) at the
organization's annual meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana.

NARUC is a quasi-governmental nonprofit organization founded
over 100 years ago to serve the public interest by improving
the quality and effectiveness of public regulation in America.
Its membership is comprised of government agencies of 50
states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the
Virgin Islands. In her acceptance speech before NARUC members,

Chairman Parrino shared her goals for the organization and
outlined the major issues she believes are common to all
utility industries. She also indicated that she felt NARUC is
at a critical point in its 107-year history.

"The telecommunications industry is on the verge of the first
major legislative change in 30 years. I predict we will see
legislation pass this year or early next year. The Safe Water
Drinking Act, PURPA and PUCHA repeal or reform are all matters
currently under discussion. We must be involved if we are to
live up to our motto -- dedicated to the public interest,
Chairman Parrino said. "I commit that NARUC will be a viable
and valuable player in those discussions and that we will have
an impact on how the industries transition to a competitive
market place," she added.

CPUC INVESTIGATES WILTEL FOR CALLER ID PRACTICES

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has opened
an investigation of Wiltel Telephone Corporation (Wiltel) for
allegedly releasing phone numbers of California callers to
out-of-state parties without notice or blocking, a violation
of CPUC and federal Caller ID regulations.

The Commission told Wiltel, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company,
it has 30 days to notify its customers that their billing
numbers are being disclosed in interstate calls. The notice
must be separate from the customer's bills and by first class
mail.  Wiltel must submit within 45 days a report to the CPUC
detailing numbers of customers, volume of intrastate and
interstate calls, and names of all resellers of Wiltel service
in the state.

If the company is found to have violated CPUC regulations, it
could face monetary penalties.

Specifically, Wiltel has been passing on billing numbers, but
for residential customers these are usually the same as the
home number, although they often differ for business lines. In
either case, Wiltel's California subscribers, many of them
with unlisted  numbers, do not know that their numbers are
being disclosed on the other end of a long distance call.

The problem was revealed in late 1994 when two California
customers complained to the Commission. While local phone
companies do not provide Caller ID, that is, allow a called
party to see the number of the person calling, billing numbers
are forwarded to the long distance phone companies and to
subscribers of 800 and 900 services for billing and routing
purposes.

OPEN DEVELOPMENT INTRODUCES PREPAID CALLING CARD
SYSTEM SUPPORTING MORE THAN 100 MILLION ACCOUNTS

Open Client/Server-Based Prepaid Calling Card System Brings
Customized Service Capabilities to RBOCs and Interexchange
Carriers

Open Development Corporation, of Westwood, MA, developers and
marketers of software and services to telecommunications
companies, has introduced openMEDIA Prepaid, a network-based
prepaid calling card system designed to handle over 100
million accounts and support more administrative features than
any other prepaid system in the industry.  openMEDIA Prepaid,
which is marketed to service providers, can easily process 20
million call minutes per month.

openMEDIA Prepaid provides many advanced administrative and
performance features required to provide fast, reliable
prepaid service. These features include fraud control,
multiple reseller and rating plan support, call branding and
activation of cards and lots through IVR (interactive voice
response), as well as the ability to handle large call volumes
associated with millions of accounts. In addition, openMEDIA
Prepaid handles administration, billing and customer care
functions using Windows-based applications.

"Using our openMEDIA Prepaid system, service providers can
deliver reliable, high-volume phone service 24 hours, seven
days a week," said Jeff Laughlin, vice president of marketing.
"Our system is designed for maximum performance and
reliability. The use of industry-standard hardware and
software guarantees system flexibility and scaleability so our
customers can quickly respond and adapt to new market demands
now and into the future. "

Prepaid phone cards let users make calls easily without a
phone company account, allow the use of pay phones without
coins, and are cost-effective because there are no surcharges
or operator assist charges. For businesses, prepaid phone
cards make it easier to track expenses and can be used as
promotional items and giveaways. Yankee Group analysts expect
prepaid phone cards to represent a $1 billion market by the
end of 1996. "We use Open Development is openMEDIA Prepaid
phone card system for our standard retail offering as well as
our NFL "Let's Talk Football" sweepstakes promotion because it
is the most available, scaleable and reliable system we've
seen to date," said Gordon Allen, president of GTE Card
Services. "The system's database implementation enables us to
easily and efficiently manage account transaction processing
and card distribution," added Allen.

openMEDIA Prepaid is designed to be a reseller platform.  It
offers a hierarchical database of agents, subagents, lots and
cards, making it easy to set up new business partners, create
special promotions and generate hundreds of thousands of cards
in a matter of minutes. In addition, it provides the options
necessary to support one or more resellers. Each reseller, in
turn, can set up a number of prepaid phone card campaigns.

openMEDIA Prepaid is the first application to be fully
integrated on openMEDIA, Open Development's robust, open
client/server-based Enhanced Services Platform (ESP).
openMEDIA is a core foundation from which all applications
can run and share platform resources. The platform is built on
a fully integrated Oracle 7 database, PowerBuilder front-end
applications, IBM RS/6000 or Stratus Continuum processors, a
Summa Four or Excel Switch, Dialogic-based voice response
units and a voice recognition option.

The use of the Oracle 7 Relational Database Management System
(RDBMS) and the Oracle Parallel Server option ensures database
integrity and system scaleability. The platform also offers an
integrated client/server database, a real-time billing and
rating engine, and integrated ACD for customer care, IVR for
service creation environment, and is sold in a fault tolerant
and highly available configuration.

Prices for openMEDIA Prepaid start at $150,000. A standard
package includes all hardware, software, the VRU switch and
the CPU. openMEDIA Prepaid is available immediately directly
from Open Development and selected VARs.

Open Development Corporation develops and markets software
solutions to telecommunications companies worldwide. The
company is recognized as an industry leader in highly
available, large network-based enhanced service platforms and
prepaid phone card systems. Founded in 1992, Open Development
is committed to providing its customers with high performance,
full-featured telecommunications services for wireline and
wireless networks worldwide. Open Development's products are
implemented as strategic business solutions because they
enable service providers to expand their offerings, grow their

COMPUTER DATA PROTECTOR AND TELEPHONE
PRIVACY DEVICE INTRODUCED

Are there interruptions from coworkers or family members
picking up the telephone when you are dialed into your
favorite on-line service or cruising the INTERNET? Ever wonder
if someone else is listening in on your telephone
conversation?

If these are problems you are experiencing because of a shared
telephone line, Dalco Products has the answer without the
need of installing a dedicated line. Just place one of their
Data Protector line cords on the extensions that are causing
the interruptions.

Any device equipped with the Data Protector cannot access or
interrupt a line that is already in use. This prevents devices
on the same line from causing interruptions when downloading
files, and eavesdropping on calls already in progress. This is
an ideal device for the home office or anyplace where line
privacy is required.

Installation is simple. Just swap out your existing modular
telephone cord with the Data Protector cord. An in-line
coupler is provided if you need additional length in your
installation. Retail price is $16.95 each with discounts when
purchasing 3 or more devices.

Dealer inquiries are welcomed. For more information, contact
Dalco Products 200 West Main, Roberts, WI 54023. Phone
(715)749-0160 or Fax (715)749-3960.

NEW AMERITECH PAGING SERVICE BOOMING
IN CHICAGO AND ROLLS OUT IN DETROIT

Success of a new paging service from Ameritech, Calling Party
Pays - Paging (CPPP), has been so good in Chicago that
SourceOne Wireless is rolling out the service in Detroit under
their brand name, "FREEDOMPage."

Ameritech developed the Calling Party Pays - Paging service
and currently is the only company offering it in the U.S. As
the first CPPP customer, SourceOne Wireless earned $45,000
from Ameritech in usage fees generated during the audit period
the service was available in the Chicago market.

"This breakthrough technology now allows us to offer a paging
service to people who would not have considered one
previously. We particularly see interest among working parents
with school children to check on them, adults caring for
elderly parents and small business and trades business
people," said Neil Cox, president of Ameritech Information
Industry Services.

A CPPP subscriber no longer pays for incoming calls -- the
caller pays. The only cost for the paging subscriber is
purchasing a pager or converting a current one and the
activation fee, which means no monthly service fee for the
subscriber. Callers to a paging number are given a voice
announcement describing the service fee before the call is
connected. The caller has the option to hang up or complete
the call. The fee is determined by the third-party paging
provider offering the service, but usually runs a flat rate of
25 cents per call.

CPPP was tariffed in Illinois last August after a trial that
ran in Chicago since May. "Since then, 600,000 calls a month
are being processed and new subscribers are being added at the
rate of 15,000 per month," Cox said.

"We are extremely optimistic about FREEDOMPage in Detroit,"
said Dave Trop, chief executive officer of SourceOne Wireless.
"Our results to date in Chicago are well above expectations,
and we anticipate this service to be as successful as our
traditional paging services."

Ameritech is now accepting orders from Michigan, Ohio and
Wisconsin and expects to be accepting orders throughout
Indiana soon. The company also is exploring opportunities
outside the region.

Calling Party Pays (CPP) is built off the Advanced
Intelligent Network (AIN), the most advanced AIN platform
available today and the basis of many new enhanced services.
Other CPP product enhancements off the AIN platform are in
development, and Ameritech is offering technological and
marketing consulting services on CPPP to other companies,
according to Roger Sosa, CPP product manager.

For more information, call 312/335-2919 or fax 312/335-2926.

WISCONSIN PSC APPROVES NEW RATE STRUCTURE (ALREADY IN PLACE)

The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has reviewed the
record of the Utelco, Inc., rate restructuring proposal and
approved it at an open meeting. Utelco is a Monroe-based
telecommunications company that provides service to
approximately 12,500 customers in eight exchanges in the
Monroe area.

On December 29, 1994, Utelco implemented, subject to a refund
pending PSC review, a new rate structure that charges for
local telephone calls on a per minute basis. The Commission
received three petitions containing 1,258 signatures
requesting that it investigate the proposal, and conduct a
public hearing to determine if the Utelco proposal was in the
public interest.

Two public hearings were held in Monroe on September 25,
1995. At the hearings, 287 appearance slips were submitted by
individual Utelco customers and 206, or 72 percent of the
appearances, indicated they supported the Utelco proposal. In
addition, 46 Utelco customers testified both in support and in
opposition to the proposal.

The Commission found that Utelco residential customers
averaged approximately $8.53 in usage charges for the first
six months of 1995, and that 72 percent of the residential
customers were saving money under the Utelco plan.

GTE CARD SERVICES KICKS OFF FOOTBALL
SWEEPSTAKES USING NFL GTE PREPAID PHONE CARDS

Open Development's openMEDIA Prepaid Application Tackles Call
Management and Contest Administration

GTE Card Services Incorporated, which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of GTE Information Services Incorporated, and Open
Development Corporation, a software developer for
telecommunications service providers, announced a nationwide
football sweepstakes to promote "Let's Talk Football" NFL GTE
Prepaid Phone Cards.

GTE's Prepaid phone card and the administration of the
consumer contest are both automated by openMEDIA Prepaid, a
new prepaid calling card system built for high-volume
applications by Open Development. Open Development's openMEDIA
Prepaid system allows RBOCs and high-volume interexchange
carriers to offer reliable processing of debit calling-card
service.

GTE Card Services is sponsoring the "Let's Talk Football"
sweepstakes, which runs through December 31, 1995, to promote
its officially licensed NFL GTE Prepaid Phone Cards. The cards
feature officially licensed helmets and team logos from all 30
NFL franchises. They are sold in retail locations nationwide
in $10 denominations.

"We've been extremely pleased with the performance of our
prepaid business," said Gordon Allen, president, GTE Card
Services. "Due to significant growth in the prepaid phone card
market, our sweepstakes program has doubled in size. The
scaleability of Open Development's architecture has allowed
us to respond efficiently to this increased demand.

openMEDIA Prepaid offers service providers sophisticated
administrative features such as fraud control, multiple
reseller and rating plan support, call branding and
interactive voice response activation of cards and lots. The
application can handle millions of accounts and performs
administration, billing and customer service functions using
Windows-based applications. The system also tracks the sale
and usage of each card issued, which helps retailers determine
the effectiveness of their marketing strategies.

With the help of features built into the openMEDIA Prepaid
application, consumers can determine over the telephone,
without speaking with a contest representative, whether they
have won a sweepstakes prize. Consumers can call an 800 number
and enter their unique personal identification PIN, found on
the back of the card, to determine whether they have a winning
card. Prizes include official NFL merchandise, GTE Prepaid
Phone Cards featuring NFL teams, and a grand prize that
includes a trip for two to Super Bowl XXX in Phoenix, Ariz.

"We did an extensive market study and found that Open
Development's combination of availability, scaleability and
reliability are far superior to any other calling card
technologies," added GTE's Gordon Allen. "Open Development's
flexible database technology greatly simplifies the task of
running special promotions such as the sweepstakes, and its
tracking and reporting features help our distributors manage
their businesses more effectively every day."

The prepaid phone cards work much like a debit card with a
preset spending limit. The phone system tracks the prepaid
minutes and informs the cardholder how many long-distance
minutes remain. Once all of the available minutes have been
used, consumers can "recharge" the prepaid phone card using a
credit card.

openMEDIA Prepaid, designed as a reseller platform, is built
on a fully integrated Oracle 7 database, PowerBuilder front-
end applications, IBM RS/6000 or Stratus Continuum processors,
a Summa Four or Excel Switch, Dialogic-based voice response
units and a voice recognition option.

Open Development Corporation develops and markets software
solutions to telecommunications companies worldwide. The
company is recognized as an industry leader in highly
available, large network-based enhanced service platforms and
prepaid phone card systems. Founded in 1992, Open Development
is committed to providing its customers with high performance,
full-featured telecommunications services for wireline and
wireless networks worldwide. Open Development's products are
implemented as strategic business solutions because they
enable service providers to expand their offerings, grow their
customer base, and increase revenue.

GTE Card Services Incorporated, based in Irving, Tex., is a
wholly owned subsidiary of GTE Information Services
Incorporated.  GTE Corporation, the parent company of GTE
Information Services Incorporated, is the world's
fourth-largest publicly owned telecommunications company.

GERMAN MINISTRIES EDGE TOWARDS AGREEMENT ON TELECOMS REGULATOR

The German economics ministry is looking increasingly likely to take
full responsibility for the new German telecommunications regulator,
after a lengthy and acrimonious battle within the country's ruling
three-party coalition.

Although a political agreement has not yet been reached, a final
decision is anticipated before next Wednesday (January 24) when the
ministry of post and telecommunications is hoping to submit to the
cabinet the draft version of its new telecommunications bill which will
pave the way for liberalisation in 1998.  The bill was supposed to be
submitted in December but has been delayed by the dispute over
regulation (Telecom Markets, 283/1).

Political negotiations are continuing in an attempt to settle the issue
by the deadline of January 24, to which the government is determined to
adhere.  Assuming that agreement can be reached on the fundamental
issue of which ministry to which the new regulator should report, the
details of the agreement can be worked out later during the legislative
process.

The first parliamentary reading of the bill is due to take place on
February 1 and the relevant parliamentary committee will begin
discussing it on February 7.  The bill is expected to be approved in
June.

The dispute has involved a cabinet battle between post and
telecommunications minister Wolfgang Botsch (who is a member of the
Christian Social Union, CSU), economics minister Gunter Rexrodt (a
member of the Free Democrat Party, FDP) and minister of technology and
education Jurgen Ruttgers (a member of the Christian Democrat Party,
CDU).

It appears that agreement has already been reached to split
responsibility for telecommunications regulation, with the economic
ministry's Federal Cartel Office taking charge of competition issues,
and another higher governmental authority taking over everything else.

It now seems likely that the economics ministry will gain control of
the new authority as well -- despite the opposition of the CSU and the
CDU.

This outcome reflects the fact that Rexrodt is continuing to wield
considerable political influence, despite the weakening position of the
FDP within the coalition.

BT, AT&T AND C&W GET SET TO FIGHT FOR THE HAND OF FININVEST

BT and AT&T have emerged as rivals to Cable & Wireless Europe in a race
to set up a strategic alliance with Fininvest, the Italian conglomerate
owned by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Each of the suitors is anxious to do a deal with Fininvest in order to
gain access to the national terrestrial broadcast network run by its
audiovisual subsidiary Mediaset.  This network could be used as a
springboard for opportunities in both fixed and wireless
communications.

BT is pursuing an alliance with Fininvest through Albacom, its joint
venture with leading Italian bank Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (Telecom
Markets, 267/3).  Albacom aims to secure a partnership by taking a
small equity stake in Mediaset.

It is thought that AT&T is also interested in a stake in Mediaset.

On the other hand Cable & Wireless Europe, which is equally owned by
C&W of the UK and Veba of Germany, appears to be seeking an alliance
that might not involve any equity acquisition at all.

This could put C&WE at a disadvantage, since it is thought that
Fininvest will favour potential partners that are prepared to take a
stake in Mediaset.  However, there are indications that it might bid
for a stake in Mediaset if it has to.

Fininvest says that the exact size of the Mediaset stake to be sold
will depend on the partner, although it is unlikely to be large.
Sources suggest that it will be in the region of about five per cent.
Fininvest expects to announce its telecommunications partner in the
next couple of months, and says that a separate joint venture will
probably be established for telecommunications.

Fininvest's immediate interest is value added and cellular services.
It intends to join with its new partner in applying for one of the
personal communications network (PCN) licences that the government is
expected to put out to tender later this year (Mobile Communications,
181/1).  Fininvest says that the identity of the partner will be a key
factor in determining whether or not it decides to pursue opportunities
in basic services.

Fininvest is keen to reduce its stake in Mediaset, which runs Italy's
three main national commercial television channels controlling 43 per
cent of the total audience.  Such a reduction is necessary in order to
reduce the political pressure on Berlusconi, who is hoping to return as
prime minister after the general election which is expected to be
called soon following last week's resignation of the most recent
incumbent Lamberto Dini.  Berlusconi's standing has suffered from the
general perception that there is a serious conflict of interest between
his political role and his control of so many television outlets.

Fininvest has already disposed of 24 per cent of Mediaset, but says
that it will sell another 30 per cent or so in order to take its share
down to about 45 per cent.

In October, Fininvest sold 18.5 per cent of Mediaset for around $1.1
billion to a group of three foreign partners: Saudi Prince al Waleed
ben Talal; Leo Kirch, owner of the German-based Kirch media group; and
Nethold, the European pay-TV group controlled by South African
entrepreneur Johann Rupert.  Then at the end of December Fininvest sold
a further 5.5 per cent of Mediaset for $230 million to a group of six
leading Italian banks.

After selling a stake in Mediaset to a telecommunications partner,
Fininvest plans to divest itself of another 20 per cent to 30 per cent,
partly through sales to banks and institutional investors, and partly
through a public offering.

* Berlusconi, who served an eight-month term as prime minister in 1994,
this week went on

trial facing corruption charges.  Berlusconi, his younger brother Paolo
and four other senior Fininvest executives are accused of bribing tax
officials in order to secure favourable inspections of the books of
companies in the Fininvest group.  Paolo Berlusconi and Salvatore
Sciascia, head of Fininvest's tax department, have admitted making the
payments but claim that they were blackmailed into making them.

Silvio Berlusconi is also being investigated over three other
allegations of corruption as well as for the alleged blackmail of
Antonio Di Pietro, the magistrate largely responsible for this week's
charges.

SEVEN GROUPS IN THE RUNNING FOR STAKE IN TELECOM EIREANN

The Irish government last week finally launched its long-awaited
contest for the sale of a stake of up to 35 per cent in state-owned
telecommunications carrier Telecom Eireann -- a contest which involves
seven consortia composed of nine separate companies.

The government kicked off the process on January 12 with the
publication of an information memorandum laying out the terms of the
bid.  It indicated that it hopes to choose a winner by the end of the
summer.

Michael Lowry, the minister for transport, energy and communications,
said at the launch that the government plans to invest I#220 million of
the sale proceeds in Telecom Eireann and to retain the rest itself.

The government has not said how much it expects the sale to realise
altogether.  Some local observers this week predicted figures ranging
from #400 million to #500 million.  One City banker more conservatively
estimated #350 million, having valued the whole company at #1 billion.

The government has not confirmed that it will sell the full 35 per cent
allocation in this offering (Telecom Markets, 274/21), although this is
widely understood to be its intention.  Once the full stake has been
sold, the government plans to retain a stake of between 60 per cent and
65 per cent, and to offer up to five per cent to company employees.

The seven rival bidders are:

* the grouping of BT and US carrier MCI;
* Telia of Sweden and Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN) of the
Netherlands;
* Bell Atlantic, the US regional Bell operating company;
* AirTouch, the US cellular operator;
* GTE, the US local telephone operator;
* Singapore Telecom; and
* Tele Danmark.

The first three groups are viewed as the front runners.

The BT-led group is seen as the favourite.  The involvement of MCI, in
which BT holds a 20-per-cent stake, might help to offset political
concerns over the possibility of a UK company taking a major stake in
one of Ireland's largest companies.  One observer said a US carrier
might defuse some of the political anxieties.  MCI is also a 25-per-
cent shareholder in Concert, the global corporate services joint
venture with BT.  If BT wins the bid then Telecom Eireann would become
the local distributor of Concert services.

Another strong candidate is the team of Telia and KPN, which are
already partners in the Unisource alliance.  Last month a grouping of
KPN and another Unisource member, Swiss PTT Telecom, was the runner-up
in the contest for a stake in Belgian carrier Belgacom (Telecom
Markets, 283/5).

Two of the other bidders, Singapore Telecom and Tele Danmark, could
decide to join forces, having teamed up successfully to win the
Belgacom stake ahead of the Dutch/Swiss group.

The involvement of AirTouch is surprising since, as a cellular
operator, it is hardly likely to be interested in Telecom Eireann's
fixed business.  The company is thought to have offered to buy Eircell,
Telecom Eireann's mobile division, separately from the rest of the
company.  Such a sale would be opposed by the Communications Workers
Union, which represents the majority of Telecom Eireann workers and has
some influence on the bid.  The CWU has made clear its opposition to
any deals that involve the break-up of the carrier and a consequent
weakening of its power.

Several other potential bidders which at one time had expressed
interest had already pulled out -- including Cable & Wireless (Telecom
Markets, 277/15) and AT&T (Telecom Markets, 259/3).

How to spend the money? Lowry said last week that Telecom Eireann will
use its I#220 million share of the sale proceeds to ``restructure and
strengthen'' itself in order to meet future de-regulation of the Irish
telecommunications market.  The government is to introduce full
competition on January 1, 2000 -- two years later than most European
countries.

The government wants to see a reduction in the carrier's costs and
prices. It is thought that management might offer voluntary redundancy
to about 2,000 of the carrier's 11,000-strong workforce after the sale.
 A significant rebalancing of tariffs is also likely at some point.

In addition, the carrier is also expected to draw on the expertise of
its new partner in order to invest in the introduction of the sorts of
advanced services that are already available in other countries.

In particular, the government would like to:

* improve the standard of telecommunications services offered to
multinational companies that are interested in setting up in Ireland;

* expand the household penetration rate of telephone services;

* encourage an acceleration in the rate of subscriber growth at
Eircell;

* restructure Telecom Eireann's cable television business, Cablelink,
and develop its network in order to offer broadband services and to
make its capacity available to any other interested service providers;

* provide key personnel and technical support for Telecom Eireann.

The government admits that the introduction of a strategic partner will
probably lead to redundancies at Telecom Eireann but argues that the
economic benefits generated by increasing the carrier's efficiency will
help to create new jobs in the economy as a whole.

New regulator: Lowry also announced the proposed creation of an
independent regulator to take over the regulatory functions that are
currently performed by his ministry.  The government wants to set up
the new regulator next year.

FRENCH MINISTER PROPOSES INDEPENDENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATOR

French telecommunications minister Francois Fillon outlined the basics
of the new telecommunications law on January 9 at a round table meeting
marking the end of the consultation process that was initiated on
October 13 (Telecom Markets, 279/1).

Fillon proposed the creation of an independent telecommunications
regulator along the lines of the current television regulator, the
Conseil superieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA).  The new regulator would have
responsibility for applying regulations and imposing sanctions.  The
government would retain responsibility for handing out licences and
would establish the main rules of the game.

The minister originally suggested that his ministry should retain more
of its regulatory powers (Telecom Markets, 279/1) but was swayed by the
strong support for a more independent regulatory authority that was
demonstrated during the consultation process.

The details of the split in responsibility will not become clear until
the draft legislation is presented to parliament, probably in March.
Before that stage is reached, Fillon has to present his proposals to
the prime minister for approval.  The law is due to become law by July
1.

The minister also proposed the creation of a separate agency charged
with administering the distribution of radio frequencies.

In addition, Fillon suggested that France Telecom continue to provide
universal service with new operators contributing to a fund to
subsidise this.  The universal service obligation will initially apply
only to basic telephony but this will be reviewed in five years time in
order to take into account technological progress.

New competitors will be able to obtain licences in 1997.

No details were given of how interconnection issues would be resolved.

The telecommunications minister did not give any details of the
government's plans for France Telecom itself, but did say that he would
like to see more public discussion on France Telecom's legal status.
The highly sensitive political issue of France Telecom privatisation
was one of the causes of December's public sector strikes.  Fillon said
that prime minister Alain Juppe would make a statement on the issue
before the end of January.

FRANCE TELECOM JOINS INTERNET

France Telecom will from March 15 provide access to the Internet from
anywhere in France for the price of a local call.  As well as Internet
access it will also provide its own services on the Internet through
its France Telecom Multi Media subsidiary.

At the same time, France Telecom is also proposing to cut the cost of
its Minitel on-line service and to increase the speed of the service as
well.

C&W DROPS THE FEDERATION APPROACH AS EXECUTIVE SEARCH GOES ON

Cable & Wireless this week confirmed that it has dropped its much-
criticised ``federation'' approach towards its worldwide businesses --
the issue which prompted the dispute between executive chairman Lord
Young and chief executive James Ross and led to their departures from
the company in November (Telecom Markets, 281/12).

C&W executives said at this week's extraordinary general meeting, held
on January 15, that the company will no longer use the marketing
concept of the federation, which was created in an unsuccessful attempt
to boost its stock market value.

The loss of the federation should help with investors, said one City
analyst, who said that the ``F-word'' had serious negative
connotations, given that it had been associated with a continued
underperformance of the company's share price.  But he added that this
did not entail a significant alteration in strategy, beyond a certain
change of focus.

So the company will continue with the approach which Ross had already
begun to follow in the last few months, concentrating on core
businesses in three areas: the UK and Europe; Asia-Pacific and Hong
Kong; and the USA and the Caribbean.  Tensions arose between Ross and
Young partly because the latter continued to gather a disparate
collection of additional investments alongside these core areas.

C&W is looking at how to rationalise some of these non-core interests.
According to the same analyst: ``Investors might wonder what
investments like C&W's `Baltic Hub' add to the company's value.  They
are pretty small for a company like C&W to be involved with and profits
are a long way down the line.  They are more trouble than they are
worth.''  The company holds stakes in a number of ventures in the
Baltic region including the Latvian telecommunications carrier
Lattelekom and PLD, a long-distance and international carrier in St.
Petersburg.

But the C&W strategy could soon change again, given that the company is
hoping to appoint a new chief executive in the next few months.

Monday's EGM was called in order to approve a change in the company's
articles of association in order to allow it to appoint non-UK citizens
to the positions of chief executive and executive chairman (although
any long-term appointment is likely to involve a non-executive
chairman, in order to avoid a repeat of the Young/Ross dispute).

However, the UK government, which holds a golden share in C&W, is
insisting that only one of the two posts can go to a foreigner, a
change which was agreed by the EGM.  Since the current short-term
chairman Brian Smith is a UK citizen, this leaves the way open for an
overseas appointment as chief executive.

In the short term, the change allows New Zealander Rod Olsen, C&W's
finance director, to be formally appointed as acting chief executive (a
task he was already carrying out -- Telecom Markets, 283/15).  In the
longer term, the company is thought to be looking to recruit a
permanent chief from the US telecommunications or computer industries.

One name that has been raised is that of Richard Callahan, former
president of the international operations of US regional carrier US
West.  Analysts are more sceptical about suggestions that the company
might seek to recall Duncan Lewis, who resigned as chief executive of
C&W subsidiary Mercury Communications in September (Telecom Markets,
276/1).

There has been some surprise at the absence of any internal candidates
-- particularly Olsen, who until last November's double departure had
been tipped as the most likely successor to Ross, but will now be a
member of the appointments committee, and Linus Cheung, the chief
executive of Hongkong Telecom, the most successful business in the C&W
group, who many thought would have a chance of the top job.

C&W says that both men have issued statements saying that they do not
wish to be considered for the job -- a development that many
commentators have found puzzling.

AT&T SIGNS COLT DEAL AND GEARS UP FOR UK ROLL-OUT IN 1996

The deal that AT&T signed this week for interconnection with City of
London Telecommunications (Colt) is the first of a number of
initiatives that the US carrier is planning this year to increase its
presence in the UK market.

The deal, which will enable AT&T to enhance its coverage in London,
will be followed by a publicity event in the capital next Tuesday
(January 23) which is intended to raise the profile of its Software
Defined Network (SDN) product -- the virtual private network service
which was launched last autumn.

AT&T is likely to use the event, which will be attended by chairman
Robert Allen, to lay out its plans for new services to be launched in
the UK during 1996.

In addition to the already offered data and VPN services (Telecom
Markets, 277/8), AT&T will explain the launch dates for its 0800
freephone, UK long-distance and international simple resale (ISR)-based
international telephone services.

But the carrier's UK strategy has so far appeared rather relaxed.  Both
its long-distance and its ISR services were originally due to have
launched in the third quarter of last year (Telecom Markets, 277/8).
In addition, the company chose last month not to bid for the radio
frequencies offered by the Department of Trade and Industry for
wireless local loop services (Telecom Markets, 283/5).  Nor was it
among the bidders for the sale of long-distance carrier British Rail
Telecommunications (Telecom Markets, 280/1).  It has also previously
pulled out of negotiations to buy UK carriers Mercury Communications
and Energis (Telecom Markets, 242/1).

The interconnection between AT&T and Colt's two networks will enable
the former to gain access to Colt's London network.  In return, AT&T
will carry Colt's traffic on its ISR-based service, mainly to the USA.
When its long-distance service is available, AT&T might also carry some
of Colt's UK traffic.

The agreement between the two carriers is non-exclusive.  It is only
AT&T's third interconnection deal, following previous agreements with
BT and Mercury.  Colt has agreements with nine other carriers.

C&W OFFERS LESS TO YOUNG

The board of C&W appears set to offer Lord Young rather less than he
wanted in terms of severance pay.  Young is thought to have been
looking for somewhere between #2.5 million and #4 million.  But C&W is
understood to have offered less than a year's salary plus his pension
entitlements, worth a total of less than #1 million.

The company is to invest $28.3 million in an undersea cable linking

OFTEL MAKES FURTHER DELAY ON STANDARD INTERCONNECTION CHARGES

The Office of Telecommunications (Oftel) is likely to put off until
next month its long-awaited determination on interim standard
interconnection charges for 1995-96, which could offer savings of 35
per cent over existing rates.

Oftel had hoped to issue the determination this month.  But it has had
to hold back because it is still calculating whether certain costs
should be excluded from the charges paid by other carriers for using
BT's network.

The regulator said before Christmas that it would have to gather more
information on the costs incurred on such elements as BT redundancies,
the running of chairman Sir Iain Vallance's office and the company's
advertising campaigns (Telecom Markets, 283/14) which BT said should be
paid for by other carriers via its interconnection charges.

These costs account for 15 per cent of the total cost of
interconnection, in addition to the 20-per-cent reduction predicted by
Don Cruickshank, director general of telecommunications in October
(Telecom Markets, 279/1), when the charges were originally to have been
issued (Telecom Markets, 277/1).

``Oftel has to be very careful on this,'' said one observer, although
the regulator is still thought keen to reduce the charges by a further
15 per cent to give a 35-per-cent reduction in total.

SERVICE PROVIDERS

Oftel's consultation document on the role of service providers is
likely to attract opposition from telecommunications network carriers
when it is published in the next few weeks.

Carriers fear that the document will seek, in line with European Union
proposals, to establish the principle of equal access for service
providers, such as resellers and value-added service suppliers.

Service providers would then be entitled to cost-based interconnection
rates rather than the retail rates that are currently charged for using
a carrier's network.  Such a change in their regulatory status would
make them much more competitive as well as reducing the revenue
received by carriers.  ``It's a contentious issue,'' said one carrier.

Oftel complained in July after publication of its policy document,
Effective Competition: Framework for Action (Telecom Markets, 274/15),
that few service providers had bothered to respond.  But a number,
including the UK Internet access provider Pipex, have since become more
vocal.

The service provider document was originally to have been published in
December (Telecom Markets, 282/1) but the welter of other proposals led
to a postponement.

OFTEL'S FAIR TRADING PROPOSALS

The regulator last month published for consultation its controversial
proposed licence amendment on anti-competitive practice (Telecom
Markets, 283/14).  BT immediately expressed ``disappointment'' that
Oftel was determined to adopt what it called ``sweeping new powers''.

BT has until March, when the consultation period is due to end, to
decide whether to accept the licence amendment.  If it does not, Oftel
will refer the issue to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

MERCURY'S RULES RELAXED

Oftel last month proposed to remove a number of conditions from
Mercury's operating licence in order to put it in a stronger position
to compete against BT and smaller rivals in the UK telecommuni-cations
market.  In particular, Mercury will no longer have to publish tariffs
28 days in advance of when they become effective.  Instead, it will
have to publish the tariffs on the same day as their commercial launch,
although other telecommunications carriers, such as Colt or MFS, do not
have to publish their tariffs at all.

However, Cruickshank said that Mercury should still be defined as a
dominant carrier in the international-calls market where it has a
considerable market share.

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT IN RETHINK ON NTT BREAK-UP

Newly-elected Japanese prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his three-
party coalition government appear to be coming round to the view that
national carrier Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) should not be
broken up, favouring instead a broader policy of deregulation that does
not focus solely of restructuring NTT.

Other influential organisations within Japan also seem less certain
about whether a radical restructuring of NTT represents the best way
forward.  The Keidanren, the federation of Japanese business interests,
published a report on the future of NTT on January 9, but was unable to
give a definitive answer because opinion was split down the middle.

These developments come shortly before the appearance of the long-
awaited report on NTT by the Telecommunications Council, an advisory
panel of high-level industrialists and civil servants.  The Council was
set up last April and given until the end of next month to draw up
plans for the future structure and management of NTT (Telecom Markets,
268/1).

The report will be sent to the ministry of post and telecommunications
(MPT), a long-standing champion of a break-up which shows no sign of
changing its mind.  The MPT is due to present its proposals on NTT to
the Japanese Parliament at the end of March.

Increasing competition: The arguments in favour of breaking up NTT are
largely focused on competitive issues.  NTT dominates local services
with a 98 per cent market share, according to the Institute for
Japanese-European Technology Studies at the University of Edinburgh.
It is argued that reorganising NTT's local service business into a
number of regional operating companies would encourage new entrants to
the market.  It is thought that it would be easier for new entrants to
compete against regional NTT units than against a single, monolithic
NTT.

It is also argued, by the powerful ministry of international trade and
industry (Miti) among others, that if NTT is allowed to continue to
dominate the market for local services, the development of multimedia
and interactive services could be stifled.

Dr Martin Fransman, director of the Institute for Japanese-European
Technology Studies, believes that there are broader issues at stake and
that break-up NTT will not in itself create more competition.  In a
recent report, NTT and Japan's telecommunications industry at the
crossroads, Fransman argues that one of the most important factors
effecting future competition in Japan will be the ease and cost at
which new entrants will be able to interconnect with NTT's network.

Fransman says that breaking up NTT or any other such measure will make
little difference unless actual access charges are transparent and
based on real costs.  If this is not the case, new entrants will not be
able to calculate the returns they can expect, and so providers of
capital might be reluctant to invest.  In addition, the government
needs to put in place clear and explicit procedures for negotiating
interconnection agreements, as well as a neutral body to settle any
disputes that might arise.

NTT appears to be making concessions, and in October indicated that it
was prepared to give full and equal access to its local network
(Telecom Markets, 278/15).  However, the move received a lukewarm
reception from analysts as NTT gave no indication as to how it would
implement the new regime.  Critics suggested that the real reason for
the announcement was the company's desire to ease the pressure for its
break-up.

Fransman also favours a break-down of the strict demarcation between
international and domestic long-distance services.  NTT is currently
banned from offering international services, which are the preserve of
Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), International Digital Communications (IDC)
and International Telecom Japan (ITJ).  In turn, the three
international operators are banned from offering domestic long-distance
services.  These are reserved for NTT, DDI, Teleway Japan and Japan
Telecom -- although NTT has by far the largest market share with about
60 per cent.

Fransman notes that NTT is one of the few national carriers not allowed
to offer international services.  As a result, Japan is one of the few
countries that does not have a genuine contender in the international
telecommunications market, given that KDD, IDC and ITJ are all
relatively small in international terms.  Fransman argues that NTT is
the only carrier in Japan with the size and resources necessary to
become a significant player.  But he concedes that given the time it
takes to establish such a position NTT might find itself too far behind
established players to make much impact.

Hashimoto was finance minister between 1989 and 1991.  The finance
ministry holds the government's 65-per-cent stake in NTT.  As a result
it is one of the strongest opponents of a break-up, other than NTT
itself.  Opponents of a break-up argue that this step would result in a
loss of existing economies of scale, and a weakening of research and
development efforts which are said to be crucial for the development of
multimedia services (Telecom Markets, 262/4).  In addition, if NTT is
split into a number of regional companies, it will be that much harder
to induce them to work together to build a national optical-fibre
information superhighway.

Sceptics note that profits from NTT feed into the national budget, and
that the finance ministry is probably reluctant to jeopardise a
valuable revenue stream by splitting up the company.

The MPT position: The MPT will, in drawing up its own proposals,
consider not only the recommendations from the Telecommunications
Council, but also the report produced last year by the Administrative
Reform Commission, part of the prime minister's office.  This report
outlines the most radical blueprint for restructuring NTT (Telecom
Markets, 276/6).

The commission recommends that NTT's local service business should be
divided into four regional operating companies covering separate areas,
and that these companies should be allowed to offer cable television
services (which NTT is currently unable to do).  The commission also
recommends that NTT's domestic long-distance business is spun-off into
a separate company, which would for the first time be allowed to offer
international services.  The three international carriers would in turn
be allowed to domestic long-distance market.

However, it is unclear whether the MPT will propose such radical
measures.  Some analysts believe a more acceptable compromise could be
adopted whereby NTT is simply split into two companies: one for long-
distance services and another for local services.

PARTNERS PUT FINAL TOUCHES TO PHOENIX TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALLIANCE

US long-distance carrier Sprint said last week that it would complete
its Phoenix alliance with Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom by the
end of this month, and that it expects to launch services in the first
half of this year.

The deal involves Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom jointly taking a
20-per-cent-stake in Sprint, split equally between them, at a total
cost of between $3.5 billion and $4.2 billion.

The final price will be influenced by the valuation given to Sprint
Cellular, which is to be spun off from the rest of Sprint in the first
half of this year.  The Deutsche Telekom/France Telecom stake will be
in the new non-cellular core of Sprint.

A special meeting of Sprint shareholders will be held on January 29 to
vote on proposals relating to the investment as well as on the spin-off
of the cellular arm.

Under the terms of the investment agreement, Deutsche Telekom and
France Telecom will acquire the shares at the price of $48.704 per
share.

The moves follow last month's decisions by the US Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) and Department of Justice to grant
their approval to Phoenix (Telecom Markets, 283/16).

The joint venture had already received preliminary approval from the
European Commission last October (Telecom Markets, 279/6).  The EC is
unlikely to grant final approval to Phoenix -- and to Atlas, the
European arm of the joint venture -- until the second quarter of this
year.  But competition commissioner Karel Van Miert has indicated that
the EC would not challenge any move to launch services before final
approval has been given.

WEST EUROPEAN SERVICES MARKET SET TO REACH $212 BILLION IN 2000

The value of the West European market for telecommunications services
will increase from $160 billion in 1995 to $212 billion in 2000
according to a new report, New Opportunities in European Telecommuni-
cations, produced by UK consultancy Ovum.

The report says that the bulk of the $50 billion increase in the
service market -- defined as the revenues generated by both fixed and
mobile networks -- will be generated by growth in the mobile market.  It
predicts that the value of the fixed market will increase by 1.76 per
cent from $141.5 billion in 1995 to $154.4 billion in 2000, but that
the size of the mobile market will rise by 25 per cent from $18.9
billion to $56.8 billion in 2000.

According to the report -- which covers the 15 countries of the European
Union, plus Norway and Switzerland -- the best fixed-network
opportunities will arise in Austria, France and Germany.  These
countries all have large markets, incumbent operators that are
vulnerable to some degree and the likelihood of pro-competitive
regulatory regimes.  The report excludes Italy from this group on the
grounds that its regulatory framework is likely to be rather less
favourable to competition.

The countries with the lowest level of fixed-network opportunity,
partly because of the existing degree of exploitation, are Denmark,
Finland, Norway and Sweden.  The report says that in these countries
the penetration of fixed telephony is already high and cannot increase
much further.  Fixed-network revenues are expected to decline due to
the increasing degree of substitution by mobile-network services.  In
addition, these countries have small markets and efficient incumbent
operators which already charge low prices.

The report also believes that:

* The best opportunities in the long-distance market will be in
Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

* The best opportunities in the local-loop market will be in the UK and
Ireland.  Tariff rebalancing and the availability of other
infrastructures such as cable television networks are key factors in
making the local market more attractive to new entrants.

* The best opportunities for the resale of capacity will be in France,
Germany, Greece, and Ireland.  The best opportunities for resellers are
in countries with low leased-line prices and high trunk prices.

* The best opportunities for mobile operators will be in Belgium and
Switzerland, both of which have underdeveloped mobile markets.

The report argues that the chances for the success of a new
telecommunications venture will be affected by a number of factors
including the regulatory environment, the strength of the incumbent
operator and the size and expected growth rate of each market.  It says
that the regulatory environment will be a key determinant of the ease
of entry for new competitors.

Given that the EU is leaving it up to individual countries to interpret
rules on such issues as interconnection charges, significant regulatory
differences can be expected to arise.  Even if the EU were to choose to
enforce its requirements it would take around three years to complete
the process -- one year to discuss an infringement with a member state
and to notify it of proceedings, and then two years to pursue the
matter through the courts.  The independence of the national regulator
and the extent of its experience will be crucial factors in determining
the opportunities available in a particular market.

DEUTSCHE BAHN SHORTLIST

Deutsche Bahn, the German federal railway operator, last week selected
the shortlist for the 49-per-cent stake it is offering in new
subsidiary DBKom,

narrowing down the number of bids to either three or four.

The remaining bidders are thought to include: Communications Network
International (CNI) and AT&T; Thyssen and BellSouth; Viag; and RWE.

Communications Network International (CNI) is a joint venture between
Mannesmann and Deutsche Bank which also has a cooperation deal with the
Uniworld alliance between AT&T and Unisource (Telecom Markets, 276/2).

German steel-based conglomerate Thyssen and US regional
telecommunications operator BellSouth established a joint venture in
February 1995 with a view to obtaining a full operating licence after
liberalisation (Telecom Markets, 262/15).

Viag is believed to be bidding along with Thyssen and BellSouth for a
stake in DBKom and to be considering possibly extending the
relationship.

However, Viag's name has also been linked with RWE -- there are reports
that RWE may be considering joining the InterKom alliance between
energy utility Viag and BT.  RWE has been looking for new partners
following its withdrawal from the CNI joint venture with Mannesmann and
Deutsche Bank last September and its failure to strike a deal with AT&T
(Telecom Markets, 276/2).

Vebacom, the telecommunications subsidiary of industrial conglomerate
Veba, did not make it to the shortlist.  Vebacom is particularly
disappointed as it already has an access agreement to unused capacity
on the Deutsche Bahn network (Telecom Markets, 283/2), and was bidding
for a stake in Deutsche Bahn in the hope of deepening this
relationship.

However, Vebacom this week (January 16) signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) with Mannesmann Eurokom, the telecommunications
division of Mannesmann, to form a 50:50 joint venture company.  This
company, headquartered in Hanover, is intended to establish a national
telecommuni-cations network to carry public switched telephony from
1998 as well as other telecommunications services, cable television and
broadband services.  This might give Vebacom a second chance at
obtaining a stake in DBKom.

The number of potential telecommunications alliances in Germany seems
to be growing by the day, but many are unlikely to come to fruition,
according to Malcolm Ross of consultants Arthur D Little.  ``Many of
these will be dirty weekends rather than marriages,'' he says.
``Whether many will result in children is doubtful''.

Second phase bids are expected to be submitted for evaluation around
April and a final decision is expected by the end of the second quarter
of this year.

ROW OVER DEUTSCHE TELEKOM RATES

Deutsche Telekom's new rate structure, announced on New Year's Day, has
been criticised by numerous politicians including post and
telecommunications minister Wolfgang Botsch.

The increases in local call rates and decreases in long-distance rates,
which form part of an ongoing process of tariff rebalancing, have been
extremely badly received.

Deutsche Telekom is being urged to introduce a rebate system modelled
on existing `friends and family' systems as soon as possible, in order
to take the edge off the rate increases.  Deutsche Telekom claims that
this will not be possible until the end of the year at the earliest,
because not enough telephone lines are yet digitalised.

The political temperature was also raised by a computer error on New
Year's Day which resulted in residential customers being charged
weekday rates instead of a lower holiday tariff for domestic long-
distance calls.  Deutsche Telekom has run a big advertising campaign
apologising for the billing mistake and has announced that it will
offer households 30 free units as compensation.  Deutsche Telekom also
intends to offer cheaper rates than normal on the last Sunday in
February.

The January 29 meeting of the telecommuni-cations regulatory council is
expected to consider the above issues and possibly exert extra pressure
on Deutsche Telekom.

NYNEX RESTRUCTURE IN BID TO SHAKE `LEAST-EFFICIENT' TAG

The restructuring plan unveiled last week by Nynex CableComms, which
involves the shedding of 11 per cent of the 2,900-strong workforce,
follows months of criticism from City analysts that the company is the
least efficient of the UK's cable operators.

Nynex hopes that the cutting of 310 jobs and a saving of between #7
million and #10 million a year will enable it to reach operating
cashflow breakeven by the end of this year.

But the company's financial problems were underlined this week by the
publication of its operating statistics for 1995, which showed total
revenues for the year of #85 million -- up from the 1994 figure of #41
million, but still #23 million short of some analysts expectations.

The restructuring involves the centralisation of much management, a
move which gained a mixed reception from analysts.

The company said that more than 70 per cent of the job cuts -- which
will be effected through a mixture of sackings, voluntary redundancies
and natural wastage -- resulted from a #25 million investment in
information-technology systems to handle areas such as subscriber
management and tele-sales.

The axe is falling most heavily in the sales and marketing areas,
reflecting a move away from door-to-door sales towards tele-sales, an
approach which Nynex regards as more efficient (it accounted for a
quarter of sales in 1995).

Senior management will be cut by 20 per cent.  John Killian, who has
just taken over as chief executive, will not be replaced in his old
role of chief operating officer.  Strategy director Sally Davis, who
drew up the restructuring plan with Killian and chief financial officer
Nicholas Mearing-Smith, is moving to the parent company's New York
office to undertake a similar role.  There was only one senior
casualty: Peter Morse, executive director of the southern block of
franchises.

Nynex had become increasingly sensitive to criticism from industry
analysts that its cost-base was much higher than that of all other UK
operators.  Given its size, one might have expected lower costs through
economies of scale.

The company's net operating expenses for staff, marketing and
administration represented 132 per cent of its revenues for the nine
months to end-September 1995.  The figure compares with one of 80 per
cent for TeleWest, the UK's biggest cable operator.

The UK Nynex company grew from 200 people four years ago to 2,900 by
the end of 1995.  As one senior executive put it, ``we grew by 300 too
many.  That's not so bad.  A cable company bases its growth on an
expected customer base and expected revenues.  We did not get the
television customers we expected, but the whole industry expected
more.''

In the past, Nynex has justified its position as the big spender of UK
cable by saying that its customer service and churn rate -- the
proportion of subscribers who quit the system -- are the best in the
industry and that it is counter-productive to rush to breakeven on the
basis of poorer service.  The company's churn rate may no longer be the
best, but it is close to it.  At 30 per cent, it contrasts strongly
with TeleWest's 45.7 per cent.

On the other hand, Nynex's operating statistics for 1995 show that
penetration (the number of subscribers expressed as a percentage of
those who could take the service because the cable passes their homes)
is running at 19.8 per cent -- lower than the latest TeleWest figure of
21.4 per cent and the industry average of 20.8 per cent.  Nynex knows
that it must increase its sales, but suggests that the churn rather
than the penetration figures may turn out to be the biggest contributor
to long-term success.

Nynex's spending on customer service is arguably well-justified.
Arguably, too, TeleWest should have spent far more to keep its churn
lower.  Indeed, it has recently increased its spending.  According to
Mearing-Smith, ``it costs you money to get to where Nynex has in terms
of customer service.  We don't want to lose what we have, but we need
to make it more economic.''

Nynex hopes by the end of this year to reduce the cost of sales,
marketing and administration to 50 per cent of its revenue-base -- the
level it expects TeleWest to achieve.

Nynex's restructuring could be seen as part of a wider trend within the
industry.  As one senior analyst put it, ``it's not a general panic,
but there is a sharpening of focus on why cable television is still not
selling well.''  Last year, TeleWest carried out a small restructuring
in its London South operations, shedding 20 jobs.

The Nynex moves to some extent reflect a change in corporate culture
resulting from the UK company turning itself last June from a wholly-
owned foreign subsidiary of a monolithic regional Bell telephone
company into a public company (though major policy decisions still have
to go through the slow process of gaining US approval).

The company was keen to dispel any impression that the restructuring
represented the opening shots of a new management style.  It said that
it was purely a coincidence that the moves were announced during the
week of Connell's departure.

As Mearing-Smith pointed out, the restructuring plan was drawn up in
the wake of a ``priority resourcing'' study carried out by Coopers &
Lybrand, the management consultants.  This was started in October,
before it was clear that Connell's tour of duty would end at the turn
of the year.

Mearing-Smith said that the restructuring was ``the kind of grown-up
behaviour shown by big companies and shareholders should feel good
about it.''

Not all observers accept the merits of centralisation.  One analyst,
Andrew Walsh of NatWest Markets, said: ``I don't think it is a good
thing.  At this stage of the operation, it makes sense to put
management resources as close to the franchises being managed as
possible.''

Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes that, even with
the changes, Nynex will find it hard to reach breakeven by the end of
the year.

Even so, analysts generally welcomed the moves.  Nynex was, after all,
only doing what they had criticised it for not doing in the past.
However, the share price fell 2p on the day of the announcement
(January 8), closing at 105p.  It fell further this week to reach an
all-time low of 95p on Monday before recovering to 97p on Wednesday
afternoon after the 1995 figures were released.

INTERNET SERVICES TO BE WORTH #12 BILLION BY 2002, SAYS REPORT

There will be more than 200 million worldwide users of the Internet by
the end of 2002, according to a new report from London stockbroker
Durlacher.  These users will be accessing services via more than 150
million subscriptions, and generating annual revenues of more than #12
billion.

There were estimated to be about 33.4 million Internet users worldwide
at the end of 1995, on 15.3 million subscriptions.

The report differentiates between two main methods of connection: 1)
connection via dedicated Internet service providers (ISPs); and 2)
connection via full online bulletin board services (BBS) -- an
environment where the service provider brings together a finite
collection of information and services.

The report predicts that the number of subscribers to BBS services will
grow from about 13 million at the end of 1995 to over 84 million at the
end of 2002.  The annual revenues generated by these subscribes will
increase from about #667 million to more than #8 billion.

The number of subscribers to dedicated ISPs, on the other hand, will
grow from around 1.7 million at the end of 1995 to over 70 million by
the end of 2002.  The annual revenues will increase from around #127
million to over #4 billion.

The report thus predicts that there will be 154 million online
subscriptions by 2002. It anticipates a duplication factor of 25 per
cent, so that approximately 38 million subscribers will have more than
one account.  This means that there will be 116 million separate
subscribers in 2002.

The value of the UK market alone will grow from #35 million in 1995 to
more than #900 million by the turn of the century.

LOOT CHALLENGES BT

The London advertising daily, Loot, says it is seeking ``tens of
thousands of pounds'' compensation from BT for a fault on its lines
which prevented potential advertisers from getting through to the
publication for 11 hours.  BT says that Loot has no grounds for
compensation, since engineers had been on site within the time
specified in the paper's maintenance contract.  BT also disagrees with
Loot's claim that the lines went down because engineers cut through an
optical-fibre cable, saying that the break-down was due to faulty
software.

ROME DROPS TARIFF INCREASE

The Italian government has frozen controversial changes to telephone
charges in the face of unexpectedly heavy criticism.  The post and
telecommunications ministry said that it had not withdrawn the tariff
rebalancing decrees -- which would increase the cost of local calls --
but would be talking to unions before implementing the measures.

POLISH PRIVATISATION

The Polish government will prepare a privatisation plan for
telecommunications monopoly TPSA this year.  It is likely to offer only
a minority stake initially although this may be extended above 50 per
cent later.  According to telecommunications minister Andrzej
Zielinski, options being considered include floating a stake on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange and selling equity to a strategic investor or a
group of passive investors.  TPSA's international monopoly will be
retained until 2001.

DECEMBER 1995

'Bombing' is just one problem faced by electronic 
mail users

      The convenience and simplicity of electronic mail 
makes it an increasingly attractive communications 
medium for business, academic and personal 
correspondence, but it also has its inherent dangers.
     Unfortunately, E-mail is also easy to manipulate, 
and the same individuals and companies that are 
relying heavily on it to conduct business could be 
subject to a range of problems, including disruption 
of communications, violations of privacy or 
tampering with networks.
     A case in point occurred on a New Jersey campus 
last month.
     A Monmouth University junior faces federal 
charges after an "E-mail bomb" that crashed the 
school's message system was sent to the school's 
system on Nov. 20.
     The FBI has charged Dominick LaScala, 21, with 
flooding the accounts of two administrators with  
24,000 electronic messages and causing the uni-
versity's E-mail system to go down for about five 
hours, Grey Dimenna, university general counsel, 
confirmed. 
     "It basically overloaded our system," said 
Dimenna, adding that computer messages were only 
delayed, not lost.
      Investigators say the "bombing" may have been 
a simple act of retribution. Lascala's computer 
privileges were revoked by the two administrators on 
Nov. 17 after they received complaints that he was 
sending multiple commercial messages to 
inappropriate areas on the Internet, Dimenna said. He 
added that some of the messages sought investors in 
a restaurant, while others advertised a "900" pay-per-
call service.
     Joe LaGaipa, director of the university's computer 
services, who was one of the targeted administrators, 
said Monmouth computer specialists traced what 
they believe was an E-mail bomb revenge to a site in 
Atlanta and a remote site in Redbank, N.J., which is 
near the university. The computer account from 
which the random-text messages originated was a 
shared account with another student who was 
unaware of the bomb.
     "[The trace] was basically systems operators 
comparing systems and notes," LaGaipa told 
Telecom & Network Security Review.
     The FBI didn't actually take part in the initial 
investigation. Rather, Dimenna said, FBI officials 
became interested in the case after the trace when 
LaGaipa called the agency to ask if any crimes had 
been committed based on what had been discovered.
     An FBI official verified that LaScala did not enter 
a plea at his first court hearing and was released on 
$10,000 bail. 
     His charges include a felony for using a computer 
used in interstate commerce to send data that would 
deliberately crash a system, and a misdemeanor for 
using a computer with reckless disregard. If 
convicted, LaScala could be sent to prison for a 
maximum of six years and receive a maximum 
$350,000 fine.
     Dimenna said LaScala will also be disciplined 
under the school's conduct rules, which could result 
in suspension or dismissal. LaScala will first have 
the opportunity for a hearing at the university.
     LaGaipa said the university can't really protect 
itself from another E-mail bomb crashing its system, 
even with what it learned from the November attack.
     "There's no real protection ... it can happen again 
anywhere," he said. He added that the only protection 
is the knowledge by potential bombers that their E-
mail bombs usually leave plenty of footprints that 
can lead back to them.

**Ease of use means tough problems

     The New Jersey case may have turned out to be 
rather benign; no more than an inconvenience for 
users of the Monmouth University E-mail system. 
But this and other incidents should send up a 
warning flag to those who rely on E-mail for 
important and confidential communications.
     And there are a lot in that category. The Electronic 
Messaging Assn. estimates that there will be 70 
million corporate E-mail users in the United States. 
The same group estimates the electronic messaging 
business will grow from $3.5 billion in the United 
States in 1994 to $62 billion in 2000.
     E-mail is easy and inexpensive to use. And it can 
improve worker productivity by cutting down on the 
trips to a colleague's desk to conduct a brief exchange 
or eliminating the need to print out and photocopy 
multiple copies of memos. 
     But this medium creates new risks, too. Because 
information is so easily disseminated to a large 
audience, the risk of misdirecting confidential 
information is increased. And once you've sent an E-
mail message to the wrong party, there's no chance 
of retrieving it.
     This is exacerbated by the fact that people tend to 
assume files on a computer are private and are more 
likely to communicate a sensitive issue through E-
mail than they would be over the telephone or in a 
memo or letter. 
     It is also not possible to verify the source or 
recipient of an E-mail message -- unless of course it 
is encrypted or some other security feature is added 
to it. It is extremely easy for hackers to gain access to 
networks, or for colleagues to learn each other's 
passwords and send or receive information under 
different names, or alter messages sent by others. 

**E-mail lingers

     In addition, the law is unsettled concerning 
whether an employer can be held liable for illegal 
activities by an employee using a company-owned 
network. The major telecommunications bill that 
could be passed by Congress by the end of the year 
may resolve the issue. In some jurisdictions it is 
possible now that an employer would be held 
responsible if a worker downloaded pornography or 
other illegal material. Civil suits would be another 
possibility.
     On a related point, E-mail can be used as 
evidence in a court of law, just as other documents 
can. Many people don't realize that, but even of those 
who do, few recognize that even if a file is deleted 
from your E-mail, it is likely still lingering on a 
computer backup tape somewhere else. There is even 
a cottage industry of sorts popping up of specialists 
in locating electronic mail to be used as evidence. 
Two of them, both located in the Seattle, Wash., area 
are Computer Forensics Inc. and Electronic 
Evidence Discovery Inc.
     Another E-mail related issue that is generating a 
lot of attention is the expectation of privacy of the 
correspondents. According to Michael Corby of M 
Corby & Associates Inc., in most cases, "If the 
electronic mail ... system is used at a company, the 
employer owns it and is allowed to review its 
contents. Messages sent within the company as well 
as those that are sent from your terminal to another 
company or from another company to you can be 
subject to monitoring by your employer."
     The 1986 Electronics Communications Privacy 
Act protects the privacy of messages sent over public 
telephone lines and online systems such as 
CompuServe or American Online but does not cover 
private, employer-owned E-mail systems.
     But many people feel that absent a company 
statement to the contrary, the communications they 
make through their E-mail systems are private. And 
there are cases pending, particularly in California that 
could help clarify the law on this point.

**E-mail security checklist

     There are a number of key steps employers must 
take to secure electronic mail and protect the 
company or organization. These recommendations 
elaborate on information contained in "Manager's 
Guide to E-Mail Security," by San Francisco-based 
Computer Security Institute.
     * Write a strong, enforceable policy, like the 
proposed policy provided elsewhere in this issue. 
The policy should outline the appropriate uses of E-
mail, the penalties for misusing the system, the 
organization's intention to enforce the policy, 
procedures for purging E-mail files and the legal 
consequences of destroying E-mail evidence.
     * Reserve the right to monitor. Employers 
generally are protected against privacy lawsuits if 
employees are clearly informed that the information 
conveyed in company-owned E-mail systems is not 
private.
     * Implement security controls. Make sure audit 
trails, password controls and other security options 
in your E-mail software are activated.
     * Investigate using encryption. Pretty Good 
Privacy is one popular encryption method that was 
discussed in detail in the August 1995 issue of 
Telecom & Network Security Review.
     * Ensure the post office server is physically 
secure. The E-mail post office server should have the 
same level of security other network servers have. 
The servers should be kept where unauthorized 
personnel cannot get to them.
     * Promote security awareness by employees. 
This can be done through seminars or training 
courses, as well as through statements in the 
company employee manual.
     * Set up procedures for destruction and retention 
of archives. E-mail messages can be permanently 
destroyed, but generally are not. That's why every 
company should see that its policy for maintaining, 
storing and disposing of key documentation crosses 
over into the electronic mail arena.

**E-mail users fight police intrusion

     Privacy with regard to E-mail is unsettled law 
and, consequently, is the subject of litigation 
throughout the country. One related issue that is 
being fleshed out in the courts involves illegal or 
allegedly illegal material transmitted through E-mail 
and how law enforcement officials go about 
investigating such cases. 
     Last month Telecom & Network Security Review 
discussed the use of electronic mail, and in this case 
a bulletin board service, to set up a sting operation 
through which participants in an illegal cellular phone 
operation were arrested. Another pending case raises 
issues about privacy rights relating to investigations 
by police of electronic mail or bulletin boards.
     The case concerns a small computer bulletin 
board in Ohio. The Cincinnati Computer Connection 
has operated since 1982 and has several thousand 
subscribers, who pay a set fee for access to the 
board. Subscribers have the ability to send and 
receive E-mail, participate in on-line discussions, use 
and download software, play computer games and 
receive periodicals. Some subscribers -- about 3% of 
the users, say attorneys for the BBS owner -- also 
use adult-oriented information and "service options." 
     As part of an investigation to determine whether 
the adult-oriented material was pornographic, the 
Hamilton County (Ohio) Regional Computer Crimes 
Task Force obtained search warrants and seized 
computer equipment including computer hardware, 
video display units, printers, software, data drives 
and internal or external information storage units 
from the BBS operator, Bob Emerson.
     Now Emerson has filed a federal suit against the 
task force, and a separate federal suit has been filed 
by a group of the BBS users. The user group claims 
that only the 45 allegedly obscene images should 
have been seized. 
     The group's attorney, Peter Kennedy of Austin, 
Texas, said the police knew what they were looking 
for and should have seized only those files. The 
group wants the return of their electronic files and is 
alleging various monetary damage claims relating to 
loss of business or other correspondence because the 
files were confiscated. Kennedy successfully 
represented E-mail users in another case of seizure 
of communications for evidence purposes, but in that 
instance the defendant was the Secret Service (Steve 
Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret 
Service).
     Emerson, in his separate suit before the same 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, 
Western Div., is seeking damages of $250,000 for 
the loss of subscriber revenue and the loss of 
computer equipment confiscated in the search. He 
also says in the complaint that the law enforcement 
officials violated his 1st and 4th Amendment rights. 
     The complaint says the officials conducted an 
over-broad search "purposefully, in bad faith, in 
conscious and reckless disregard of [Emerson's] 
federal and constitutional rights to privacy, to free 
speech, and to be free from unreasonable searches 
and seizures, and with the intention to intimidate 
[Emerson] from his continued exercise of free 
expression and to impose prior restraint on the 
transmission of presumptively protected forms of 
expression ... by permanently removing from 
circulation non-obscene adult oriented and other 
forms of expression."
     Emerson's attorney, Laura Abrams, of the firm of 
Sirkin, Pinales, Mezibov & Schwartz, expects 
months of discovery before the case goes to trial. 
The user group and Emerson cases have been 
consolidated for purposes of discovery.

FCC confronts new ruse to get around pay-per-call 
rules

     Pay-per-call operations are using a new scam to 
play fast and loose with federal regulations 
governing audiotex services, but the Federal 
Communications Commission thinks the practice 
violates the letter and spirit of the law.
     Pay-per-call or audiotex operators have been 
moving overseas at an increasing rate, just as pay-
per-call traffic, usually of the X-rated variety, has 
been increasing. Favorable deals with less developed 
nations and evasion of U.S. pornography laws are 
the lures.
     Robert Spangler, deputy chief of the FCC's 
common carrier branch, said along with the 
movement overseas has been the frequent 
advertising of pay-per-call services using a dial-
around code (10XXX) of a long distance carrier. 
This suggests that the carriers are paying the 
information providers to advertise their dial-around 
numbers.
     More recently, foreign pay-per-call services are 
being routed through "500" follow-me numbers or 
"700" conference-calling numbers.
     Under the 1992 Telephone Disclosure and 
Dispute Resolution Act, all pay-per-call services 
must be provided on the "900" service access code. 
Any carrier involved in either transmitting or billing 
subscribers for pay-per-call services is subject to 
several statutory requirements meant to ensure that 
consumers can prevent access to or charges for 
unwanted information services. Specifically, the 
TDDRA:
     * Requires carriers to offer telephone subscribers 
the option of blocking access to pay-per-call services.
     * Prohibits the disconnection of basic 
telecommunications services for failure to pay pay-
per-call charges. 
     The statute also specifically exempts from pay-
per-call status "any service the charge for which is 
tariffed," and services offered pursuant to a 
"presubscription or comparable arrangement."
     Ronald Marlowe, an attorney with the Miami law 
firm of Cohen, Berke, Bernstein, Brodie, Kondell & 
Laszio, recently sought an FCC advisory opinion 
concerning the legality of interexchange carriers 
providing telecommunications services to foreign 
audiotex operations. The services would be 
transmitted using the 10XXX + international 
number, 1-500-NXX-XXXX or 1-700-NXX-
XXXX dialing sequences. Calls would be billed to 
telephone subscribers at the tariffed rate as standard 
toll charges. 
     But Marlowe went further. He asked if the 
legality of the arrangement would be affected if:
     1) the carrier remits a portion of the transport 
charge to the party advertising the destination 
number; or
     2) the carrier remits a portion of the transport 
charge to the destination entity for providing the 
information.
     Finally, Marlowe asked whether the 
circumstances described would be legal if the other 
IXCs were blocked from providing access to the 
information provider.
     The FCC responded in a four-page advisory letter 
by John Muleta, chief of the enforcement division. 
But Spangler summed it up by saying the FCC 
thinks that "there is such a close tie between the 
carrier and information provider ...  that in this 
situation it appears the carriers were not acting as 
common carriers but were using an enhanced 
service."
     Spangler added that the "payment of 
commissions appeared to be an attempt to evade the 
definition of pay-per-call service under our rules." 
But it would not be successful, and the information 
services would be required to be accessed through a 
"900" number. One criteria for evaluating whether a 
service is a pay-per-call service is whether the 
consumer pays the provider more than what is 
required to transmit the call. The fact that the IXCs 
would be paying a commission to the information 
provider for the calls would suggest the consumer 
was paying more, said Spangler.

**No common carrier with blocking

     In the letter, Muleta said that by making payments 
to an information provider or destination entity, the 
carrier would "abandon objectivity and acquire a 
direct interest in promoting the delivery of calls to a 
particular number for the provision of a particular 
communication." This would be true, said Muleta, 
regardless of the dialing sequence used to place the 
call. Further, Muleta said any carrier "that is 
involved, either directly or indirectly, in blocking 
access to the called number by other carriers or in 
determining or influencing the content of the 
communications delivered through its network is 
not, we believe, offering a common carrier service."
     The letter also stated that the fact that the 
consumer does not directly pay the information 
provider does not exclude the service from the 
definition of pay-per-call if the payment is simply 
paid to the information provider by the carrier and 
then recovered from the consumer through the 
transport charge. The situation is not comparable to 
payments to pay telephone or other aggregators, said 
Muleta. "Those commissions simply compensate 
aggregators for their costs of making services and 
facilities available to the transient public for its 
communications needs."
     The transport charge discussed in the Marlowe 
letter is "a sham; the consumer has, in fact, paid the 
carrier for transport, and the provider, albeit 
indirectly, for the information," Muleta wrote.

**WKP seeks rehearing

     At least one company interested in providing the 
kind of service described in Marlowe's letter -- WKP 
Communications Inc. -- didn't like Muleta's response 
and has filed with the commission a request for 
review. That request must be approved or denied by 
the five FCC commissioners.
     Meanwhile, the commission has yet to issue a 
final rule concerning "800"/"900" fraud. 
     Back in August 1994 the commission proposed 
to curb the "800"/"900" problem by requiring that a 
written agreement be executed before pay-for-call 
services can be provided through "800" numbers. 
     Spangler said the commission is not likely to rule 
on reconsideration of the Marlowe letter as part of 
the "800" rulemaking. He also predicted that the 
"800" docket would be concluded first.

**International centers come on board

     Meanwhile, the FCC is making some progress in 
dealing with the international audiotex problem, 
particularly when it concerns adult services. 
     International audiotex operations have become a 
source of revenue in some undeveloped countries. 
When a call goes overseas the U.S. carrier pays a 
portion of that call to the foreign carrier. 
     And since the telecommunications industry in 
some of these poorer nations is government-owned, 
a dozen or so nations have been willing to pay a fee 
to overseas providers to get them to relocate (see 
box).
     To address this problem the FCC in April held a 
roundtable discussion with industry. And, in the 
summer four major IXCs agreed to a "verbal 
arrangement"  to forgive bills for foreign pay-for-
service calls where the calls are disputed by 
customers in the first billing cycle, said John Copes 
of the FCC's international division. The carriers that 
have verbally agreed to this are: GTE, MCI, Sprint 
and AT&T.
     Copes said the commission also is trying to get 
nations involved in incoming pay-per-call services to 
agree not to require U.S. carriers to collect for calls 
that are unauthorized or are made by minors. Two of 
the most active countries -- the Dominican Republic 
and Guyana -- have agreed to comply. Copes said 
that discussions are continuing with other nations.

Sample E-Mail Security Policy Statement

     The best way for a company to protect itself from 
abuse of its E-mail system by employees is to set 
out clear, detailed standards and make sure all 
workers who use the system are informed of those 
standards. The sample plan below is an excellent 
model for organizations to follow in setting out 
standards for employees. It was prepared by Michael 
Corby, of M Corby & Associates Inc., 255 Park 
Ave, 9th Floor, Worcester, Mass., 01609-1946.

Memorandum to: All Company Electronic Mail Users
Re: Company Electronic Mail Usage Policy
     One of the more important advances in office 
technology in the last decade has been Electronic 
Mail. The company's E-mail system has given us the 
ability to communicate with one another more easily 
and effectively. With this technology come some 
practices and policies concerning the use of E-mail 
that all company employees need to understand and 
follow:

**Appropriate Usage:

     It is expected that all company associates will use 
E-mail primarily for business reasons and will 
conduct themselves in a fashion that is consistent 
with the company's philosophy of treating others 
with respect and dignity. E-mail communication, 
both within the company or with other companies' 
E-mail systems should follow the same standards 
that are expected in written business 
communications.
* Messages that are defamatory, abusive, profane, 
sexually oriented, threatening, or racially offensive 
are prohibited.
* Messages that serve as advertising or solicitation 
are prohibited.
* Chain letters (a mailing with a request to recipients 
to continue distribution to others) are prohibited.
* The collection and/or transmission of material in 
violation of any federal, state or local law is 
prohibited.
     The inappropriate use of E-mail is a violation of 
company policy and may be subject to disciplinary 
action, up to and including termination of 
employment.

**Ownership:

     All information stored, transmitted, received, or 
contained in the company's E-mail system is the 
property of the company. It is not company policy to 
intentionally inspect E-mail usage. However, there 
may be business or legal situations that necessitate 
company review of E-mail messages and 
documents.

**Privacy:

     Employees should not attempt to gain access to 
another employee's E-mail messages without that 
person's express permission. However, company 
management reserves the right to access all E-mail 
files.

**Confidentiality:

     If there is a need for sensitive or confidential 
material to be sent via the E-mail system, care 
should be taken to route it only to those with a 
legitimate need to know. Any E-mail users has the 
capability to forward any message they receive, or to 
print and circulate a paper copy. In formulating and 
addressing sensitive E-mail messages, you should 
exercise the same discretion you would with any 
written document.
If you have any questions concerning this policy, 
please consult your manager, or contact Corporate 
Information Services, or the Law Department.

Data security problems touch more businesses, lead 
to greater awareness by top management

     More than half of the 1,300 information 
specialists responding to a new Ernst & 
Young/Information Week survey reported security-
related financial losses over the past 12 months.
     The average security losses were in the $250,000 
range. Twenty of those respondents reported their 
companies suffered losses exceeding $1 million.
     The annual survey found that the increased use of 
the Internet and tools for remote access, combined 
with the problems of hackers, former employees and 
overzealous competitors, are putting network 
security at the center of concerns by network 
managers.
     Inadvertent errors were the largest source of 
financial losses, followed by a lack of system 
availability. Virus attacks were experienced by 67% 
of the respondents, up from 59% in the 1994 survey. 
But just 8% of the viruses caused financial losses. 
And 78% of those who experienced virus attacks 
said the viruses were disruptive, but caused no 
financial loss.
     The Internet appeared to be a particular concern to 
the 1,300 responders from a cross-section of 
business and industry, and for good reason. Of those 
using the Internet for exchanging information 
externally, 20% said they were the target of 
successful or attempted break-ins in the past year.
     Forty percent of the Internet business users who 
responded to the survey said they are dissatisfied 
with Internet security. But a full 87% of them said 
they would use the Internet more frequently to 
conduct business if security were enhanced.
     As the charts on this page suggest, there is an 
increase in how seriously top management takes data 
security when compared with earlier Ernst & 
Young/Information Week surveys. Daniel White, an 
Ernst & Young partner who specializes in 
information security, said companies seem 
increasingly willing to devote more resources to 
finding security solutions. For example, 79% of the 
respondents said they have at least one full-time 
information security person on staff, up from 75% in 
1994.
     But most companies surveyed admit that they 
don't have adequate tools or properly trained 
personnel to defend against information security 
losses, White said. Management awareness and 
budget constraints weren't quite the problem in 1995 
that they were in 1994, according to respondents. 
     But frustration with a lack of tools or security 
solutions increased in 1995 over 1994.
     White advises that "information security should 
be decentralized." He said that there is an increase in 
data exchanges among remote locations -- plants, 
warehouses, home or branch offices --  and the 
people in charge locally need to take on effective 
security systems. 
     "To assist in this effort, common guidelines for 
security must be developed centrally and uniformly 
enforced in all locations," he said.

Former law enforcement official arrested in 
computer, phone fraud case

     The Los Angeles Police Department's reputation 
has been tarnished in a number of high-profile cases 
recently.
     Now a retired member of the LAPD is under fire 
for computer crimes. The retired officer and two 
private detectives were charged with accessing 
confidential information from government, private 
utility and private industry computer data banks and 
then selling the information. 
     Retired LAPD detective Robert Muldrew, 48, and 
private investigators Steven Kudler, 35, and David 
Westland, 28, were charged with unauthorized 
computer access, fraudulent telecommunications 
access and conspiracy. A fourth suspect, Joan 
Jayasinghe, an employee of GTE, was out of town 
when warrants were served but voluntarily 
surrendered to authorities upon her return to Los 
Angeles. She was charged with one count of 
computer fraud.
     Muldrew allegedly accessed Department of 
Motor Vehicles data bases and law enforcement data 
bases through a detective's computer terminal at the 
Devonshire Division police station, although the 
detective has not been implicated. Kudler and 
Westland allegedly broke into telephone company 
data bases and stole billing records. They also 
allegedly stole credit reports and customer account 
records from a local bank. 
     L.A. County Deputy District Attorney Efrem 
Grail, after expressing relief that he was receiving 
inquiries about something other than the O.J. 
Simpson verdict, said the defendants were in court 
on Nov. 6 and that the matter, which has been 
continued several times, could be considered on Dec. 
19, while a pre-plea report is being prepared for the 
defendants by the probation board. The defendants 
and the state are in "serious negotiations" and felony 
pleas are expected based on offers made by the state.

Staff Abuse of the Net/Web: A Growing Problem

     When we published our two volume bookset on 
telephone fraud nearly two years ago, we coined the 
phrase "Telabuse" to describe the generally 
overlooked problem of insider abuse of telecom 
systems. 
     Telabuse remains a significant factor, adding well 
over $8 billion to user bills yearly through wasteful 
and inappropriate telephone use by staff. Examples 
include employees dialing "900" and "976" numbers 
on office phones, personal long distance calls from 
work and friends/family interacting with staff 
through the employer's "800" service.
     The explosive growth of Internet and World 
Wide Web use, now easily accessed from most 
workplaces, is leading to a growing problem of 
employer abuse of the Internet/Web, akin to 
Telabuse. I dub the problem "Netabuse." It has 
rapidly become a subject of extreme concern to 
management and security directors. 
     Some recent examples reported in just the last 
two months:
     * A diversified manufacturing concern in the 
Midwest announced the testing of a highly secret 
new product internally to its managers through E-
mail. One manager then posted the message through 
a technical news group on the World Wide Web, 
accessed by all the company's competitors. The 
damage was immense.
     * A manager of a Georgia utility walked into a 
conference room to find nearly a dozen young male 
staffers having a brown bag lunch while viewing 
pornography through the Internet. 
     * A California software concern conducted an 
unannounced audit of Internet usage for one day and 
found 28 employees had spent an average of 3.25 
hours browsing for primarily personal information 
and entertainment. One young employee, smitten 
with stock speculation on high tech IPOs, had spent 
seven hours of his "workday" on personal 
investment research.
     Activities of this sort are common. The problem 
is growing as ease of access continuously improves 
and exciting  choices grow exponentially.  While 
direct costs are minimal, the loss of productivity and 
time can be staggering. A small -- but growing -- 
number of employees is developing  what's closely 
akin to an "addiction" to browsing the Web to satisfy 
instincts or desires involving sports information, 
pornography, investment opportunities and 
developments in technical fields of purely personal 
interest. 
     Experts in the field advise me that abuse of the 
Net/Web and the resulting impact on productivity 
has now become the number two concern, after 
security threats through the Net from the "outside."
     User management needs to address the problem. 
Clear, explicit policies must be formulated, 
distributed and enforced. Security policies and 
protections, which up to recently have only been 
asymmetrical (guarding against intrusions from the 
"outsiders") now must be modified to become 
symmetrical (guarding against outgoing -- as well as 
incoming -- leaks and breaches).
     Users can effectively manage against Telabuse by 
installing "call management" software systems 
available at low cost, starting at less than $1,000. 
These systems block access to "900," "976" and 
other pay-call services as well as monitor for abuse 
and toll fraud. Well over 80% of firms with 
professional telecom managers have now installed 
such systems, which are highly effective. 

**Free market responds

     In our entrepreneurial society, software firms 
respond quickly with solutions to new problems. 
The twin problems of Net/Web abuse and internal 
security leaks through the Internet from insiders 
(whether inadvertent or purposeful) are a very recent 
phenomena. But commercial solutions are already 
available in the marketplace. And -- just as was the 
case with telecom fraud -- the best systems provide 
symmetrical security and management, protecting 
against both external and internal threats.
     Security experts have particularly high praise for 
one such system, called "Sidewinder," available 
since March. Produced by Secure Computing Corp. 
of Roseville, Minn., Sidewinder protects against 
external threats through the use of a firewall 
approach coupled with the user's choice of any 
combination of authorization codes, passwords, IDs 
and smart cards. This is a rather typical approach.
     What differentiates Sidewinder from most 
software security offerings is that it also provides 
control and flexible management tools to allow the 
user to protect against internal abuse and security 
leaks. Employees with access to the system, for 
example, can have limited Internet privileges (e.g. E-
mail only) or full access (E-mail, news groups, Web 
access). 
     Sites to which the user doesn't want access at all 
(e.g. pornography) are blocked. Usage is 
electronically monitored to ensure that the usage and 
security protocols set by the user's management are 
being followed. 
     The cost of a complete system is $30,000. The 
software alone is less.
     Secure Computing Corp. will soon launch less 
expensive systems for smaller users. Competitors 
are announcing software systems that also adopt the 
symmetrical approach. Prices are sure to drop in the 
months to come. 
     Internet software security systems that are mainly 
asymmetrical (protecting only against unauthorized 
access by outsiders) will soon become history. As 
the explosive use of the Net and Web continues to 
grow, so will abuse, by insiders as well as outsiders.

Pick passwords carefully

     Passwords are a way of life in this fast-paced, 
information-based business environment, but they 
are not without dangers.
     Most business people simply can't avoid them 
unless they avoid PBX features such as direct inward 
system access, and also don't use cellular phones, 
voice mail systems, computers and electronic mail.
     Since passwords are so important to keeping 
communications secure, it's worth going to the 
trouble of picking the right ones and administering 
them properly. 
     A large percentage of hackers will move away 
from your telecom system or network if they have to 
work beyond some of the standard entry codes. 
Making codes as long as possible is an important 
deterrent. But long codes don't guarantee security. In 
fact, the longer the code, the greater the likelihood 
that it will be written down and placed in a spot that 
makes it an advertisement for a break in -- on the 
bulletin board at an employee's desk or on a yellow 
post-it note beside the telephone. 
     Find a happy medium. A six-digit code can be 
cracked in less than a half hour with software that 
costs just a few hundred dollars. But a 20-digit code 
is difficult to memorize, in addition to being 
unpopular. Nine-to-12 digit passwords are 
reasonably secure, but still manageable. Group codes 
-- such as one code for everyone in a particular 
department -- should be avoided as authorization for 
any communication systems. If several individuals 
are using the same code it makes it extremely 
difficult for administrators to audit the system and 
track suspect calls.
     System administrators should also be certain that 
codes are changed frequently, in the computer, the 
voice mail system and throughout the telecom 
system and network. Change codes every 30 to 90 
days. Some systems can be designed to alert the user 
on a periodic basis that passwords should be 
changed.
     An extremely important point is for telecom 
managers to be certain to change any default codes in 
the PBX, and make certain those codes are changed 
regularly. Hackers are very familiar with the default 
codes for maintenance and other ports of major 
telecom equipment.
     Security codes should never involve sequential 
digits. Other codes to be avoided include:
     * Common terms, words or sayings
     * Telephone extension numbers
     * Employee identification numbers
     * Social Security numbers
     * Anniversaries
     * Maiden names
     * First names
     * Spouses' names
     If at all possible, telecom managers should assign 
codes to employees rather than letting them 
determine their own access authorization codes. 
Codes should be randomly generated, frequently 
changed, and deactivated as soon as they are no 
longer needed.

Justice official seeks computer ethic, better interstate, 
international coordination

     The Justice Dept.'s six-member Computer Crime 
Unit has its hands full, and the unit's trial attorney 
thinks the problem "is not going to get better anytime 
soon."
     Prosecutor Martha Stansell-Gamm says the 
department is seeing the age of the criminals going 
up. Phreakers and hackers used to be primarily 
teenagers, but they increasingly are now adults in 
their 20s and 30s. The "size of the harm is also going 
up," she said when recently addressing a group of 
data security experts at a Computer Security Institute 
conference in Washington.
     Stansell-Gamm cited statistics from the 
Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie 
Mellon University in Pittsburgh that show 
technological intrusions have increased by 498% and 
the number of affected sites has increased by 702% 
since 1991. But she added that there are not sufficient 
statistics to give a true picture of the problem. "For 
every report of computer crime there are nearly 500 
intrusions that we don't hear about," she said.
     Stansell-Gamm applauded CitiBank for being up-
front concerning the diversion of $10 million in 
illegal fund transfers by alleged computer crook 
Vladimir Levin. But she noted that most companies 
are unwilling to admit they have been hit, either 
because they feel it will make them look foolish or 
will somehow make their systems more vulnerable.
     Stansell-Gamm said that the computer crime 
problem is more a problem of ethics than of 
technology. She devotes time to visiting schools and 
talking with young students because she recognizes a 
new privacy ethic has to be developed for the 
computer age. 
     "Right now we just teach how computers work, 
but we don't teach how they hurt." Just as kids watch 
adult drivers to see how they protect themselves and 
others, we need to teach this self-defense and respect 
for other on the information highway, she said.
     Ascertaining the nature and scope of the computer 
crime problem is just one small piece of what the 
Computer Crime Unit does. It's other responsibilities 
are to:
     * Coordinate multi-district, multi-agency 
investigations. This is an important function since 
attacks on technology generally involve more than 
one jurisdiction. Stansell-Gamm cited the case of 
Kevin Mitnick as a good example of this 
coordination. Mitnick, one of the most notorious 
criminal hackers in the United States, was arrested 
early this year in Raleigh, N.C., after a chase that 
began in California. Mitnick has since been 
transferred to Los Angeles and is being prosecuted 
by the U.S. Attorney's Office there, Stansell-Gamm 
said.
     Remedies to the multi-jurisdictional problem have 
included creation of an infrastructure to make sure all 
law enforcement can work together: the 
Computer/Telecommunications Coordinators.
     * Train agents and prosecutors. The crimes the 
unit deals with involve highly technical 
telecommunications and computer issues, which in 
the past meant a "steep learning curve" for 
prosecutors, Stansell-Gamm said. Through the 
efforts of the Computer Crime Unit, there is now 
one prosecutor in each district trained in the 
technology and tough legal issues in this field, 
Stansell-Gamm said. 
     The Computer Crime Unit conducts training 
courses for prosecutors, agents, system 
administrators and agency lawyers. It also has 
published the "Federal Guidelines for Searching and 
Seizing Computers" to aid law enforcement.
     * Develop an international response. Just as 
computer crimes cross state lines, they similarly are 
not hampered by international or geographical 
barriers. But nations have different views of how 
computer activities should be handled and some 
countries do not recognize computer crime as a 
threat. The Computer Crime Unit is trying to 
streamline the methods for obtaining international 
assistance and evidence. The procedures need to be 
in place ahead of time because computer crimes 
occur instantly and the criminals can cover their 
tracks and move on. Stansell-Gamm sees some 
progress in this area but believes that ultimately the 
United States will need to negotiate treaties with 
other nations to deal with the security threat.

Selling security to upper management takes new 
kind of talk

     Many telecom and network professionals may 
understand beefing up security will make a 
difference to the bottom line of their companies, but 
top officials usually don't.
     And in an age of belt-tightening and downsizing, 
few companies are going to be interested in 
investments in "technical niceties." 
     That means that on top of all the technical and 
management responsibilities they must juggle, 
system administrators also had better hone their 
powers of persuasion if they want the backing to get 
the security resources needed to protect 
telecommunications and computer investments.
     Studies, such as the Ernst & Young survey 
outlined in this issue, show company CEOs are 
beginning to give information security more 
consideration. But resources still don't match the 
security risks. And security professionals still have 
trouble helping senior management understand the 
need for security in their own organizations.
     "Techies" often have a tough time getting the 
dollars they need for security measures because they 
don't know how to sell themselves, says Patricia 
Fisher, president of JANUS Software Inc., and 
because technical people and upper management 
speak different languages.
     In a presentation before Computer Security 
Institute's recent conference in Washington, Fisher 
outlined the steps information specialists should 
follow to get the security resources they think their 
organizations need. 
     When making a presentation to upper 
management, the telecom or network administrator 
should:
     * Understand your audience. Do your homework 
and find out as much as you can about the goals and 
concerns of the person you are trying to persuade. 
Also, if you are dealing with upper management, it 
will likely be a challenge to hold the attention of a 
CEO who has hundreds of other concerns. Practice 
presentation skills to keep your audience awake and 
engaged.
     * Outline the topic and what the presentation will 
attempt to accomplish.
     * Provide statistics that show why a policy or 
monetary decision is in the best interest of the 
business. Statistics about the scope of the security 
problem can be persuasive. But they are particularly 
so if they are tailored to the circumstances of your 
specific line of business. 
     * Alternatively, show how the security 
investments could provide an opportunity for your 
company. For example, investments in a firewall for 
communications over the Internet may enable your 
company to feel secure enough to use the World 
Wide Web to increase visibility, and potentially 
increase business.
     * The meat of the presentation should be devoted 
to showing what needs to be done to solve a 
business problem. Do not get into technical 
discussions with high-level officials.
     * Make the presentation balanced. Show the 
obstacles so management can see that you are "not 
just a technical person who wants a technical toy" but 
someone who has thought through the situation and 
is looking out for the best interest of the company.
     * Suggest some realistic alternatives. That way 
management knows they can trust your judgement.
     And Fisher's final piece of advice to security 
professionals who need to make a sales pitch is: 
"practice, practice, practice."
