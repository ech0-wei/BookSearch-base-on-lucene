 MEXICO: ZAPATISTAS AND GOVERNMENT AGREE ON FURTHER NEGOTIATING SESSION

 Two days of discussions between representatives of the government and the 
Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional (EZLN) ended on 17 July with some 
progress. The two sides reached preliminary  agreement on the second item on 
the agenda of peace negotiations. The talks have been going on since April 
1995 in the Chiapas town of San Andres Larrainzar. A full negotiating 
session on 'democracy and justice' is due to take place on 6 August, but the 
two sides appear to be as far apart as ever on the fundamental issues.

 The talks reflected the EZLN's determination to project itself as a 
national organisation, going far beyond issues affecting Chiapas. It set out 
its twin aims for the next round of negotiations as: 'Promotion of a regime 
of social coexistence fully covered by the rule of law and the construction 
of a democratic development that permits a peaceful political life and 
intense citizen participation.'

 'Comandante Tacho' of the EZLN was dismissive of the government's proposals 
on these issues: 'Democracy is much more than honest elections, extending to 
citizens' participation in all spheres of social, productive, political and 
cultural life.'

 This projection was further seen in a subsequent meeting in the Lacandona 
jungle on 22 July between EZLN representatives and members of the bank 
debtors' organisation known as El Barzon, which claims 1m members, and sees 
much in common with the Zapatistas in its struggle for more favourable 
treatment from the federal government. The two groups signed a mutual 
defence pact, and agreed to form a front of civic organisations to press for 
changes in the Mexican economic model.

 In Guerrero, the new guerrilla group known as the Ejercito Popular 
Revolucionario (EPR) confirmed its insurgent credentials on 19 July when it 
issued a communique, signed by 'Comandante Antonio,'  claiming 
responsibility for an attack on a military patrol three days earlier near 
Chilapa.

 LOPEZ OBRADOR WINS

 Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, 43, was formally proclaimed the new leader of 
the Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD) on 17 July. He received 
264,565 votes, 73.9% of the total, in internal elections.

 Lopez Obrador, former PRD candidate for governor of Tabasco, is regarded as 
on the radical wing of the PRD. He replaces Porfirio Munoz Ledo on 3 August.

 ARGENTINA: POLITICS: CAMILION QUITS OVER ARMS SCANDAL: MENEM FINDS A JOB 
FOR DEFEATED BUENOS AIRES MAYOR

 When he announced the appointment of the outgoing mayor of Buenos Aires, 
Jorge Dominguez, as defence minister on 21 July, President Carlos Menem 
insisted that the departure of Oscar Camilion, who resigned five days 
earlier, had nothing to do with the scandal concerning arms sales to Ecuador 
in which the minister had become implicated.

 Two in one week. For the second time in a week Menem had to let a long-
serving minister go, amid protestations that the departure had no particular 
motive (see Page 334/96). Camilion, like Rodolfo Barra, had apparently come 
to the end of his time, nothing more.

 But everybody knew that Camilion had been hanging on by his finger-nails 
for months, as the judicial inquiry into the arms sales drew closer and the 
clamour from the opposition benches grew louder (see Page 238/96). The final 
straw came when federal judge Jorge Urso decided there was enough evidence 
of a cover-up to request the lifting of Camilion's ministerial immunity.

 Menem took five days, during which he was on a visit to the United States, 
to mull over the resignation. He finally decided Camilion must go, but took 
care to make clear that the government was no more involved in the scandal 
than the minister: 'Argentina sold the arms that ended up in Ecuador to 
private entities,' he claimed.

 But Urso based his application to interrogate Camilion on the testimony of 
the air force commander, Brigadier Juan Paulik, who said he had warned the 
defence minister that the planes supposedly bound for Venezuela were 
stopping off in Guayaquil. The ministry took no action.

 The only suspects to be arrested so far are Luis Sarlenga, former president 
of the company that made the weapons, Fabricaciones Militares (owned by the 
defence ministry), and two other senior officials of the company.

 The departure of Camilion will help to mend fences with Peru, where 
indignation was widespread that an old ally should lend itself to supplying 
arms to an enemy in a time of conflict.

 Dominguez has fallen on his feet, after suffering a humiliating defeat in 
the mayoral elections on 30 June at the hands of the Radical candidate, 
Fernando de la Rua. Despite finishing third, behind the Frepaso candidate, 
Dominguez was told by Menem that he was 'the best mayor Buenos Aires has 
had.'

 AMIA BOMB SUSPECTS HELD

 Prosecutors investigating the bombing of the Amia Jewish community centre 
in July 1994 suspect two Buenos Aires policemen of Arab origin of supplying 
the pick-up truck loaded with explosives that was used in the attack, in 
which 86 people died.

 One of the two, who have not been arrested, is thought to be close to a 
'prominent member of the Lebanese community' who was connected in some way 
with the owner of the vehicle, Carlos Telleldin, the only suspect charged 
with involvement in the incident.

 Following Telleldin's evidence, judge Juan Jose Galeano has linked the 
vehicle with an extortion racket run by 14 Buenos Aires provincial 
policemen, arrested earlier this month.

 ARGENTINA: ECONOMY: STRIKE THREAT OVER SPENDING CUTS: MENEM BACKS CAVALLO 
(AGAIN) AFTER ROW WITH UNIONS AND PJ

 While economy minister Domingo Cavallo threatened to resign unless his 
latest economic adjustment measures were implemented by congress, President 
Menem took responsibility for whipping dissident members of the ruling 
Partido Justicialista (PJ) back into line.

 Menem imposed order in the party after ratifying yet again his faith in 
Cavallo. The latter's attempts to make amends for failing to meet fiscal 
targets set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were bitterly 
criticised within the PJ (see Page 316/96).

 'The adjustment measures are mine, not Cavallo's,' Menem said on 19 July. 
Some 2.4m workers stand to suffer from a reduction in state aid for 
dependent families, and from the taxation of food subsidies paid to some 
1.2m employees by companies as part of their total wage. The government is 
also considering the abolition of transport subsidies and imposing value 
added tax (IVA) on bus, metro and train fares -all wildly unpopular measures 
with the unions.

 The Confederacion General del Trabajo (CGT) has called a general strike on 
8 August, 10 days before negotiations begin with the IMF to secure a waiver 
on the agreed fiscal targets. The unions have also threatened to seek a 
court ruling overturning the presidential decrees implementing the 
adjustment measures.

 Opposition economists expect the result to be a big fall in consumption 
rather than an increase in tax revenues. The government expects the measures 
to save up to US Dollars 1bn a year. The main employers' organisation, Union 
Industrial Argentina (UIA), has given its support, regarding the measures as 
preferable to tax increases.

 The fiscal deficit of US Dollars 2.508bn for the first six months of 1996 
was US Dollars 8m higher than the figure agreed with the IMF for the whole 
year.

 AUTONOMOUS BUENOS AIRES

 The first autonomous government of Buenos Aires will take office on 6 
August, in accordance with the first decision taken by the assembly drawing 
up the capital's political statutes, the 60-member Convencion de 
Representantes.

 Senador Graciela Fernandez Meijide, of Frepaso, was elected president of 
the convention on 19 July. Frepaso has 25 seats in the assembly, against 19 
for the Union Civica Radical (UCR), 11 for the PJ and five for Nueva 
Dirigencia.

 CUBA/UNITED STATES: DIPLOMACY: CLINTON FUDGE FAILS TO SATISFY ALLIES: 
HELMS-BURTON CONFLICTS POSTPONED, NOT PREVENTED

 The option chosen by President Clinton on implementation of the Helms-
Burton Act (see Page 325/96) was a skilful fudge: the law would be applied, 
but not yet. It was not lost on Latin American countries that the diplomatic 
clout of the European Union (EU) had caused Washington to postpone taking 
action under the most controversial section of the law.

 Six-month moratorium. The President's statement on 16 July maintained the 
right of US citizens to sue foreign 'traffickers' in confiscated properties 
in Cuba under Title III of the Helms-Burton Act, but took to make sure that 
no cases would come to court for at least six months -that is, until 
February 1997.

 Clinton's calculation is that he will have done enough to avoid alienating 
the Florida Cuba lobby without driving the US into open conflict with the EU 
or its partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).

 The first reaction of Senator Jesse Helms, joint sponsor of the law, was 
not promising, however: his spokesman said the President's decision was a 
'capitulation' to Castro and his EU allies.

 Clinton's best hope is that he wins the presidential elections in November, 
and can then extend the moratorium or, better still, quietly let Title III 
drop. But that will depend on the correlation of forces in the new Congress.

 Pressure for change. In the meantime, the US proposes to continue efforts 
over the next six months to persuade its allies to bring greater pressure to 
bear on the Castro government to introduce democratic freedoms in the 
island. If they do not do so, Title III could then be brought into action.

 In other words, Washington still insists on the 'extra-territorial' 
application of its national legislation -a point underlined a few days later 
when proposals were put forward in Washington to prosecute foreign companies 
trading or maintaining economic contacts with Libya or Iran.

 This position could be storing up trouble for the future, as it is 
precisely this point that has most enraged EU, Nafta and other Latin 
American countries. The EU has said it proposes to continue with 
preparations for retaliatory measures, and EU Commission president Jacques 
Santer has said Clinton's moratorium, while welcome, is not enough.

 The Spanish-based Sol-Melia hotel group, with extensive interests in Cuba, 
was among the first EU companies to begin its own campaign, on 22 July, to 
ensure that Titles III and IV are never applied. Sol-Melia is one of the 
foreign companies already notified that it is liable to sanctions under the 
Helms-Burton legislation.

 Title IV refers to the denial of visas to executives of companies dealing 
with Cuba, and is a mere pinprick compared with Title III. But pinpricks are 
annoying, and much has already been made by commentators in EU countries and 
Canada about the absurdity of refusing to allow children of, say, Sherritt 
International executives to visit Disneyland for their holidays.

 President Fidel Castro is making the most of the divisions among the 
Western allies. He emphasised in a briefing to Spanish journalists on 19 
July that the Helms-Burton Act was a 'sword of Damocles' hanging over the 
sovereignty of all nations and sets a precedent with dire implications for 
international trading relations in general.

 'AVIONETAS' AT UN

 Attempts by Washington to secure a resolution from the United Nations 
Security Council condemning Cuba for the shooting-down of two light aircraft 
in February seem to have come unstuck. US ambassador Madeleine Albright said 
on 22 July that she was satisfied there was a consensus in the Council 
against military attacks on civilian aircraft, but she was prepared to tone 
down a draft resolution prepared by the US.

 A report by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) criticised 
the incident and appeared to back the US position that it took place in 
international airspace (see RC-96-06). But the ICAO board did not 
specifically condemn the Cuban government, and US allies on the Security 
Council see Washington's campaign for sanctions against Cuba over the 
incident as part of its policy of isolating the Castro regime, and are 
reluctant to go along.

 SOUTHERN CONE: BRIEFS

 Chile's exports will rise to US Dollars 18bn in 1997, 13% higher than the 
US Dollars 16bn forecast for this year, according to the finance ministry. 
Last year services accounted for US Dollars 3.1bn of exports, the third 
largest figure in the region after Brazil and Mexico.

 Consumer prices are expected to have risen by 0.2-0.3% in July, compared 
with 0.8% for the same month of 1995, bringing inflation in Chile to 7.7% 
for the last 12 months, the finance ministry has announced.

 The state copper company, Codelco, has forecast a US Dollars 500m fall in 
income to US Dollars 1.2bn for this year, as a result of the Sumitomo 
scandal causing copper prices on the international markets to plummet.

 Forestry exports fell 20% in value to US Dollars 769m, and 11.3% in volume, 
in the first five months of the year, compared with the same period of 1995.

 Atilio Fernandez, the former integration minister, has been appointed head 
of Paraguay's Privatisations Council, his explicit brief being to speed up 
the sell-off process begun by President Wasmosy in 1993.

 Uruguay's public payroll has been cut back by 16,754 posts over the past 18 
months, to 239,146 officials.

 Uruguay's state electricity company, UTE, is to link up with the joint 
venture between the Uruguayan oil company ANCAP and the government of 
Argentina's Entre Rios province to build a gas pipeline on both sides of the 
river Uruguay, which divides the two countries. UTE is to invest US Dollars 
120m in a 350MW natural gas station to form part of the infrastructure.

 A new law will end the state monopoly on the financing of the construction 
of new homes, leaving the Banco Hipotecario, the current credit provider, to 
adapt to a new and competitive market.

 BRAZIL: ECONOMY: SETBACK IN JUNE TRADE FIGURES: BUT TELECOMS LEGISLATION IS 
THROUGH CONGRESS AT LAST

 External account figures released in mid-July were not as good as expected, 
causing the government to promise a thorough revision of its projections for 
this year. But, on the positive side, real progress was made with 
legislation on opening up the economy.

 Trade back in deficit. The May trade deficit of US Dollars 268m was 
followed by a disappointing US Dollars 327m deficit in June, with exports 
6.77% down on the previous month. The shortfall for the first half-year was 
US Dollars 296m -which makes the official prediction of a US Dollars 500m 
trade surplus for the year seem unlikely. The government concedes that the 
current account deficit will exceed US Dollars 2bn for the whole of 1996.

 The government, naturally, has been putting a favourable gloss on the 
results. The finance ministry's economic policy secretary, Jose Roberto 
Mendonca de Barros, pointed out that the growth in imports in June was 
largely accounted for by a 15.2% jump in machinery and equipment purchases. 
'The pick-up in investments is much more important than the import figures,' 
he said, adding that a reviving economy was bound to suck in imports.

 Mendonca de Barros noted that direct investments were pouring in, most of 
them related to Mercosur projects, making the accumulated reserves of US 
Dollars 60bn an advantage rather than a problem.

 A record total of foreign investments of US Dollars 1.1bn was recorded in 
June, bringing the total for the first six months up to US Dollars 4.37bn, 
according to central bank figures released on 19 July.

 Mexican spectre. Not everybody agrees with the government's upbeat 
assessment. The June trade figures suggest to some economists -those of what 
might be called the Dornbusch persuasion- that the spectre of a Mexican-
style crisis has still not been dispelled (see Page 268/96), and the 
deterioration of the external accounts should set the alarm bells ringing.

 Non-government projections of the current account deficit this year are in 
the range of US Dollars 4bn-US Dollars 5.6bn. And critics also point out 
that much of the foreign capital is coming to Brazil because of what are 
still among the highest real interest rates in the world.

 Cellular telephones law. The most impressive legislative advance was the 
approval on 18 July by the senate, by 55 votes to six, of the law regulating 
private participation in cellular telephony, satellite broadcasting and data 
transmission. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed the bill into law 
on the following day.

 Cellular telephony is expected to attract foreign investments totalling US 
Dollars 5bn over the next five years, opening the floodgates of investment 
in telecoms. The compromise that enabled the law to complete its passage 
through congress means that companies taking part must have at least 51% 
Brazilian capital for the first three years. The former state monopoly 
company, Telebras, is authorised to set up subisidiares to compete for 
concesisons.

 Nineteen consortia. The communications minister, Sergio Motta, said the 
first bids for cellular telephony services would be called in the next few 
weeks, and the country would be divided into 10 regions for the purpose. 
About 19 consortia, already in existence or in formation, are expected to 
participate.

 Cardoso said at the signing ceremony that the government was in no hurry to 
complete its reform programme, but wanted to be sure that they were the 
right ones for the country. He nevertheless did not neglect the opportunity 
to appeal to congress to speed up approval of the big constitutional reforms 
that are still bogged down there, notably the social security amendments.

 A much watered-down version of this reform was given a second reading and 
approved by the lower house of congress by 318 votes to 136 on 17 July. The 
concept of 'years of contributions' rather than 'length of service' as 
qualification for a retirement pension is preserved, but in other respects 
the lower house badly mauled the government's original draft (see RB-96-04). 
Civil servants and teachers keep their privileges, including the right to 
retire on full pension after 35 years' service, and no minimum qualifying 
age is laid down for civil servants.

 Worst of all, from the government's point of view, it failed to carry the 
proposal to reduce the  state's contribution to financing the pension funds 
of publicly-owned companies.

[TEX] MALUF'S STAR RISES 

 Mayor Paulo Maluf of Sao Paulo, with a 52% approval rating in the latest 
opinion polls, looks increasingly likely to carry his unknown protege Celso 
Pitta into office on his coat-tails. While the mayoral campaign of former 
planning minister Jose Serra appears to be flagging, Pitta's is prospering.

 Pitta, born in Rio de Janeiro, is a former executive in the Maluf family 
business, and is clearly Maluf's man. He also has the undeniable electoral 
disadvantage of being black. But Maluf's vote-winning 'Projeto Cingapura', a 
low-cost housing and favela improvements scheme, financed with a US Dollars 
150m loan from the Inter-American Development Bank, could make all the 
difference to his chances -as well as keeping Maluf in the public eye and 
serving as a springboard for his undoubted presidential ambitions.

 Cardoso's PSDB party regards the election of Serra as vitally important 
both to the government's prospects in 1997 and to the chances of Cardoso's 
standing for re-election. If Serra were to lose, the government would settle 
for a victory for the Partido dos Trabalhadores' candidate, Luiza Erundina, 
who is still ahead in the polls.

 BOLIVIA: POLITICS & SOCIETY: UPROAR OVER PENSIONS REFORM: DECISION ON NEW 
SYSTEM PUT OFF AFTER MASS PROTESTS

 President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's determination to complete his 
programme of basic reforms before electoral politics take over completely -
the presidential polls are only a year away- suffered a setback with the 
decision to postpone discussion of the draft pensions law until August. 
Popular opposition to this measure shows no sign of abating.

 Political moratorium. Sanchez de Lozada, whose inability to delegate is 
notorious, has tried to put politics on hold while he completes his grand 
design. But the moratorium has proved no easier to impose on the streets 
than on his party, the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR).

 The pensions bill presented to a special session of congress on 10 July was 
met with a general strike, followed by mass demonstrations. Workers objected 
to the whole idea of individual policies replacing a fully state-financed 
scheme, particularly if the new private pension fund companies (AFPs) were 
to be based on Chilean models, and perhaps controlled by Chilean interests.

 The latter possibility was immediately struck out of the draft legislation. 
The President promised an international competition, and said the 
concessions would be awarded in November.

 A feature that provoked intense opposition was Sanchez de Lozada's 
insistence on fixing retirement age for the new system at 65. In the face of 
massive resistance, he conceded that workers could choose their own 
retirement age from 55 onwards, but if they wanted to draw their full 
pension, they would have to carry on working to 65.

 As the well-informed La Paz newsletter Siglo XXI points out, only 14% of 
Bolivia's 120,000 pensioners are 65 or over -and only 3.6% of Bolivians can 
hope to reach that age. It suggested that the next draft should lay down a 
minimum contributions level to qualify for a full pension -along Brazilian 
lines- rather than a qualifying age.

 One important concession has already been made: the old state pensions 
system will remain in existence even after the AFPs begin to operate. 
Sanchez de Lozada's main argument in favour of a new system is that it will 
extend coverage to all 3.5m adult Bolivians, rather than the tiny number 
covered by the present system.

 Everybody, wage-earner or not, is to receive a minimum of about US Dollars 
200 a year for life out of the proceeds of the capitalisation programme.

 Opposition to the capitalisation programme, however, remains widespread -as 
reflected in the decision to renegotiate terms for the gas pipeline with the 
US company Enron and postpone the capitalisation of the state energy 
company, YPFB, until September.

 The Chilean factor is also present in political opposition to the 
capitalisation of the state railways, which have passed into the hands of 
the Chilean Cruz Blanca group. Plans for mass lay-offs of the feather-bedded 
workforce caused immediate uproar.

 Similar lay-off proposals provoked strike threats from the workforce of the 
national airline, Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB), now controlled by the 
Brazilian Vasp group.

 Political reform. Another difficult issue postponed until the second 
extraordinary session of congress, opening on 22 July, was the 
redistribution of congressional seats, to introduce a single-candidate 
system in place of lists for half the country's constituencies.

 This long-overdue reform set off a battle royal between departments, and no 
political party was prepared to concede any seats, for fear of losing out in 
next year's elections.

 The proximity of the elections has caused some edginess in the MNR, despite 
the President's attempts to keep the lid firmly down. The president of the 
senate, Juan Carlos Duran, has made no secret of his ambitions, and he has a 
national reputation. His lower house equivalent, Guillermo Bedregal, has 
also begun manoeuvring, with the aim of leading an MNR backlash against 
Sanchez de Lozada's preference for non-party independents in his cabinet.

 The minister with the best prospects appears to be Carlos Sanchez Berzain 
(interior), while an interesting outsider could be former planning minister 
Enrique Garcia. But he has just been re-elected president of the Caracas-
based Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF), and presumably has other things 
on his mind.

 BRAZIL: BRIEFS

 Banco de Credito Nacional, Brazil's fifth largest private bank, is to buy 
Banco Itamaraty as part of the central bank's programme to strengthen the 
fragile banking system, in which 100 out of 246 banks are expected to be 
'absorbed' or closed down. The two banks' combined assets will exceed US 
Dollars 11bn.

 Two investment banks, Cindam and Fonte, are also to merge, with combined 
assets totalling US Dollars 1.7bn.

 The Brazilian government has extended its alcohol fuel programme, due to 
end this December, for a further three years due to its environmental 
advantages. Subsidies cost Petrobras US Dollars 400m in the first quarter of 
1996 alone.

 Petrobras announced expected record production levels of 845,000bpd in 
1996, 18% up on last year. The increase was due to productivity gains, and 
the discovery of new reserves in Argentina, Ecuador, and the Bahia de Campos 
field, off the coast near Rio de Janeiro.

 Brazil's tax receipts totalled US Dollars 46.9bn for the first half of 
1996. The low figure, well below the government's expectations, is due to 
the slow-down in economic activity.

 The number of credit card transactions reached a record 188m and were worth 
US Dollars 11.8bn in the first half of 1996, a 24% rise on the same period 
of last year. One in 10 of the population has access to 'plastic' money.

 Brazil and Japan are to resume negotiations  regarding the former's 70% 
import tariff on foreign vehicles. The measure, introduced last year, cut 
Japanese car sales in Brazil by 95%.

 A government study suggests the country will receive US Dollars 220.5bn in 
private investment up to the year 2000, including US Dollars 10-12bn from 
privatisation.

 REGION: TRENDS: RESENTMENT GROWS TOWARDS WASHINGTON: THE REGION FEELS THE 
BIG STICK IS BEING BRANDISHED AGAIN

 Any lingering illusions about the end of the Cold War and the triumph of 
free-market capitalism making the world a simpler and safer place -the 'end 
of history' theory- must have been dispelled by the recent succession of 
issues concerning perceived national interests that have brought the United 
States into conflict with its allies and trading partners. The consequences 
for Latin America and the Caribbean include a growing feeling that Uncle 
Sam's big stick has been brought back out of the cupboard.

 The Helms-Burton Act, which has succeeded in lining up the European Union, 
Canada and the whole of Latin America against Washington, is seen by the EU 
as both an ideological aberration and a threat to its commercial interests. 
But in the US, zealots regard it as much as part of a crusade against the 
last remnant of Marxist totalitarianism in the Western hemisphere as a 
defence of citizens' property.

 In Latin America and the Caribbean, and particularly in Mexico, the Act is 
seen as part of a wider US attempt to stop the region developing independent 
economic relations. Such a perception may boost Mercosur, for example, at 
the expense of the US-sponsored Free Trade Area of the Americas. It 
certainly drove Chile away from Nafta and into the arms of Mercosur.

 These differing views reflect the extent to which US foreign policy in 
recent years has become a mish-mash of sometimes conflicting aims. These are 
highlighted by confrontations over two other issues: drugs and bananas.

 1. Drugs. As far as Washington is concerned, its pressure on Colombia in 
general and President Ernesto Samper in particular are acts of legitimate 
self-defence: drugs are a threat to its society, and countries that allow 
them to flow into the US become liable to sanctions.

 The uneasy reaction of Latin America is summed up in the words of Simon 
Consalvi, a former senior Venezuelan diplomat. He described the withdrawal 
of Samper's US visa as 'part of an escalation that could lead anywhere.' 
Samper himself saw it as an 'imperialist' act, a unilateral assault on the 
'South' -a view shared by the Non-Aligned Movement, of which he is chairman.

 Samper's US-born wife, Jacquin Strouss, singled out US envoy Myles 
Frechette as an exponent of an outmoded interventionist style of diplomacy. 
She warned that pressure on Colombia was stirring up an anti-American mood 
that she had never seen before.

 This feeling that US ambassadors are striking proconsular attitudes is not 
confined to Colombia: in Argentina, for example, the outspoken interventions 
of envoy James Cheek have been widely resented. Viewed from the south, 
officials in Washington and their representatives on the ground do not even 
pretend to have much respect for the institutions of the countries with 
which they deal.

 2. Bananas. The small Caribbean producers, particularly the Windward 
Islands, which are almost totally dependent on exports of the fruit for 
their foreign exchange earnings, have been lobbying Washington frantically 
in an attempt to persuade it to drop its objections to the EU's market 
regime. But the US has proved impervious to pleading, insisting that the 
regime is unfair to US marketing companies and should be subjected to a 
World Trade Organisation disputes panel.

 The argument that this narrow view of US interests could rebound on 
Washington if island economies collapsed and sent a flood of drugs and 
migrants northwards has failed to make much impact.

 The Caribbean's experience is similar to that of countries exporting to the 
US, which have found non-tariff barriers mysteriously appearing even as the 
free-trade rhetoric flows from Washington: reformulated gasoline exports 
from Venezuela and Brazil, which became the first issue to be resolved by 
the WTO's disputes panel, are a case in point.

 If Latin America and the Caribbean are coming to regard US policy towards 
them as a mixture of bullying and blinkered hypocrisy, that is a worrying 
trend indeed.

 REGION: DEBT&LENDING ROUND-UP

 ARGENTINA/ Debt grows. The foreign debt has grown by almost 57% over the 
past four years, according to an economy ministry report released on 18 
July. The total for both public and private sectors reached US Dollars 
91.47bn in March this year, compared with US Dollars 58.41bn at the end of 
1991 -a 56.59% increase.

 The public sector debt increased during the first quarter of 1996 by US 
Dollars 2.59bn.

 During the same period, Argentina's foreign exchange reserves increased by 
109.36%, from US Dollars 8.97bn to US Dollars 18.78bn.

 BRAZIL/ IDB road loan. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and 
Germany's Dresdner Bank group have agreed to lend US Dollars 25m for the 
construction of a 15km, six-lane toll road in Rio de Janeiro.

 Total cost of the project will be US Dollars 173.5m, of which  Rio 
municipal government will contribute US Dollars 112m.

 COSTA RICA/ Unused credits. The government is proposing to cancel US 
Dollars 450m worth of undisbursed loans from the IDB, including a US Dollars 
400m credit to the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE). The 
country is paying US Dollars 4m a year to keep the loans open.

 ECUADOR/ Judicial reform. The World Bank is lending US Dollars 10.7m to 
help finance modernisation and strengthening of the judicial system. The 
government is to provide an additional US Dollars 3.6m.

 Spanish credit. Formal signing of a US Dollars 110m credit from the Spanish 
government for the extension of the new trolleybus system in Quito was 
completed on 18 July.

 PERU/ Paris Club deal. President Fujimori announced in Lima on 20 July that 
a restructuring deal had been reached with the country's Paris Club 
creditors, along the lines achieved by Russia in May.

 Payments are to be made over 20 years, with a maximum of US Dollars 450m-US 
Dollars 600m for the first three years. The total to be paid will be US 
Dollars 7bn, a reduction from the US Dollars 9bn owed to Paris Club 
countries. Peru's outstanding commercial debt totals some US Dollars 10bn.

 REGION/ World Bank appointment. Guillermo Perry Rubio, former finance 
minister of Colombia, has been appointed the World Bank's chief economist 
for Latin America and the Caribbean from 1 August.

 Before serving in the Samper government, Perry was a Liberal member of 
congress and of the 1991 constitutional assembly. He was minister of energy 
and mines 1986-88.

 World Bank lending back to normal. Latin American and Caribbean countries 
borrowed a total of US Dollars 4.44bn from the World Bank in the 12 months 
to 30 June 1996. The total for the previous year was US Dollars 6.06bn. The 
fall, the Bank says, reflects Mexico's recovery from the financial crisis at 
the end of 1994.

 Assistance to the financial sector fell from US Dollars 1.4bn to US Dollars 
11.9m, and lending for public sector management from US Dollars 1.06bn to US 
Dollars 666m.

 Most WB lending to the region was in International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (IBRD) loans at favourable market rates: US Dollars 4.05bn, 
down from US Dollars 5.71bn in the previous year. But lending at 
concessional rates, from the International Development Association, was up 
from US Dollars 345.2m to US Dollars 390.3m.

 Argentina was the bank's fourth-largest borrower, with US Dollars 1.51bn, 
Brazil sixth (US Dollars 875m) and Mexico eighth (US Dollars 526.5m).

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO/ Help for poor. The IDB is to lend US Dollars 28m to 
finance community infrastructure and social services aimed at the poor. 
Projects include child care, education and conservation schemes.

 GUATEMALA: ECONOMY: RESOURCE LIMITS THREATEN PEACE DEAL: QUESTIONMARK HANGS 
OVER ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

 With the country now looking forward to the signing of the final peace 
accords between the government and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional 
Guatemalteca (URNG) guerrillas, (see Page 308/96) most likely to be 
initialed in September, attention is now being turned towards the economy, 
and the cost of peace.

 Questionmark over resources. A major step in the peace process was the 
socio-economic and agrarian accords agreed in May, from which the URNG 
negotiators had withdrawn their most radical demands, in particular the 
reference to the 'social function of land', and in return accepted somewhat 
loose promises of social reform. But the cost of implementing these accords 
is estimated to be between US Dollars 600m and US Dollars 900m, and the 
government's planning secretariat calculates that about US Dollars 2.3bn 
will be needed to pay for the rehabilitation of those areas affected by the 
conflict. Though some international aid is certain to be forthcoming, a 
questionmark hangs over the economy's ability to deliver the necessary 
resources.

 Economic indicators for 1995 were encouraging. Overall GDP growth 
accelerated to 4.5% from the previous year's 4%. The fastest growing sectors 
were mining (11%); banking & real estate (8%); construction (7.9%) and 
electricity, gas & water (7%). Agricultural growth was sluggish at 2.9%. 
Official figures for urban unemployment showed a fall from to 4.3% from 5.2% 
in 1994. Forecasts for 1996 place GDP growth at 5%.

 Export revenues increased 28.5% to US Dollars 2.2bn in 1995, mainly as a 
result of high coffee and sugar prices. Oil exports also performed well, 
rising in value by 38%. Exports to other Central American countries grew by 
23%, thanks to an agreement to consult on tariff changes in April 1995. The 
trade deficit, however, widened by 4.3% over the previous year as the import 
bill rose to  Dollars 3.3bn. Imports of raw materials and capital goods 
outstripped consumer goods for the first time in nearly a decade.

 Coffee, sugar and bananas account for 42% of export revenues and the recent 
dip in world prices has highlighted the need to widen the range of products 
the country sells abroad. While Guatemala succeeded in raising the value of 
non-traditional agro-exports from US Dollars 50m in 1986 to US Dollars 141m 
in 1989, progress since has been disappointing. (See table)

 The manufacturing sector suffered with the decline of the Central American 
Common Market in the 1980s and has responded inadequately to the lifting of 
tariff barriers in the 1990s. The country is an important exporter of 
chemicals, cosmetics, paper and processed foods, but manufacturing as a 
percentage of GDP fell from 16.7% in 1980 to 14.3% in 1994.

 Last year's trade deficit of US Dollars 1.1bn could widen if world prices 
continue to fall, but the current account will be helped by remittances from 
Guatemalans abroad as the government allows commercial banks to open dollar 
accounts. The peace dividend may well include an increase in the number of 
tourists, whose numbers rose from 537,374 in 1994 to 563, 478 last year.  
However the murder of one Briton and a US citizen in January has reawakened 
safety fears. 

 Domestically, President Alvaro Arzu is likely to continue the tight fiscal 
policy of his predecessor, who brought the fiscal deficit down from 1.4% of 
GDP to 0.7%, the lowest lower in Central America. Keeping inflation during 
the year to 8.6% was a considerable achievement.

 Though the three percentage point increase in VAT in January this year and 
the temptation to loosen monetary policy to spur growth may fuel inflation 
pressures, Arzu is unlikely to let prices get out of control.

 Privatisation on the cards. Despite strong trade union opposition the Arzu 
government has expressed its commitment to a privatisation programme. Least 
controversial are the loss-making rail network Fegua, the milk producer 
Prolac, and some municipal services. Electricity privatisation is going to 
be tricky, as the Guatemalan Electric Company, EESGA, the distributor, is 
refusing to pay its debts to the National Electricity Institute, Inde, the 
generator. However, in 1995 the Venezuelan government granted a US Dollars 
35 million loan to help modernise the country's electricity network.

 The state telecommunications company Guatel is the most lucrative concern 
on the list to be sold off. It is estimated to be worth US Dollars 1bn with 
annual profits of US Dollars 150m. But the government may be reluctant to 
lose such a valuable source of revenue and delay its privatisation. Last 
September Guatel, together with Northern Telecom of the US, inaugurated a 
modernisation project worth US Dollars 42m. An advanced switching system 
will be set up and a network of 40,000 telephone lines, 36,000 toll trunks 
and an international gateway exchange based on the latest technology will 
update Guatel's services. Meanwhile the US subsidiary Comcel, which operates 
a local cellular telephone monopoly, has given Motorola's Pan American 
Wireless Infrastructure Division a contract worth US Dollars 20m to 
introduce high-tech switching equipment. 

 Investment in infrastructure is vital, but with government spending at only 
6.3% of GDP in 1994, low even by Central American standards, there is little 
alternative but to rely on external financing. The Inter-American 
Development Bank recently approved a US Dollars 150m loan for road building, 
US Dollars 38.6m for healthcare improvements and US Dollars 4.3m to improve 
tax collection. The Japanese government has also pledged US Dollars 30m to 
modernise provincial infrastructure, and the Canadian government has 
promised to increase its contribution to the Fund for Democratic Development 
of Guatemala by US Dollars 3m.

 Foreign debt servicing soaks up about 4.8% of export earnings, well below 
the 10% figure regarded as 'manageable' by Eclac and better than the Latin 
American average of 16.4%.

 The May peace accords included a proposal to raise the tax to GDP ratio by 
50%, currently at 7.8%, one of the lowest rates in Latin America. But 
weighty political lobbying from the rich will render it a difficult task. 
According to the latest World Bank Report, 51% of the total population is 
outside the wage economy, and 37% of the urban population is in the informal 
sector, beyond the reach of tax collectors. In rural areas, the percentage 
of non-wage workers rises to 65%.

 Despite GDP growth, average living standards remain low and income 
distribution highly skewed. The country has achieved a sound base, including 
macro-economic and competitive exchange rate, for export-led growth, but 
without some levelling of income, through the broadening of the tax base, 
some social conflict could threaten progress after the URNG-government 
negotiaitions draw to a close.

 GUATEMALA: SOCIETY & POLITICS: DEATH SENTENCES PROVOKE PROTESTS: ARZU 
REFUSES TO PARDON MURDERERS OF FOUR-YEAR-OLD

 President Alvaro Arzu's determination to use the death penalty as a weapon 
against the crime wave that has swept Guatemala, in common with the rest of 
Central America, has provoked a wave of protests that threaten to overshadow 
the final achievement of a peace accord with the left-wing guerrillas -now 
scheduled for 15 September.

 Clemency refused. Two campesinos were still waiting in the death cell as we 
went to press, after a last-minute stay of execution. They had been due to 
face the firing squad in Escuintla on 23 July, after being found guilty of 
raping and murdering a four-year-old girl in April 1993. President Arzu 
refused to exercise his power of clemency, but the constitutional court 
accepted a motion from two lawyers that the judge who passed sentence had 
committed procedural errors.

 Guatemala is the only Central American country that still has the death 
penalty on its statute book. The executions of Pedro Castillo and Gustavo 
Giron would be the first to be carried out since 1983.

 Opposition to capital punishment has come internally from the Catholic 
hierarchy and human rights bodies such as the Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo (GAM), an 
organisation of relatives of disappeared people, and also from Amnesty 
International.

 GAM described the sentence as 'judicial terrorism,' and called on the 
government to attack the causes of violence in Guatemalan society, not the 
symptoms.

 Amnesty likened the death penalty to other human rights violations common 
in Guatemala, such as torture and disappearances. The organisation said four 
other death sentences had been passed in Guatemala, though appeals were 
still under way.

 Chief government negotiator Gustavo Porras announced a new round of talks 
with representatives of the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca 
(URNG) before the end of the month. Their purpose, he said, would be to 
'clarify' some points about the strengthening of civil power and the role of 
the army in a democratic society.

 RIOS MONTT RE-ELECTED

 Retired General Efrain Rios Montt, prevented from standing for President 
again last year, showed his determination to remain in the political frame 
by being re-elected as general secretary of the opposition Frente 
Republicano Guatemalteco (FRG) on 21 July.

 Rios Montt made a show of accepting the accolade with reluctance. He bowed, 
he said, to the will of the party assembly. Losing presidential candidate 
Alfonso Portillo was chosen as one of the four assistant general 
secretaries, along with his former running mate, Harris Whitbeck.

 Rios Montt is now assured of control of the FRG for the next two years. The 
next presidential elections are in the year 2000, and in the meantime the 
General has the job of consolidating the FRG as the country's main 
opposition force.

 MEXICO: BRIEFS

 Mexico's stock exchange index fell 93 points to 2,916 in one day's trading 
on 15 July, wiping out all gains made this year. The 3.10% fall was seen as 
a knock-on effect from the Dow Jones fall on the same day's trading in New 
York.

 New capitalisation rules for financial intermediaries will come into force 
in September, including the allocation of greater resources to guarantee 
savers' funds against possible risks. The Mexican government also hopes that 
improved supervision of the banking sector will remove any remaining 
anomalies and provide a platform for investment-led economic reactivation.

 The Bank of Mexico has predicted a 33.9% rise in manufactured exports this 
year, driven by high investment in the sector.

 Only 0.9% of companies, the largest, generate 62% of the country's wealth, 
while the smallest 91.6% account for only 9.1% of the total, according to a 
report on the polarisation of Mexican industry.

 Sony is to invest US Dollars 9m in a factory in Tijuana which from next 
year will produce video recorders for distribution throughout the Americas.

 The steel maker Altos Hornos de Mexico announced net earnings of US Dollars 
318m in the first half of this year, three times higher than in the same 
period of 1995. This followed rises of 300% in exports and 30% in sales.

 Mexico's external trade surplus stood at US Dollars 3.93bn for the first 
half of the year, with a US Dollars 45.47m increase in exports, 18.4% up on 
the same period in 1995.

 Unemployment rose to 5.6% in June, a slight increase on the 5.4% figure for 
May.

 COLOMBIA: DRUGS & DIPLOMACY: SAMPER ANNOUNCES TOUGH LEGISLATION: BUT RETURN 
OF VICE-PRESIDENT COULD BRING CRISIS TO A HEAD

 By announcing a package of tough anti-drugs measures on 20 July, President 
Ernesto Samper both served notice that he would be unflinching in his 
determination to confront the traffickers who have all but wrecked his 
presidency and fulfilled one of Washington's most insistent demands. And by 
letting it be known that congress would be invited to modify the legislation 
that currently makes it impossible to extradite traffickers, he made another 
important conciliatory gesture to the United States.

 De la Calle returns. It could all be too late. Vice-President Humberto de 
la Calle, after conspicuously failing to give Samper his unreserved support 
against US pressures (see Page 326/96), finally resigned his post as 
ambassador in Madrid on 16 July and returned to Bogota to join in the 
political fray, or 'to collaborate more closely in the various and serious 
problems that afflict Colombia,' as he put it.

 He has been the focal point of innumerable scenarios and salidas for many 
months now -the latest came from former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen on 
21 July- and could again become the central figure in a negotiated accord 
that would enable Samper to step down gracefully. One option being discussed 
is that he, too, would step down from the line of succession, to enable a 
third party to serve out the remainder of Samper's term, which ends in 
August 1998.

 Names that have been mentioned include defence minister Juan Carlos 
Esguerra and former justice minister Nestor Humberto Martinez, both of whom 
are respected in Washington. But it seems highly unlikely that De la Calle 
would agree to such a procedure.

 The influential Liberal newspaper El Tiempo, after carefully sitting on the 
fence long after most politically-aware Colombians had taken sides, finally 
called upon Samper to resign, for the good of the country. 'This government 
is no longer viable,' said respected columnist Hernando Gomez on 16 June.

 And the industrialists' association, Andi, confirmed its support on 16 July 
for the strongly anti-Samper line taken by its president, Luis Carlos 
Villegas Echeverri.

 Since he took office in March, Villegas has been one of the loudest voices 
against the President within the Consejo Gremial Nacional -which feels that 
his remaining in power is doing serious damage to Colombia's economic 
prospects, particularly exports.

 Communications minister Juan Manuel Turbay, the most unconditional 
samperista of them all, has followed foreign minister Rodrigo Pardo out of 
the government. That leaves only the combative interior minister, Horacio 
Serpa Uribe, of the three ministers interrogated and acquitted by the 
supreme court, still standing by the President.

 Court cases continue. The supreme court has made clear that it will 
continue with its investigation of the 111 members of the lower house of 
congress who voted to clear Samper in April. Chief public prosecutor Alfonso 
Valdivieso said at the time that the representatives had failed to consider 
much of the concrete evidence against the President in their deliberations, 
and a complaint to that effect by a number of pressure groups has ensured 
that the matter will not be allowed to drop.

 The anti-drug measures are broadly speaking those promised by Samper in his 
speech after being cleared by congress (see Page 260/96), and can be seen as 
a survival strategy by the President. They followed the first steps to 
confiscate property belonging to imprisoned leaders of the Cali cartel, and 
declarations from Samper that he would press for the heaviest penalties for 
convicted traffickers.

 The proposal to debate the extradition of Colombian nationals -a marked 
change of tone from the defiance that characterised Samper's initial 
reactions to Washington's demand and to the withdrawal of his visa- was made 
conditional on the international community taking concerted action against 
drug-trafficking. This is a long-standing demand of Colombia and other South 
American countries, and serves to defuse the confrontation with the US by 
internationalising the issue.

 The departing foreign minister, Rodrigo Pardo, made a remark on 17 July 
very reminiscent of Valdivieso's comment that extradition could be a 'useful 
tool' for tackling the drug-trafficking problem.

 Successful pressure? This was a far cry from Samper's denunciation on 15 
July of Washington's 'unfriendly act' in withdrawing his visa, and its 'lack 
of respect for Colombia's democratic institutions.' The Clinton 
administration might be forgiven for concluding that its policy of incessant 
pressure on the Samper government is producing results, whatever the bluster 
from Bogota and the expressions of solidarity from around the world.

 The promised diplomatic offensive began on 23 July, when new foreign 
minister Maria Emma Mejia was dispatched to Washington. Samper himself said 
he would tour Latin America before addressing the United Nations general 
assembly in New York in September.

 MIRAFLORES EMERGENCY

 The government declared a special emergency zone in the department of 
Guaviare after Miraflores, San Jose del Guaviare and nearby towns were 
occupied by thousands of angry coca-growers, protesting at the government's 
eradication campaign, which uses aerial spraying of the herbicide 
glyphosate.

 This is the second such action in the region in the past year, and reflects 
both the effectiveness of the spraying operations, carried out by police 
helicopters, and the government's failure to offer small farmers any viable 
alternative way of making a living. The government blames Fuerzas Armadas 
Revolucionarias de Colombia (Farc) guerrillas for organising the protests.

 ECUADOR: POLITICS: INDIAN CONFLICTS COMING TO A HEAD: ISSUES MAY PROVIDE 
EARLY TEST OF BUCARAM'S POLITICAL SKILLS

 The issue of the role that Indian organisations will have in the Bucaram 
government (see RA-96-06) looks like coming to a head sooner than expected. 
While jungle Indians are determined to resist plans for the further 
development of oil reserves in their territory -a declared priority of the 
incoming administration- highland communities are threatening an 'uprising' 
if the government fails to respond to their demands for assistance.

 The outgoing government of President Sixto Duran-Ballen has had to face a 
number of these levantamientos populares, generally organised by the 
Confederacion de Nacionalidades Indigenas del Ecuador (Conaie) in connection 
with national issues, such as the privatisation of public utilities.

 Earthquake victims. But the latest threat has much more grass-roots 
origins: 80,000 campesinos from Cotopaxi province who lost everything in an 
earthquake in March claim the central government has given them no help with 
rebuilding their lives, despite lavish promises.

 Bucaram has fiercely attacked the 'racism' of previous governments, and 
promised a big say for Indian groups such as Conaie in his government -
including the creation of a full ministry of Indian affairs. Simmering 
Indian discontent, including roadblocks along the Pan-American highway, 
would be highly embarrassing for a leader anxious to establish his 
credentials both as a popular benefactor and as a man with whom foreign 
bankers and entrepreneurs can do business.

 The President-elect continued his efforts to reassure potential investors 
by confirming the president of the central bank, Augusto de la Torre, in his 
post on 19 July.

 De la Torre is regarded as a safe pair of hands by the private sector, and 
the best guarantee that the orthodox monetary policies of the present 
government will be continued under Bucaram. The latter has already been 
briefed by De la Torre on how to approach business leaders when he visits 
New York just before his 10 August inauguration.

 Oil development plans. Another of Bucaram's choices, Alfredo Adoum, as 
minister of energy, foreshadows an early conflict with jungle Indian 
organisations. Adoum, a Guayaquil businessman and old Bucaram ally, has 
already said he will 'open the doors wide' to foreign investment in the oil 
industry, particularly exploration. He is also committed to constructing new 
pipelines from the jungle to the coast.

 Such projects imply direct conflict with groups such as the Huaorani, only 
about 1,300 strong, who have been pressing the government to expel thousands 
of settlers who have moved into their territory in the Oriente jungles in 
the wake of the oil companies.

 The Huaorani have a legally-recognised 600,000-hectare reserve in Napo 
province, which has become a centre of oil production, involving foreign 
companies such as Oryx, Arco, Agip, Elf and Petrobras.

 The warlike Huaorani have threatened to seal off their territory and expel 
the oil companies and colonos themselves unless the government takes a hand. 
The Organizacion de Nacionalidades Huaoranis de la Amazonia Ecuatoriana 
(Onhae) has been claiming for some time that the companies have encroached 
on their territory without permission and have set one group of Indians 
against another with selective offers of economic aid and social services.

 A new, highly-recommended book* describes in detail the struggles of the 
Huaorani to come to terms with the encroachment of the outside world into 
their previosuly cloistered lives.

 CAPITALISATION PLEDGE

 Alvaro Noboa, economic adviser to Bucaram and one of the triumvirate of 
bankers who will run the economy (see Page 329/96), has promised to halt the 
privatisation programme initiated by the Duran-Ballen government and replace 
it with 'capitalisation' of state-owned companies, along the lines adopted 
by the Sanchez de Lozada government in Bolivia.

 TAX PROTESTS

 Thousands of small traders marched through the streets of the main cities 
on 17 July in protest against attempts by the government to extend the 
taxation system to the 'informal' sector of the economy. Invoices are now 
supposed to be issued for all sales above 10,000 sucres (about US Dollars 3) 
in value.

 The Guayas small traders' association threatened an all-out strike unless 
Bucaram reversed the measure by 20 August.

 ANDEAN REGION: BRIEFS

 The Colombian government announced a US Dollars 37.6m credit line to help 
investment for developing industry and business in frontier regions.

581.9m in the first five months of 1996, banana exports rose by the same 
amount to  Dollars 402.4m.

 Peru's tax revenue reached US Dollars 4bn in the first half of the year, 
50% more than expected.

 The Iscaycruz mining complex, with zinc and lead reserves worth US Dollars 
280m, has become Peru's first private zinc producer, under Swiss-Peruvian

LATIN AMERICAN WEEKLY REPORT  via NewsNet
August 1, 1996

 REGION: POSTSCRIPT

 ANTIGUA/ Nevis dispute. Prime Minister Lester Bird has brought in a former 
Commonwealth secretary-general and a university vice-chancellor to help find 
a solution to the political impasse between the Premier of Nevis, Vance 
Amory, and the St Kitts & Nevis Prime Minister, Dr Denzil Douglas. Amory has 
denounced the creation of an Office for Nevis Affairs on the smaller island 
by the Douglas administration, and has threatened to secede from St Kitts.

 BRAZIL/ Portuguese speakers. Portuguese, the third most widely spoken 
Western language, enjoyed linguistic communion on July 17, when Brazilian 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso flew to Lisbon to co-found the Community 
of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). The founding act was attended by 5 
African countries as well as Brazil and Portugal, with the CPLP touted as a 
'model of north-south co-operation' between equals, despite the obvious 
population disparities: there are 160m Brazilians, but only 120,000 
inhabitants of Sao Tome-Principe.

 CHILE/ Miners' strike. The 1800 workers from the Lota coal mine, on strike 
since 17 May, have rejected for the fourth time an agreement reached between 
union leaders and the government. The strikers are demanding better benefits 
for the 450 who are to lose their jobs as part of a rationalisation 
programme. Meanwhile, development minister Felipe Sandoval hinted that the 
state coal company Enacar is to be partially privatised.

 COLOMBIA/ Bad weather. Some 600,000 people have been affected by the worst 
winter for five years. Torrential rainfall, already at nearly the yearly 
average of 3000mm after only six months, has destroyed 20,000 homes and 
100,000 hectares of crops, and claimed the lives of some 100 people. The 
Metereological Institute fears that the first rainy season, normally between 
mid-March and mid-June, is going to run into the second wet weather period, 
due to  begin in September.

 EL SALVADOR / Leftist meeting. Delegates from left wing parties from 
throughout the region were due to meet at the end of July in San Salvador 
for the 6th Congress of the Sao Paulo Forum, to be hosted by the FMLN. The 
Forum, founded in 1990 to promote political alternatives to neoliberalism, 
has also invited communist party members from China, Libya and Cuba, 
triggering heightened fears of subversion among El Salvador's security 
forces.

 To make matters a little more uneasy, only the previous week the 'Military 
Youth' organisation threatened to 'take control of the state' unless the 
government of President Armando Calderon Sol did not 'restore order', tackle 
social unrest, and investigating corruption charges against, amongst others, 
former president Alfredo Cristiani.

 GUYANA/ Floods. President Cheddi Jagan declared a State of National 
Emergency in mid-July after several months of some of the heaviest rainfall 
ever recorded in the country caused widespread flooding in coastal and 
riverside regions. All major rivers have burst their banks, affecting 30,000 
people and destroying swathes of rice crops, livestock and the Indian 
groups' staple, cassava. Army and police are supporting flood relief workers 
distributing food and medicine donated by the government and the 
international community.

 PERU/ Ratings slip. Public approval of President Alberto Fujimori's 
government fell to 56.3% in July, 3.5% less than in the previous month, 
according to an opinion poll by Analistas y Consultores. The number of those 
who disapprove of his record rose to 36%, six percentage points up on June.

 The ratings slip, however, came at the same time as Peru climbed two places 
on the UN's Human Development scale to 91st position, while UNICEF announced 
an US Dollars 8m health, education and nutrition programme for children.

 VENEZUELA/ Neighbour dispute. A new offensive in the war of words between 
Colombia and Venezuela over guerrilla activities in their common border 
region was launched in Caracas when the press reported a speech by President 
Ernesto Samper accusing corrupt elements of the Venezuelan army of selling 
arms to Colombian insurgents and drug-traffickers. The comments in fact came 
from a non-official report, according to Samper, who also released a veiled 
apology. But the duel has already soured Colombia's new foreign minister, 
Maria Mejia's imminent trip to Caracas to arrange a bilateral summit, the 
first since 1994.

 Minister sacked. President Rafael Caldera dismissed the justice minister, 
Enrique Meier, on 17 July, for his outspoken criticism of his predecessor, 
Rubens Creixems. Meier had only held the post since mid-March.

 REGION/ Oil Pact. Haiti and Panama are to rejoin the nine other Central 
American and Caribbean member states of the Venezuelan and Mexican Energy 
Co-operation Programme later this month. Under the scheme, quotas of oil and 
its derivatives are sold to the beneficiary nations with 20% of the cost 
returned as super-soft loans for development projects. Haiti and Panama had 
been suspended for overdue credit repayments.

Aeromexico to Cut Costs

     Aerovias de Mexico (Aeromexico) has launched a cost reduction
program as well as a program to expand its charter flight services
in the United States and Canada.

     The program will be fully implemented by the end of the third
quarter.  The target is a reduction of 4 percent of the airline's
monthly expenses, resulting in savings of about US$3 million a
month.  Measures include reducing the costs of:  fuel consumption
by 1.5 percent through preferred fuel loadings and rationalization
of reserve fuel loadings; leases by 4 percent by extending and
refinancing leases and reducing the amounts of the credit letters
(a project that started six months ago); workforce by 12 percent;
ramp services by 3 percent via a joint venture with ASA and
MEXICANA solely to provide these services; and, maintenance per
hour by 17 percent through the reduction of the number of full-time
employees and better scheduling of maintenance services.

     This winter Aeromexico will begin service to Toronto, Vancouver,
Winnipeg and elsewhere in Canada, and in the northern U.S., to
Seattle, Portland and other destinations.

have been arrested for the alleged illegal disposal, storage and

Mexico.  Felony charges against the two were brought as a result of
a combined investigation by the California state  Department of
Toxic Substances Control and the Los Angeles County District
Attorney.

     The Husemans own and operate Keelco Anodes Inc. of Wilmington,
California.  A third individual named in the complaint, Jose Kahn,
owner and operator of New Frontier Trading Corp of San Diego was
reported planning to surrender to authorities.

     Keelco manufactures lead keels for boats and lead anodes used in
refining copper from ore.  Keelco and the Husemans are charged with
unlawfully disposing of lead waste on the ground at the Wilmington
site and at Quay Street, adjacent to the business.  Keelco
employees were unnecessarily exposed to friable waste lead
grindings and that the waste was stored on site illegally for more
than 90 days at a time.

     New Frontier Trading Corp. is a metals brokerage that purchases
waste lead from Keelco and other entities and arranges for its
transportation to Metales y Derivados, a smelter in Tijuana.

Mexican Trucking Company Suspended

     The U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission has announced the six-
month suspension of Jorge Romo of Mexicali, Baja California for
willfully operating in violation of territorial restrictions and
limitations stated within Romo's Certificate of Registration.

     The Commission acted after obtaining California Highway Patrol
(CHP) information involving the CHP's issuance of numerous
citations to trucks operated by Romo in areas well beyond the
limits of the prescribed, U.S.-border commercial zone specified in
Romo's Certificate of Registration.

An Overview:  Part I

The NAFTA negotiations have been completed and a draft of the
Agreement released.  With this issue MTLR begins a series of
articles providing a broad overview of the content and terms of the
NAFTA.  In the coming months, MTRL will also publish in-depth
analysis of the individual NAFTA chapters.


     A North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will create a free
trade area of 360 million people comprising a market of over US$6
trillion.  Mexico will benefit through substantially increased
economic growth and opportunities; Canada and the U.S. will benefit
economically, as well as politically from a more stable Mexico as
neighbor.

                Objectives

     The opening provisions of the NAFTA formally establish a free
trade area between Canada, Mexico and the United States, consistent
with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  They set
out the basic rules and principles that will govern the Agreement
and the objectives that will serve as the basis for interpreting
its provisions.

     The objectives of NAFTA are to eliminate barriers to trade,
promote conditions of fair competition, increase investment
opportunities, provide adequate protection for intellectual
property rights, establish effective procedures for the
implementation and application of NAFTA and for the resolution of
disputes and to further trilateral, regional and multilateral
cooperation.  The NAFTA countries will meet these objectives by
observing the principles and rules of the Agreement, such as
national treatment, most-favored-nation treatment and procedural
"transparency."

     Each country affirms its respective rights and obligations under
the GATT and other international agreements.  For purposes of
interpretation, the Agreement establishes that the NAFTA takes
priority over other agreements to the extent there is any conflict,
but provides for exceptions to this general rule.  For example, the
trade provisions of certain environmental agreements take
precedence over NAFTA, subject to a requirement to minimize incon-
sistencies with the Agreement.

     The opening provisions also set out a general rule regarding the
application of the Agreement to subfederal levels of government in
the three countries.  In addition, this section defines terms that
apply to the whole Agreement, to ensure uniform and consistent
usage.

                Rules of Origin

     NAFTA eliminates all tariffs on goods originating in Canada,
Mexico and the United States over a "transition period."  Rules of
origin are necessary to define which goods are eligible for this
preferential tariff treatment.

     This section of the Agreement is designed to:

*    ensure that NAFTA benefits are accorded only to goods produced
     in the North American region -- not goods made wholly or in
     large part in other countries;

*    provide clear rules and predictable results; and

*    minimize administrative burdens for exporters, importers and
     producers trading under NAFTA.

     The rules of origin specify that goods originate in North
America if they are wholly North American.  Goods containing non-
regional materials are also considered to be North American if the
non-regional materials are sufficiently transformed in the NAFTA
region so as to undergo a specified change in tariff
classification.  In some cases, goods must include a specified
percentage of North American content in addition to meeting the
tariff classification requirement.  The rules of origin section
also contains a provision similar to one in the Canada-United
States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that allows goods to be treated
as originating when the finished good is specifically named in the
same tariff subheading as its parts and it meets the required value
content test.

     Regional value content may be calculated using either the
"transaction-value" or the "net-cost" method.  The transaction-
value method is based on the price paid or payable for a good; this
avoids the need for a complex cost accounting system.  The net-cost
method is based on the total cost of the good less the costs of
royalties, sales promotion, and packaging and shipping.
Additionally, the net-cost method sets a limitation on allowable
interest.  Although producers generally have the option to use
either method, the net-cost method must be used where the
transaction value is not acceptable under the GATT Customs
Valuation Code, and must also be used for certain products, such as
automotive goods.

     In order to qualify for preferential tariff treatment,
automotive goods must contain a specified percentage of North
American content (rising to 62.5 percent for passenger automobiles
and light trucks as well as engines and transmissions for such
vehicles, and to 60 percent for other vehicles and automotive
parts) based on the net-cost formula.  In calculating the content
level of automotive goods, the value of automotive parts from
outside the NAFTA region will be traced through the production
chain to improve the accuracy of the content calculation.  Regional
content averaging provisions afford administrative flexibility for
automotive parts producers and assemblers.

     A de minimis rule prevents goods from losing eligibility for
preference solely because they contain minimal amounts of "non-
originating" material.  Under this rule, a good that would
otherwise fail to meet a specific rule of origin will nonetheless
be considered to be North American if the value of non-NAFTA
materials comprises no more than seven percent of the price or
total cost of the good.

                Customs Administration

     In order to ensure that only goods satisfying the rules of
origin standards are accorded preferential tariff treatment under
the Agreement, and to provide certainty to and streamlined
procedures for importers, exporters and producers in the three
countries, the NAFTA includes a number of provisions on customs
administration.  Specifically, this section provides for:


*    uniform regulations to ensure consistent interpretation,
     application and administration of the rules of origin;

*    a uniform Certificate of Origin as well as certification
     requirements and procedures for importers and exporters that
     claim preferential tariff treatment;

*    common record-keeping requirements in the three countries for
     such goods;

*    rules for both traders and customs authorities with respect to
     verifying the origin of such goods;

*    importers, exporters and producers to obtain advance rulings on
     the origin of goods from the customs authority of the country
     into which the goods are to be imported;

*    the importing country to give exporters and producers in other
     NAFTA countries substantially the same rights of review and
     appeal of its origin determinations and advance rulings as it
     provides to importers in its territory;

*    a trilateral working group to address future modifications of
     the rules of origin and the uniform regulations; and

*    specific time periods to ensure the expeditious resolution of
     disputes regarding the rules of origin between NAFTA partners.

                Trade in Goods

     The NAFTA incorporates the fundamental national treatment
obligation of the GATT.  Once goods have been imported into one
NAFTA country from another NAFTA country, they must not be the
object of discrimination.  This commitment extends to provincial
and state measures.

Market Access

     These provisions establish rules governing trade in goods with
respect to customs duties and other charges, quantitative
restrictions, such as quotas, licenses and permits, and import and
export price requirements.  They improve and make more secure the
access for goods produced and traded within North America.

Elimination of Tariffs.  The NAFTA provides for the progressive
elimination of all tariffs on goods qualifying as North American
under its rules of origin.  For most goods, existing customs duties
will either be eliminated immediately or phased out in five or ten
equal annual stages.  For certain sensitive items, tariffs will be
phased out over a period of up to fifteen years.  Tariffs will be
phased out from the applied rates in effect on July 1, 1991,
including the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the
Canadian General Preferential Tariff (GPT) rates.  Tariff phase-
outs under the Canada-U.S. FTA will continue as scheduled under
that agreement.  The NAFTA provides that the three countries may
consult and agree on a more rapid phase-out of tariffs.

Import and Export Restrictions.  All three countries will eliminate
prohibitions and quantitative restrictions applied at the border,
such as quotas and import licenses.  However, each NAFTA country
maintains the right to impose border restrictions in limited
circumstances, for example, to protect human, animal or plant life
or health, or the environment.  Special rules apply to trade in
agriculture, autos, energy and textiles.

Drawback.  NAFTA establishes rules on the use of "drawback" or
similar programs that provide for the refund or waiver of customs
duties on materials used in the production of goods subsequently
exported to another NAFTA country.

     Existing drawback programs will terminate by January 1, 2001,
for Mexico-U.S. and Canada-Mexico trade; the Agreement will extend
for two years the deadline established in the Canada-U.S. FTA for
the elimination of drawback programs.  At the time these programs
are eliminated, each NAFTA country will adopt a procedure for goods
still subject to duties in the free trade area to avoid the "double
taxation" effects of the payment of duties in two countries.

     Under these procedures, the amount of customs duties that a
country may waive or refund under such programs will not exceed the
lesser of:


*    duties owed or paid on imported, non-North American materials
     used in the production of a good subsequently exported to
     another NAFTA country; or

*    duties paid to that NAFTA country on the importation of such
     good.

Customs User Fees.  The three countries have agreed not to impose
new customs user fees similar to the U.S. merchandise processing
fee or the Mexican customs processing fee (derechos de tramite
aduanero).  Mexico will eliminate by June 30, 1999, its existing
customs processing fee on North American goods.  The United States
will eliminate its current merchandise processing fee on goods
originating in Mexico by the same date.  For goods originating in
Canada, the United States currently is phasing down and will
eliminate this fee by January 1, 1994, as provided for in the
Canada-U.S. FTA.

Waiver of Customs Duties.  The NAFTA prohibits any new performance-
based customs duty waiver or duty remission programs.  Existing
programs in Mexico will be eliminated by January 1, 2001.
Consistent with the obligations of the Canada-U.S. FTA, Canada will
end its existing duty remission programs by January 1, 1998.

Export Taxes.  The NAFTA prohibits all three countries from
applying export taxes unless such taxes are also applied on goods
to be consumed domestically.  Limited exceptions allow Mexico to
impose export taxes in order to relieve critical shortages of
foodstuffs and basic goods.

Other Export Measures.  When a NAFTA country imposes an export
restriction on a product, it must not reduce the proportion of
total supply of that product made available to the other NAFTA
countries below the level of the preceding three years or other
agreed period; impose a higher price on exports to another NAFTA
country than the domestic price; or require the disruption of
normal supply channels.  Based on a reservation that Mexico has
taken, these obligations do not apply as between Mexico and the
other NAFTA countries.

Duty-Free Temporary Admission of Goods.  The Agreement allows
business persons covered by NAFTA's "temporary entry" provisions to
bring into a NAFTA country professional equipment and "tools of the
trade" on a duty-free, temporary basis.  These rules also cover the
importation of commercial samples, certain types of advertising
films, and goods imported for sports purposes or for display and
demonstration.  Other rules provide that by 1998 all goods that are
returned after repair or alteration in another NAFTA country will
re-enter duty-free.  The United States undertakes to clarify what
ship repairs done in other NAFTA countries on U.S.-flagged vessels
qualify for preferential duty treatment.

Country-of-Origin Marking.  This section also provides principles
and rules governing country-of-origin marking.  These provisions
are designed to minimize unnecessary costs and facilitate the flow
of trade within the region, while ensuring that accurate infor-
mation about the country of origin remains available to purchasers.

Alcoholic Beverages -- Distinctive Products.  The three countries
have agreed to recognize Canadian Whiskey, Tequila, Mexcal, Bourbon
Whiskey and Tennessee Whiskey as "distinctive products" and to
prohibit the sale of products under these names unless they meet
the requirements of their country of origin.

                Textiles and Apparel

     This section of the NAFTA provides special rules for trade in
fibers, yarns, textiles and clothing in the North American market.
The NAFTA textiles and apparel provisions take precedence over
those of the Multifiber Arrangement and other agreements between
NAFTA countries applicable to textile products.

Elimination of Tariff and Non-Tariff Barriers

     The three countries will eliminate immediately or phase out over
a maximum period of ten years their customs duties on textile and
apparel goods manufactured in North America that meet the NAFTA
rules of origin.  In addition, the United States will immediately
remove import quotas on such goods produced in Mexico, and will
gradually phase out import quotas on Mexican textile and apparel
goods that do not meet such rules.  No NAFTA country may impose any
new quota, except in accordance with specified "safeguard"
provisions.

Safeguards

     If textile or apparel producers face serious damage as a result
of increased imports from another NAFTA country, the importing
country may, during the "transition period," either increase
tariffs or, with the exception of Canada-U.S. trade, impose quotas
on the imports to provide temporary relief to that industry,
subject to specific disciplines.  In the case of goods that meet
NAFTA's rules of origin, the importing country may take safeguard
actions only in the form of tariff increases.

Rules of Origin

     Specific rules of origin in the NAFTA define when imported
textile or apparel goods qualify for preferential treatment.  For
most products, the rule of origin is "yarn forward," which means
that textile and apparel goods must be produced from yarn made in
a NAFTA country in order to benefit from such treatment.  A "fiber
forward" rule is provided for certain products such as cotton and
man-made fiber yarns.  Fiber forward means that goods must be
produced from fiber made in a NAFTA country.  In other cases,
apparel cut and sewn from certain imported fabrics that the NAFTA
countries agree are in short supply, such as silk, linen and
certain shirting fabrics, can qualify for preferential treatment.

     Additional provisions, responsive to the needs of North American
industry, include "tariff rate quotas" (TRQs), under which yarns,
fabrics and apparel that are made in North America, but that do not
meet the rules of origin, can still qualify for preferential duty
treatment up to specified import levels.  The TRQs for Canada that
were included in the Canada-U.S. FTA have been increased and
provide for an annual growth rate for at least the first five
years.

     The NAFTA countries will undertake a general review of the
textile and apparel rules of origin prior to January 1, 1998.  In
the interim, they will consult on request on whether specific goods
should be made subject to different rules of origin, taking into
account the availability of supply within the free trade area.  In
addition, the three countries have established a process to permit
annual adjustments to TRQ levels.

Labelling Requirements

     A joint government and private sector Committee on Labelling for
Textile Products will recommend ways to eliminate unnecessary
obstacles to textile trade resulting from different labelling
requirements in the three countries through a work program to
develop uniform labelling requirements, for example regarding
pictograms and symbols, care instructions, fiber content
information and methods for attachment of labels.

                Automotive Goods

     The NAFTA will eliminate barriers to trade in North American
automobiles, trucks, buses and parts (automotive goods) within the
free trade area, and eliminate investment restrictions in this
sector, over a ten-year transition period.

Tariff Elimination

     Each NAFTA country will phase out all duties on its imports of
North American automotive goods during the transition period.  Most
trade in automotive goods between Canada and the United States is
conducted on a duty-free basis under the terms of either the
Canada-U.S. FTA or the Canada-U.S. "Autopact."

Vehicles.  Canada and the United States eliminated tariffs on their
trade in vehicles under the Canada-U.S. FTA.  Under the NAFTA, for
its imports from Mexico, the United States will:


*    eliminate immediately its tariffs on passenger automobiles;

*    reduce immediately to ten percent its tariffs on light trucks
     and phase out the remaining tariffs over five years; and

*    phase out its tariffs on other vehicles over ten years.

     For imports from Canada and the United States, Mexico will:


*    reduce immediately by 50 percent its tariffs on passenger
     automobiles and phase out the remaining tariffs over 10 years;

*    reduce immediately by 50 percent its tariffs on light trucks and
     phase out the remaining tariffs over five years; and

*    phase out its tariffs on all other vehicles over ten years.

     Canada will eliminate its tariffs on vehicles imported from
Mexico on the same schedule as Mexico will follow for imports from
Canada and the United States.

Parts.  Each country will eliminate its remaining tariffs on
certain automotive parts immediately and phase out duties on other
parts over five years and a small portion over ten years.

Rules of Origin

     The NAFTA rules of origin section provides that in order to
qualify for preferential tariff treatment, automotive goods must
contain a specified percentage of North American content (rising to
62.5 percent for passenger automobiles and light trucks as well as
engines and transmissions for such vehicles, and to 60 percent for
other vehicles and automotive parts) based on the net-cost formula.
In calculating the content level of automotive goods, the value of
imports of automotive parts from outside the NAFTA region will be
traced through the production chain to improve the accuracy of the
content calculation.

Mexican Auto Decree

     The Mexican Auto Decree will terminate at the end of the
transition period.  Over this period, the restrictions under the
Auto Decree will be modified by:


*    eliminating immediately the limitation on imports of vehicles
     based on sales in the Mexican market;

*    amending its "trade balancing" requirements immediately to
     permit assemblers to reduce gradually the level of exports of
     vehicles and parts required to import such goods, and
     eliminating, at the end of the transition period, the
     requirement that only assemblers in Mexico may import vehicles;

*    changing its "national value-added" rules by reducing gradually
     the percentage of parts required to be purchased from Mexican
     parts producers; by counting purchases from certain in-bond
     production facilities (maquiladoras) toward this percentage; by
     ensuring that Canadian, Mexican and U.S. parts manufacturers may
     participate in the growing Mexican market on a competitive
     basis, while requiring assemblers in Mexico during the
     transition period to continue to purchase parts from Mexican
     parts producers; and by eliminating at the end of the transition
     period the national value-added requirement.

Mexican Auto-Transportation Decree

     The Mexican Auto-Transportation Decree covering trucks (other
than light trucks) and buses will be eliminated immediately, and
replaced with a transitional system of quotas in effect for five
years.

Imports of Used Vehicles

     Canada's remaining restrictions on the import of used motor
vehicles from the United States will be eliminated on January 1,
1994, in accordance with the Canada-U.S. FTA.  Beginning 15 years
after the NAFTA goes into effect, Canada will phase out over ten
years its prohibition on imports of Mexican used motor vehicles.
Mexico will phase out its prohibition on imports of North American
used vehicles over the same period.

Investment Restrictions

     In accordance with the NAFTA's investment provisions, Mexico
will immediately permit "NAFTA investors" to make investments of up
to 100 percent in Mexican "national suppliers" of parts, and up to
49 percent in other automotive parts enterprises, increasing to 100
percent after five years.  Mexico's thresholds for the screening of
takeovers in the automotive sector will be governed by NAFTA's
investment provisions.

Corporate Average Fuel Economy Fleet Content

     Under the NAFTA, the United States will modify the fleet content
definition found in its Corporate Average-Fuel Economy (CAFE)
rules, so that vehicle manufacturers may choose to have those
Mexican-produced parts and vehicles they export to the United
States classified as domestic.  After ten years, Mexican production
exported to the United States will receive the same treatment as
U.S. or Canadian production for purposes of CAFE.  Canadian-
produced automobiles currently may be classified as domestic for
CAFE purposes.  The NAFTA does not change the minimum fuel economy
standards for vehicles sold in the United States.

Automotive Standards

     The NAFTA creates a special intergovernmental group to review
and make recommendations on federal automotive standards in the
three countries, including recommendations to achieve greater
compatibility in such standards.

                Energy and Basic Petrochemicals

     This section sets out the rights and obligations of the three
countries regarding crude oil, gas, refined products, basic
petrochemicals, coal, electricity and nuclear energy.

     In the NAFTA, the countries confirm their full respect for their
constitutions.  They also recognize the desirability of
strengthening the important role that trade in energy and basic
petrochemical goods plays in the North American region and of
enhancing this role through sustained and gradual liberalization.

     The NAFTA's energy provisions incorporate and build on GATT
disciplines regarding quantitative restrictions on imports and
exports as they apply to energy and basic petrochemical trade.  The
NAFTA provides that under these disciplines a country may not
impose minimum or maximum import or export price requirements,
subject to the same exceptions that apply to quantitative
restrictions.  The NAFTA also makes clear that each country may
administer export and import licensing systems, provided that they
are operated in a manner consistent with the provisions of the
Agreement.  In addition, no country may impose a tax, duty or
charge on the export of energy or basic petrochemical goods unless
the same tax, duty or charge is applied to such goods when consumed
domestically.

     This section also provides that import and export restrictions
on energy trade will be limited to certain specific circumstances,
such as to conserve exhaustible natural resources, deal with a
short-supply situation or implement a price stabilization plan.

     Further, when a NAFTA country imposes any such restriction, it
must not reduce the proportion of total supply made available to
the other NAFTA countries below the level of the preceding three
years or other agreed period, impose a higher price on exports to
another NAFTA country than the domestic price or require the
disruption of normal supply channels.  Based on a reservation that
Mexico has taken, these obligations do not apply as between Mexico
and the other NAFTA countries.

     This section also limits the grounds on which a NAFTA country
may restrict exports or imports of energy or basic petrochemical
goods for reasons of national security.  However, based on a
reservation that Mexico has taken, energy trade between Mexico and
the other NAFTA countries will not be subject to this discipline,
but will instead be governed by the Agreement's general national
security provision, described in the "Exceptions" section.

     The NAFTA confirms that energy regulatory measures are subject
to the Agreement's general rules regarding national treatment,
import and export restrictions and export taxes.  The three
countries also agree that the implementation of regulatory measures
should be undertaken in a manner that recognizes the importance of
a stable regulatory environment.

     In the NAFTA, Mexico reserves to the Mexican State goods,
activities and investments in Mexico in the oil, gas, refining,
basic petrochemicals, nuclear and electricity sectors.

     The NAFTA energy provisions recognize new private investment
opportunities in Mexico in non-basic petrochemical goods and in
electricity generating facilities for "own use," cogeneration and
independent power production by allowing NAFTA investors to
acquire, establish and operate facilities in these activities.
Investment in non-basic petrochemical goods is governed by the
general provisions of the Agreement.

     To promote cross-border trade in natural gas and basic
petrochemicals, NAFTA provides that state enterprises, end users
and suppliers have the right to negotiate supply contracts.  In
addition, independent power producers, CFE (Mexico's state-owned
electricity firm) and electric utilities in other NAFTA countries
also have the right to negotiate power purchase and sale contracts.

     Each country will also allow its state enterprises to negotiate
performance clauses in their service contracts.

     Certain specific commitments relating to special aspects of
Canada-U.S. energy trade, set out in the Energy Chapter of the
Canada-U.S. FTA, will continue to apply between the two countries.

                Agriculture

     The NAFTA sets out separate bilateral undertakings on cross-
border trade in agricultural products, one between Canada and
Mexico, and the other between Mexico and the United States.  Both
include a special transitional safeguard mechanism.  As a general
matter, the rules of the Canada-U.S. FTA on tariff and nontariff
barriers will continue to apply to agricultural trade between
Canada and the United States.  Trilateral provisions in the NAFTA
address domestic support for agricultural goods and agricultural
export subsidies.

Tariffs and Nontariff Barriers

Trade between Mexico and the United States.  When the Agreement
goes into effect, Mexico and the United States will eliminate
immediately all nontariff barriers to their agricultural trade,
generally through their conversion to either "tariff-rate quotas"
(TRQs) or ordinary tariffs.

     The TRQs will facilitate the transition for producers of import-
sensitive products in each country.  No tariffs will be imposed on
imports within the quota amount.  The quantity eligible to enter
duty-free under the TRQ will be based on recent average trade
levels and will grow generally at three percent per year.  The
over-quota duty -- initially established at a level designed to
equal the existing tariff value of each non-tariff barrier -- will
progressively decline to zero during either a ten- or fifteen-year
period, depending on the product.

     Under the NAFTA, Mexico and the United States will eliminate
immediately tariffs on a broad range of agricultural products.
This means that roughly one-half of U.S.-Mexico bilateral
agricultural trade will be duty-free when the Agreement goes into
effect.  All tariff barriers between Mexico and the United States
will be eliminated no later than ten years after the Agreement
takes effect, with the exception of duties on certain highly
sensitive products -- including corn and dry beans for Mexico, and
orange juice and sugar for the United States.  Tariff phase-outs on
these few remaining products will be completed after five more
years.

     Mexico and the United States will gradually liberalize bilateral
trade in sugar.  Both countries will apply TRQs of equivalent
effect on third country sugar by the sixth year after the Agreement
goes into effect.  All restrictions on trade in sugar between the
two countries will be eliminated by the end of the fifteen-year
transition period, except that sugar exported under the U.S. Sugar
Re-Export Program will remain subject to most-favored-nation (MFN)
tariff rates.

Trade between Canada and Mexico.  Canada and Mexico will eliminate
all tariff and nontariff barriers on their agricultural trade, with
the exception of those in the dairy, poultry, egg and sugar
sectors.

     Canada will immediately exempt Mexico from import restrictions
covering wheat, barley and their products, beef and veal, and
margarine.  Canada and Mexico will eliminate immediately or phase
out within five years tariffs on many fruit and vegetable products,
while tariffs on remaining fruit and vegetable products will be
phased out over ten years.  A small number of these products will
be subject to the special transitional safeguard described below.

     Other than in the dairy, poultry and egg sectors, Mexico will
replace its import licenses with tariffs, for example on wheat, or
TRQs, for example respecting corn and barley.  These tariffs will
generally be phased out over a ten-year period.

Special Safeguard Provision

     During the first ten years the Agreement is in effect, the NAFTA
provides a special safeguard provision that applies to certain
products within the scope of the bilateral undertakings described
above.  A NAFTA country may invoke the mechanism where imports of
such products from the other country reach "trigger" levels set out
in the Agreement.  In such circumstances, the importing country may
apply the tariff rate in effect at the time the Agreement went into
effect or the then-current MFN rate, whichever is lower.  This
tariff rate may be applied for the remainder of the season or the
calendar year, depending on the product.  The trigger levels will
increase over this ten-year period.

Domestic Support

     Recognizing both the importance of domestic support measures to
their respective agricultural sectors and the potential effect of
such measures on trade, each of the NAFTA countries will endeavor
to move toward domestic support policies that are not trade-
distorting.  In addition, the three countries recognize that a
country may change its domestic support mechanisms so long as such
change is in compliance with applicable GATT obligations.

Export Subsidies

     Recognizing that the use of export subsidies within the free
trade area is inappropriate except to counter subsidized imports
from a non-NAFTA country, the Agreement provides that:

*    a NAFTA exporting country must give three-days' notice of its
     intent to introduce a subsidy on agricultural exports to another
     NAFTA country;

*    when an exporting NAFTA country believes that another NAFTA
     country is importing non-NAFTA agricultural goods that benefit
     from export subsidies, it may request consultations on measures
     the importing country could take against such subsidized
     imports; and

*    if the importing country adopts mutually agreed upon measures to
     counter that subsidy, the NAFTA exporting country will not
     introduce its own export subsidy.

     Building on the bilateral discipline on export subsidies in the
Canada-U.S. FTA, the three countries will work toward the
elimination of export subsidies in North American agricultural
trade in pursuit of their objective of eliminating such subsidies
worldwide.

Agricultural Marketing Standards

     The NAFTA provides that when either Mexico or the United States
applies a measure regarding the classification, grading or
marketing of a domestic agricultural product, it will provide no
less favorable treatment to like products imported from the other
country for processing.

Resolution of Commercial Disputes

     The three countries will work toward development of a mechanism
for resolving private cross-border commercial disputes involving
agricultural products.

Committee on Agricultural Trade

Structural Implications of NAFTA

by Ewell E. Murphy, Jr., Esq.

     If the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) succeeds, it
will change the economic geography of our hemisphere, creating a
new North America in which goods and investment will move among
Mexico, Canada and the United States with unprecedented ease.  How
will that affect the structuring of Mexican business operations in
the United States?

                Are joint ventures passe?

     Transnationally, "joint ventures" blossomed in the disruptive
1970s.  They were born of protectionist legal systems that
prevented the foreign investor from controlling the corporation in
which he invested -- such systems as Malaysian Bumiputra, African
"Nigerianization" and Mexico's Echeverrian Investment Law, which in
most industrial sectors limited foreigners to 49 percent of the
equity.

     To sugarcoat such forced marriages, they were named joint
ventures, a label intrinsically false.  The dictionary tells us
that "joint" means sharing or acting in common, and "common" means
belonging equally to, or shared alike by all in question, but a
joint venture neither equally belongs nor is shared alike.
Corporate shares that, held by foreigners, are forever incapable of
being joined with other shares to achieve a wholly-owned subsid-
iary, or even 51 percent control, are in fact second-class shares.
All participants in a joint venture are equal, but some (the
favored local citizens) are more equal than others.

     When structured in a close ownership percentage such as 51/49,
a "joint venture" is inherently difficult to manage over any
considerable period, especially when its investors are from dif-
ferent legal and cultural systems.  Absent legislative coercion
like the Echeverrian Investment Law, there is little compelling
reason for foreign investment to be structured that way,
either in Mexico or in the United States.  Each investment, of
course, must be designed to meet its unique business objectives,
but I suspect that, as a general proposition and over appreciable
time, both sides of the Rio Grande will see fewer such joint
ventures during the NAFTA years.

                Owned or Supervised Distribution

     Another traditional structure that NAFTA will probably make less
typical is Mexican export F.O.B. the border.  All too frequently
that structure has characterized Mexican sales for the U.S. market.
Under it, the Mexican manufacturer sells for export and is paid in
dollars, but leaves actual foreign market penetration to the
purchaser.  After getting the product into the hands of a customs
broker in, say, Nuevo Laredo, the Mexican manufacturer calls it a
day, draws down his dollars, and goes home.

     That structure allocates to the purchaser the risks and
responsibilities of the U.S. market, to be sure, but it also
allocates to him the corresponding value-added.  Consequently the
Mexican manufacturer is an exporter in name only, both as to risks
and as to return.

     One can only speculate why the structure of sales F.O.B. the
border is so prevalent in Mexico.  One reason, perhaps, is that
historically Mexican exports have tended to be raw, semifinished or
fungible products -- metals, ores, cotton, hydrocarbons and the
like -- whose producers had no name~recognition by export
consumers.  Another reason, probably, is the cost and complexity of
financing intermediate distribution.  The legal and practical
aspects of conducting business in the U.S. were no doubt a factor
as well.

     In recent years Mexican manufacturers have begun to overcome
there doubts and concerns, and are penetrating the U.S. export
market more effectively.  A typical new structure is the wholly-
owned distribution subsidiary, which receives the product from its
Mexican manufacturing parent at the Mexican plant or the border and
handles directly all subsequent warehousing and sales to
distributors, dealers or consumers in the United States.  Another
new structure is supervised distribution, under which the Mexican
manufacturer sells to an unrelated U.S. importer at the plant or
border, but also maintains in the United States its own U.S.
subsidiary to check on the importer's efforts and to keep the
Mexican manufacturer directly informed of the U.S. market.  Under
NAFTA, such structures of owned or supervised distribution will
likely become more customary and will bring more value-added back
to Mexico.

                Strategic Alliances

     A more sophisticated prototype for Mexican investment structures
in the new North America is the strategic alliance.  This ingenious
arrangement is designed to coordinate the efforts of two or more
companies in correlative markets.

     Imagine, for example, a U.S. company that is in the top echelon
of its industry in the United States, is fairly competitive but by
no means dominant in Europe, and in Japan is technically able to
perform but feels ostracized by business practices that favor
Japanese companies.  Imagine, in the same industry, a German
company that is well recognized in Europe, somewhat competitive in
the United States, but similarly defensive in Japan.  Add a
Japanese company that leads the industry in Japan but is a newcomer
to Europe and the United States.  How can those three companies
grow in each other's home markets?  One way is to bash ahead
unilaterally, each the best it can.  Another way is through
aggressive attempts at hostile take-over.  A third is by strategic
alliance.

     Strategic alliance structures are infinitely variable, but in
our example each of the three companies might acquire small
minority interests -- say, 10 percent or 20 percent -- in each
other.  At the same time they probably would cross-license certain
technology.  They might also agree to cooperate in bids on projects
of certain types, especially where each can make a unique contribu-
tion, and perhaps arrange to coordinate procurement and training.
If they are manufacturers, they probably would add reciprocal
supply contracts.

     Strategic alliances are not easy to plan or document.  They
require careful legal thinking, especially in antitrust and
intellectual property law.  If successful, however, they offer an
imaginative means for companies to grow, not at the expense or by
the destruction of each other, but by pooling complementary
strengths.

     Strategic alliances between Mexican and U.S. enterprises have
already begun, and it seems likely that a NAFTA will encourage
more.  Such arrangements offer more market scope than simple
wholly-owned subsidiaries and allow more effective management than
is afforded by "joint ventures" with close ownership percentages.
For leading companies that seek coordinated expansion in both the
Mexican and the U.S. markets, strategic alliances may be the
cutting edge of the NAFTA future.

Legal Considerations for Mexican Businesses in the United States

by Ewell E. Murphy, Jr., Esq.


     If the North American Free Trade Agreement is achieved it will
allow a Mexican business, if it is so minded, to go up, beyond the
river, and carry there all the goods and investment capital that it
can find.  And NAFTA will, in time, prohibit any toll, tribute or
custom upon the movement of those goods or capital.

     For Mexican exporters the Hispanic segment of the new NAFTA
market will be especially inviting.  The six states of the United
States over which the flag of Mexico once waved have a combined
population of some 55 million and an aggregate gross product of
nearly US$1 trillion -- equivalent to 60 percent of Mexico's
present population and more than five times its gross domestic
product. note 1  By race, second language, tradition, and proximity
these states are enthusiastically attuned to Mexican culture and
products.  They offer the Mexican exporter his first and easiest
success in the new North America.

     The market that NAFTA will create is, of course, much larger
than those former Mexican lands.  It will be all of North America,
which one projection places at 370 million human beings with a com-
bined gross domestic product of US$6 trillion, larger than the
present European Community. note 2   Some Mexican companies al-
ready, in advance of NAFTA, have made their mark in that larger
market.  Particularly notable are the Modelo breweries, whose
exports of Corona and other brands account for 11.7 percent of all
imported beers sold in the United States, second only to Heineken;
note 3 and Vitro, S.A., which in the acquisition of Anchor Glass
accomplished the first hostile Mexican takeover of a major U.S.
corporation, and with joint ventures with Corning, Inc., Whirlpool,
World Tableware International, and others, is well on its way to
becoming a full-fledged multinational corporation. note 4  Those
attainments in export and investment are persuasive prototypes of
success for Mexican industry in the new North America.

     To achieve that success, however, Mexican business must heed the
advice of Thomas Wolfe, who reminded us that "you can't go home
again."  The home we return to is never the same as the home we
left.  When Mexican business returns to its home beyond the river,
it will enter a world that is radically different, not only from
the world those six states knew under the Mexican flag, but also
from the present world below the Rio Grande.

     Of all the differences the Rio Grande delineates, none is more
striking than the contrasting legal systems of Mexico and the
United States.  Superficially that difference can be catalogued as
the distinction between the civil law and the common law, which
creates the dissimilarities that separate, say, Italy from Britain;
but the incongruities across the Rio Grande are much more profound.
Mexico not only inherited the civil law from Spain, but was
nurtured in a Castilian colonialism that regarded juridical and
economic order as something ordained from above, a commandment from
the ruler to the ruled.  The United States not only learned the
common law from England, but was molded by the rugged individualism
of the frontier into the world's most uncompromising advocate of
democratic initiative and free-market capitalism.

     Consequently, law occupies different dimensions of life above,
than it does below, the Rio Grande.  In Mexico, law is essentially
a vertical force that moves downward from government to people.
When Mexicans have problems with each other they may resort to law,
but usually they resolve their conflicts by other means.  They view
legal duties, fundamentally, not as obligations between individuals
but as exactions of the government.  If the government does not
effectively enforce a particular law, the peoples' response, in the
famous Mexican phrase, is acatar pero no obedecer (respecting but
not complying). note 5

     In sharp contrast, above the Rio Grande law occupies both the
horizontal and the vertical dimensions of life, and vertically it
moves up as well as down.  When people have problems with each
other their first impulse is civil suit.  ("I'll take you to
court!").  If that remedy seems insufficient, they invoke the
government against each other by means of criminal prosecution.
("I'll get the law on you!").  If neither recourse suffices, they
insist that their elected legislators create a new legal remedy.
("There ought to be a law!").  Most significantly, in the United
States the factual application of any law is subject to the concur-
rence of randomly chosen representatives of the local citizenry:
horizontally by civil juries and vertically by the grand juries and
trial juries of criminal prosecution. note 6

                Cultural Shocks

     Those legal differences between Mexico and the United States
create many unpleasant surprises for a Mexican business first
entering the market beyond the river.  In particular, there are
three abrupt cultural shocks:  litigiousness, states' rights, and
compelled competition.

Litigiousness

       The first shock, litigiousness, is the most devastating.  This
characteristic of U.S. society has grown, in two centuries, from a
quaint rambunctiousness to an enormous problem.  With 90 percent of
all civil jury cases in the world tried in the United States,
Americans have been spending US$30 billion a year just suing each
other; between 1975 and 1985, U.S. liability awards in general rose
401 percent, and the number of product liability cases before U.S.
federal courts increased by 1,000 percent. note 7  The resulting
burden on industry is staggering.  The liability insurance costs of
U.S. manufacturers has increased 500 percent over ten years,
constituting, for example, 15 percent of the price of U.S.-made
machine tools and nearly 70 percent of the price of U.S.-made
tetanus vaccine, and demolishing entire product lines, such as
Cessna's single-engine airplanes. note 8

     In Mexico things are different; civil actions do not go to
juries, liability awards are typically for modest sums, and major
public issues are resolved, not by lawsuits, but by political
pressure and economic clout.  Consequently, Mexican entrepreneurs
are unprepared for the hair-trigger litigation and crippling jury
awards they may encounter in the United States.

     Anticipating and defending against Yankee litigiousness is a
principal objective of the investment structure -- the interrelated
framework of corporations and contracts -- by which a Mexican
enterprise achieves a business presence in the U.S. market.  Essen-
tially the structure's strategy is to wall off the main Mexican
enterprise from involvement in the United States.  In an export
structure, for example, the manufacturing source of the product and
its facilities for distribution within Mexico function in -- and
only in -- Mexico.  Distribution in the United States is restricted
to a separate subsidiary corporation whose objective is to limit
the liability of the manufacturing parent to the resources the
parent invests in that subsidiary.  The parent and the subsidiary
are related only by share ownership and by contracts consistent
with their roles.  In such a structure, for example, the parent
contracts to supply the subsidiary, in Mexico, with products; the
subsidiary exports the products from Mexico, imports them into the
United States, warehouses them as needed in the United States, and
resells them to subdistributors, dealers or consumers.  For
additional insulation a special-purpose Mexican export subsidiary
may be placed between the manufacturing parent in Mexico and the
distribution subsidiary in the United States.

     Among the basic risks to consider in planning such an export
structure are the jurisdictional laws of the states in which the
distribution subsidiary will resell.  An example is the Texas Long-
Arm Statute, note 9 which subjects to suit in Texas any corporation
that (1) "contracts by mail or otherwise with a Texas resident and
either party is to perform the contract in whole or in part in
[Texas]," (2) "commits a tort in whole or in part in [Texas]," or
(3) "recruits Texas residents, directly or through an intermediary
located in [Texas], for employment inside or outside [Texas]."

     As construed by the Texas Supreme Court, the Texas Long Arm
Statute is even more grasping than its terms, and will reach as far
as the U.S. Constitution permits.  By that rule, a Mexican
corporation can be sued in Texas if three conditions are met.
First, the corporation purposefully did some act or consummated
some transaction in Texas.  Second, either (a) the cause of action
arose from or was connected with that act or transaction or (b) the
corporation's contacts with Texas were continuing and systematic.
Third, the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend traditional
notions of fair play and substantial justice. note 10  Under that
reasoning, recent decisions reflect considerable willingness to
sustain Texas jurisdiction over corporations that make sales into
Texas, regardless of whether they conduct actual sales activities
within the state. note 11

     In the sober aftermath of the Bhopal disaster we realize, of
course, that some liabilities will pierce the most meticulously
crafted corporate and contractual veils.  The most ruthless
penetrator is product liability.  There the principal guidelines
are two decisions of the United States Supreme Court.  World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson note 12 permits product liability
jurisdiction to be asserted over any foreign exporter that delivers
its products into the "stream of commerce" with awareness that they
will be purchased by consumers in the forum state.  Asahi Metal
Industry Co., Ltd. v. Superior Court of California note 13 shields
from that rule certain component manufacturers who sell only to
primary manufacturers abroad.  For direct exporters to the United
States, however, the only reliable precaution is product liability
insurance covering the Mexican manufacturing parent and its entire
corporate group.

     If a Mexican corporation can jurisdictionally be reached for
suit in Texas, it can be sued in Texas on claims for wrongful death
or personal injury arising anywhere in the world.  That was the
startling result of the 1990 decision of the Texas Supreme Court in
Dow Chemical Co. v. Castro Alfaro, note 14 which held that, for
purposes of such claims, the doctrine of forum non conveniens,
under which courts may decline jurisdiction of foreign causes
because of injustice or inconvenience of trial, has been abolished
by statute in Texas.  That decision has made Texas a forum of great
attraction for foreign plaintiffs, and is a strong additional
reason for cautious structuring of Mexican business operations that
cross the Rio Grande.

     There are two helpful resources for contractually defining the
legal boundaries between a Mexican manufacturing parent and its
U.S. distribution subsidiary and between the subsidiary and its
purchasers.  The first is the United Nations Convention on Con-
tracts for the International Sale of Goods, to which Mexico and the
United States have both adhered.  The second is Incoterms, the
International Chamber of Commerce's standard published definitions
of basic trade terms.  A structure whose legal basis is the
Convention and whose points of sale are expressed in Incoterms can
be established by internationally comprehensible contracts that are
explicit but succinct.

     Although disputes with U.S. purchasers cannot be avoided, they
can be diverted to modes of confrontation less problematical than
litigation.  This is another area in which there is a helpful
treaty relationship between Mexico and the United States.  Both
nations adhere to the United Nations Arbitration Convention, and
are thus reciprocally obligated to enforce agreements to arbitrate
and to recognize arbitration awards.  This permits the distribution
subsidiary to ensure, by carefully drawn arbitration clauses, that
disputes arising under its sales contracts will be resolved by
arbitration at acceptable venues under acceptable law.
States' Rights

     The second shock the Mexican exporter encounters beyond the
river is that of states' rights of U.S. federalism.

     To the jaundiced eyes of U.S. lawyers, the Interstate Commerce
Clause and a permissive federal judiciary have well nigh
emasculated the Tenth Amendment, making the United States, for
business purposes, virtually a unitary nation.  But to the Mexican
entrepreneur the opposite seems true.  He planned to introduce his
product into one foreign nation, but to his astonishment he finds
that he confronts fifty-one of them:  fifty corporation laws; fifty
certificate of authority statutes; fifty state tax systems; fifty
state legislatures, judiciaries and executives; and, to make it
even more forbidding, a fifty-first umbrella of federal taxes, laws
and government over-arching all the rest.

     Mexico, by contrast, is a highly centralized nation.  Its
constitution is labeled "federal" but there the federalism ends.
It has one corporation law, one law for the establishment of
foreign enterprise, central control of most taxes, and a tradition
of national domination of the nominally separate states.  Small
wonder that Mexicans are stunned by the balkanized and discordant
system of state authority they encounter north of the Rio Grande.

     The Mexican entrepreneur can deal most effectively with U.S.
states' rights by visualizing the United States as fifty separate
markets, planning carefully in advance, in terms of compliance with
key state requirements, which of the fifty his product will enter.
Aside from product-specific regulations, those key state
requirements are, essentially, certificate of authority laws,
franchise taxes, and taxes generally.

     The Texas Certificate of Authority law, note 15 for example,
allows an uncertificated Mexican corporation to maintain local bank
accounts; to sell in Texas through "independent contractors;" to
create, secure and collect debts; to transact business in
interstate commerce; and to conduct "isolated transactions;" but
requires the corporation to obtain a Certificate of Authority to
"transact business" in Texas otherwise.  Cases have held that no
Certificate of Authority is required to sell into Texas by
interstate shipment on the basis of purchase orders obtained in
Texas but accepted outside. note 16  Consignment sales in Texas by
out-of-state consignors are similarly exempt. note 17

     Previously, the Texas franchise tax system was almost that
indulgent.  The statute note 18 simply said that franchise tax must
be paid by any foreign corporation that has a Texas Certificate of
Authority or "does business" in Texas, and administrative decisions
held that interstate commerce sales into Texas did not constitute
doing business provided they were not obtained by consignment or
regular solicitation within the state. note 19  Recently, however,
administrative rules note 20 of the Comptroller General began to
limit those immunities.  Those rules said that "[p]erformance of a
contract in Texas" or "[h]aving employees, independent contractors,
agents or other representatives in Texas" who "provide or induce
sales of the foreign corporation's goods or services" was "doing
business" for franchise tax purposes.

     Most sweeping of all was the rule of "constitutional nexus,"
which became effective in 1986.  It asserted that "A corporation is
doing business in Texas, for purposes of [franchise tax], when it
has constitutional nexus with Texas for the purpose of franchise
taxation."

     Finally, effective January 1, 1992 those encroaching rules were
replaced with an amendment of the statute itself, which now
provides that Texas franchise tax extends "to the limits of the
United States Constitution and federal law adopted under it." note
21

     For the movement of goods, those Constitutional limits were
drawn by the U.S. Supreme Court's "original package" cases (Brown
v. Maryland note 22 and Low v. Austin note 23) as refined by
Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, note 24 and Japan Line, Ltd. v.
County of Los Angeles. note 25  Those decisions exempt from state
taxation a vehicle or instrumentality of foreign commerce, but
allow a state to impose a nondiscriminatory tax on any goods --
imported or domestic -- that have come to rest in a warehouse
within the state.  In Texas the chief tax thus enabled is an annual
levy by counties and local tax authorities on the value of property
within the jurisdiction. note 26

     Another principal source of state and local revenues in Texas is
a sales tax note 27 analogous to, but simpler than, Mexican
Impuesto de Valor Agregado (IVA).

Compelled Competition

     The third shock of U.S. law to Mexican business is the ghost of
Adam Smith.  A fundamental stage direction of the U.S. legal drama
is the rule that its commercial actors must behave like freely-
competing characters from The Wealth of Nations.

     That rule is enforced chiefly by the federal antitrust laws,
which apply to export movements into the U.S. market as well as to
activities within it.  Exports to the United States are covered,
directly or indirectly, by the basic provisions of the Sherman Act
regarding combinations, note 28 the Federal Trade Commission Act
regarding unfair competition, note 29 and the Clayton Act regarding
acquisitions. note 30  Exporters to the United States are
explicitly addressed in the Wilson Tariff Act regarding price-
fixing in imported goods, note 31 and the Robinson-Patman
amendments to the Clayton Act regarding price discrimination and
exclusive dealing. note 32  Once Mexican products have reached the
United States they are subject, like all domestic products, to
general antitrust rules affecting exclusive distributorships, tying
clauses, resale price maintenance, and territorial and customer
restrictions.

     Similarly, when Mexican business engages in a merger,
acquisition or joint venture in the United States, it is subject to
the rules of U.S. antitrust laws against unlawful combinations.
For substantial transactions, that includes the premerger
notification rules of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, note 33 which
require participants in the proposed transaction to give advance
notice to the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of
Justice, allowing those agencies a specified period to determine
whether, in their view, the transaction would violate antitrust law
and if so to seek an injunction against it.

     Antitrust Guide for International Operations, a statement of
enforcement policy issued by the Department of Justice in 1988, is
a helpful guide to the transnational application of U.S. antitrust
laws.  In April 1992, however, the Department announced a partial
reversion to pre-1988 policy, in that combinations abroad that
limit the access of U.S. exports to foreign markets will be
prosecuted regardless of their effect on U.S. consumers. note 34

     The ghost of Adam Smith is also invoked, in the name of "fair
trade," to justify two U.S. penalties on inbound goods, although
most observers classify those penalties as market distortions
themselves.

     One is antidumping, a form of protectionism pioneered by the
United States note 35 and under which the U.S. has imposed more
penalties than any country in the world. note 36  By it, the United
States levies on the Mexican product an additional import duty
equal to the amount by which its value in the foreign market
exceeds its U.S. market price. note 37  The technicalities of that
determination are complicated, and the administrative procedures
for assessing and collecting the resulting duties are elaborate.
The only saving grace is that, to impose antidumping duties,
"material injury" to a U.S. industry must be shown.

     Another fair trade protectionism is countervailing duties. note
38  Here the law assesses penalty duties, not to offset lower
prices, but to compensate for government subsidies from which the
product benefited in its country of origin.  The United States has
the dubious distinction of having imposed more countervailing
duties than the rest of the world combined note 39 and, in fact, to
be the only nation to have used them extensively. note 40
Fortunately for Mexican exporters, a 1985 agreement between Mexico
and the United States note 41 placed Mexican products temporarily
within the protected category in which U.S. countervailing duties
may not be assessed unless the claimant proves material injury to
a U.S. industry.  Mexico's access to that category was confirmed in
1986 by Mexico's decision to join the GATT and accept its Subsidies
Code. note 42

     Any one of those three weapons -- antitrust, antidumping, or
countervailing duties -- is sufficient to bankrupt a business that
depends on the market distortions it forbids.  Against that risk
the only practical strategy of the Mexican entrepreneur is to
analyze -- candidly, carefully and in advance -- the extent to
which a project will involve such distortions.  If the project is
likely to be successfully challenged under antitrust law, it is
better never initiated.  If the project is vulnerable to
antidumping or countervailing duties, those duties and the ensuing
cost of fighting a challenge must be factored into the budget.

                Familiar Foes

     Not all of the legal problems of the U.S. market are cultural
shocks to the Mexican entrepreneur.  There are four familiar ones.

Federal Income Tax

     One is federal income taxation.  On this subject the legal
systems of Mexico and the United States are conceptually similar
and converging in corporate rates, with income in top corporate
brackets now being taxed at 35 percent in Mexico and 34 percent in
the United States.

     For Mexican investors, the most significant recent change in the
U.S. fiscal system was the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which not only
reduced U.S. rates dramatically but, by adding a "dividend
equivalent tax," note 43 reversed the structural rule-of-thumb for
Mexican investment in the United States.  Previously, because the
United States had a 30 percent tax on dividends paid abroad but no
corresponding tax on the remittance of branch profits, the best
corporate structure for investors (like Mexicans) unprotected by a
general tax treaty with the United States was usually the U.S.
branch of a corporation incorporated outside the United States.
Given the dividend equivalent tax of the 1986 Act, for investors
without treaty protection there is now a 30 percent tax not only on
dividends paid abroad but also on annually remittable branch
profits.  Consequently, the typical tax structure for Mexican
investment in the United States has become a subsidiary corporation
incorporated in the United States.

     The liveliest current tax issue between Mexico and the United
States is their negotiation of a general income tax treaty.
Presently their only tax treaty relationships cover shipping and
aircraft earnings note 44 and the exchange of information. note 45
As compared with competitors from nations that have full tax
treaties with the United States, that leaves Mexican investors
disadvantaged by the tax of 30 percent on dividends, interest,
royalties and rent paid abroad, which for treaty-protected
recipients is reduced to rates as low as 15 percent or zero.

Trademarks

     The second element of the U.S. legal landscape familiar to the
Mexican entrepreneur is trademarks.  Unfortunately they are so
familiar that sometimes they are ignored.  A surprising number of
Mexican investment projects have been disadvantaged by failure to
establish, in advance, proprietary name-identification of their
products in the United States.

Customs

     For Mexican exporters, the third familiar element of U.S. law is
that traditional hobgoblin of transnational traders, la aduana.  As
a checkpoint and duty-exacter, U.S. Customs functions much as
tariff-collectors do in other countries.  To cope with it, the
exporter's best technique is to shadow-box his entries in advance
with an experienced customs broker, making mock-ups of intended
shipping documents and thus avoiding unpleasant surprises.  Besides
import duties, U.S. Customs also enforces a myriad of federal laws,
from country-of-origin markings to the massive remedies of Section
337 note 46 against "unfair practices" in trade.  If achieved, a
North American Free Trade Agreement will eventually eliminate U.S.
import duties, and perhaps some Customs-enforced penalties, on
Mexican products.

Foreign Investment Restrictions

     The fourth foe for Mexican business in the United States is
restrictions on foreign investment.  Here the paradox is that in
recent years, while Mexican foreign investment rules were moving
from protectionism to permissiveness, U.S. foreign investment rules
were changing in the opposite direction.

     Mexico's present foreign investment restrictions began with the
piecemeal ownership restrictions of a 1944 executive decree of
President Avila Camacho.  They crested in President Echeverria's
protectionist 1973 Investment Law and were significantly liberal-
ized by the 1989 Regulations of President Salinas.  If rumors can
be trusted, that liberalization may soon be institutionalized by
formal amendment of the 1973 Law.

     The United States, by contrast, has traditionally welcomed
foreign investment.  There are specific statutes that favor U.S.
suppliers for government procurement and restrict foreign
management or ownership in such sensitive areas as banking, trans-
portation, communication, energy and fisheries, but until recently
the only really pervasive U.S. foreign investment statutes were
aimed not at restriction but merely at disclosure.  Those statutes
were the International Investment Survey Act of 1976 note 47 and
periodic "benchmark" legislation, under which significant foreign
acquisitions and related transactions must be reported
confidentially to the Department of Commerce, and the Agricultural
Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978, note 48 which requires
detailed public disclosure to the Department of Agriculture of
foreign acquisitions of farm land.

     More recently, however, fear of foreign takeovers has eroded the
permissiveness of the United States toward foreign investment.
Scrutiny of the economic position of foreign investors prompted the
1980 Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, note 49 and the
1986 dividend equivalent tax, note 50 each of which eliminated
federal income tax advantages for foreign investors.  In 1988 came
the Exon-Florio provision, note 51 which authorizes the President
to suspend or prohibit any merger, acquisition or takeover by a
foreign person if, in the President's judgment, that foreign person
"might take action that threatens to impair the national security."
The relevant procedures are now enshrined in Treasury regulations
note 52 that provide a voluntary notice and 30-day review period --
in effect, an advisory ruling mechanism -- for concerned foreign
investors.  The President's nullification power has been sparingly
used, but it is largely discretionary and constitutes a hurdle
Mexican investors must not ignore.

     The same restrictive trend is seen in the Foreign Bank
Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991, note 53 which subjects any
U.S. branch or office of a foreign bank to prior approval by the
Federal Reserve Board as well as the Comptroller of the Currency
and any state regulatory body, and reduces to five percent the
level of foreign investment in a U.S. bank that is subject to
Federal Reserve approval.

                Structural Guidelines

     Mindful of the cultural shocks and familiar foes of the U.S.
market, what guidelines does a Mexican business follow in
structuring an investment beyond the river?

Limiting Liability

     The investing corporation shields its Mexican assets against the
litigiousness of the U.S. market, as best it can, by creating a
firewall of corporate and contractual insulation between the parent
group in Mexico and the subsidiary that manufactures, distributes
or otherwise operates in the United States.  Then it adds the
further safeguard of product liability insurance adequate to the
costly jury verdicts of the United States.

Tax Planning

     The second guideline is tax planning.  When a Mexican business
crosses the Rio Grande it anticipates all the taxes it will face on
each side of the border and minimizes them by correlating those
taxes as aggregates and offsetting them against each other, as much
as possible, by foreign tax credits.  The impending negotiation of
a general Mexico-U.S. income tax treaty is encouraging, but until
such a treaty is firmly in place its possibility only increases the
variables.  Meticulous advance tax planning is essential to the
success of any Mexican investment in the United States.

State Strategy

     Legally, the United States is divided into fifty parts, the
states; and the market of each must be won by a strategy of
separate compliance with its distinctive laws.  The U.S. market is
conquered state by state.

Discerning Differences

     The last guideline is that of discerning differences.  The
Mexican investor must be continually alert to the unique demands of
the U.S. legal environment.  Some of those demands -- antitrust,
for example -- have little analogue in Mexico; they must be learned
and respected as new creatures.  Others, such as trademarks and
customs duties, must not be ignored just because their names and
functions are similiar to those of Mexico.

     Applying those four guidelines, the typical Mexican investment
in the United States will be structured as a separate, locally
incorporated subsidiary.  Its contractual relations with its
Mexican parent will be designed to insulate the parent from
commercial presence in the United States and to coordinate their
respective profit centers in a manner to credit and reduce taxes.
The subsidiary will confirm its trademark registrations and customs
classifications prudently in advance and will plan its U.S. market
expansion state by state.  Proposed acquisitions will be checked
against foreign investment restrictions, cleared under Hart-Scott-
Rodino and Exon-Florio if relevant, and reported to the Department
of Commerce and the Department of Agriculture as applicable.  After
that, full speed ahead.

NAFTA May Bring New Opportunities

by Douglas Karmin


     One of the main goals of the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) is to expand trade among the member nations.  NAFTA is
intended to reduce the tariffs on goods and services traded among
the three members (Canada, Mexico, and the United States).  The
financial services sector has received a great deal of attention
during the NAFTA negotiations in part because it has historically
been one of the most protected and regulated industries in North
America.  This articles examines how the NAFTA would liberalize the
financial services sector in Mexico and the potential impact this
would have on U.S. banks, insurance companies, and securities
firms.  Throughout the article, the potential beneficiaries of
Mexico's liberalization will be referred to as firms and investors
in Canada and the United States.  In the agreement, this is defined
as firms established in either country, even if they are owned by
non-North American investors.

     This article focuses solely on the expansion of American
financial services into Mexico.  The reason for this is that Canada
already liberalized its financial services market under the 1988
Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA).  This article also does not
address the contentious issues involved in liberalizing the United
States' financial services.  Canada and Mexico want to be exempt
from the Glass-Steagall and McFadden Acts which restrict a bank's
ability to own stock in other financial institutions and to conduct
interstate banking.  These restrictions are largely independent
from the issues involved in liberalizing Mexico's industries, and
therefore will not be analyzed here.

     Before examining the potential changes the NAFTA would bring to
U.S. financial services in Mexico, a distinction should be made
between business growth and employment.  Financial services
industries are known for employing relatively small numbers of
workers for a given amount of capital invested.  The U.S.
International Trade Commission reported that, with the exception of
marketing and sales positions, employment figures are declining in
many of the financial services. note 1  This is due in part to the
high degree of automation that is used in these industries.  When
expanded opportunities in Mexico for U.S. financial service
industries are discussed here, it should be kept in mind that the
corresponding increases in U.S. employment would not be nearly as
large as those in the manufacturing or other sectors.

                U.S. Investment and Operations in Mexico

     International trade in services usually requires the exporter to
invest in the foreign nation since the services are usually
provided directly to foreign customers.  Therefore, the investment
climate in a foreign country is crucial to foreign service
providers who want to enter the market.  And the investment climate
in Mexico was not very attractive during the 1980s because Mexico's
large foreign debt, poor infrastructure and communications system,
and high rate of inflation served as deterrents to foreign invest-
ment.

     The recent reforms under President Salinas as well as the
anticipation of a NAFTA have give a boost to investors' confidence.
The Journal of Commerce reported in June 1992 that U.S. investors
held approximately US$27 billion of the US$130 billion capitaliza-
tion in the Mexican equity market. note 2  Financial services,
while still heavily protected and regulated, have been a part of
this increase in foreign investment.  By the end of 1991, there
were 190 foreign financial institutions either represented by
individual banks or sharing banking offices in Mexico. note 3

     In acquiescing to the U.S. and Canadian demands to liberalize
its financial sector under the NAFTA, Mexico is also pursuing its
own economic interests.  Foreign competition in banking, insurance,
and securities will provide some of the resources needed for Mexico
to expand economically.  Foreign firms might also force Mexican
financial services to become more efficient in order to compete.
But at the same time, Mexico is very concerned that foreign firms,
due to their higher level of efficiency and capital reserves, will
drive Mexican firms out of business.  This could jeopardize
Mexico's financial sovereignty, particularly in the banking sector.
Mexico's Commerce Secretary and chief trade representative, Jaime
Serra Puche, summed up his nations' concerns when addressing the
Mexican Senate: "The negotiation of financial services has been
guided by two central objectives.  First, to maintain predominant
Mexican control of the financial system.  Second, to design an
opening that reinforces the economy's competitiveness." note 4

                Banking

     The Mexican banking industry has undergone many structural
changes in the last decade.  In 1982, responding to the foreign
debt crisis, President Lopez Portillo nationalized Mexico's
eighteen banks.  But under the leadership of President Salinas,
Mexico has successfully reversed that action.  All eighteen banks
had ben sold to Mexican investors by July 1992.  Foreign investors
were ineligible to participate in the sealed bid auctions.

     Part of the reason for the privatization movement was the
inefficiency of Mexico's state-run banks.  Lack of foreign
competition also hampered the industry's progress since Citibank is
the only foreign bank allowed to have commercial operations in
Mexico.  Citibank established operations in Mexico in 1929, before
most of the regulations barring foreign banks were created. note 5

Past Restrictions

     In December 1989, Mexico issued new banking regulations that
permitted foreign investors to own 34 percent of the equity in
Mexican banks, but foreign involvement was restricted to nonvoting
participation. note 6  A second wave of banking reforms was
implemented in July 1990.

     Under this new system, 51 percent of Mexican bank equity was
labeled as "A" shares and auctioned off to Mexican financial
institutions like the state development banks and the development
trust funds.  The remaining "B" shares were auctioned off to
institutional investors and Mexican companies as well as the
financial institutions eligible for the "A" shares.  "A" and "B"
shareholders could in turn sell some of their shares to virtually
any investor, including foreigners, as long as these "C" shares
were limited to 30 percent of the bank's total equity. note 7

     Another restriction limited individual investors and single
companies, both foreign and Mexican, to owning only five percent of
any bank.  This limit could be raised to ten percent with special
authorization. note 8

     The "C" shares that were permitted under the 1990 reform gave
foreign investors for the first time a voting stake in bank
operations.  Still, foreign investors did not flood the Mexican
market, in part because they were not interested in operating such
a small fraction of the controlling interest in Mexican banks.

     An even greater obstacle to foreign investment, this one
concerning foreign banks operating in Mexico, was the regulation
that prohibited foreign bank subsidiaries from offering services to
Mexican citizens.  They were only permitted to provide "offshore"
banking services. note 9

Proposed Liberalization Under NAFTA

     In late June 1992, it was reported that Mexico, the United
States, and Canada had reached a compromise on the financial
services sector of the NAFTA that would dramatically liberalize
Mexico's banking industry.  The agreement would allow U.S. and
Canadian investors to own 100 percent of Mexican banks, subject to
the restriction that no more than eight percent of the entire
Mexican banking industry is owned by foreigners within the first
year after a NAFTA is signed.  This eight-percent limit would be
raised one percent per year, each year for seven years, at which
time the limit would be completely removed. note 10  For the first
four years after the limit is removed, Mexico would reserve the
right to freeze U.S. and Canadian investment if it reached 25
percent of the Mexican banking industry.  This 25-percent freeze
could only last three years. note 11  Any further restrictions
beyond this transition period would require the approval of U.S.
and Canadian officials.

     The compromise limits individual investors to only 1.5 percent
of the market during the transition period.  After the transition
period has ended, individual investors would still be limited to
four percent of the market share if the four percent was achieved
by acquiring Mexican banks. note 12  This stipulation was designed
to protect Mexico's largest banks from foreign takeover.
Individual investors from Canada and the United States could expand
beyond this four percent limit, but only through internal
growth. note 13

     The NAFTA also addresses the issue of what kinds of banking
services U.S. firms could provide.  Under the agreement, U.S. and
Canadian subsidiaries in Mexico would receive national treatment
and therefore be allowed to provide all the services that Mexican
banks provide.  U.S. and Canadian banks operating outside Mexico
would still be restricted to providing "offshore" services only.

Prospects for U.S. Industry after Liberalization

     A fall in Mexican interest rates, coupled with the boost in
economic confidence that the NAFTA should provide, is expected to
spur borrowing in Mexico.  This possibility has led many to
speculate that the financial services agreement under the NAFTA
could give a strong boost to the U.S. banking industry.  But the
international position of U.S. banks must be taken into account
when analyzing the potential impact of the NAFTA.  A 1991 U.S.
International Trade Commission (ITC) report concluded:

     If U.S. banks are allowed to offer a full range of financial
     services and products directly in the Mexican market, there
     could be a moderately positive impact on U.S. banking services
     exports to Mexico in the long term.  However, U.S. banks are
     currently consolidating their international operations in
     response to large outstanding loans and higher capital
     requirements which will weaken their ability to enter the
     Mexican market. note 14

     Analysts have also cautioned that the relative size of the
Mexican market, even with rapid growth, is such that the short-run
impact on the revenues of U.S. banks is likely to be small.  A
recent study by Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott shows that in 1989
sixteen of Mexico's banks collectively had assets worth
approximately US$58 billion, one-fourth the size of Citicorp's
assets for the same year. note 15  In the long-run, however,
proponents of the NAFTA argue that the prospects for U.S. banks
look more promising.  Not only is Mexico's economy likely to grow
under the NAFTA and thus provide greater demand for banking
services, but it is possible that U.S. banking operations in Mexico
could be used as a way of expanding services throughout Latin
America.

     In regards to the type of banking operations most likely to be
undertaken, the ITC speculated in its report that commercial
banking would be the focus of U.S. investment rather than retail
banking. note 16  This is because retail banks must reach
individual consumers and therefore require larger capital
investments.

                Insurance

     Despite the fact that there are forty-three Mexican insurance
companies, this sector is widely considered the weakest of Mexico's
financial services. note 17  And unlike banking, the Mexican
insurance industry has a fairly large foreign presence.  Twelve of
the world's twenty-five largest insurance firms, including American
CIGNA and AIG, provide reinsurance and consulting services in
Mexico. note 18  These foreign firms make up approximately 15
percent of the Mexican market share.

Past Restrictions

     Similar to the banking industry, Mexico took steps even before
the NAFTA negotiations to liberalize its restrictions on foreign
involvement in the insurance industry.  Most significantly, in 1990
Mexico lifted its ban on new foreign investment in the insurance
sector and raised the limit of foreign ownership from 15 percent to
49 percent of Mexican insurance companies. note 20

     Despite these changes in regulations on ownership, there still
exist many insurance services that are reserved solely for Mexican
firms.  For example, only national firms are allowed to sell
policies to individuals living in Mexico at the time when the
contract is signed.  National firms also have a legal monopoly on
auto insurance for cars that are owned by Mexican citizens or have
Mexican license plates.  Another examples is the insurance of
imported and exported goods, which is restricted to Mexican firms
if a Mexican resident is liable for the risk.  Credit insurance and
civil liability policies have similar restrictions. note 21

Proposed Liberalization under NAFTA

     The financial services agreement reached in June 1992 would call
for major changes in Mexico's insurance industry.  U.S. and
Canadian insurance companies that are already in Mexico would see
their limitations on ownership in Mexican companies raised from 49
percent to 100 percent by 1996. note 22  The authors conclude that
this is indicative of an industry that is maintaining high
profitability in a protected market despite poor efficiency.
Liberalization of the insurance sector would therefore seem like a
great opportunity for the much more efficient U.S. companies to
expand their operations.

     Still, the Mexican insurance market has the same relatively
small size (when compared to the U.S. market) as the Mexican
banking market.  Insurance premiums represent only one percent of
GDP in Mexico, compared to 9.1 percent in the United
States. note 26  It is unclear whether the small size of the
Mexican market is due to lack of demand or supply or both, but if
it is lack of supply, then it is likely that U.S. insurance
companies could enjoy profitable growth opportunities in Mexico.

                Securities

     The securities and brokerage industry is considered by many to
be Mexico's strongest financial service sector.  Mexico has twenty-
five brokerage houses that provide its investment services.  These
brokerage houses have four main areas of operation, with by far the
largest one being securities agents and traders on the secondary
market.  Two other areas are brokering and mutual fund
administration.  There also exists investment banking divisions in
some of the brokerage houses. note 27  But the size of these
brokerage firms should not be overstated.  The Hufbauer and Schott
study examined seventeen of these firms in 1989 and found that they
had a collective net worth of approximately US$1 billion.  By
comparison, in that same year Merrill Lynch alone had a net worth
over US$3 billion. note 28

Past Restrictions

     The brokerage houses have probably the strictest regulations on
foreign ownership among the financial services.  Foreign investors
in brokerage houses must receive permission from Mexico, and the
total amount of foreign ownership in any one firm is limited to 30
percent.  In addition, no individual foreign investor may hold more
than ten percent of a Mexican brokerage house. note 29

Proposed Liberalization under NAFTA

     The financial services compromise would allow U.S. and Canadian
securities firms to control 10 percent of the Mexican market as
soon as the NAFTA goes into effect.  This limit would be raised to
twenty percent during the first six years of the agreement.  If,
after this six-year transition period, the U.S. and Canadian market
share reaches 30 percent, Mexico can put a freeze on further
foreign investment during a second transition period.  This 30-
percent freeze could only be started during years seven through ten
of the NAFTA and could last at most, three years once Mexico
decides to implement it. note 30

     Individual foreign-owned securities firms would be restricted to
four percent of the market during both stages of the transition
period, which would be a maximum of thirteen years if Mexico
invoked the three-year freeze in the tenth  year of the agreement.
At the end of both transition periods, the limit on individual
market share would be lifted, as would the aggregate limit of 30
percent. note 31

Prospects for U.S. Industry after Liberalization

     Since the securities industry in Mexico is the most regulated of
the financial services, some argue that the U.S. securities
industry has the most to gain from the NAFTA.  U.S. securities
firms have competed successfully in other unregulated markets due
in part to their relative size, sophistication, and reputation.
The industry was quite pleased with the compromise of late June.
In addition to the liberalized Mexican market that this compromise
would create, industry representatives are also fairly optimistic
about the prospects of expanding operations beyond Mexico and into
Latin America, though such an expansions would not be as easy as
spreading throughout the European Community.

     There are, however, a couple of reasons why a liberalization of
Mexico's securities regulations might not have a major impact on
U.S. firms.  First, the relative poverty of the average Mexican
citizen and the small level of capital funds of Mexican companies
may limit the demand for services from U.S. securities firms.
Industry representatives hope that the NAFTA will boost Mexican
wealth in the long run and thus improve the opportunities for these
U.S. firms.  Second, some financial services that fall under the
rubric of the securities industry do not require foreign direct
investment.  For example, most of the transborder business that
U.S. investment banks conduct with Mexico entails Mexican clients
coming to the United States for services.  Under these
circumstances, liberalizing Mexican market access is not going to
significantly improve the business opportunities of U.S. investment
banks.  There are, however, other types of securities services
(e.g., financial advisors, brokerage firms) which are more
dependent on foreign direct investment and therefore would stand to
gain from Mexican liberalization.

                Conclusion

     Despite the transition periods that Mexico has insisted upon
before completely liberalizing its financial service sectors, the
recent NAFTA negotiations appear to be a major victory for U.S.
financial service firms.  For the first time Mexico is permitting
majority ownership by foreign companies in these sectors, as well
as allowing U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries to provide services that
previously had been restricted to Mexican firms.

     On the whole, U.S. banks, insurance companies, and securities
firms are expected to compete very effectively in a liberalized
Mexican market.  The combination of experience, resource size,
reputation, and technical expertise gives U.S. financial service
firms a distinct advantage over their North American competitors.
However, U.S. firms could face stiff competition from Japanese and
European firms that are already established in North America and
therefore eligible for preferential treatment from Mexico.  Since
most major Japanese and European financial service firms are
established in North America, this sector could become the most
open and competitive market addressed in the agreement.

     It appears that the main obstacle to the expansion of U.S.
financial services in a liberalized Mexican market is the size and
income level of Mexico's businesses and citizens.  This obstacle
could be diminished by accelerated Mexican growth once the NAFTA is
implemented.  As is the case with many industries, the United
States might export more financial services to Mexico as it expands
economically.

MEXICO TRADE AND LAW REPORTER via NewsNet
August 1, 1992

Ringing Up Credit Cards Sales

     In July 1992, there were 9.6 million credit card accounts in
Mexico.  The credit card market is a rapidly expanding part of the
financial services sector in Mexico and is expected to continue its
growth in the near future.  Two banks, Banamex and Bancomer, along
with a consortium of thirteen banks called CARNET, control
virtually the entire market.  American Express plays an important
role in the service card market.

                Laws and Oversight

     The credit card industry falls under the Ley de Instituciones de
Credito (Credit Institutions Law) of 1990.  The industry is
regulated by the Bank of Mexico and the Comision Nacional de Bancos
(the National Banking Commission).  Only diversified banks may
issue credit cards.  This excludes credit unions and specialized
banks such as Mexico's agricultural and development banks.

                Card Issuers

     Through July 1992, Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, was the
leading issuer of credit cards, with approximately four million
accounts out of a total of 9.6 million in Mexico.  The consortium
CARNET, whose largest member is Banca Serfin, was second with three
million accounts.  Bancomer was the third largest issuer with 2.6
million accounts.

     As in the U.S., American Express issues service, not credit
cards, and usually requires its cardholders to pay off their entire
balance each month; thus American Express is exempted from the
restriction on card issuance by non-banks.  As of August 1992,
American Express had approximately 400,000 cardholders in Mexico.
Diner's Club and several department stores issue their own cards,
but they represent a small part if the market.

     Bancomer issues Visa cards and CARNET and Banamex issue both
Visa cards and Mastercards.  Banks pay the U.S.-based Visa and
Mastercard organizations a licensing fee to issue cards in Mexico.

                Card Billings and Market Strategies

     A total of US$12.3 billion was charged on bank credit cards in
1991.  During the first seven months of 1992, US$8.6 billion was
charged.  In spite of Banamex's lead in charge accounts, each of
the group's share of annual credit card charges is roughly the
same.  Through July 1992, Banamex and Bancomer each controlled
slightly over a third of Mexico's credit card charges and CARNET
just under a third.

     In addition to bank credit card billings, American Express
billed about US$1.0 billion in the first seven months of the year
and projects its billings will reach US$1.7 billion for the entire
year.  American Express's Mexican customers charge an average of
US$5,000 a year on the standard green card, double the amount of
their U.S. counterparts.

     Banamex aims at the mass market, trying to get its cards into
the hands of as many people as possible.  Bancomer, by offering
more services and by charging more for its cards, aims for a
clientele that has greater economic resources.  CARNET, because it
is a consortium of banks, does not have a set strategy; rather,
each bank sets its own market goals.  American Express gears its
card toward the highest income groups.  According to the head of
the Mexican subsidiary, American Express aims solely at the upscale
card market.  In the beginning of 1992, in fact, American Express
canceled 40,000 accounts, about ten percent of outstanding accounts
at the time, because of credit problems and because these
cardholders no longer met American Express's income requirements.

                Credit Card Loan Portfolios

     Credit card loans have become an increasingly important
component of banks' loan portfolios.  Banamex's credit card
portfolio grew in real terms between December 1989 and December
1991 from about US$1.0 billion to US$2.0 billion.  (Real growth is
calculated by factoring out inflation from the peso, then
converting totals into US$ using the peso/dollar exchange rate
prevailing in December 1991.)  At the same time, these loans grew
from eight percent to eleven percent of the bank's total outstand-
ing loans.  Bancomer's credit card loan portfolio more than doubled
in real terms between December 1989 and December 1991, from US$850
million to US$2.0 billion.  During this period, credit card loans
grew from 7.6 percent to 11.3 percent of its total outstanding loan
portfolio.  Bancomer reports that its credit card loans through
December 1991 constituted the most profitable segment of its loan
portfolio.  Figures were unavailable for CARNET.

                Revenue Sources

     Credit card issuers make money from three primary sources:  i)
the annual fee they charge customers for the card; ii) the amount
they charge merchants to process a transaction; and iii) the
interest charged to customers who do not pay off their monthly
balances.  Among banks, card fees range from 45,000 pesos (US$15)
for Bancomer's standard card to 200,000 pesos (US$75) for
Bancomer's high-income gold card.

     Banks charge merchants a fee of up to six percent of the gross
amount of each sale charged to a credit card issued by the bank and
offer discounts to merchants that do a high-volume of credit card
sales.  The day after the transaction, the banks pay the merchant
the entire value of the sale minus the bank's commission.  The
banks do not gain from a float -- i.e., from holding money in an
interest-bearing account and paying the merchants later.  In fact,
banks suffer a "negative float" -- that is, banks pay the merchants
before the banks have received payment from the cardholders for the
items charged and must absorb the cost of money until they are paid
by the cardholders.  Much of this funding cost is offset by the
commission the banks charge the merchants.

     For banks though, the most lucrative feature of issuing credit
cards is the interest they charge cardholders on unpaid balances.
Banks would lose money on their card operations if a significant
number of people did not use the revolving credit feature of the
cards.  In September 1992, banks charged a monthly rate of 3.25
percent interest (39 percent annual rate) on outstanding balances.
The rate charged on unpaid credit card balances is set monthly by
the Bank of Mexico, and is based on the banks' average cost of
raising funds, called the CPP, plus a profit spread for the banks.
In September 1992, the interest rate charged on unpaid balances of
39 percent provided banks a net annualized gain of almost 19
percent over the CPP rate of 20.16 percent.  A balance is outstand-
ing if unpaid 20 days after the billing date.

     Industry-wide, approximately 70 percent of monthly credit card
balances are left unpaid.  One indication of why so much is left
unpaid each month comes from a northern Mexico newspaper (El Norte)
survey which in July 1992 found that 68 percent of cardholders were
oblivious to the interest they were paying on their balances.

     In contrast to banks, American Express derives its credit card
revenues primarily from the fees it charges for its cards and from
what it charges merchants.  The standard green card costs US$66 and
the higher-income gold card costs US$165.

     American Express's charges to merchants depend on the payment
schedule the merchant select and the Mexican short-term treasury
bill interest rate.  For example, in September 1992, a supermarket
would pay American Express a 3.1 percent commission if it wanted to
be paid for purchases made on the American Express card within
seven days and 2.5 percent if it chose the 21-day payment option.
American Express does not offer next-day payment to merchants, but
its fees are generally lower than those of other card companies.
American Express also requires its cardholders to pay off their
balances within 11 days of billing, thus reducing the time the
company must extend credit to its customers.

     American Express does offer credit to its cardholders for
purchases over two million pesos (US$654), but as of September 1992
it charged an annual interest rate of 72.6 percent for this
feature.  Only 12 percent of purchases on the American Express card
are made this way.  As a separate matter, as of early September
1992 American Express charged a punitive annual interest rate of
125.4 percent for all delinquent payments.

                Loan Defaults

     Credit card companies lose money primarily through defaults.
Industry contacts indicate that industry-wide, that part of the
banks' credit card loan portfolios that is past due or
non-performing is about seven percent of outstanding loans.

     In March 1991, the Ministry of Finance adopted new rules for the
establishment of loan loss reserves by Mexican commercial banks.
The rules established five categories, corresponding to the degree
of probability that the loan would be repaid; the riskier the loan,
the higher the reserve.  Under this system, for example, Bancomer
in 1991 placed loan loss reserves of 41.5 percent against its total
past due loan portfolio.  Specific figures for reserves for past
due credit card loans were unavailable.  Banks may write off a loan
only with approval from the National Banking Commission after
demonstrating that they have made sufficient attempts to collect
the loan.

                Applying for and Holding a Credit Card

     Cards available in Mexico range from those only for use within
Mexico to those internationally-acceptable, with corresponding
credit limits and income requirements.

Applying for a Card

     All banks and American Express require proof of local address,
the last two salary statements, and a photo identification.
Banamex requires, in addition, a letter of employment and three
years of employment history.  Bancomer also requires family and
personal references.

     The companies usually do an in-house credit check and, when
necessary, submit the application to Cicsa, Mexico's only credit
bureau.  American Express does most of its credit verification
itself.  All issuers reported that each person's credit history is
verified, usually through phone calls, before they approve
applications.

     American Express rejects approximately 50 percent of its
applicants, mostly for lack of adequate income.  Bancomer rejects
only five percent of its applicants, usually for incomplete or
false data.  Neither Banamex nor CARNET would divulge this
information.

Cards and Cost

     Table I provides a sample of the least and most expensive cards
available and the minimum salary requirements to qualify for one.
American Express's cards are the most expensive, followed by
Bancomer's cards.  American Express also has the highest salary
requirement.

Services and Bill Paying

     Credit card providers in Mexico offer services similar to those
available from providers in the U.S.  These include access to
automatic tellers for cash advances, automatic travel insurance,
and card replacement.  Visa, Mastercard, and American Express
cardholders are connected to the international networks of those
firms.  In addition, Mexican holders of credit cards issued by
banks may use their accounts as savings accounts.  Banks pay a
market interest rate on positive balances.

     Most bank credit card bills are paid in the offices of the banks
that issued the card.  American Express bills are paid in American
Express offices.  Some customers pay their accounts by mail but
because of the unreliability of this method, most choose to pay in
person.  Banamex is beginning a phone payment system in which a
customer can transfer funds from a bank account to pay the bill.

                Market Growth

     The credit card market has grown significantly over the past few
years.  From 1990 to 1991 alone, total charges on bank credit cards
grew over 30 percent in nominal terms.  Charges on the American
Express card were up 27 percent in nominal terms over the same
period.

     Card companies expect the growth to continue through 1992 and
1993, although not as quickly as in the past two years.  Because of
the privatization of the Mexican banks, competition within the
industry is becoming more intense.  Still, CARNET and Banamex plan
for nominal growth of 10 to 20 percent a year in both billings and
card issuance through 1993.  American Express expects 20 percent
nominal annual growth in its card and billing portfolio through
1993.

     This growth is possible both because there are people who meet
the income criteria for cards but do not yet have a credit card and
because increasing incomes for some Mexicans could soon qualify
them for a credit card.  American Express reports that the number
of Mexicans who meet its income criteria is between  1.3  and  1.7
million.   Banamex would not provide an estimate of a target
market, but asserted that the free trade agreement with the U.S.
and Canada and increasing economic modernization in Mexico will
raise personal incomes making more people eligible for credit
cards.

American Express-Banamex Joint Venture

     In March 1992, American Express and Banamex announced a
joint-venture called Banamsa to issue American Express gold cards.
American Express expects to issue 300,000 of these co-branded cards
by 1995, in addition to the 400,000 American Express cards already
issued in Mexico.  American Express's primary aims in this venture
are to gain access to Banamex's six million customers and to its
network of roughly 725 branches.  This will make it easier for
customers to pay bills and for merchants to receive payment.  In
addition, American Express hopes to extend the market for its
corporate card through Banamex's relationship with businesses.
Banamex expects to gain access to American Express's expertise in
the travel industry and to its international financial experience.

                NAFTA

     Under NAFTA, foreign non-bank financial services companies will
be permitted to set up limited-scope financial institutions in
Mexico, including those to provide credit card services.  The total
assets of these companies are limited to three percent of the total
assets of all commercial banks in Mexico plus the total assets of
all limited-scope financial institutions in Mexico.  A change in
Mexican law would be required for non-banks to be able to issue
credit cards in Mexico.  It is expected that this change will occur
as part of the implementing legislation for NAFTA.

Toshiba:Established A China Joint Venture to Manufacture

from MAINICHI PRESS RELEASE SERVICE/ENGLISH SERVICE, September 17, 1996

September,1996

TOKYO -- Toshiba Corporation today announced that it has entered into
agreements with Chinese partners and Nichimen Corp. to establish a
joint venture company to manufacture and market color television sets
(CTVs) in Dalian, China.

Investment in the new facility acounts to approximately US$ 98.1
million. The establishment will assure Toshiba of a solid manufacturing
and marketing base for color television sets to address the strong
growth of demand anticipated in China, and to supply other fast-growing
Asian countries.

Dalian Toshiba Television Co., Ltd. (DTV), the color TV plant, will
have an initial capitalization of US$49.1 million, 52 percent owned by
Toshiba Corp., 13percent by Toshiba (China) Co., Ltd., 5 percent by
Nichimen Corp. and 30 percent by Dalian Daxian Group Corp. The
procedures to establish the IV were completed in last July. DTV's
facilities, including a product design and development center, will be
located on a plot next to Toshiba's Dalian facility for manufacturing
electronic components, Toshiba Dalian Co., Ltd. (TDL).

Construction will start in October 1996 and manufacturing is scheduled
to begin in October I 997. The plant will have a production capacity of
1 million units a year, and a product line-up of 21-inch to 29-inch
CTV. Output will be sold in China and also exported, malnly to other
Asian countries.

Market Gro'wth Expected
The worldwide CTV market reached 109.6 million units last year, and is
expected to enjoy steady growth to 112 million units this year.
Particularly strong growth is expected in the Chinese market, with high
growth rates pushing demand to 15 million units in 1995 and 20 million
in 2000. It is expected to match the U.S. marketinsize by 2000.

Toshiba's Facilities Worldwide
Toshiba is establishing a global network of CTV manufacturhig and
marketing facilities based in key markets including Japan, North and
Latin America, Europe and Asia. In fiscal year 1995, the company's
facilities worldwide sold approximately 6.1 million units.

Toshiba is establishing the new facility in Dalian: (1) to assure a
manufacturing and marketing operation supporting production of products
to meet demand from the Chinese market; (2) and because TDL already
produces key CTV components in Dalian, including TV chassis and tuners,
which provides a basis to create mutual effect for Toshiba Group by
extending overall manufacturing operation and procurement in the region.

Toshiba develops and produces a wide range of products in order to meet
diverse demands in different markets. The company is currently
enhancing all aspects of its global manufacturing operation structure,
from procurement to assembly, with consideration for such factors as
market size, costs and labor availability, etc. The establishment of
the new company fits into this worldwide strategy, and also allows
Toshiba to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation through business.

Toshiba:Uses the Internet to Strengthen Worldwide

from MAINICHI PRESS RELEASE SERVICE/ENGLISH SERVICE, September 17, 1996

September,1996

Tokyo--Toshiba Corporation today announced that it will use the
Internet to bring a new dimension to its worldwide procurement of
components and materials. The company is listing descriptions and
specifications of items it wants to purchase, and inviting suppliers
to e-mail details of price, availability and other information.

This new approach is part of Toshiba's reinforcement of global
purchasing. The company wants to procure from companies competitive in
price, delivery, quality and service, thus assuring its own
competitiveness across its wide range of business, from semiconductors
to power plant. Procurement from outside Japan amounted to 341.6
billion yen last fiscal year, and is expected to rise to 500 billion
yen by fiscal 1998, ending March 1999.

Use of the Internet will support Toshiba in finding and contacting new
suppliers, procuring from the most competitive sources, establishing
clear, speedy and effective communications, and developing and
maintaining mutually beneficial relations with suppliers.

Commenting on the on-line system, Mr. Hideo Shimizu, General Manager
of the Procurement Division, was very positive: "1 see the Internet as
having a very positive influence on our procurement. It gives us a
powerful means for finding and working closely with potential
suppliers, and 1 think it will also assure fairness, openness and our
accessibility to suppliers."

In other moves to strengthen worldwide procurement, Toshiba is also
enlarging its network of International Procurement Offices. Two new

All-out collaboration: Australia and Malaysia edge towards a more
integrated partnership

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 59

MALAYSIA AND Australia are strengthening their ties in the fields of
business, education, science, the arts and sports. That was the message
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer delivered in his
recent visit to Malaysia.
  The minister also said that the tide of economic, technological and
social change which is transforming Australia has created further
opportunities for cooperation and partnership between the two countries.
  In a written reply to questions from Malaysian Business, Downer spells
out the framework for trade and economic relations between the two
countries, and what possibly lies in the future.  
How do you see future growth in trade between Australia and Malaysia?
  Clearly, we would like our trade with Malaysia to increase strongly
every year. Over the past five years, total two-way trade has grown at
just on 19 per cent - a trend I would like to see continue.
  However, as we form more integrated partnerships with Malaysia and
Malaysians, it is likely that we will invest and establish more commercial
operations in each other's markets. This may mean that there will be a
shift in the way business is undertaken in future. There might be a
stronger growth in the bilateral investment statistics at first, hopefully
leading to a steady and balanced growth in trade statistics. Greater
investment should in turn engender healthier trade flows too.  
Would you be able to specify the amount of foreign direct investment
flowing from Australia into Malaysia?
  It is very difficult to specify the exact amount of Australian
investment going into Malaysia. Official figures do not take into account
funds sourced outside the investing country, re-investment of profits,
appreciation of assets and a number of other factors. So the figures are
generally underestimates - sometimes by a long shot. Nevertheless,
Australian official data puts the level of Australian direct investment in
Malaysia at around A$2.1 billion (RM4.24 billion), as at June 1994.
  However, I think this is an underestimate of the true stock of
Australian investment in Malaysia. Malaysia and Australia are both long
standing investors in each other's economies, and the total stock of
investment in each direction probably amounts to several billion dollars.
  Over the last few years, the pace of Malaysian investment in Australia
has also accelerated significantly. Some of your bigger and more
successful groups are here. Apart from the earlier, and successful,
Malaysian investors such as IGB Bhd and Malaysia Mining Corporation, we
are now seeing newer players like the Berjaya Group entering the market in
fields such as medical services and technology.  
What are the major Malaysian sectors in which Australian companies are
involved?
  Australian companies are involved in commercial operations and projects
right across the Malaysian economy. Australian investment has largely been
concentrated in the textile and textile products, non-metallic mineral
products, rubber, electrical and electronic and fabricated products
industries. Already some 200 Australian companies have offices in
Malaysia.
  Significant new Australian investments are expected to be approved in
the food processing, building products and paper manufacturing industries.
The information technology, computing and multimedia fields are also very
exciting.  
Given Malaysia's current push for technology intensive industries, there
must be plenty of opportunities for Australians. Please comment.
  This is one of the most exciting areas. We really want to help build
partnerships in technology, and Malaysia's focus on `Smart Partnerships'
in the technology sector will put the onus on businesses to be creative,
innovative and highly cooperative in their approach, and to include a
practical focus on training and human resource development.  
How does Malaysia compare with other countries in the Asia Pacific
region in terms of investment incentives?
  I am really no expert on the comparative investment incentive schemes
around the East Asian region. It is obviously a very competitive
environment. But my overall assessment is that more important than
specific incentives schemes for this or that industry or specific tax
breaks, is the need to get the overall economic and investment environment
right.
  That means setting a long term strategic vision and sticking with it,
getting the long term macro economic settings right and of course,
underlying all of this, stable and clear sighted political leadership. In
this environment, businesses can invest long term, build their assets and
expand their markets. I think that Malaysia has achieved its standing as a
very attractive investment destination because it has got these
fundamentals right. Vision 2020 sets a clear goal. Macro economic settings
have been carefully set and prudently managed and the country is
politically stable.
  So I think it is the fundamentals which are the source of success. Of
course, there are a number of other East and Southeast Asian countries
which have also advanced by attending carefully to these fundamentals -
but I think Malaysia stands out in the first rank of these.  
What investment opportunities are there in Australia for Malaysian
businesses?
  As I said before, we would like to encourage more Malaysian businesses
to invest in the productive, export and job-generating sectors of the
Australian economy - and I think we see good signs that this is already
starting to happen.
  Traditionally, we have had a good flow of investment into property
development and into mining. But now we are seeing interest in investment
in shipbuilding, medical services and technology, solar heating, building
products and aircraft engineering and technology.
  We want to see more of this kind of investment. Australian firms are
very innovative - having developed or adapted technologies to make them
suitable for Australian conditions. Now many of them are looking to go off
shore. They want to expand their markets. Foreign equity participation can
provide the finance and market openings to make this happen. And in
return, there will be technology transfer benefits for the foreign partner
and its affiliates.  
Are there going to be any changes in Government policy which will either
make it easier or more difficult for Malaysians to invest in Australia?
  My view is that government works best when it supports people and
business rather than tying them down in regulation and bureaucracy. The
best contribution the government can make is to lay down sound macro and
micro economic policies which create conditions for business to thrive. In
that context, the government's agenda is to free up the Australian economy
and create a strong climate, conducive to investor confidence.
  We want to make it easier for both local and foreign companies to invest
in this country's future. On the macroeconomic front, our first priority
has been to get the budget in order. We have cut A$3.9 billion (RM7.87
billion) from the underlying public sector deficit in this financial year
and we will cut A$7.2 billion (RM14.54 billion) by 1997-1998, bringing the
budget into underlying surplus in 1998-1999. This will reduce pressure on
the markets, reduce the cost of finance and encourage private investment.  
How would you describe Malaysia-Australia relations, particularly
economic ties?
  The bilateral relationship is very good and getting better -
particularly in the economic and commercial field and at the political
level which is very important. The priority this government has put into
the relationship is attested to by the energy with which we have sought to
establish relationships with our Malaysian counterparts. The bilateral
relationship is underpinned by very strong people-to-people links -
alumni, business people - and it is my job to ensure we do not take these
linkages for granted, that we build on them pro-actively to advance our
shared interests.
  The Australian government greatly appreciated Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad's first meeting with the Australian Prime Minister John Howard.
This was a tremendous basis upon which to establish relations between the
two governments.
  We have had an impressive flow of ministerial visits in both directions.
I have been to Malaysia myself twice since this government came to office
and many of my colleagues have also visited Malaysia. Deputy Prime
Minister and Trade Minister, Tim Fischer has met with  Datuk Seri Rafidah
Aziz on five occasions since March this year. So we are achieving a good
close working relationship in areas of central importance. We want to
build friendship and trust.  
Are there any areas in which you hope to expand further?
  Definitely. We would clearly like to see more expansion of people-to-
people ties at all levels from science and technology collaboration to
sport, in small business development and in new areas of existing
cooperation such as in education and training.
  My perception is that business and commercial opportunities in this
region usually follow the informal paths, the networks of friendship
established directly between people. So we need to build on those.
  Now, more than ever before, the growth of cheaper international
telecommunications, the Internet, expanded frequency and lower cost of air
travel are making the formation and maintenance of these kinds of networks
all the more easy.  
There have been reports that Australia's new government is rather cool
on the issue of integration with Asia as compared with the previous
government. Please comment.
  The government is strongly committed to building relations with Asia as
our highest foreign priority. For that reason, I and my ministerial
colleague the Minister of Trade, Tim Fischer, have travelled extensively
and frequently in Asia since we took office. The Prime Minister, Howard,
made his first major bilateral visits to Indonesia and Japan. The focus of
our diplomatic activity, our commitment and our travel continues to be
within our region. To put it simply, Australia's commitment to the region
is unshakeable. There can be no questioning of our commitment or interest
in building our Asian relationships. Our relationships with Asia embody
our key national interests as a country both now and in the future. We are
committed to the active pursuit of those interests.

No basis to rumours: Executive director Khaw Chay Tee sets the record
straight

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 10

DATUK LIM Thian Kiat, or better known as T K Lim, has a reputation for
being reclusive and press-shy. Thus, it came as no surprise when the
taipan of Multi-Purpose Holdings, Kamunting, Magnum and a host of other
listed companies turned down a request for a Malaysian Business interview.
  However, he directed his lieutenant, MPHB executive director and lawyer
Khaw Chay Tee, to reply to a set of questions on his behalf. Below, we
reprint the replies:
  It was reported some time back that you will be teaming up with Hong
Leong in a Philippine lottery venture. What is the status of this venture?
Have you mended fences with Quek Leng Chan of Hong Leong?
  There is no proposal for the Kamunting-Multi-Purpose Group to team up
with the  Hong Leong Group in any Philippine lottery venture. As for our
relationship with the Hong Leong Group, it has always been and is a
cordial and friendly one.
  It was rumoured that Multi-Purpose Capital (M Capital) will be making a
reverse takeover of a second board company. Or is this an attempt to list
Multi-Purpose Bank?
  There is no proposal for M Capital to undertake a reverse takeover of
any listed company.
  There are also currently no firm plans to list Multi-Purpose Bank as the
management is concentrating its efforts on achieving Tier-1 status for the
bank under the two-tier regulatory system as soon as possible.
  Are you planning any more gaming ventures in China?
  The Kamunting-Multi-Purpose Group has no plans for any more gaming
ventures in China.
  It is felt that Bandar Raya Development's prospects are bleak as its
landbank is being depleted. Will you be buying up more land?
  Bandar Raya Developments has over the last few years recorded average
profit growth exceeding 25 per cent per annum and the management of Bandar
Raya is confident of being in the position to maintain this trend. It
currently has an existing landbank exceeding 1,100 acres, the bulk of
which is located strategically in the Klang Valley and Johor, which is
more than sufficient to sustain Bandar Raya's requirements for the next
few years. Bandar Raya has, of course, identified existing as well as what
it believes will be new growth areas for property development and shall be
replenishing its landbank when the opportunity arises.
  There is speculation that MPHB will divest its stake in Sarawak
Enterprise Corporation Bhd. Is this true?
  MPHB has no intention of doing so as we believe Sarawak Enterprise as
well as the state of Sarawak hold tremendous potential.
  Four years ago, you told Malaysian Business you would be concentrating
on property and gaming, leisure and finance. Now, with the addition of
Sarawak Enterprise, you are also into power generation and various other
Sarawak-linked activities. What are the divisions that you will be
concentrating on from now on?
  Since 1991, the MPHB Group has had three core businesses, namely
financial services, property and gaming. The group has over the last four
years developed and grown this into the profitable and stable businesses
which you see today. The MPHB Group was therefore in the position, at the
end of 1995, to take on the challenge of an additional core business in
the form of electricity generation, transmission and distribution through
Sarawak Enterprise. The group intends to devote a similar amount of time
and effort to its new core business as it does to its existing core
businesses.
  Kamunting Corporation Bhd's (KCB) Kepong toll concession has been the
subject of controversy. How stable would earnings be if the concession is
withdrawn?
  Kamunting does not view its toll concession as controversial. The Kepong
toll concession was legally extended by the government for an additional
seven years, that is, from 8 Jan 1996 to 7 Jan 2003. The legality of the
extension has been publicly reconfirmed on a number of occasions by both
the Minister for Works as well as by the Deputy Minister for Works. As
Kamunting has at all times complied with and fulfilled its obligations
under the Kepong toll concession, there are really no grounds for any
controversy.

Bug-busting its way to the top: Fumakilla Malaysia Bhd isn't content with
being just the market leader i

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 24

IT MAY SOUND odd, but Fumakilla Malaysia Bhd is one company which is happy
about what is a bane of most households - blood-thirsty mosquitoes and
bothersome insects. And little wonder, for the revenue of this soon-to-be-
listed company is derived from our strong aversion to the buzz and bites,
disease and destruction of these pesky winged creatures.
  Fumakilla manufactures mosquito coils, insecticide vapourising mats and
insecticide aerosol sprays. But the manufacture and sale of mosquito
coils, which make up 80 per cent of Fumakilla's sales turnover is clearly
its speciality. The remaining 20 per cent of sales comes from Fumakilla's
vape mats (10 per cent) and aerosol sprays (10 per cent).
  The company's mosquito coils enjoy a market share of 65 per cent in
Malaysia, and its total sales have grown from RM28 million in 1990 to RM78
million in 1995. The Fumakilla plant at the Prai Industrial Park, Penang,
churns out over 800,000 cartons of 1,000 coils and 100,000 cartons of
1,000 units of vape mats and aerosol sprays a year.
  Fumakilla's president and executive chairman, Datuk Fumihiko Konishi,
says Fumakilla intends to increase the Prai plant's production capacity to
1.6 million cartons a year in five years' time.
  Konishi elaborates, `It does not involve expanding the premises of the
plant or establishing a new one. It is an attempt to reduce the workforce
by using technology.' This automation programme, says Konishi, is a
gradual one which is going to take five years and a significant amount of
investment. Upon completion, it will reduce Fumakilla's staff by half.
  Currently, 25 per cent of Fumakilla's workforce are Bangladeshis. The
company aims to reduce their numbers by not renewing their permits. The
reason? `To reduce cost - we seem to spend more because we have to provide
them with accommodation and transportation plus an annual paid trip back
home as well as uniforms and recreational facilities,' says Konishi.
`Also, if for some reason Bangladeshis have to return to their country,
then our company will be paralysed.
  `Besides, the acute labour shortage in Malaysia will persist. Population
growth cannot catch up with the growth of the industries of this country.
The only way is to introduce automation.' Automation will utilise the same
space as the existing premises. Says Konishi, `Our 7.2 acres will not be
increased. And if we fully automate, then we should be able to double our
capacity.'
  Konishi isn't content with Fumakilla being the market leader in
Malaysia. He has set his eyes on making the company one of Southeast
Asia's insecticide giants. `In 10 years time, I will be talking not about
Fumakilla's Malaysian market share but about its Asean market share. The
total population of the Asean market will reach 500 million by the year
2000. It represents an enormous market,' says a confident Kohishi.
  According to the Fumakilla president, the stage has been set for the
penetration of this regional market. Over 20 per cent of the 800 million
mosquito coils churned out by Fumakilla's Prai plant is exported, mostly
to Asean-member countries. He explains,' `The exports go to Thailand,
where we have captured a 15 per cent market share. I forecast this to
increase to 20 per cent by 1997. Other export destinations are South Korea
where Fumakilla has a 20 per cent market share, and Hong Kong and
Singapore, with smaller market shares.'
  Outside Malaysia, Vietnam is Fumakilla's biggest market, having captured
30 per cent of its market. So much so that Fumakilla set up a
manufacturing facility in the Dong Nai province of Vietnam at a cost of
RM8 million. Production began in December 1995 with a capacity of 200,000
cartons of mosquito coils per year. The capacity is to be doubled by the
end of the year, and this will involve an investment of about RM2.1
million.
  The next step, says Konishi, is to set up a manufacturing facility in
Myanmar next year. `Although we have begun to supply our mosquito coils to
Myanmar from our Penang plant this year, there has been a serious
logistical problem - their ports are congested. Hence, a better way to
penetrate the Myanmar market is to manufacture the coils in the country.
Furthermore, there is an abundant and cheap supply of labour there,' says
Konishi.
  Konishi says Fumakilla's mosquito coils, marketed under the brand names
Fumakilla, Goldfish and Jumbo, have an edge over competitors because they
have a higher content of an active ingredient called d-allethrin. Both
insecticide mats and coils when heated release the d-allethrin chemical
which destroys insects such as mosquitoes. Claims Konishi, `Our product is
50 per cent more effective than the other brands.' He explains why. `We
use 0.3 per cent of this ingredient in every coil while the common
practice among players in the industry is to use only 0.2 per cent.'
  Since d-allethrin costs RM500 per kilogramme, a higher concentration of
the ingredient drives costs up. As a result, Fumakilla's mosquito coils
are priced 20 per cent higher than other brands in the market. But this
does not worry the company. `We reckon our customers will be loyal, and
this is also why we project our sales to grow,' says Konishi. He expects
Fumakilla's market for mosquito coils in Malaysia to increase annually by
four per cent or less in the future.
  Konishi also says Fumakilla takes its research and development
seriously. Its analytical and biological laboratory which focuses on
research into insecticide is the only one of its kind in Asia outside
Japan.
  `In terms of product development, our laboratory comes up with products
that are more effective than our competitors. We have so far invested RM5
million in our R&D facility. In 10 years, we hope to invest at least five
per cent of our sales turnover into R&D,' says Konishi.
  Surprisingly, Fumakilla in Malaysia was not set up to manufacture
mosquito coils, but to import insecticide mats. Established in 1976, the
company started by supplying vape mats made by Fumakilla Japan Ltd - the
inventors of the electronic insecticide device.
  Konishi, a trained chemist from Japan, did not begin his career with
Fumakilla. He spent four years with a Singaporean trading company, leaving
his post as head of its chemical department in 1973 to venture into Penang
to establish Texchem (M) Trading Sdn Bhd (now known as Texchem Resources
Bhd). Among other things, Texchem trades in chemical products. Konishi
also set up a manufacturing company, Texchem (M) Sdn Bhd, which began
production of industrial chemicals in 1976.
  That same year, Konishi decided to get into the insecticide business
with Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed Fumakilla Ltd whose majority
shareholders, the Oshimo family, were family friends. With the assistance
of the Oshimos, Fumihiko incorporated Fumakilla (M) Sdn Bhd in Malaysia on
Dec 29, 1976 to manufacture vape mats. It was converted into a public
company on April 1983.
  However, Konishi says he had a hard time convincing the public to buy an
insecticide which did not produce smoke. `It takes a long time before
people will be comfortable using vape mats which do not produce any smoke
but which are just as effective as mosquito coils. Even in Japan, where
mosquito coils and insecticide mats originated, it took 30 years for the
sale of the mats to rival that of coils,' he says.
  Konishi feels the mosquito coil market is not about to shrink. `Even in
the year 2005, which will be 30 years after the introduction of vape mats
here, I don't think the usage of vape mats would be equivalent to the use
of mosquito coils. This is because of factors such as our lifestyle and
the structure of houses and rooms,' says Konishi.
  Fumakilla's listing exercise on the second board of the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange involves an offer for sale of six million shares at RM3.20
each. Fumakilla has a paid-up capital of RM39.99 million and is
forecasting a pre-tax profit of RM10.943 million on a turnover of RM87.38
million for the year ending Dec 31, 1996. This will give Fumakilla a gross
earnings per share of around 27 sen.
  Thus, at its offer price of RM3.20, its shares are being offered at a
prospective gross price earnings (PE) multiple of 11.8 times. According to
analysts, the consumer products sectoral PE multiple is 21.6 times. Based
on this PE, Fumakilla would probably trade at above RM5.80.

Choices in education: The stage is being set for greater interaction with
Australian edu

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 62

IN THE FIELD of higher education, Australia rates among one of the premier
destinations for Malaysian students wanting to study overseas. Last year,
of the 60,980 local students who went abroad for their tertiary education,
21 per cent chose Australia.
  Australian ties to Malaysia in the field of education date back to the
1950s when `The Lucky Country' was a key participant in the Colombo Plan
which provided education to developing nations of the British
Commonwealth.
  More than half of the average 12,000 Malaysian students admitted into
Australian institutions annually study business-and-economics-related
subjects, while almost a quarter study science and technology-related
subjects, including engineering.
  They study at the more than 300 schools, Technical and Further Education
(Tafe) colleges, specialist colleges and universities spread over
Australia's vast continent.
  But things may change in the near future, and the number of Malaysian
students abroad may fall.
  The reason? About RM2.5 billion leaves Malaysia annually as a result of
Malaysians studying abroad, contributing to the country's large services
deficit. Government authorities are keen to see Malaysia becoming a
regional centre of excellence in education by the year 2020. To help the
Malaysian higher education sector expand, legislation has been tabled to
allow private universities to be established, including the setting up of
branch campuses of foreign universities.
  Interviewed by Malaysian Business, Senator Amanda Vanstone, Australia's
Minister for Employment, Education Training and Youth Affairs, says such a
move is welcomed by Australia as it is in line with Australia's plans for
its education sector.
  Malaysia and Australia, she says, are at the start of a new phase of a
three-stage relationship in education. Says Vanstone, `The first phase
started with the Colombo Plan which saw a small but growing number of
Malaysian and other Commonwealth students going to Australia for their
studies. The second phase was one where there was a big push, with
industry and other private sector interests driving large numbers of
Malaysian students to come to Australia. We think both these phases have
been beneficial to us and, we hope, for Malaysia as well.
  `We are now starting on the third phase, where rather than a one way
flow of students from Malaysia to us, we want to step up the interaction
quite dramatically with things like twinning arrangements, where the
institutions, the academics and researchers will work much more closely
together. This two-way flow of students is a much more dynamic and
exciting relationship than the other two and we wish to emphasise that we
are very keen on building this third phase and pushing it as far as we
can.'
  Vanstone says it won't be long before the number of Australians coming
to Malaysia to study increases, but `perhaps not for full degrees in the
beginning ... just doing semesters up here with twinned institutions'.
  In all likelihood, there will be a drop in the number of Malaysians
wanting to study in Australia. `Things change,' says Vanstone. `I was here
about eight years ago but now, I hardly recognise Kuala Lumpur. The world
is never going to stop changing and we have to learn to move with it. We
are grateful for the opportunities we have had in having a lot of
Malaysian students. Now, we want to work with you on the next phase of
what you want and what we want.'
  In a related development, the Australian government recently announced
its intention of making some substantial savings from the higher education
sector. Vanstone says that as a result of this, Australian universities
will face only a very small reduction in their operating grant. The
reduction is against a growth estimate, adding that the universities will
have more operating grants next year than they had this year, but it will
be a little less than expected. `The big savings we are making does not
come from cutting grants to universities but from increasing the
contributions from Australian university students,' she says.
  Australia has a system of contribution called the Higher Education
Contribution scheme (HECS), introduced by the previous Labour government.
Under this scheme, students can go to university irrespective of the
wealth of their family but the moment they begin to earn wages, they have
to make contributions. However, Vanstone says the present government
intends to make this system of contribution more equitable.
  She explains, `The previous HECS system was one where irrespective of
whether you were a teacher, a doctor or a veterinary science student, the
contribution you were required to make was the same. We think that is
unfair and we are shifting to three levels of contribution where doctors,
veterinary science graduates and lawyers will be in the highest level;
engineering, general science and commerce students in the middle level and
nursing and art students as well as teachers in the lowest level.'
  In relation to the cut in operating grants for universities, Vanstone
says that universities will be allowed to `drop load', that is, to drop
student numbers in the post-graduate course work area. `We want to
increase the numbers in the undergraduate area. We plan to fund 5,000 more
students nationally for undergraduate courses but they are at universities
that will be allowed to drop post-graduate course work-loads such as MBAs.
This means that the total government funding per student will remain
pretty much the same,' Vanstone says.
  Recently however, Australia's reputation as a welcoming country took a
hard knock, no thanks to Australian independent Member of Parliament,
Pauline Hanson. In her maiden speech in Parliament, Hanson blamed Asians
and Aborigines for economic and social problems in the country and linked
Asian citizens to crime and drug problems. As a result, prospective
students are uneasy over their future in Australia. Vanstone took the
opportunity to address the issue, describing Hanson as a renegade and
`maverick' member of parliament and also describing as unfortunate, the
attention given Hanson by the media.
  She says, `It is important to note that when the (Australian) Prime
Minister first heard Hanson's remarks, his instructions were that she
could not stand for Parliament as a Liberal, that those remarks were
inconsistent with Liberal philosophy and hence it was simply not possible
for her to stand under the Liberal banner. She, therefore, stood for
parliament as an Independent and has expressed views which are repugnant
to the government, that are not the government's views.
  `They are certainly not my views. Australia has been a very welcoming
country and it still is. Our door is always open. We feel we have got
enormous benefits from the international students who have come. We look
forward to that continuing and increasing and at the same time, working on
a two-way development with Malaysia and increasing the strength of our
relationship,' she says.

Contractual benefits: Students gain in several ways from the twinning of
the Sepang Institute

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 68

THERE IS ONE simple reason why the Sepang Institute Of Technology (SIT)
chooses to have a twinning programme with the University Of Adelaide (UOA)
- the high standard and reputation of Australia's third oldest university
which ranks among that country's top six.
  SIT chief executive officer Dr Paul Chan says UOA became the obvious
choice as a twinning partner because it is considered as the Oxbridge of
Australia and is highly regarded internationally. `This university has
Noble prize winners (3) and very brilliant staff, Rhodes Scholars among
them. It is not a very huge university but it definitely has won many
awards - recently, Professor Allen Kerr was the winner of the inaugural
Australia Prize and Professor Paul Davis was awarded the Templeton Prize,
previously won by Alexander Solzhenistsyn and Mother Teresa.
  `Students there are well rounded and the entrance requirement is
befitting that of a good university. It is also very proud of its
tradition. The alumni of UOA comprise some of the top people in Singapore
and Malaysia,' says Chan.
  UOA first came to Malaysia in 1994 when SIT was run by the Hong Leong
Group. Director of the SIT-UOA twinning programme and visiting professor
Dr Thomas Kurucsev says, `When the Lion Group bought over the Institute,
we became their twinning partner. Our first intake was early this year,
and 250 students are enrolled in the twinning programme. We hope to
increase the number of students to between 400 and 450 for the second
year. In three to four years, we want to have at least 650 to 700 students
in the twinning pro-gramme.'
  Kurucsev adds, `SIT's scholastic year for the Australian programme is
synchronised with UOA and students sit for the examinations at the same
time as undergraduates in Adelaide.'
  UOA offers SIT students various engineering courses leading to a honours
degree. The other courses offered at SIT are Bachelor of Economics,
Bachelor of Commerce, Bachelor of Computer Science and Bachelor of Science
(Maths and Computer Science). The engineering courses run for four years,
which means students will have to be at SIT for two years before going to
UOA for another two years. The same applies for the other four-year
courses. For the three year courses, students are required to be at SIT
for one year and another two at UOA.
  SIT is the only college in Malaysia with the largest number of
academicians holding PhDs (20) and masters degrees (20), many from
prestigious universities like Harvard, Oxford, London, Toronto, Illinois,
Australian National and Adelaide.
  Kurucsev says SIT-UOA has a strict quality control on courses and this
is achieved several ways, including having a full-time academic director
for the project. SIT has provided a considerable budget which allows
Australian lecturers to come at regular intervals for each subject. The
duration for each subject is between a week and 10 days.
  Apparently, by coming over to Malaysia, the Australians get an
opportunity to give tutorials where they can meet and talk to students
about their courses. `For each semester, there should be two visits per
subject. There should be 20 visits per semester from lecturers from UOA
and that is an absolute minimum,' says Kurucsev.
  According to him, under the agreement, SIT is not allowed to have
another twinning programme with any other Australian university and the
same applies to UOA which cannot have a similar programme with another
local institute.
  Established in 1874, UOA has over 13,000 students, including more than
1,000 international students. The first official ranking of Australian
Universities by the Australian government's Committee for Quality
Assurance in Higher Education in 1995 has confirmed again that UOA is one
of the universities in the top band of institutions in Australia.

Crest and trenergy to tie up?

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 4

SOMETHING seems to be brewing between second boarders Crest Petroleum Sdn
Bhd and Trenergy (M) Bhd.
  Earwitness understands that Crest (formerly T H Loy) is negotiating to
acquire a stake in Trenergy for an undisclosed sum. It is, however, not
likely to be a controlling stake.
  Industry sources say a tie-up between both companies will not come as a
surprise as both are involved in the oil and gas industry.
  Recently, Trenergy director Chee Peck Kiat was reported to have disposed
of his 20 per cent stake in the company. It was not known who the buyer
was.
  Crest, which has a paid-up capital of RM75.78 million, is a member of
the Renong Group. It jointly owns substantial oil reserves, estimated at
110 million barrels, in Sumatra, Indonesia with Petramina and Petronusa.
  Trenergy is headed by Salehuddin Hashim, believed to be a close friend
of Renong chieftain Tan Sri Halim Saad.
  The sources also do not discount the possibility of Crest and Trenergy
collaborating in a technical tie-up.

Crystal clear directions: Construction company Crystal Realty is quite sure
it is ready to take on

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 30

KUCHING-BASED construction firm Crystal Realty Group Bhd may be
comparatively young but within seven years it has garnered enough jobs to
put it well within the top league in its field in rapidly growing Sarawak.
  Formed by two Foochow brothers, Ting Kie Hung, 36, and Ting Bing Cheong,
34, `CR', as the company is known, started in 1989. Among its first jobs
was the RM2.4 million sub-contract to build the Sarawak United People's
Party (SUPP) headquarters in Jalan Tan Sri Ong Kee Hui, Kuching.
  The project was completed well on schedule. Recalls Bing Cheong, a civil
and structural engineer by training, `I literally worked and lived at the
work-site for the duration of the contract period.' He says that for a
year, the oversized container office was his office and living quarters.
  That project was perhaps the most important break the brothers received
after branching off on their own - they had previously worked for their
father Ting Ong Hua who owned Sibu-based Soon Hup Construction Company -
to enter the Kuching market. `We've been kept very busy ever since,' says
Bing Cheong, the group's managing director.
  CR's executive director Huon Chek Khing, 29, shows a list of completed
projects todate valued at about RM133 million and another list of projects
in progress valued at about RM360 million. `We specialise in building
construction, more so now in high-rise buildings,' he says. `The high-rise
buildings under construction include the Tun Jugah Centre, Wisma Bersatul,
Wisma Crystal and Rumah Dayak - all in Kuching.'
  Huon adds that while general and building construction remains the
group's core business, CR has diversified into property development,
property management, mechanical and engineering services, building-related
materials manufacturing, trading and specialised foundation jobs.
  `We're the first Sarawak-based construction group to venture into bore
foundation works. Examples are the Custodev's Twin Tower Block in Rock
Road, the Tun Jugah Centre in Padungan and the MBf building in Jalan
Satok. But that's not all CR is into. It is also the first Kuching-based
company to manufacture non-baked bricks, besides reinforced pre-cast
concrete or ready-mix concrete, under Crystal Concrete Sdn Bhd.
  `Our aim is to be a self-sufficient construction firm by becoming
involved in manufacturing, trading and marketing. All of them complement
our core business. In other words, we want to grow and expand.'
  This interview took place at what Bing Cheong describes as CR's
temporary office on the third floor of Crystal Cineplex Complex in Taman
Satria Jaya, Kuching, pending the completion next year of CR's RM20
million 13-storey corporate headquarters at Jalan Rambutan/Jalan Nanas.
  The group's logo `CR' is in two colours - `C' which is red is usually
associated with prosperity in the Chinese culture, while `R' is blue,
symbolising the sky that is unlimited, like its slogan `Together, We
Build'. A corporate image is strictly maintained - everyone from boss down
to the office boy wears a blue uniform at work. The group also allocates
funds for staff training.
  Not only is the company young but the people managing and working in it
are mostly in their early thirties. With so many projects on hand, the
workforce has increased as well. `Our total staff today is 280, including
50  engineers and managers,' says Bing Cheong.
  CR feels it has marshalled enough experience, expertise and know-how to
attempt bigger things, especially major infra-structural works. It is
undaunted by the competition from the `big boys'.
  With a growing turnover (refer to chart), CR will definitely play a big
role in Sarawak's construction sector in the years to come. According to
Bing Cheong, turnover for 1996 is estimated at about RM75 million, nearly
double that of 1995, which itself is twice that of the previous year.
  `We've got a lot of opportunities here with the Bakun HEP, foreign
investments, mega projects, etc, that will entail a total development
expenditure of some RM75 billion within the next 10 years. There is a
provision of RM1.8 billion alone for infra-structural development for
Sarawak under the Seventh Malaysia Plan. So I think we can share a bit of
the cake,' says Bing Cheong.
  The managing director believes that CR has been in the market
sufficiently long enough to prove its capacity and capability. Its edge
over many others, he claims, lies in having the latest technology in
construction `like the bore piling' and RM25 million worth of construction
equipment ranging from excavators to  cranes and bore piling machines.
  In a competitive environment, every company has to have some kind of an
edge. And the way to achieve that is to synergise people and resources and
keep costs down. Diversifying from its present core business into the
various related activities is part of the long-term strategy.
  Bing Cheong says CR is studying the possibility of getting listed on the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's second board. Like many other Sarawak
contractors, CR sees listing as perhaps the best way to raise the
necessary capital and take advantage of opportunities from the billion-
ringgit projects in Sarawak in the next 10 years.

Detecting deceit: Some of the ways employees can cheat a company

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 77

MUCH OF OUR work derives from negative events such as stock differences,
indications of fraud or theft, or the leaking of business information. The
tip-off usually comes from someone inside or outside the company, but
often the management hesitates to act on it.
  Denying the problem is no solution. No matter how unpleasant, the
question as to whether something is wrong or not must be answered as the
uncertainty in the long run can be extremely undermining. An investigation
brings clarity, certainty and an end to anxiety and problems.
  Outlined below are some cases where the management has heeded the
signals that demanded action.THE HARD WORKER
  Doubts and suspicions are difficult to work with. That is why a client
wanted us to carry out an investigation into rumours that an employee was
changing car tyres free of charge.
  The rumours did not seem plausible because the employee had been with
the firm for 10 years and, moreover, was a hard worker. But still,
certainty is always better, especially if an innocent person is being
falsely accused.
  The employee was a one-man business inside the firm. He was responsible
for the guarantee work. If there were problems with the tyres delivered,
he assessed the complaint, wrote out the guarantee ticket, fetched new
tyres from the stores and fitted them. No one checked his work. He was a
hard worker who would even work during break times to help a client.
  In reality, he made good use of the fact that everyone else was in the
canteen so that he could arrange his little deals with the clients, who
did not arrive at break time by chance. Our investigation revealed that he
had a number of other little deals which had nothing to do with the firm
but which he conducted during working hours.
  The firm is now an employee the poorer but financially the richer.
  A proper separation of functions plus extra attention to clients who
always ask for the same employee, especially at the beginning or end of
the working day or at break times, is a good step towards fraud
prevention.A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT WITH BITE
  A client had strong suspicions that an employee of his dental laboratory
was carrying out work for a competitor on his own account.
  Our investigation confirmed that he had indeed a lot of contact with the
competition and was carrying out work for the other laboratory, and that
he also carried out work for his employer's customers which he did not put
through the books.
  We also discovered that a second employee was involved with him. The two
of them had built up a strong private working relationship with each
other.
  Both employees had been with the laboratory for about 20 years, but they
had never signed a contract of employment so there were no written rules
about contact with competitors nor anything else. However, we were able to
prove that in carrying out work on their own account for the competitor
and others the two had used the materials, time and apparatus belonging to
their employer.
  Our client has now introduced a contract of employment which makes clear
what is required and what is not allowed and the consequences of breaching
that contract.AGGRESSIVE ADVERTISEMENT CANVASSING
  This `tip' is published at the request of a lawyer in the Dutch city of
Maastricht. Not only this Maastricht lawyer but also various colleagues
inside and outside the Maastricht County Court District are frequently
approached by telephone canvassers who, in an extremely cheeky, cunning
and aggressive manner, try to obtain orders for the placing of
advertisements.
  Often it goes like this.
  The subject is telephoned by a canvasser with the claim that some time
ago an agreement was made by telephone that an advertisement would be
placed, that the proof is ready and will be faxed to the subject, and that
this must be signed as approved and returned.
  Subsequently, a discussion ensues when the subject disputes the supposed
telephone agreement and the canvasser persists with his stand and says
that costs have already accrued for the proof which must be paid for in
any case.
  Cases are known where the telephone argument ends with the canvasser
saying, `We will talk to each other again in front of the judge,' after
which nothing more is heard. It has also happened that in the absence of
the lawyer, the secretary or office manager is approached (in the
foregoing manner) and that under pressure or through misunderstanding,
advertisements have been placed for which an order was never given.
  Our comment: Businesses too are approached in this way. It happens
especially during holiday periods when it is hoped that whoever is filling
in will think that a colleague has ordered the advertisement. Some
canvassers use a well known courier service to deliver the confirmation
and return with the signature. And if their account is not paid, then some
will even call in collection agencies.
  We would advise our readers that those of you who do business in the
Netherlands, if subjected to this kind of approach, could contact the
Stichting Eerlijk Zakendoen (Honest Business Foundation) who, in co-
operation with the Chambers of Commerce, are undertaking action against
these canvassers. The address of the foundation is Werkhovenstraat 94,
9546 VJ The Hague. Tel: 070 3299591, Fax: 070 3299751.DONE DIFFERENTLY
  It was strange that the head of the administration department had needed
to speak to the same driver twice about his failure to hand over the money
for paid invoices. Each time he had a different excuse: his house was
being rebuilt and in the chaos he had lost the money; he thought that he
had paid the money over and wondered if someone in the administration
department had made a mistake.
  Because the driver still enjoyed the management's full confidence it was
thought that he had not done anything dishonest, and when spoken to he had
eventually paid the money over.
  When he failed for the third time to hand over a sum of money, the
directors decided that they had had enough. Perhaps external investigators
would tackle it differently.
  When our investigators were interviewing the driver they quickly
realised that he was not very particular about telling the truth. He told
them that on the morning in question he had not been at work because he
had had to do a vocational test at the labour office. He told our
investigators the room number where he had done the test and gave them the
name and description of the examiner.
  What he did not expect was that they would check what he had told them.
The room number he had given did not exist and the examiner he had named
was on holiday. When confronted with this he admitted that he had not been
to the labour office, he simply wanted a free morning. And what about the
money that he had kept back? If no one had asked about it he would have
kept it.
  At the end of the interview he said, `You go about things differently
than they do here!'TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE
  Two employees left a client company at the same time. Both of them were
experts in their speciality. Although both of them said that they were not
about to undertake competitive employment, the directors had their doubts.
We were asked to carry out an investigation as to whether or not the two
were in breach of the conditions of their former contract of employment.
  During preliminary inquiries, it became apparent that the two were
indeed employed in the same sector as their previous employer. It was
decided to contact them to ascertain how far their activities had
advanced. The first man contacted suggested a meeting in a motel.
  As usual, our investigators arrived long before the appointed time. They
saw the man they had come to meet enter accompanied by a second man. They
took their places at a table close to where our investigators were sitting
and conversed in voices which were easy to overhear. From what they were
saying, one of the men appeared to trust no one.
  When the appointed interview time arrived, our investigators introduced
themselves. The second man who had arrived introduced himself as the other
departed employee. Our investigators had intended to arrange interviews
with the men one at a time but a second interview was now unnecessary. The
conversation provided sufficient information for our investigators to be
satisfied that both men were in breach of their former contract of
employment.  OWN BOSS? YES, BUT ON OWN ACCOUNT TOO!
  A client was tired of the frequent absences of one of his employees. She
claimed to be sick but he was told that she had advertised in a local
newspaper that she gave beauty treatments at home.
  Our investigation revealed that during her periods of absence she had
undertaken various training courses in beauty care. In fact, she had
passed examinations with flying colours. Subsequently, our female
investigators made appointments with her and had facial treatments.
  She is now free to devote all her time and energy to making a success of
her beauty salon - but on her own account and not at her employer's
expense and not at the inconvenience of her colleagues who so frequently
had to do her work.A LITTLE HUMOUR GOES A LONG WAY
  In an previous article, we wrote about a managing director who, in order
to prevent further misuse of the alcoholic contents of the directors'
refrigerator, had stuck a note on the door that said: `God sees
everything'.
  One of our readers thought it a good idea and did the same. Some days
later he found a note stuck underneath his that read: `But He doesn't go
on about it'.
  The message had got across. As one of the directors said to us, `If they
know that I know, it makes a difference. A little bit of prevention.'

Fast and comfortable: Nissan's competitively priced Cefiro offers power
and safety

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 86

AS GIMMICKS GO, not many would venture so far as the engineers at Nissan.
They fitted their latest 24-valve DOHC V6 engine to power the jet
propellor of a two-seater light aircraft to prove a point.
  The point of the exercise - to prove that should anyone be so inclined,
the new Nissan Cefiro 3-litre, for which the engine was developed, can
fly. In a test drive conducted by Malaysian Business, fly it literally did
- the car, as did the E-Racer light aircraft whose successful flight one
might assume will give Nissan ideas far above their `station.'
  That may be for the future. For now, all that `fit-to-fly' technical
excellence is neatly packaged under the hood of Nissan's first foray into
the 3000cc class, which up till now has been the sole preserve of well-
established European makes in this country. The first Cefiro which was
introduced in 1988 was a hit in its home shores. But while sales were
brisk enough, it received rather lukewarm response elsewhere. Almost a
decade on, changes were made, designed to make various dimensions of the
new hybrid higher, wider and longer. In the words of Tan Hoe Pin, deputy
managing director of Edaran Tan Chong Motor Sdn Bhd, Nissan's goal was to
improve on the basic concept of the car particularly in terms of its
performance, styling, technology as well as active and passive safety
standards. The result is the creation of a sports sedan that is wide-
bodied with a high degree of luxury and comfort.
  The heartbeat of the new Cefiro V6 is its 3.0 Litre 24-Valve Double
Overhead Camshaft (DOHC) Engine Concentrated Control System (ECCS) engine
which is a proven high performance power plant that generates plenty of
power and brisk responsiveness. Despite that, it is subjected to less
vibration and, Nissan claims, is therefore less noisy. Engine roar was
detectable but not to the point of distraction. Ride comfort is extremely
smooth and fuel consumption is miserly for a 3-litre. (On a full tank, MB
clocked up 254km on the odometer before the fuel indicator began to nudge
the `fuel warning' level).
  Its extremely compact engine given the code VQ30DE with its all-
aluminium block is packed with performance enhancing technologies. For
this Nissan redesigned its original V6 engine that is 20 per cent lighter,
uses 10 per cent fewer parts and takes 40 per cent less time to put
together. The twin intake/exhaust valve configuration and narrow valve
angle combine to produce more powerful combustion, resulting in higher
output.
  Extensive friction-reducing technologies (molybdenum-coated pistons and
a microfinished crankshaft) and the use of lightweight engine components
contribute to excellent throttle response and fuel economy. The new engine
is in fact 29kg lighter, yet has 1000 cc more displacement. There is also
improved cooling with each engine block and cylinder head having separate
cooling, allowing for the use of small sized water pumps.
  Where the previous 2-litre Cefiro engine was a twin-cam six cylinder
producing 130 brake horsepower (bhp), this new engine winds up to 193bhp
peaking at 6,400 rpm with 26kg metres of torque at 4,000 rpm. Its power
and reliability was put to the test on the E-Racer aircraft. Shod with the
Cefiro engine, it took off and flew at a speed of 299 mph with a payload
of 800lbs.
  Translated to actual driving performance, what does it all mean? Sheer
power one must say. During the test drive down the Kuala Lumpur-Seremban
Highway towards the Kajang exit, it was a chore keeping the frisky beast
from bolting in defiance of the road traffic ordinance. Power appeared
readily on tap, an ever so gentle tap on the accelerator and the engine
purrs along uncomplainingly pushing the speedometer dial round the dial
face. It was only when the coast was clear (we shall not reveal the time
and place in deference of the law) that we dared push the new Cefiro to
its limits and tasted the engine's true potential.
  All the time one was on the road, there was a great feeling of comfort
and safety. With good reason too as the new Cefiro has been designed with
a comprehensive range of active and passive safety features, the most
distinctive of which are the four-channel Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) and
the Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) for the driver. To enhance
structural integrity and help create a safer vehicle, the new Cefiro
features extra door padding, additional ribs in the front side member,
reinforced front and side pillars and extra bracing in the door sill.
  Additionally, front side structural members are designed to crush
progressively to help minimise intrusion into the passenger cabin. All
door panels are also reinforced with internal side door beams for added
resistance to side impact. Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) seatbelts
with vertically adjustable anchors for the front seats help maximise
safety for passengers.
  The cabin interior gives the Cefiro an air of efficient functionality.
Indeed smoothly unfussy. All the key controls are within easy reach. The
central dividing panel housing the controls of the sound system and air-
conditioning is well laid out. The air-conditioning level is digitally
controlled with the occupants needing simply to key in the required
temperature level and adjusting the position of the air vents at the push
of a button.
  A twin sprung cup holder rests on the central divider forward of a deep
cushion-covered tray to stash away an assortment of knick knacks away from
prying eyes. The passenger side sun flap has a thoughtful touch - - when
pulled towards the occupant, a rectangular flap can be flicked open to
reveal a decent-sized vanity mirror with two tiny light bulbs on either
side.
  Nissan calls the new Cefiro a luxury sedan. In the ride comfort
department, this tag is well-deserved. Its rear multi-link beam suspension
takes care of all the bumps and ruts any neglected road long overdue for a
VIP visitor can offer. The rear wheels are mounted on a torsion beam to
maximise tyre grip, eliminating scuff changes and variation in vehicle
attitude when taking corners which tends to induce fatigue all round.
  In straight-line driving, the suspension minimises body sway and
maintains a steady stance for directional stability. The ride is quiet and
comfortable with little vibration and noise. When negotiating corners, the
load is optimally distributed over the four tyres to increase stability.
  There is a little idiosyncratic touch too - all the car doors lock
automatically within a few seconds of the driver side door being closed
without it being locked itself! The sound system takes some getting used
to as a number of stations appear to be transmitting programmes from some
huge cavern, complete with echo.
  One surprisingly contentious issue which surfaced when the car was first
introduced to the motoring journalism fraternity was Edaran TCM's pricing
strategy. A few seasoned campaigners who found that at RM138,000, (on-the-
road with metallic paint) they could now afford 3-litre luxury on their
pay package, insisted something was amiss. `Where's the luxury and
exclusivity if humble `ol me can afford one?' opined a highly distressed
and venerable editor of a equally venerable automobile monthly. His
colleague chipped in to support albeit with self-deprecating candour,
`It's too affordable. I'll buy it and that is sure to kill any designs of
turning the car into a really serious status symbol.'
  The last word must go to Tan. He says, `The new Cefiro is not cheap.
Just competitively priced. We received 100 bookings even before the
launch.'Specifications: Nissan Cefiro V6 3.0L Automatic

Fired by hypermarkets: Metrojaya brings style and ambience to its Cosmart
hypermarkets

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 49

LATER THIS MONTH, leading retailer Metrojaya Bhd will open the doors of
its newest venture, a 85,000 sq ft hypermarket in the Pandan Capitol
shopping mall in Pandan Indah, Kuala Lumpur. It hopes to draw not only
hordes of the 100,000 residents of the township but also shoppers from
further afield such as Ampang and Cheras.
  Metrojaya reckons that purchases at this hypermarket would add another
RM65 million annually to company coffers - a boost which the public-listed
company could do with. For the past three financial years (1994 to 1996)
group turnover has grown only marginally from RM221 million to RM238
million. The main reason, according to Lee Cheng Toh, general manager of
Metrojaya Departmental Stores, is that Metrojaya has not set up any major
departmental store (except for the smaller specialty stores) since its
last one at Menara Bakti in Petaling Jaya's Section 14 back in 1992. `In
an over-retail market, much incremental growth cannot be expected from
existing stores. It has to be fired by new big stores,' she says.
  However, with its hypermarket venture, turnover is set to perk up. After
all early birds Carrefour and Giant have demonstrated that hypermarkets -
a vast, no frills, self-service, warehouse kind of shopping environment
where the draw is cheaper prices - are making a big hit with shoppers
looking for bargains all year round.
  Now other retailers want to get into the act. Take Metrojaya, which has
traditionally positioned its departmental stores and specialty shops (with
the exception of Reject Shop) in the higher end of the market, now opting
to sprinkle its `Metro Magic' nearer the other end too. As Lee admits,
`The main core of the market is still the mass market, the below middle
income group. While Metrojaya has done exceedingly well in its mid-to-
upper market niche, we are missing out on this large segment.'
  To carve out a share of the mass market, Cosmart Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Metrojaya, was incorporated to start a chain of Cosmart
hypermarkets offering general merchandise and supermarket goods (from
foodstuffs to electrical to clothing) at very competitive rates. Besides
its maiden outlet at Pandan Indah, Cosmart will operate a second
hypermarket in the Bukit Jambul Complex up north in Penang by April 1997.
Down south, in Seremban, another Cosmart hypermarket is slated to be the
anchor tenant of a new shopping complex to be jointly developed by
subsidiaries of Metrojaya and PhileoLand Bhd. It should be operational by
the end of 1998.
  But even before this Seremban outlet, Cosmart is scouting hard for
another site within the Klang Valley or in Johor Bahru, unperturbed that
the sites might become a hot bed of competition. Says Chai Chin Cheok,
assistant general manager of Cosmart, `As a retailer, we cannot be afraid
of competition.'
  However, competition is dogging its heels. One of the country's biggest
retailers, Parkson Corporation Sdn Bhd, which reportedly raked in over RM1
billion in sales this year, will launch its first hypermarket (the Xtra
Supercentre chain) at the UE Shopping Mall in Cheras in December, right
after Metrojaya's Pandan Indah's opening. On a straight-line projection,
the two hypermarkets will be about 5 km apart. Furthermore, Parkson is
also expected to have five hypermarkets in major towns such as Johor Bahru
and Ipoh, and in Penang by the end of next year.
  Giant TMC Bhd, one of the early birds in the hypermarket scene with its
very successful Giant Cash & Carry in Subang Jaya, has announced that it
will sink in at least RM50 million to set up three more hypermarkets in
Cheras (again), Ipoh and Johor Bahru within the next three years and has
bought, or is in the process of buying, the land for the marts. Last
month, it opened its second Giant hypermarket in Ulu Klang. It is also
eyeing Penang and Kota Bahru as possible hypermarket locations in its
future expansion plans.
  Being neither the first nor the last to set up hypermarkets, what edge
has Metrojaya got over the rest of the pack?
  Ambience, for one, says Lee. `In terms of design and physical setup, we
have  tried to be more interesting, more organised, more colourful, to
have more signages so that customers will be able to locate their
purchases easily from day one, and to essentially turn the normally drab
look of hypermarkets into a more pleasing shopping ambience. For instance,
in our clothing section, we don't just have rows of blouses and rows of
skirts, but we also have coordinated displays of tops and bottoms.'
  Another is merchandising. Cosmart hypermarkets do not follow the rule of
thumb about stocking the shelves with whatever is cheap. `Metrojaya's
buying culture that quality is better than price is also being adopted in
Cosmart. Our buyers are trained not to compromise too much on quality just
for price's sake,' says Lee. `Hence, we are not out to declare that we are
the cheapest, but that we are competitively priced and we give value for
money.'
  Chai is quick to assert that this does not mean Cosmart is not striving
for low prices. `In sourcing for our goods, we cut out a lot of the
middlemen. For instance, with vegetables we go direct to the farmers.'
  Cosmart will have to cough up RM15 million in terms of set-up and
inventory costs for the Pandan Indah outlet and RM20 million each for the
Penang and Seremban hypermarkets. With an authorised and paid-up capital
of only RM3 million and RM1 million respectively (though these will be
increased to RM10 million and RM5 million), the funding will come from
parent Metrojaya. Metrojaya recently got the greenlight for a one-for-two
bonus issue and a three-for-one rights issue at RM3 a share. The rights
exercise will raise RM252 million next year, part of which will go to
finance the Cosmart operations.
  Metrojaya plans to have six Cosmart hypermarkets in the country by the
year 2000. By then Cosmart should be contributing as much as 30 per cent
to group turnover, same as Metrojaya's specialty stores, with the
remainder coming from the departmental store operations.

A new way to fly: Heli Asia is a platform for helicopter manufacturing
sub-contracting

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 53

HELICOPTER manufacturers sub-contracting parts of the aircraft in
Malaysia.
  Alexander Shephard, managing director of a UK-based aviation magazine
publisher, the Shephard Press, says this trend is already apparent in
several Asian countries such as China, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
  Shephard, who is also chairman of Shephard Conference, says for example,
there was a joint venture with a 39 per cent work share package between
China and Singapore companies in the manufacturing of the European Union's
Eurocopter 120. Besides this, the South Korean Daewoo Group is
collaborating with a Russian  company in the production of the MK-30
helicopter, while an Australian company, Hawk Pacific, is venturing into
the manufacturing of components for the McDonnell Douglas Corp's Explorer.
  Shephard says, `Of late, the American helicopter manufacturers have
become more aware that they will not be able to sell their aircrafts
without an offset programme such as in the manufacturing of components.'
He believes there is a growing demand for helicopter services among the
local companies and organisations such as in oil and gas exploration, the
police force and even an air ambulance service.
  `Just think of the hassles of going through a traffic jam. With the
availability of helicopter landing platforms in most of the high-rise
buildings in Kuala Lumpur, I do not think it impossible that more
companies will resort to using such aircrafts as a means of
transportation,' he adds. Shephard was in Kuala Lumpur for the inaugural
Heli Asia Conference and Exhibition held from Nov 5-7 at the Shangri-La
Hotel. The event, organised by Shephard Conference, was held to provide an
insight into the helicopter industry as well as business opportunities in
producing the aircraft components, and to address the civil and defence
helicopter operations within the expanding Asian market.
  Among the topics discussed at the conference were the areas of support
helicopters, naval helicopters, tactical doctrine, battlefield survival,
training, attack helicopters and operational experience. `Heli Asia is the
region's first event devoted entirely to the helicopter industry,'
Shephard says.
  The three-day conference and exhibition, covering both civil and
military rotary-wing aviation, attracted some 4,000 trade visitors. A
total of 120 exhibitors from over 26 countries participated. The United
States had the biggest representation with well-known helicopter
manufacturers like Boeing Helicopters, Sikorsky and Bell Helicopter Asia.
Other exhibitors included Eurocopter SA, Westland Helicopter, Teledyne Inc
and Turbomeca of France.
  Franco-German helicopter manufacturer, Eurocopter, a subsidiary of Aero-
spatiale of France, announced that they had sealed a deal for the purchase
of their newest lightweight helicopter, the EC135, to the Tengku Mahkota
of Pahang, Tengku Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah. Tengku Abdullah will be the
first Asian to take delivery of the EC135 when it arrives here early next
year. Launched in 1994, the EC135, the lightest in the light-twin engine
class, is a seven/eight-seater which can be utilised as an emergency
evacuation vehicle.
  Asked why the organiser chose Kuala Lumpur as the first venue for the
event, Shephard explains it is mainly due to the growing number of
helicopter users among Malaysian companies and organisations. Malaysia is
an ideal location for bringing people in. `It is a big opportunity for the
Western world to influence decision makers in Asia,' Stephenson says,
adding that it will serve as the key venue for these regions as well as
open the door to this huge and largely untapped market. Promotions on Heli
Asia were held during the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace
(Lima) '95 exhibition.
  Shephard says Heli Asia has presented opportunities for new partnerships
and joint ventures in these areas as Asia is now a source of financing for
new technology projects. `We believe Heli Asia is a success,' he says.
  Shephard confirms that Kuala Lumpur will re-host the second Heli Asia in
1998 in light of the favourable response to the inaugural event and
because of its strategic location. He adds that there is the possibility
of more static and flying demonstrations in 1998 at the Sultan Abdul Aziz
Shah International Airport in Subang when it is turned into an aviation
exhibition centre after the KL  International Airport in Sepang becomes
operational.
  `We will eventually turn the event into the largest rotary-wing
exhibition in the region in years to come,' Shephard adds.
  Malaysia Airlines chairman Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli feels that helicopters,
commonly used for military and security operations, are making their
presence felt in commercial aviation. He says helicopters are known to be
the most effective form of transport and workhorse for the offshore oil
industry, transporting medical supplies to the remote interior, search and
rescue, and in recent years, extracting timber from remote jungles.
  `Tourism will especially be boosted with more helicopter charter
operations to the many resort islands and tourist spots. That's why we
need more heliports in cities,' Tajudin says.
  During the exhibition, US helicopter giant Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation
concluded two Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Malaysian Helicopter
Services Bhd (MHS) and Airod Sdn Bhd to pave the way for the setting up of
Asia's second service centre for the S-76C helicopters after Tokyo. The
MOUs were part of the offset programme following Malaysia's order for two
US-made Sikorsky S-70A Black Hawk helicopters for VIP transport.
  Sikorsky's managing director (Malaysia) John J Carson says his company
has signed a service centre agreement to allow both parties to evaluate it
before a final decision on the matter can be reached. MHS operates six S-
76Cs and four Eurocopter Super Pumas for offshore operations. Of the Black
Hawks, Carson says both are expected to be delivered by March 1998. One
helicopter will fly with four additional fuel tanks giving it extended
range.
  The Black Hawks boast high-tech avionics, including the Honeywell
Electronic Flight Information System, and is based on the basic UH-60A
Black Hawk airframe.
  Another US giant, Boeing Helicopters, is negotiating with the Malaysian
government to sell six CH-47 Chinooks, heavy-lift helicopters, to the
RMAF. Boeing representative Jack Satterfield says the talks are in the
preliminary stages. The CH-47 Chinook is currently in service with most
air forces in the world, including Singapore and Thailand. Kawasaki Heavy
Industries assembles the Chinook under licence locally where Japan is the
largest operator of the helicopter outside the United States.

Shopping in a green world: Britain's first environmentally friendly
supermarket opens its doors

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 51

IT HAD TO come: a chain of supermarkets with an environmental conscience.
Out of This World is heralded by its originators as `a one-stop shopping
ethical experience that enables people to shop in the high street and
invest in a better world at the same time'.
  `Rather than the customer having to go to several outlets in search of
environmentally friendly products, we provide everything under the same
roof,' says Andy Houghton, manager of the branch in Bristol, west of
England.
  `It has been estimated that around five per cent of the population are
ethically aware but only one per cent actually do anything about it,' he
adds. Houghton's branch is the second to open out of a chain of 200 shops
planned.
  Described by a leading newspaper as `the most radical experiment in
British retailing for 1ystem centuries', Out of This World is the brainchild
of Richard Adams, someone with impeccable credentials for starting such a
venture.
  In 1972, Adams set up an agricultural imports company, working with
horticultural groups in developing countries that lead to the founding of
Teacraft, the craft-marketing arm of the major UK relief and development
charity, the TEAR fund.
  Furthermore, in 1979, Adams established the independent company,
Traidcraft, that become a public company in 1984 offering the first
`alternative' public share issue in the United Kingdom. Todate, Traidcraft
has marketed over STG30 million of craft, food and clothing products from
the Third World, and its linked charity, Traidcraft Exchange, has engaged
in large-scale community business development projects in several
developing countries.
  `For 25 years I've been involved in many organisations which help people
to shop or invest for a better world. Out of This World is doing just
that, right on the local high street,' says Adams.
  Out of This World is the official trading name for the Creative Consumer
Cooperative. Anyone can join. Membership costs STG5 for life,
automatically making customers into shareholders who, consequently, can be
extremely influential on all aspects of the shops.
  Shareholders become eligible for in-store promotions and they receive
regular updates on the progress of the society and eventually a dividend
on purchases. As Adams says, `This is a business with a difference - owned
and run by a community of people seeking to increase their commitment to a
more sustainable lifestyle and a safer world.'
  It would be hard to imagine a more environmentally correct chain of
shops than Out of This World. The whole nature of the shops is as `green'
as could be: the coolants in the freezer cabinets have been replaced by
the non-hazardous refrigerant, CARE 50, that neither depletes the ozone
layer nor contributes to global warming.
  The counter tops are made out of recycled plastic bottles and the
shelving is processed from pine thinnings from managed plantations. It
almost goes without saying that the paints, finishes and stains are all
solvent-free and that the labelling and promotions use recycled card and
board.
  Bristol manager Houghton adds, `We cover the globe. We have about 80
suppliers who source hundreds of products from Asia, Africa, South America
and countries across the developing world.'
  A long-term aim is to have computer data instantly available on every
product, specifying its `green' credentials and its provenance. At the
moment, only 10 per cent of the stock is on the system. But as Houghton
declares, `We're got to be transparent. It is crucial we justify
everything we do and stock.'
  There is a strong emphasis on organic produce including vegetables,
dairy products, herbs, spices, cereals, wines, beer, bread, fruit and
meat. The choice of products is extremely wide, and apart from the
predictable pulses, there are Indian, Mexican, Japanese and kosher
foodstuffs as well as numerous types of oils, including walnut, almond,
grapeseed, sesame, olive and hazelnut.
  The honey section is equally extensive, including clear types from Chile
and delicious Tabora honey from Tanzania produced by a bee-keepers'
cooperative. Everything on sale has been screened for additives - even the
tomato ketchup.
  An attractive aspect of the stores is that in addition to the main
stock, each shop will also have a selection of products and crafts sourced
locally. For instance, the Bristol branch sells handicraft baskets made
from willows grown in the Somerset levels. `We buy locally whenever we
can,' says Houghton.
  This admirable policy saves Out of This World from being another chain
of identical-looking shops and gives each store a regional character all
of its own. Also available are books, including cookery, yoga and
children's titles, cosmetics and aromatherapy items and clothes made of
cotton.
  New customers are often cautious. `Yes, it can look a bit exotic,'
admits Houghton. `But there are plenty of satisfied customers who say
things like, "I haven't tasted bacon like this since I was a child".' -

Getting a grip: The proposed listing of Multi-Purpose Capital Holdings may
just give the

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 6

MYRIAD AND multifarious. That perhaps best describes the sprawling
Kamunting-Multi-Purpose Group today - the growing empire of tycoon Datuk
Lim Thian Kiat.
  At age 36, the reclusive tycoon controls at least six listed companies -
Kamunting Corporation Bhd, Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd (MPHB), Magnum
Corporation Bhd, Bandar Raya Developments Bhd, Leisure Management Bhd and
Malaysian Plantations Bhd. Most of them seem to be interlinked via
complicated crossholdings. Lim also holds the second largest stake in
Sarawak Enterprise Corporation Bhd (formerly Dunlop Estates Bhd).
  The sheer number of listed companies in his stable means that Lim has
his fingers in a great many pies. For example, gaming is carried out via
Magnum and Leisure Management, finance and banking via Multi-Purpose
Holdings, property development via Bandar Raya Developments, stockbroking
via Malaysian Plantations which owns JB Securities, and toll collection
via Kamunting Corporation Bhd which holds the Jalan Kuching toll
concession. He is also involved in electricity via Sarawak Enterprise
Corporation.
  Although the last couple of years may have been relatively quiet for the
Kamunting-MPHB Group, the board has nevertheless kept busy. Significant
events include the acquisition of stockbroker JB Securities, relinguishing
control of Dunlop Estates (now Sarawak Enterprise Corporation), the
completion of its multi-million ringgit headquarters in Kuala Lumpur and
the controversy which erupted over its Kepong toll concession. There has
also been the much talked about proposed listing of Multi-Purpose Capital
Holdings Bhd (M Capital). MPHB minority shareholders are hoping for a
windfall in the form of a restricted offer for sale.
  Unfortunately, with MPHB being involved in such a complex and diverse
web of activities, it causes difficulties for analysts and investors alike
to get a grip on the Lim colossus.
  Says an analyst, `We don't follow MPHB because it's too complex. And we
don't know his direction. Investors and shareholders like to know what is
in store.' The tycoon's low profile is of no help either.
  This is particularly true of Lim's flagship company, MPHB. Currently,
very few analysts track the counter, citing complexity and opacity.
However, an analyst from a major retail stockbroking house says it's
probably about time to start studying the counter, `Maybe in a month's
time.' The relatively stagnant share price is also a deterrent. MPHB has
been drifting in the region of between RM3.30 and RM4.30 the past year.
Says a stockbroker tongue-in-cheek, `That's because it's a main board
company.'
  But it cannot be denied that MPHB is one of the heavyweights of the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). As at Nov 2, its market capitalisation
was RM3.214 billion, ranking it at number 41. Even heavier was Magnum at
RM6.555 billion, placing it at 16th place.
  The torpor in the trading of MPHB shares can also be attributed to the
lack of fresh major corporate developments. Says an analyst, `There's only
one million-dollar question at MPHB - when will M Capital be listed?' M
Capital is the holding company for the group's commercial banking arm,
Multi-Purpose Bank Bhd (formerly known as Malaysian-French Bank Bhd).
  M Capital holds 70 per cent in the bank while the remainder is held by
Banque Indosuez of Paris. The group's finance company, Multi-Purpose
Finance Bhd, its general insurance company Multi-Purpose Insurance Bhd,
and Multi-Purpose Credit Holdings Sdn Bhd all also come under the umbrella
of M Capital.
  But there has been some speculation that Multi-Purpose Bank itself may
be listed separately. However, MPHB executive director Khaw Chay Tee
dismisses such talk. `There are currently no firm plans to list Multi-
Purpose Bank. The management is concentrating its efforts on achieving
Tier-1 Status for the bank under the two-tier regulatory system, as soon
as possible.'
  Even so, some analysts speculate that Lim is still desirous of floating
his financial arm. If this is so, then he is probably undaunted by the
fact that the proposed listing of M Capital had already been turned down
once before. In 1994, the proposed flotation of M Capital was thrown out
by the Securities Commission.
  The reason? Non-compliance with the chain-listing requirements. The
rules state that the subsidiary to be listed must not contribute to more
than 35 per cent of its parent's pre-tax profit. Also, the proposed
listing could have hit another snag - Magnum Corp and Leisure Management,
both of whom are gaming-based, hold shares in Multi-Purpose Finance.
  Now, though, it's a different story. The group undertook a restructuring
exercise which delineated its activities into clear-cut areas like finance
and gaming. With the restructuring, analysts estimate that M Capital
contributes about 25 per cent to MPHB's group profits. Thus, the chain-
listing issue does not arise anymore.
  The gaming-finance conflict has also been resolved by putting Magnum and
M Capital at arms' length. Recently, MPHB made a voluntary general offer
for all the shares in subsidiary M Capital that it does not own. This will
relieve Magnum of its stake in M Capital and enable the former to comply
with a Bank Negara directive to divest its entire interests in Multi-
Purpose Finance.
  MPHB currently holds 168 million shares, or 76.36 per cent, in M
Capital. The rest belongs to Magnum, Leisure Management and Kamunting. The
offer price for the shares would be RM2.60 per share, thus involving a
total cash payout of RM135.2 million.
  Whether this price consideration for the minority shareholders of
Magnum, Leisure Management and Kamunting truly reflects the fair value of
M Capital cannot be ascertained. Says a research head, `With the recent
reorganisation of the group, M Capital's likelihood of getting listed is
bright.'
  Indeed, market rumours continue to be rife as to which second board
counter will be the target of a reverse takeover by M Capital. Even Red-
Box was at one time the hot favourite. But Khaw dispels the reverse
takeover talk (see sidebar).
  But the fact remains that Multi-Purpose Bank is the jewel in M Capital.
The bank had shareholders' funds of RM315.5 million in 1995. It needs to
increase this to RM500 million to make it to Tier-1. At end-1995, its
total assets stood at RM8.5 billion, total deposits at RM3.9 billion and
total loans at RM3.2 billion.
  With the reengineering, there was also a clearer direction for the MPHB
Group. However, most analysts are still vague about what that is. Asks
one, `Do they have a focus?'
  Explains Khaw, `Since 1991, the MPHB Group has had three core
businesses, namely financial services, property and gaming. The group was
therefore in a position, at the end of 1995, to take on the challenge of
an additional core business in the form of electricity generation,
transmission and distribution through Sarawak Enterprise.'
  For the year ended Dec 31, 1995, MPHB achieved a pre-tax profit of
RM525.85 million, a 17 per cent increase over the previous year's profit
of RM449.87 million. Turnover increased from RM2.6 billion to RM2.87
billion. Of this amount, the banking and financial services division
chalked up profits of RM116.7 million. The property division recorded
profits of RM150.31 million while the gaming division proved to be the
cash cow with profits of RM384.04 million.
  However, profits and turnover are expected to take a drastic dive in
FY1996 because of the transformation of former subsidiaries, Sarawak
Enterprise Corporation and Magnum Corporation, into associate companies
via the restructuring exercise.
  At end-1994, MPHB had three listed subsidiaries - 51.04 per cent of
Magnum, 51 per cent of Sarawak Enterprise and 36.9 per cent of Bandar
Raya. But the stakes in Sarawak Enterprise and Magnum have since been
trimmed to less than 30 per cent.
  For the half-year ended June 30, 1996, MPHB's profit dropped by 31 per
cent to RM157.84 million from RM227.43 million the previous corresponding
period. The lower profit was recorded on the back of a much-reduced group
turnover of RM415.882 million against RM1.305 billion in the first half of
1995.
  Apart from lower contributions from Magnum and Sarawak Enterprise,
analysts expect MPHB to suffer a massive hit of about RM47 million in
interest charges on its RM600 million revolving credit facility. Announced
in January 1996, this loan is to finance its purchase of 262.86 million
Magnum shares on the basis of nine Magnum shares for every 10 Dunlop (now
Sarawak Enterprise) shares held as at Dec 27, 1995. It is believed this
exercise will demarcate Magnum and Sarawak Enterprise into wholly separate
entities with MPHB as the holding company.
  However, analysts say the high interest charges will be dissipated with
the proposed rights issue of a five-year, three per cent irredeemable
convertible unsecured loan stocks (ICULs) on the basis of one ICUL for one
share. There will also be a special Bumiputera issue of 15.022 million
shares at RM3.80 each.
  Taking into account the new Bumiputera issue and the full conversion of
warrants and employee share options, MPHB's paid-up capital would balloon
from an estimated RM751.1 million to over RM1 billion. However, the
dilution in earnings per share, given the inflated share capital, should
be neutralised by contributions from new associate Sarawak Enterprise.
  Reckons an analyst, `The diversification into electricity generation
will power earnings in the medium term. Its investment in Sarawak
Enterprise will enable the group to become a power generator and
distributor in Sarawak.'
  For the year ending Dec 31, 1996, analysts forecast a pre-tax profit of
RM350 million on a turnover of RM943.3 million, a sharp drop compared with
1995's profits of RM525.85 million and turnover of RM2.87 billion.
  This would put FY1996 net earnings per share (EPS) at 21.1 sen. Given a
current market price of around RM4.40, the shares are trading at
prospective price earnings (PE) multiple of 21 times.
  For FY1997, analysts estimate improved pre-tax profits of RM420 million
on a turnover base of RM1.132 billion. Based on a net EPS of 25.4 sen, the
shares will trade at a prospective PE multiple of 17.3 times.

Editorial: Heed Auditor-General's report

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 1

IF THE Auditor-General feels frustrated at times, he has good reason to.
Every year, he highlights irregular accounting practices, mismanagement of
funds and dereliction of duty in state agencies. And every year these
agencies continue to ignore his advice and recommendations.
  But each time the Auditor-General's report is released, there is the
usual excitement and publicity in the media followed by comments from
various quarters. Initially, there will a chorus call to rectify the
situation. But after sometime, the excitement fizzles out.
  Take the example of Penang's state secretariat which failed to submit
records on revenue for 18 out of 42 housing schemes. `This failure has
been highlighted several times in the past, but to date, it has not been
rectified,' laments Datuk Mohd Khalil Mohd Noor in his 1994 report.
  We can understand his frustration. But the nagging question remains -
why are some government servants, politicians included, so defiant?
  Is it a case of a shortage of staff, plain ignorance or simply, a
lackadaisical attitude?
  Widespread discrepancies in the accounts of government agencies are not
something to be taken lightly. It can give rise to all kinds of
allegations, including corrupt practices. Menteri besars and chief
ministers should ensure that all government agencies attempt to put things
right as soon as possible.
  Earlier this month, it was announced that a government committee will be
established to see if action needs to be taken against two states for
irregular accounting practices. It is a laudable move.
  But more needs to be done. For a start, every state should set up a
special panel to address shortcomings highlighted in the Auditor-General's
report.
  Each of these panels should be compelled to give a detailed report to
the finance minister as to what course of action has been taken to address
the discrepancies. Disciplinary action should be taken against states
which remain defiant.
  Civil servants are entrusted with public funds. That trust must not be
betrayed. It boils down to a question of accountability to the rakyat.
After all, is it not the taxpayers who pay their salaries and bonuses?

Expanding horizons: With Samsung Malaysia's expansion programme in its
Seremban complex in i

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 18

WHEN making glass, pure sand is a prerequisite. Says Samsung Malaysia
president and managing director Kim Jin Ki, `We used to use Australian
sand to make glass (monitors and funnels at Samsung Corning Malaysia Sdn
Bhd). Now we use Johor sand, which is cheaper to transport.'
  Of course, using Johor sand as a core ingredient is not merely a means
to trim costs. The gesture can also be interpreted as a measure of Samsung
Malaysia's commitment towards localising operations. Says Kim, `Our local
component ratio, including the sand, is 81 per cent. Some components are
still made in Korea.'
  Nevertheless, Samsung Malaysia's search for local component
manufacturers is still going strong. Says Kim, `Our target next year is to
have between 81-85 per cent local content.'
  Samsung Malaysia's desire for local content is not confined to
production alone. The workforce is also being Malaysianised. Currently,
this Korean chaebol employs more than 7,500 staff in its ten Malaysian
companies (refer to table and pie chart). Departments are now mostly
headed by Malaysians with the aim of employing locals for top positions.
There are about a hundred Korean expatriates, including Kim himself.
  Says Kim, `Our target is to bring this down to 50 or 60 Koreans in two
or three years, or fewer than one per cent Korean.' Technicians and
engineers are continually sent to Samsung facilities in Korea for
training. From 1991 to 1996, 782 employees were sent to Korea for six
months' training, says Kim.
  Despite Samsung Malaysia's attempts to promote localisation, a wholly-
Malaysian workforce is not an attainable goal if locals simply don't want
to join them. Given the country's zero unemployment situation, it's very
hard to find workers, says Kim. To fill vacancies, Samsung Malaysia has
resorted to hiring foreigners. Says Kim, `They get the same pay as locals.
Actually, we pay them more because we cover their transportation and
lodging costs.' (Refer to boxed story.) Right now, there are 900
Indonesians working at Samsung, `with the permission of the state
government'.
  If localisation is a priority in Samsung Malaysia's manufacturing
activities, the reverse is true of the company's sales. Like other
multinationals, Samsung Malaysia's markets span the globe. Says Kim, `Of
the manufacturing activities, 99.5 per cent of the products manufactured
in the four factories are exported.'
  Penetrating international markets is necessary for Samsung Malaysia,
since it is impossible for the local market to provide much depth. For
instance, Samsung Malaysia expects 1996 total sales from three of its four
factories - Samsung Electron Devices (M) Sdn Bhd, Samsung Corning (M) Sdn
Bhd and Samsung Electronics Display (M) Sdn Bhd, which are housed at the
Samsung Electronics Seremban Complex - to touch RM2.3 billion. The very
next year, sales are projected at RM3.3 billion, or a walloping 50 per
cent jump. Currently, picture tubes make up 50 per cent of sales while
monitors contribute another 30-35 per cent.
  Such massive growth is due to Samsung Malaysia's expansion programme at
the Seremban Complex. Says Kim, `We are now in the final stage of the
expansion programme, so we will have more capacity next year. This year,
we produced seven million picture tubes. Next year, it will be 11
million.' Likewise, Samsung Malaysia is increasing the production of its
14-inch and 15-inch monitors. Currently, it produces 20 million electron
guns, of which 99 per cent are exported.
  A substantial percentage of Samsung Malaysia's output ends up in other
companies' products. For example, a Samsung Malaysia electron gun might be
incorporated in rival brands' TV sets.
  Says Kim, `We have around 20 per cent of the picture tube market. In
most TVs, one out of five picture tubes are supplied by Samsung. Many
Japanese companies in Malaysia and Singapore are using our picture tubes.'
The story is similar in the personal computer industry where PC makers are
likely to use Samsung monitors.
  Says Kim, `Our main clients for monitors are American buyers. Legally we
cannot reveal who is buying our products but they're private brands. The
top PC makers are using Samsung monitors; all the top, from number one to
number 10. Almost all PC makers take our monitors and we have more than 25
per cent of the market share.'
  Since monitors make up a huge chunk of Samsung Malaysia's sales, will
the American inventory overhang in personal computers and the projected
slowdown in the American demand for PCs affect the 1997 sales projection
of RM3.3 billion? No, says Kim, adding, `There won't be much impact.
Samsung monitors are rated the highest in the world. Quality-wise, cost-
wise, we are very competitive, and we have a very good location.'
  The `location' is the Seremban Complex, which encompasses 52 hectares on
the outskirts of Seremban, in the burgeoning township of Taman Tuanku
Jaafar. Says Kim, `So far, Samsung Malaysia has invested almost RM2
billion in this complex.
  But Samsung's investment won't halt here. More money will be pumped into
the Seremban Complex in future, says Kim. For instance, an internal
broadcasting system is being set up at the complex. `This is the first of
its kind in Malaysia and the first system to be implemented in Samsung
outside of Korea,' says Kim.
  Costing US$ 2 million (RM5 million), the broadcasting system will serve
as an inhouse communications tool as well as an avenue for entertainment.
Broadcasts will cover company policies, education and training, safety
procedures, production status reports, notices and documentary programmes
like National Geographic. About 175 TV monitors will be set up around the
Seremban Complex. Again, there's a localisation factor. Says Kim, `The
broadcasting system will be run by local Samsung employees currently
undergoing training in Korea.'SAMSUNG COMPANIES IN MALAYSIA: ESTIMATED TURNOVER (1996)

The uptrend remains intact: The Composite Index gets a boost from Tenaga

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 73

THE KUALA LUMPUR Stock Exchange's Composite Index peaked at 1,180.79
points on Budget day on Oct 25. There was nothing negative about the
Budget except that there was no reduction in corporate tax. The longer
term impact is positive as it liberalises the market by widening the scope
of financial services that stockbroking firms can offer. So the sell-off
after the Budget was due to the usual market phenomenon of `sell on fact'
as profit taking quickly moved in, causing the KLSE CI to drift to a low
1,156.92.
  But the KLSE CI refused to dip any lower than 1,156.92. Suddenly it
rebounded vibrantly upwards, retesting the 1,180 resistance. It was Tenaga
Nasional Bhd that came to the rescue. There was a re-rating on Tenaga. Its
share price took a sharp upturn from a low RM8.55 to close at RM11 on Nov
6. As Tenaga constitutes some nine per cent of the market, the KLSE CI
could be said to have been driven by the counter.
  It appears that the near term performance of the Malaysian stockmarket
is not affected by the US presidential election on Nov 5. There were some
market talks that our market might drift downwards after the US election.
As at Nov 6 the KLSE CI just ignored the US election as it continued to
nudge higher, retesting 1,180. The underlying strength of the KLSE CI is
due to Tenaga. Technically, Tenaga could go as high as RM11.70. Roughly, a
10 sen move in Tenaga translates to one index point on the KLSE CI. Tenaga
at RM11 will contribute another seven index points if the upside target of
RM11.70 materialises.
  Technically, the longer term uptrend remains intact as long as the
support at 1,158 is not breached. But the near-term outlook points to a
possible technical pullback to around the 1,160 area before resuming its
upward push to 1,194. The KLSE CI should maintain its current uptrend for
the rest of 1996. The first quarter of 1997 may be technically negative
for the market.
  On the weekly equivolume chart the CI is exhibiting signs of profit
taking. The equivolume chart combines volume with price to create an
equivolume box. The height of the box is the price range and the width,
the volume. The theory holds that the price  range should expand as volume
increases, whilst failure to expand on high volume is a sign of profit
taking.
  A squarish box appeared on the Budget week high of 1,180.79. One would
expect the price range to expand as the market drifted higher. Instead the
price range narrowed, suggesting some selling pressure. The following
week, the market drifted lower to 1,156.92 but closed at a high. The price
range was longer suggesting that buyers were willing to chase the market
upwards or, simply stated, the market was facilitating trades with the
buyers. This longer price range from the low of 1,156.92 also suggests
strong buying support, and technically the support at 1,158 makes some
sense as it is within this area.
  In summary the CI is expected to be riding on the current uptrend
towards the end of 1996 as long as the 1,158 support remains intact. If it
breaks the 1,194 resistance, then the next target will be 1,213. An upkick
above 1,213 will move the market to 1,248.

Landbank edge: With a landbank worth RM1 billion, Johor Land Bhd will be
busy in south

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 29

NEXT TIME a new township sprouts up in south Johor, chances are that Johor
Land Berhad (JLB) has had a hand in building it. Besides developing low-
and medium-cost housing (RM80,000 to RM100,000 range) in south Johor's
satellite towns such as Tampoi, Tebrau, Larkin and Senai, the property
development arm of Johor Corporation (JCorp) is snapping up more land
outside Johor Baru and building fast.
  The nation-wide demand for houses will certainly keep JLB busy for a
long time. Says JLB managing director A F M (Abul Fareed Mohd) Shafiqul
Hafiz, `Malaysia has not met 50 to 60 per cent of its housing needs,
compared to almost 95 per cent in Singapore. There is a huge gap. Even in
bad times, you need to eat, you need a roof to live under'.
  JLB, Shafiqul says, builds and sells houses at what he terms `efficient
price' (lower price achieved through savings in labour and material
costs). Having completed 17,000 residential and commercial units worth
RM629 million, JLB has plans for more. They include bungalows and terrace
houses, properties that are not really cheap but demand for which is
outstripping supply. Shafiqul says `JLB isn't building only luxury homes,
but quality ones.'
  Over the next five years, the JLB Group (comprising three wholly-owned
subsidiaries and an associate company) will build over 7,000 units worth
RM600 million. The units range from commercial property, low/medium cost
flats to terrace houses and bungalows.
  JLB's strength is its almost unlimited access to land in south Johor,
one of the most economically vibrant regions in the country. Being part of
the Singapore-Johor-Riau-Indonesia growth triangle, the region draws a lot
of foreign investments.
  Considering JCorp's large holdings - about 80,000 hectares in south
Johor and Pahang - none of the developers in Johor can match JLB's
landbank. Bandaraya Developments Bhd, United Malayan Land Bhd and Kuok
Brothers Sdn Bhd come close but they are still not in the same league as
JLB.
  With a landbank worth over RM1 billion, excluding the recently acquired
Ulu Tiram land, JLB has plenty to work on. Prime among its recent
acquisitions is Ulu Tiram's 1,323 acres of oil palm land purchased from
Kulim Bhd.
  Despite such massive building activity in south Johor, analysts see
little possibility of a glut. Though rental rates and condominium prices
are on the downside, Johor Baru's real estate agents say that landed
property, particularly those stretching from Senai airport to the Pasir
Gudang industrial area commands a strong market. For example, a one-acre
bungalow in Advanced Development Sdn Bhd's Green Plains project in Ulu
Tiram which was selling at about RM400,000 each is now worth RM1 million,
says a broker.
  According to an analyst based in Kuala Lumpur, prices are picking up in
Johor Baru. `The recent credit restriction in Singapore which put a
squeeze on property speculation in the island may have attributed to some
of that. And there is improved accessibility - even before the second link
(in Gelang Patah) is completed they are proposing a third link at Pasir
Gudang,' he says.
  JLB has also planned several residential projects in Muar, Batu Pahat
and Malacca. Its target are new home owners, those upgrading their homes
(for example, from single-storey terrace to double-storey or bungalow) and
investors.
  Singaporean investors are keen to buy property in Malaysia despite the
RM100,000 levy for foreigners. According to news reports, a terrace house
costs as much as S$1.7 million (RM3.1 million) in Singapore, about 10
times more expensive than a terrace house in Petaling Jaya's Bandar Utama.
In addition, the recent capital gains revision in Singapore in May makes
Johor's property market much more attractive.
  Local demand for land is not lacking either as Johor is Malaysia's
fastest growing area outside the Klang Valley and Penang. The analyst
predicts more local demand because the income level in Johor is four to
five times higher than the national average. Johor Baru's population is
also forecast to grow from the present 500,000 to 700,000 by the year
2010. Johor's neighbour Malacca is also in need of more houses.
  JLB will get a further boost with its proposed listing on the main board
of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange by the end of this year. Proceeds will
be used to finance the purchase of property developer Advanced Development
Sdn Bhd from JCorp member Kulim Bhd, thus bringing the property companies
under one roof. Plantation-based Kulim Bhd owns 6,000 acres in Ulu Tiram
and now holds a 68 per cent stake in JLB. After the proposed listing,
Kulim Bhd's stake in JLB will be reduced to 51 per cent.
  Shafiqul sees scope for improvement in the property sector. He says,
`The local industry is nowhere near those you see overseas. I would like
to see more labour saved, for one.'
  In its efforts to reduce labour cost, JLB uses pre-cast concrete
supplied by its plants in Tampoi and Pasir Gudang. It also uses pre-cast
wall panelling in its buildings instead of bricks. The lighter concrete
blocks require only one worker to handle them instead of several men
needed in the conventional method.
  JLB's wholly-owned subsidiary Johor Land Manufacturing Sdn Bhd makes
about 30,000 pieces of metal door frames a year. Compared with
conventional wooden ones, metal door frames are handier and cheaper by
about 20 to 25 per cent. `They save costs and conserve timber,' says
Shafiqul.
  Another subsidiary, Pembinaan Prefabricated Sdn Bhd (PPSB), makes clay
tiles which are more durable than concrete tiles and are developers'
preferred roofing material.
  All these are a far cry from the early 70s when JCorp built wooden
quarters for army personnel in Johor Baru. The wooden houses are still in
pretty good shape today. The secret of the company's success? Shafiqul
says, `We have more buffer compared to other developers.' That buffer may
well see Johor Land beyond another 20 years.

In the corporate lane: Datuk Lee Kim Sai says he now lives a healthier and
more peaceful

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 34

SHOULD ANYONE marvel at the ease with which former Health Minister Datuk
Lee Kim Sai made the transition from politics to that of corporate
citizen, just turn the clock back to pre-independence Malaya of the 1950s.
  It's still early dawn and Kuala Lumpur's main market (now an upmarket
bazaar called Central Market) is a hive of activity. Amongst brazen
butchers and fiesty fishmongers trading  curses, a bleary-eyed 10-year-old
schoolboy carefully picks up the day's fresh produce for the family's
wholesale business. That done, he heads for the yeow char koey (deep fried
crullers - a popular breakfast staple among the Chinese) stand. He takes
on a whole basketfull which he will sell off to foodstall operators all
over Jinjang - the neighbourhood where he grew up - but this time for
personal profit.
  This pre-pubescent dabbling in business, while taking much effort and
energy, did not interfere with the boy's education. The young Lee
performed well at school and contributed towards the family finances with
his earnings. A teaching career in adulthood, followed by 30 years
dedicated to politics resulted in the business world being put on the
backburner. So when he decided not to defend his position as MCA deputy
president (a post he held since 1985) in the party's 1996 elections and
therefore gave up the cut and thrust of political life, where would he
head for next but business?
  Lee did not leave things to providence when he said goodbye to
politics.`I planned to retire when I did. I am not one to overstay my
welcome,' he says. So within two weeks of leaving politics, Lee began
corporate life when he walked into the chairman's lair of Uniwide
Corporation Sdn Bhd. Easy enough, as the company was set up by his eldest
son, Ronnie. `He had this office done up in time so that the moment I left
politics, I could walk in to my new job,' says Lee.
  Ronnie's Uniwide Corporation has interests in tower cranes and heavy
machinery. Lee also sits on the board of what he jokingly calls two-
ringgit companies. But one which certainly does not come under this
category is KLSE-listed Metro Kajang Holdings Bhd (Metro Kajang). `They
have been good to me' says Lee.
  A source of great satisfaction for Lee was that he became Metro Kajang's
chairman prior to its listing. He is especially pleased that the listing
was carried out successfully. The offer was natural as the company had
extensive property development projects in Kajang in the Hulu Langat
constituency of which he was once its member of parliament. He religiously
follows the stock price movement of this main board counter on the
Beriteks screen of the 18-inch colour television placed strategically in
his office.
  His position as chairman means he now owns equity in the company. On the
morning of the interview, Metro Kajang shares were trading at RM6.40 each.
Within the next 48 hours they rocketed past RM7.00. When asked what his
shares of Metro Kajang was worth now, Lee flashes a brilliant smile and
says, `They have been good to me.'
  Indeed, by giving up politics, Lee's personal fortunes have changed for
the better. He remembers how as minister, he was offered a bungalow lot in
one property development project near the city but he had to turn it down
because he could not afford its then prevailing market price. He says,
`Menteri tak ada duit (a minister has no money). His role is to serve the
rakyat. It's a sacrifice.'
  Does he feel being used at all, that his services are as much needed now
as they were when he was a member of parliament and a minister, with
handsome financial rewards to boot? Lee says his worth to the companies he
is involved in is based on his intimate knowledge of the ways of the
government. `The experience gained in the various ministries is invaluable
in that I know intimately the procedures involved in property development,
for instance. The knowledge, when applied properly, is a potent advantage
in business,' he says.
  What is it about the business world that he likes? `It's the certainty,
the delivery of something tangible and the subsequent quantifiable reward
for a job well done,' Lee says. Not that he did not enjoy his long sojourn
in politics. `If one enters politics wholly for altruistic reasons, then
one must accept all that political rough and tumble, the ups and downs.
For me, I enjoyed my time in politics. The work was hard but I derived a
great deal of satisfaction from being able to do a service to the nation,'
he says.
  There is an air of peace of mind and tranquility about Lee that is
translated into an excellent state of health. Standing at 5ft 9in tall and
weighing in at a healthy 150lbs, Lee cuts a dashing figure in a dark blue
suit and smooth silk tie. The secret of his health? `I am now able to
sleep right. I dream pleasant dreams. It's all so very relaxing,' he says.
Back in those political days, Lee's sleeping habits were dictated by party
meetings. Some dragged on interminably and there was many a night when he
would crawl into bed only in the wee hours of the morning.
  Then there were other people's problems for him to attend to. When he
was MP for Hulu Langat, he would be on edge every time it rained as his
consituency was flood prone. `There was a constant stream of people
knocking on my door with all manner of complaints. As their MP, I was the
obvious conduit. MPs of course should not complain as that is part of our
job specifications,' he says with the obvious clarity of one who is no
longer encumbered with such burden.
  Lee also believes in eating right. He takes heed of the advice of an old
Chinese sage who said one should eat but only up to the point of becoming
almost sated. `I only eat up to 70 per cent of capacity. I have also cut
down on sugar and salt in my diet. As a result, I feel better. I think I
look better too,' he says with an impish grin.
  If there is one thing that can drive Lee to the greatest heights of
passion,  it has to be golf. The merest mention of the `g' word during the
interview was all the cue needed to set the 16-handicapper off. `My
handicap suffered when I was in politics. One could not be seen spending
too much time on the links when there are other important party and
constituency matters to be addressed. As minister, the workload only
increased,' he says.
  Of his own prowess at the game, Lee believes he is improving. His drive
off the tee may not fly as powerfully as it used to but what he lacks for
brute strength is more than made up by accuracy. A golfing colleague
admires Lee's ability to split the fairway consistently, setting himself
up for a relatively easy second shot to reach the green with his trusty
six iron. His short game has improved and two putts into the pin for par
are often a mere formality.
  Being in business allows Lee to spend even more time on the golf course.
He sits on the board of Rawang Lakes Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Asia Pacific
Land Bhd (AP Land), as chairman. This was at the invitation of AP Land
chairman Tan Sri Low Yow Chuan, also an avid golfer. The pair would often
team up in a four-ball round of golf at the drop of a hat. `On the course
we never talk business. We are serious golfers. But back at the 19th, we
relax, gossip, talk shop and discuss aspects of our work.'
  Lim, above all, is an educationist at heart. With a Chinese education,
he felt he would be handicapped in politics without a facility for English
and Bahasa Malaysia. So he took on extra classes to equip himself in these
two languages. He was highly regarded in the Chinese community for this
fluency in what was then regarded as `foreign' tongues. A former pupil, Dr
Law Heng Neng, now the general manager of Nanyang Siang Pau, remembers an
incident at school.
  `Our female Bahasa Malaysia teacher was having a tough time trying to
explain a particularly abstract concept to our class one day. She tried to
explain what mesyuwarah (consensus) meant to us 15-year-olds without much
success.
  `Nearing the end of her tether, she marched out of the class and headed
for the staffroom. She returned with Lee in tow. Without much effort, Lee
came up with a one-word translation in Mandarin and everyone broke into an
applause,' he says. To this day, Lee firmly believes in the power of
education as a tool for anyone to rise above their station.
  Lee has indeed had an illustrious political career. In government he has
held three Cabinet posts. He became labour minister in 1986, housing and
local government minster three years later and health minister in 1990.
  He has never lost in  general elections stretching back to the first
time he contested the Rawang state seat in 1974. In 1993, Lee made the
announcement that he would not defend his Hulu Langat parliamentary seat
in the 1995 elections. His political fate was earlier sealed when he led
the group which mounted a challenge against Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik
for the party presidency in 1990. Lee pulled out at the 11th hour but
continued to be at loggerheads with Ling.
  Lee's place in the annals of MCA politics is assured. That even those
who once crossed swords with him refuse to condemn him in public at least
is a measure of how much Lee's contribution towards building the party
means to them and the community at large. He may have made the inevitable
enemy or two throughout his political career and the grudge they harbour
may well remain festering.
  `But I don't let that worry me. I can look back at my career with a
clear conscience. I am happy,' says Lee with sanguine finality.
 

Pix: Lee: I can look back at my career with a clear conscience.

Pix: Lee: I planned to retire when I did. I am not one to overstay my
welcome.

A marriage of convenience: A rattan furniture company successfully marries
form and function to giv

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 33

POH MAY Holdings Bhd first exported rattan furniture in the midst of a
recession. `Collection and sales were poor. I hadn't reached a critical
stage yet but I was looking for markets,' recalls managing director
Geoffrey Lee. `But exports was a different game. We knocked on doors, went
from embassy to embassy, taking product shots and filling out formal
applications for our products. It was very hard.'
  As it turned out, the pay-offs were handsome. Today, 80 per cent of the
Penang-based group's furniture are exported to England, Ireland, the
United States and Europe. In these markets, rattan is upmarket, trendy and
very popular. Nearly 60 per cent of Poh May's furniture is rattan-based.
  While small in comparison with the likes of Federal Furniture, Land and
General and other listed timber-based furniture makers, business for Poh
May has snowballed in recent times. From five workers during the mid-80s,
Poh May's six subsidiary companies today employ a total of 800 in two main
factories and six showrooms.
  The two factories are at Parit Buntar, Perak and Klang. More showrooms
are in the pipeline. Lee says, `We emphasize innovation and design rather
than the traditional furniture. It's more interesting.'
  To expand and compete internationally, Poh May is seeking a listing on
the second board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Poh May's
listing involves a new issue of 4.51 million shares at RM2.90 each. Of
this, 3.27 million shares will be for the Malaysian public. The remaining
1.24 million shares will be reserved for subscription by approved
Bumiputera investors. Says Lee,`If everything goes well, we should list by
early next year.'
  Poh May forecasts a group pre-tax profit of RM7.48 million for its
FY1996 on a group turnover of RM58 million. For FY1997 it forecasts a
profit and turnover of RM13.47 million and RM84.9 million, respectively.
(Refer to Table 1.)
  Poh May is the first local furniture company to apply wood-bending, a
technique by which straight pieces of hardwood are curved in a mechanised
steamer process. The result - elegant and aesthetically pleasing pieces of
furniture. In fact, the Bendwood furniture is the only one of its kind in
Malaysia, although some makers in Taiwan and Europe have the know-how.
  Says Lee,`You can bend cane and metal, but you can't bend wood, least of
all hardwood. But we came out with the technology and the skills. No one
in Southeast Asia has been able to copy that yet,' he smiles.
  The company is adept at combining rattan with wrought iron and metal in
producing new furniture products. Any combination is possible, so long as
the end-product looks good enough. He says, `One new range of furniture is
launched every year to keep up with market demand.'
  Lee, a winner of entrepreneurial awards here and abroad, keeps a close
eye on local talent. Among Poh May's newer products to use indigenous
technology is the Igloo, a refrigeration unit which uses a locally
patented microchip cooling system instead of a generator or compressor,
thus saving energy and reducing noise level. This is incorporated into
furniture for use in the office or bedside. (Refer Table 2 for Poh May
subsidiaries and their main activities.)
  `For a feel of the market, we travel all over to see what other parts of
the world have to offer. We go to Europe and to the United States where
the biggest furniture market is. There we learn something, come back and
try it out. But we don't copy. We get an idea and develop it further,'
says Lee.
  The search for cheaper materials is also important. Poh May plans to set
up a timber-based factory in Cao Danang, an economic processing zone in
southern Vietnam, to take advantage of cheap timber and wood sources.
  The overall demand for rattan and wood furniture remains buoyant.
Malaysia's exports of rattan and wood furniture are expected to increase
to RM3 billion by the year 2000. It is expected to rise to RM2 billion by
next year.
  Lee explains, `Everyone knows the housing industry is booming, people's
incomes are rising... the furniture market is still good. It's a case of
how good you are. I emphasize design and innovation, so rather than talk
about a chair, we talk about a piece of furniture.'
  Lee explains his early move into furniture. `When I was in Form 3, my
father retired from trucking and ventured into cane furniture in a very
small way. He set up a joint venture, a small shop to do cane furniture.
We were poor so I helped out after school. After finishing Form 5, I
studied  one more year in Penang at a private institute for my higher
accounting. Then I worked for a year as an accounts clerk. I was about 21
when I went into this business.
  `At that time I called it Lee Trading. We started in a small way with
little capital. I did very basic cane furniture to supply the Penang
market. Slowly we grew. Our furniture was sent down to Kuala Lumpur and
the East Coast.'
  Then came tough times during the 1985-1986 recession. Lee decided to
look outside Malaysia. It made sense as Lee felt that the local market was
not big enough for his company to expand and enjoy economies of scale in
production.
  But this does not mean he will concentrate on exports alone. `I would
say that the local market has very good potential for growth. I am very
optimistic about the local furniture market. Of course, I cannot deny that
our costs in Malaysia have increased compared to a couple of years back,
but in Europe they are having bigger problems. The margins for us here are
higher.'

A milestone for reinsurer: MNRB plans to go into underwriting risks for
aircraft and satellites

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 14

AS THE COUNTRY'S sole reinsurer, Malaysian National Reinsurance Bhd (MNRB)
enjoys a certain degree of monopoly.
  But unlike other monopolies such as Tenaga Nasional Bhd or Telekom
Malaysia, MNRB has had to strive hard to carve this monopoly into a
meaningful revenue earner. This is because basically, the profits of
reinsurance companies depend on the performance of the insurance companies
ceding part of their premiums to the former. In MNRB's case, its
bottomline is therefore affected by the fate of local insurance companies.
  Until 1984, the local insurance industry was far from orderly and
considered a demerit market by foreign reinsurance companies. `Many
insurance companies indulged in unhealthy competition with each other for
business. There was no control ... of course we had the insurance laws and
a lot of people just looked at the law and got away or tried to get away
with it. As a result, the Malaysian market was severely affected by
underwritng losses and uncontrollable cost,' says MNRB's managing director
Anuar Mohd Hassan.
  Following the disorder that reigned in the industry, market players
through the General Insurance Association of Malaysia (GIAM) came out with
a series of inter-company agreements. MNRB, which was closely linked to
GIAM, also played a key role in ensuring the agreement was adhered to for
the viability of the industry.
  Says Anuar, `With all the efforts by parties concerned, including
insurance companies themselves who wanted to be regulated, the market
improved. Malaysia was no longer considered a demerit market but instead
one where many reinsurers worldwide wanted to be involved with. The
companies started producing underwriting profits and this had a direct
impact on profits of MNRB.'
  In a way therefore, the listing of MNRB on the main board of the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) heralds another step in the long road to
recovery of the Malaysian insurance industry. Incorporated in 1972, MNRB
is offering 19.06 million shares to the public at RM4.30 per share. After
listing, its share capital will increase to RM189.7 million. Thanks to
Malaysia not being subjected to catastrophic perils, the company has
chalked up handsome pre-tax profits the past few years. (See table)
  For the financial year ended March 31, 1996, MNRB recorded a pre-tax
profit of RM61.52 million while the forecast for 1997 is RM77.92 million.
The net tangible asset backing per share is RM1.69 while the earnings per
share based on its forecast net profit of RM54.5 million for 1997 is 29
sen. Given the initial public offer price of RM4.30 per share, MNRB shares
are being offered at a prospective price earnings multiple of 14.8 times
FY97 earnings. Given the average sectoral price earnings multiple of 24
times, MNRB's shares should trade at around RM7.
  MNRB's revenue comprises premium income and investment income. For the
past five years, premiums contributed about 90 per cent of income with the
remaining 10 per cent coming from investment income. Over 80 per cent of
the premium income of MNRB is derived from the voluntary cessions of the
entire Malaysian general insurance market while the balance comes from
facultative and treaty reinsurance.
  The voluntary cessions, structured and implemented on Jan 1, 1973, is a
form of proportional treaty reinsurance between MNRB and local insurance
companies. The agreement entered with local insurance companies require a
share of their business to be ceded to MNRB. In return, MNRB covers
damages in proportion to the premium ceded. Part of the voluntary cessions
is retroceded to the ceding companies with the objective of helping
prevent premium outflow and to help local insurance companies build up
premium volume from a well spread portfolio of risks.
  The amount of business ceded to MNRB ranges from 10 per cent to 15 per
cent. The voluntary cessions agreement provides MNRB with a steady stream
of income, causing several analysts to be optimistic of the steady
earnings the company will get in the future.
  However, an analyst ponders on what is to become of the voluntary
cessions agreement with the liberalisation of world trade and services
through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and World Trade
Organisation (WTO) in the next few years.
  To this, MNRB senior general manager Mustaffa Ahmad explains that he
does not expect MNRB or the agreements with the local insurance companies
to be a subject of contention under GATT and WTO. `As long as it is not a
compulsory arrangement, there should not be any questions. The agreement
was agreed by all parties,' he says.
  Anuar explains that the voluntary cessions agreement was last reviewed
last year and the percentage ceded was supposed to be further reduced in
January this year. `However, with the declining trend of the national
retention ratio, the board of MNRB together with the industry agreed that
there should be no change in the level of voluntary cessions for this
year, he says.
  According to the 1994 Director-General of Insurance Report, the national
retention ratio was 72.3 per cent while the government wants to see the
retention ratio move up to 85 per cent. Anuar says no date has been fixed
for the next review of the voluntary cessions agreement.
  `There is no specific date for the agreement. It has to be agreed upon
by all parties which are the industry, MNRB and Bank Negara. I do not
expect it to be done every year,' he says.
  Another concern among analysts is the rather flat net profits showed by
the company since 1995. This, according to a company official, is because
MNRB has been very prudent in forecasting its claims ratio. `In addition,
the more risk we write, the more we have to set aside as unexpired premium
reserve,' he says.
  With a guaranteed stream of steady income, what is the future of MNRB
with more foreign reinsurance companies given the nod to set up operations
here? At present there are seven other reinsurance companies in Malaysia.
Six of them are incorporated outside Malaysia. The other is the Malaysian
Re International Insurance (MIIL) which is incorporated in Labuan. MNRB
has a 20 per cent equity interest in MIIL. Anuar says MNRB is looking at
writing more offshore business with foreign companies. `We not happy to
sit here and wait for offers to come here through intermediaries,'
stresses Anuar. `We want to be involved in Asean countries where many
reinsurers are interested due to the phenomenal economic boom. We are also
looking at North Africa and the Middle-East countries.
  `There is a great desire from some countries in that region to have
business dealings in Malaysia, not only because our country is on the
world map but because they have heard of MNRB's reputation of assisting
and improving local insurance companies. It is also due to the financial
strength of MNRB and its desire to work with another Muslim company.
Besides that, we are also looking at India,' he says.
  On the local front, Anuar says MNRB will take over the management of the
aviation pool which will have the capacity to underwrite a certain portion
of risks involving aircraft. `We cannot underwrite 100 per cent of MAS
planes but the pool will at least be able to underwrite the smaller
aircraft. A substantial amount of premiums involving such large risks is
going out of the country at the moment,' he says.
  From planes, MNRB plans to move into underwriting risks for satellites.
Anuar says MNRB is discussing with an experienced foreign reinsurance firm
on the matter.

Pix: Mustafa: It's not a compulsory arrangement.

Pricier than the norm: But given its profitability, analysts think that's
a fair IPO price for

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 12

EVERMASTER GROUP Bhd's flotation exercise has drawn keen interest amongst
market players. Reason: the shares are being offered at RM7, the second
highest ever for a second board listing after Penas Corporation Bhd.
  Clearly, the company has taken the cue from the Securities Commission
(SC) urging companies to move from a merit-based environment to one of
full disclosure. This means it is the company and not the authorities who
determine the initial public offer (IPO) price.
  Comments an analyst,`Beginning 1996, the SC left it up to the merchant
bankers to decide on the IPO of a company. In this case, Commerce
International Merchant Bankers Bhd has set the scale based on the market
sentiments. At present, second board sentiments are generally positive so
the pricing of Evermaster shares probably reflects this scenario.
Sometimes, we see shares hitting a opening price of more than RM7 upon
listing.'
  Is the RM7 justified?
  According to estimates, Evermaster's net earnings per share (EPS) pre-
listing is 76.3 sen which will rise to a post-listing 80.2 sen FY1996
earnings. The forecast figures for 1997 include a RM102 million turnover
and a RM14.5 million pre-tax profit.
  Based on the 1996 post-listing EPS, the shares are being offered at a
historical price earnings (PE) multiple of 8.8 times. This is around the
average net PE most IPOs are priced at.
  Managing director Tsai Ching Chi maintains the RM7 is based on the
company's historical and forecast earnings. Is it expected to fetch a huge
premium on opening day like other second board counters? `We do not know
what the premium will be, but we hope it will be similar to others in the
industry,' he says.
  Says one analyst, `It would  seem that given the company's
profitability, the RM7 IPO price is not high at all. In fact, the
shareholders could have opted for a higher paid-up capital of say RM30
million, instead of its RM20 million, which would have given a lower EPS
and thus lower IPO price. After all, you can still go for a listing on the
second board on a paid-up capital of up to RM40 million.'
  Tsai says the prospectus will be issued by mid- November and the listing
is scheduled by the end of the year. Pursuant to the listing, the main
shareholders of Sabah-based Evermaster are making an offer for sale of
five million shares at RM7 each. Of these, two million are for bumiputera
investors, 851,000 shares for Evermaster eligible employees and the
remaining 2.149 million for the public.
  Although Evermaster is in the timber business, it does not own any
timber concessions. But the company maintains this is not a reason for
concern. Its log supplies are sourced under various agreements with
concessionaires and direct purchases from suppliers in the open market. It
even has long term supply agreements with third parties with concession
periods ranging from eight to 10 years.
  Evermaster was set up in 1986 as a company trading primarily in timber
logs by three founder members - managing director Tsai and executive
directors Lim Piak How and Yek Lik Hua. Following the listing, Tsai, Lim
and Yek will each hold a 15.3 per cent stake while chairman Hamzah
Zainudin will own 20 per cent.
  Prior to 1986, Tsai, who is a Taiwanese with permanant residence status
in Sabah, was involved in timber and forestry for more than 30 years. In
the course of work, he met up with his current partners, both Sabahans.
Lim was a surveyor with vast experience in timber extraction, while Yek's
forte is in marketing and shipping timber. `Each of us has vast experience
in specialised areas and it was only logical that we teamed up and used
our expertise in our own operations,' says Tsai.
  Evermaster Wood Products Sdn Bhd was established two years later in 1988
to take advantage of the government's incentives. Evermaster Wood produces
sawn timber and veneer as value added products and has 780 employees.
  Through its two subsidiaries, Evermaster Wood and Evermaster Sdn Bhd
(trading in timber logs), Evermaster derives 95 per cent of its turnover
from overseas markets, mainly Japan, South Korea and China. Major
customers for plywood include the China National Trading Corporation Ltd,
Momura Trading Co Ltd, Mitsubishi Corporation Co Ltd and Northeast
Materials Ltd. Sawn timber is exported to Nisho Iwai International (S)
Ltd, Takahide Corporation and Anrobis Trading Pte Ltd.
  The remaining five per cent of the group's turnover comes from supplying
its products in Sabah itself. Evermaster products are marketed under the
brand label `Green Frog'. Why this name? Tsai explains, `Most of our
products are exported to the Asia-Pacific region, particularly to China
and Taiwan where people prefer the names of animals as brand names.
  `Although Evermaster deals with timber we want people to know that we
are not destroying the environment. So we came up with the Green Frog,
which signifies life and preservation,' he smiles.
  The Evermaster Group operates from its timber complex covering 53 acres
in Keningau, Sabah. The facility has four production lines each for veneer
and plywood, operating on two 10-hour shifts a day. There is one
production line for sawn timber operating on one shift of 10 hours a day.
  According to Tsai, the total investment in fixed assets for the two
subsidiaries to date stands at RM50 million. The total production capacity
for plywood is 78,000 cubic metres per year and 18,000 cubic metres per
year for sawn timber.
  Tsai is emphatic that the demand for timber products will continue to
grow, particularly in Asia-Pacific countries with high growth rates. `The
dominant players in the Asia-Pacific region are China and Japan. If these
economies continue to grow, we believe Evermaster's prospects will be very
good,' he says.
  Evermaster is pegged as one of the top 10 exporters in terms of export
earnings from Sabah, Tsai claims. He does say, however, that no
comparative studies have been conducted.
  What plans does Evermaster have? `We plan to expand into downstream
activities such as finger-jointed wood, laminated boards, profiles and
blackboards as well as kiln drying,' says Tsai. The group is set to invest
RM16 million to construct a new plant adjacent to its existing plant in
Keningau to manufacture new downstream products. Work on the new factory
will begin in January next year.
  Other areas being considered for expansion include manufacturing of
furniture to add value to existing products. Evermaster will also venture
into other markets in Europe and United States.
  The group has been registering a steady increase in turnover and profits
over the last five years (see table).

The profits of peace: Malaysian investors get a head start in southern
Philippines

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 71

THE PHILIPPINE economy is heading for better times. Exports have grown,
domestic consumption is rising and inflation is down to nine per cent. An
added bonus is the signing of the peace treaty on Sept 2 that ended 24
years of war in southern Philippines.
  Though the Philippines is still far from catching up with the economies
of the Asian `dragons', analysts say with political stability and skilled
manpower, the country could outpace its present six to seven per cent
growth in the next few years.
  In keeping with global trend, the Philippines is shifting away from
traditional family-dominated monopolies to a free market system,
emphasising the development of basic infrastructure.
  Last year, private sector investments amounted to 335.3 billion pesos.
Priority is given to build, operate, transfer (BOT) projects.
  The free market shift is also aiding the tourism industry, traditionally
the Philippines' major foreign exchange earner. Intense competition among
four airlines - Air Philippines, Grand Pacific, Cebu Pacific Airlines and
the national flag carrier Philippines Airlines - is bringing down air
fares.
  Services contributed to 43 per cent of the gross domestic product last
year and the government is opening the banking sector to foreign
competition. Under the foreign bank liberalisation law, foreign investors
can buy a controlling stake of up to 60 per cent in a local bank. The
Central Bank's previous ceiling on foreign ownership was 40 per cent.
  A recent report by the Central Bank governor shows that foreign banks'
share of the total resources of the Philippine commercial banking system
increased from 6.95 per cent last year to 8.17 per cent as of March 1996.
With the Central Bank issuing new licences, there are now 42 banks
compared to 24 in 1991.
  Malaysian corporations are among those to take advantage of the
investment opportunities in the Philippines. Four Malaysian joint ventures
are involved in the BOT projects planned for 1996-2000. Renong Bhd is
developing the Manila Cavite Expressway worth 6.5 billion pesos (RM650
million); Philippine Malaysia Water Consortium is undertaking the South
Metro Manila Water Supply project worth 312 million pesos; Malaysian
Philippines Utilities Sdn Bhd is building the Balara Water Treatment
Plant; and Johan Holdings Bhd is involved in a BOT project valued at 4.16
billion pesos.
  According to the Board of Investments, Malaysian-led projects rank
fourth among all BOI-approved investments in the Philippines. Regionally,
they form the biggest investor group. Last year the BOI-regulated
investments from Malaysia was 1.59 billion pesos. The Malaysian companies
went into manufacturing, construction, property development and the
services sectors in the early 90s and are now expanding, mostly into
resource-rich but underdeveloped Mindanao island in southern Philippines.
  Even before the peace pact between the Philippine government and the
Moro National Liberation Front last September, Malaysian, Indonesian and
Hong Kong investors have ventured to Mindanao. They invested in the
banking, telecommunications, steel, tourism, liquified petroleum gas
(LPG), water supply, property, palm oil/rubber, coconut processing,
banking and property sectors.
  Most of these companies gained a foothold in the Philippines during the
1992-1993 period when President Fidel Ramos' government sped up market
reforms initiated by his predecessor Corazon Aquino. The early birds
include Westmont Group's Westmont Bank, Berjaya Group, Hong Leong Group,
Waterfront International, Kuok Group, Johan Holdings, Petronas, Hume
Industries, Rashid Hussein Bhd, TA Securities Bhd, Auto Industries Sdn Bhd
and the Lion Group.
  Proton recently completed a plant in Pengasinan in Luzon which will
start producing cars after the Apec (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation)
meeting in Subic this month. Metroplex Bhd and Genting Bhd are developing
hotels and a casino in Subic. Westmont Bank, reputed to be among the top
10 commercial banks, is the result of a takeover and rescue bid by
Westmont group in 1994. Arab-Malaysian Banking Corp, Bank Bumiputra,
Malayan Banking and Bank Islam are among the latest investors in Mindanao.
  Undoubtedly, the inflow of foreign investments is fuelling the
Philippines' economic recovery. But the real challenge now is to ensure
that the benefits of the recovery trickle down to ordinary Filipinos. An
Asian diplomat based in Manila says, `Normally with economic growth there
is decline in unemployment, but you don't see that so clearly. The
implication is that economic recovery is benefiting only certain sectors.'
  The jobless rate is nine per cent and between 30 and 35 per cent of
Filipinos are underemployed, notes the diplomat. (The underemployed are
those holding part-time jobs). In addition an estimated four million
Filipinos are working overseas, 90 per cent of whom are classified as
`vulnerable'. The vulnerable groups include domestic servants and
unskilled workers who are the hardest to monitor and encounter the most
problems. In recent years, the robust economy has helped to reduce
unemployment but more needs to be done.
  Says Philippines' ambassdor to Malaysia Jose S Brilliantes, `Even if
they are not coming home in droves, there is a perceptible improvement
now'. Undersecretary of the Board of Investment Melito Sison Salazar Jr
notes, `In general job migration is an outward rather than an inward flow.
Though employment opportunities have improved somewhat, this is offset by
the rising cost of living that still drives many Filipinos to seek better
paying jobs overseas.'
  The immigration laws have been tightened and the government is now
sponsoring re-orientation programmes and investment schemes to assist
workers returning to the Philippines.
  As capital-hungry Filipino businesses look to tie up with foreign
partners, there is great potential for technology transfer and the
development of human resources. Wages have increased but they are still
lower than other countries in the region. Wages in the manufacturing
sector increase by about 9.5 per cent annually. However, income at the top
is among the most respectable. A study by Hong Kong's Political and
Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd shows that the salaries of professionals in
managerial and production positions in the Philippines are among the top
in the region.
  Brilliantes says labour is no longer cheap in the Philippines. `One of
the comparative advantages in investing in the Philippines is not in low
wages but in its human resources, the availability of a large pool of
highly trainable, skilled, English-speaking manpower,' he says.

The perks of the trade: Samsung workers enjoy living standards better than
most

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 23

LIKE their brethren across the nation, Seremban factory workers have been
infected by the malady of quitting their employers for higher-paying
offers elsewhere.
  Lately, a number of engineers and technicians from certain Seremban-
based plants have been lured to Samsung Seremban, drawn by higher pay and
better perks. Although the brain-drain has not reached a critical level
yet, the outflow of talent from a particular electronics company has its
management so worried, that a top executive requested Samsung Malaysia
president and managing director Kim Jin Ki not to pay such high salaries.
  Does Samsung pay the most among Seremban industrial facilities? `We are
among the highest,' says Kim. `But whether we are the highest I do not
know.'
  `They pay the best rates. Not that much more, about four to five hundred
more per month,' affirms a senior engineer with the rival electronics
manufacturer. `But they also work you the hardest.'
  At the Samsung Electronics Seremban Complex, 12-hour shifts are the
norm. Where executive engineers are concerned, overtime can only be
claimed after working 20 hours. And, adds the senior engineer, `They like
you to take overtime.'
  However, the long hours are cushioned by a cornucopia of employee
benefits. Workers are entitled to 26 free meals a month, and can choose
from five to seven different menus at the company cafeterias. Reflecting
Samsung's heritage, Korean food - albeit tailored to Malaysian tastebuds -
is available. Judging by the long line at the counter, the Korean dishes
go down well with Samsung workers.
  Free meals are complemented by lodging - gratis also - at the company's
custom-built dormitories. Costing RM17.5 million, the dormitories consist
of four blocks, with another two to be completed in May 1997. Also on the
cards are a swimming pool, gymnasium (offering free recreational classes)
and football field.
  Says K K Lee, self-styled resort director at Samsung Dormitory, `As far
as I know, this is the first (dormitory) of its kind. A test case where
residences are within the industrial area.'
  The concept seems to have found favour with Samsung employees.
Currently, the occupancy rate is 90 per cent, which works out to some
2,000 residents, including 500 Indonesians. Expectedly, males and females
are segregated in their own blocks. Each block has 96 rooms, with four
occupants per room. Facilities are basic, with each room featuring spartan
double-decker bunk beds and wardrobes. Just like a college dormitory,
there are common areas - TV rooms, reading rooms, prayer rooms and laundry
rooms - as well as communal shower areas. The pantry features moulded
plastic seats and tables, just like in fast-food restaurants.
  Thanks to his military background, K K Lee runs the place `barracks-
style', assisted by his wardens. There are strict rules - a curfew of 12
midnight is strictly enforced for employees `who are not out of station'
and smoking is prohibited.
  Despite the regimentation, says K K Lee, `There's a waiting list to get
in.' This is hardly surprising, since staying in the dormitory would
enable a worker to shave his monthly living expenses considerably. Rentals
in Seremban and surrounding areas have been escalating steadily, with a
single-storey terrace house going for RM250 on the average.
  The question is - has Samsung's employee benefits programme actually
boosted its ability to retain staff? Employee turnover is pretty low, says
Kim, about three per cent monthly compared to the national monthly average
of six per cent.  But staff retention comes at a hefty cost. On a micro
level, says Lee, Samsung spends RM100-odd per month on each dormitory
resident. Multiply that figure by 2,000 residents and Samsung's monthly
dormitory bill is a steep RM200,000. But that's not all. Each month, says
Kim, the expense of maintaining the employee benefit programme is `at a
one-to-one ratio' with Samsung's wage bill.

Roads to roam: The Western Australian Education Centre shows you several
ways of gettin

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 64

AUSTRALIA has plenty to offer - excellent weather, a cost of living which
most consider reasonable, is culturally diverse and has an education
system considered among the best Down Under.
  And Perth is the Australian city most students, Malaysians or others,
head for in furtherance of their education. Over 10,000 international
students are currently enrolled in Perth's various educational
institutions, many of whom are from Malaysia.
  A substantial number of them have sought the services of the Western
Australian Education Centre in Kuala Lumpur for assistance in getting
places at the many Perth institutions of higher learning. There are four
universities in the Perth region - Curtin University of Technology, Edith
Cowan University, Murdoch University and the University of Western
Australia.
  All are large government-funded universities which provide a wide range
of degree courses from bachelor to doctorate level. And all are of
international standing and repute, with their degrees enjoying
international recognition.
  Overseas students have the option of pursuing their secondary education
by enrolling in a number of government- or private-sector colleges. They
offer courses from Year 7 to Year 12 (final year). Entry to university is
based on the results of the Tertiary Entrance Examination which are the
Year 12 examinations under the Western Australian Education system.
  But for those who find the method of entry to university rigid, there is
an alternative secondary system provided by Canning College, Tuart
College, Beaufort College, Edwards College and St Marks International
College. These colleges offer the Western Australian Universities
Foundation Programme in association with the four government universities.
This programme has been designed for international students and is an
alternative to Year 12. All universities accept the results of the
Foundation Programme for University entrance.
  In the vocational area there are a number of government and private
colleges which offer courses for international students. The government
provider is Tafe (Technical and Further Education) which is the largest
educational provider in Western Australia with over 100,000 students. Tafe
offers a wide range of courses at vocational and technical level in most
areas of study. Students who complete a Tafe diploma in some of these
areas (notably business and engineering) are eligible for entry to most
Western Australian universities with advanced standing.
  The private providers in the vocational field include Alexander College,
Edwards College, Australian Institute of University Studies (AIUS), Perth
Institute of Business and Technology (PIBT), and Perth Commercial College.
These colleges tend to focus on courses in business, computing, mass
communications, travel and tourism, hospitality studies and secretarial
studies.
  Admission requirements are flexible and some also have a three semester
calender year which means there are three intakes a year for the various
programmes. The system also allows students to complete a programme of
study in a shorter period of time.
  Alexander College, Edwards College, AIUS and PIBT also have arrangements
with the Western Australian universities whereby the former offer courses
equivalent to the first (and in some courses second and third) year of the
degree programmes in business/commerce, computing and mass communications.
  Upon successful completion of these programmes, students are able to
enrol directly into the second year (and where applicable later years) of
the relevant degree programmes of the universities. These courses provide
an excellent alternative for students who are marginally unable to gain
direct entry to the university course of their choice.
  For students and parents keen to learn more about the programmes offered
by the various Perth institutions of higher learning, they can visit the
Western Australian Education Centre in Kuala Lumpur.
  The centre is located at 4th floor, UBN Tower, 10, Jalan P Ramlee, 50250
Kuala Lumpur. They can make an appointment or even seek information from
centre officials by telephone at 03-2321248/9.

Seeking only the best: High calibre multiple partners help IMC maintain
high standards

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 66

WHEN THE International Medical College (IMC) chose the University of
Melbourne Medical School as its 20th partner medical school, it knew it
had made the right decision.
  The reason is simple - the University Of Melbourne Medical School is the
oldest medical school in Australia. It is also widely dubbed as the
Oxbridge of Down Under for its high standard. The Dean of IMC, Professor
John S Beck says, `This is a very good choice and we are immensely proud
to have this university as our partner medical school.'
  The University of Melbourne Medical School only became IMC's partner
medical school last year, three years after it started.
  The reason behind the slight delay in getting an Australian university
as one of its medical partners was because IMC was not familiar with the
standard of Australian universities as well as their curriculum.
  Beck says, `Once we had examined the curriculum and spoken to their
students, we concluded that their standard was high and just as good as
ours. So we went into a partnership with them. The University of Melbourne
has offered six places to students of IMC.'
  The IMC is looking for more Australian partners. `The IMC is also
building ties with other universities in Australia We are very careful in
selecting partner medical schools as we only want the best because here at
IMC, our standards are equally high,' adds Beck.
  Beck says one of the reasons why IMC is looking favourably at
universities Down Under is because Australia has become a natural focus
for sudents in this region. `People here always perceive Australia as
being nearer to home than any other country. Europe and North America are
considered as being too far away.'
  The University of Melbourne Medical School was the first medical school
established in Australia - that was in 1862, 11 years after the university
formally opened.
  The school attracts many of the best students in Australia and overseas.
  Over the last 10 years it has attracted more research funding than any
other medical school in Australia. Its ability to attract a leading share
of Australia's largest pool of government and privately-funded health and
medical research opportunities continues to draw research talent of the
highest calibre.
  The teaching hospital network offers outstanding experience for students
in their clinical years. Associated with the medical school are five major
general teaching hospitals: the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Western
Hospital, St Vincent's Hospital, Geelong Hospital, Austin and Repatriation
Medical Centre.
  Major specialist teaching hospitals are the Royal Children's Hospital,
Royal Women's Hospital, Mercy Hospital for Women, the Royal Victorian Eye
and Ear Hospital, the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, North-West
Hospital and Fairfeild Hospital for Infectious disease.
  Students who join the IMC can complete their MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine
and Bachelor of Surgery) in six years - 2ystem at the college and 3ystem years 
in Melbourne. The tuition fee in Melbourne is A$24,000 per annum.
  The IMC curriculum consists of two parts - Part 1 comprises 2ystem years of
training supervised by the Faculty of the International Medical College in
basic biomedical science and an integrated clinical systems-centred
course.
  The Advanced Diploma in Medical Sciences will be awarded by the college
to students who have successfully completed their programme of study at
the IMC.
  The IMC approach introduces clinical experience from the start of the
curriculum and this helps the student to appreciate the real importance of
the basic science since its application is clearly presented. First year
students will receive clinical exposure at the Seremban General Hospital,
Port Dickson Hospital and various community health clinics in Seremban.
  The college accepts Malaysian and international students who have
completed their Australian Matriculation examinations.
  Todate, the college has some 100 students who have completed various
Australian matriculation programmes such as the South Australian
Matriculation, Victoria Certificate Of Education, the New South Wales
Foundation and Queensland Matriculation. IMC also accepts students with
Monash University Foundation Year qualifications.
  The other 19 partner medical schools of the IMC are University of
Auckland in New Zealand, University College Cork, University College
Dublin, University Galway, the Royal College of Surgeons and Trinity
College in Ireland, University Of Alberta, University Of Calgary,
Daihousie University, McGill University, Memorial University Of
Newfoundland, University Of Western Ontario, and Thomas Jefferson Medical
College In North America, University Of Aberdeen, University Of Dundee,
University Of Glasgow, University Of Liverpool, University Of Newcastle
Upon-Tyne and Queen's University In the United Kingdom.

Stage set for the next century: The 1997 Budget lays a foundation for a
technologically sophisticated

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 40

IN A 90 MINUTE speech at the Dewan Rakyat on Oct 25, Finance Minister
Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim described his Budget as laying the foundation to
establish a `firm bridge' to take Malaysia into the 21st century. What is
in store for 1997?
  Notwithstanding a drop in the electronics industry, the Malaysian
economy is expected to surge ahead at an estimated GDP growth rate of 8.2
per cent for this year. This represents the ninth consecutive year of
robust growth of more than eight per cent per annum for the country.
Consequently, the per capita income has correspondingly increased from
RM10,058 in 1995 to RM11,118 for this year.
  What has confounded sceptics is the fact that the strong economic growth
has been accompanied by low inflation, a proud achievement for the country
indeed. For 1996, for instance, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected
to rise a mere 0.2 per cent to 3.6 per cent from 3.4 per cent last year,
helping to allay fears of an economy overheating.
  Besides stable prices, the other commendable feature of the economic
growth this year is the healthy rise in national savings from 36.5 per
cent in 1995 to 38.8 per cent for 1996. This places the savings rate in
Malaysia higher than Japan and all the other newly industrialising
economies (NIEs), with the exception of Singapore.
  At the same time, the capital market is further boosted by a record
listing of 61 companies from January to September this year, turning the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange into the third largest bourse in the Asia
Pacific region.
  In the manufacturing sector, domestic-oriented industries grew at a
healthy rate of 15.2 per cent for the first seven months this year as
compared to 12.8 per cent over the same period a year ago. Except for the
electronics sector, all other export-oriented industries, especially
textiles, wood and rubber products, posted significant growth.
  In its rush to catch up with the other NIEs, Malaysia has recently been
facing a current account deficit compounded by a persistent and
deteriorating service account. With a breakneck pace of growth in recent
years, the country is also experiencing full employment and capacity
utilisation with a resultant increase in inflationary pressures both in
terms of wages and costs.
  Recognising the need to further strengthen the structure of the economy
as well as address the weaknesses associated with a long period of growth,
the 1997 Budget, with a total expenditure of RM59.98 billion, has been
drawn up to ensure sustained growth in the medium and long term by:
  * Achieving sustainable growth through enhanced productivity;
  * Strengthening the balance of payments position with improvements in
the services sector and higher domestic production; and
  * Strengthening the agenda for social development.
  Presently, more than half (55 per cent) of the growth in output derives
from capital investment making the ratio of investment to GNP a high of
45.1 per cent. While this is laudable, the whole approach to development
would have to undergo a major shift from being capital driven to
productivity driven if Malaysia were to enjoy a higher level of
sustainable growth. The emphasis on productivity growth is clearly
emboldened in the Seventh Malaysia Plan as shown in the table.
  In this regard, appropriate measures have been announced in the Budget
to steer the economy in the right direction. To encourage manufacturing
and agricultural firms to modernise operations, expand capacity and
diversify output, a reinvestment allowance of 100 per cent of statutory
income is granted for productivity boosting investments.
  Underscoring its commitment to upgrade the high level of technology, the
Budget has allocated RM721 million for the Technology Development Plan and
research programmes like the IRPA (Intensification of Research in Priority
Areas). To encourage more research and development work, private
companies, especially the small and medium industries (SMIs), are allowed
to use the IRPA's allocation. Firms are also allowed double deduction for
R&D expenditures. Tax deduction for the acquisition of intangible assets
like patents, designs and trade marks would help the country in scaling up
the technology ladder rapidly.
  Besides enhancing the value chain of the manufacturing process, the new
Industry Inter-Linkage Programme (ILP) also helps to promote cooperation
and transfer of skills and technology from multinational corporations to
local industries. In addition, SMIs participating in the ILP and producing
quality intermediate goods, are given tax exemption for up to 10 years.
  The Budget also has generous incentives to help promote a strategic
shift to knowledge-based and technology intensitive industries. This move
will undoubtedly help to improve efficiency and productivity in all areas.
Of particular mention is the slew of incentives to give the Multi-Media
Super Corridor (MSC) a further boost. Among such incentives are:
  * Pioneer status for 10 years for Investment Tax Allowance of 100 per
cent for a new company;
  * Exemption of taxes on all multi-media equipment;
  * Allowing the recruitment of expatriates according to needs; and
  * Special guidelines for transactions and loans in foreign currency.
  The Budget has also not forgotten the human resource development
necessary to make the upgrading of technology a success. A whopping
allocation of RM13.2 billion or more than 20 per cent of the Budget has
been provided to upgrade and expand local educational and training
institutions and to promote a large pool of technicians and engineers.
  A 50 per cent income tax exemption is also allowed for foreign lecturers
and foreign educational institutions set up in Malaysia, a much needed
boost to the country's effort to establish itself as a regional centre for
education. Besides earning foreign exchange, this move can also help to
save the RM2.5 billion spent annually by Malaysian students overseas.
  Underlying the commitment to upgrade its industries and human resources,
the Finance Minister has also announced that no more new foreign workers
will be allowed into the country. In this regard, a Guideline on Wage
Reform has also been introduced. The guideline proposes a productivity-
linked wage system to increase competitiveness, productivity and
industrial harmony. This is especially pertinent given that the wage
growth of eight per cent for the first seven months of this year has far
outstripped productivity growth of just 3.9 per cent.
  To ensure sustainable growth, the Budget also recognises the need to
maintain a low level of inflation. To this end, RM1.7 billion has been
provided to develop agriculture, fisheries and livestock as well as
increase the effectiveness of the marketing and distribution systems. More
import duties will be abolished or reduced on several items including
paper products, printed paper and cosmetics.
  In tandem with the government's efforts to check inflation, a cabinet
committee has been formed to promote the savings habit among Malaysians
with a long term target for savings rate at 40 per cent. This would
substantially reduce the present savings-investment gap as Malaysia needs
more funds to finance its many development plans.
  The recent implementation of major infrastructural projects has
contributed to a current account deficit, given the substantial imports of
both capital and intermediate goods. This is compounded by a chronic
service account deficit as illustrated in the charts.
  The service deficit seems to be the main culprit in the current account
problem. While the merchandise account can be improved relatively sooner,
the service account will take a little while longer as Malaysia
restructures its economy. Hence, to ensure a smooth transition of the
economy, a string of measures have been announced to give a strong boost
to its financial and other service sectors.
  To develop a dynamic banking and financial sector, some of the measures
announced in the Budget include:
  * Allowing foreign share-holding of local brokerages to be raised from
30 to 49 per cent;
  * More fund management companies will be approved with a concessionary
tax rate of 10 per cent, down from 30 per cent, to be allowed for both
foreign as well as local fund managers;
  * The government will issue zero coupon bonds to provide benchmark yield
curve to boost the private debt securities market. Major institutions like
the EPF, Bank Simpanan Nasional and the Social Security Organisation will
be allowed to invest in such instruments;
  * The banking sector will be further liberalised with Tier-1 commercial
banks allowed to undertake securities and lending business and engage in
equity derivatives.
  Besides the financial sector, the budget also grants incentives to
promote other service sectors. For instance, the export of professional
services has also been encouraged by its exemption from the services tax
and the shipping sector is granted an additional Shipping Fund of RM200
million.
  To attract more international companies to use Malaysia as an
International Procurement Centre (IPC) and thus add more value to the
economy, both the import duties and limits on foreign equity holdings in
IPCs are to be lifted.
  To promote Labuan as an international offshore financial centre, a
generous tax exemption is granted on 65 per cent of income from
professional services by Labuan-based firms. Expatriates in Labuan have to
pay tax only on 50 per cent of income.
  Recognising the tourism sector as a substantial foreign exchange earner,
the Budget allocated RM294.5 million for the construction and upgrading of
hotels, convention centres and other recreational projects to attract 9.5
million foreign visitors in 1997. A five year Pioneer Status for tourism
related infrastructure projects is also granted.
  Besides earning foreign exchange, the tourism sector could also help
prevent the outflow of the ringgit as more Malaysians start visiting the
newly built and upgraded tourist attractions in the country.
  One of the main causes of the current account deficit was the
substantial imports of capital and intermediate goods which resulted in a
high import content of domestic manufacturing activities. Hence, the
import duty on spare parts and consumables used in manufacturing as well
as on components used in the assembly industry will help to curb imports
and increase domestic production of intermediate goods. To boost
entreneurship, RM1 billion is allocated for such programmes as on vendor
development and the Incubator Premises and Factory Nurturing Schemes.
  Unprecendentedly, the Budget also gives a strong emphasis on the social
sector, reinforcing the government's determination to balance economic and
social development.
  The strategy to narrow the gap between the urban and the rural community
is high on Anwar's social agenda. His budget made a generous allocation of
RM7.05 billion for the development of rural areas. A sum of RM2.4 billion
is also set aside to further reduce poverty.
  Anwar also announced the setting up to a RM1 billion National Housing
Company to solve the housing problem of the low-income earners amid rising
property prices.
  As part of the government's effort to promote the social agenda, welfare
institutions are given assistance to the tune of RM280.7 million. Others
like the non-governmental organisations, AIDS Foundation and the Cancer
Society are also not forgotten.
  A sum of RM3.4 billion is budgeted for more hospitals and to enhance the
quality of health services. With the hospital services tax substantially
reduced, it will not only translate into savings for patients but also
help promote Malaysia as a regional medical centre.
  Given that the economy has already reached full employment and capacity
utilisation, Malaysia simply has no choice but to effect a clear shift to
higher technology and productivity to optimise the use of the nation's
capital and human resources. All these bold efforts must at the same time
be delicately balanced with a need to maintain price stability to prevent
inflation from rearing its ugly head.
  Hence, the generous incentives in the Budget for the information and
industrial technology sectors would certainly help to lay a proper
foundation for a knowledge-based and technologically sophisticated
economy.
  The Multimedia Supercorridor would, in time to come, help spin off and
spawn a whole network of IT related companies which would lift Malaysia
confidently into the information age. Together with incentives given to
programmes like the Inter-Industry Linkage Programme, the Vendor
Development and the Incubator Scheme, the day is not far off when Malaysia
will reach a critical mass in its R&D, thus helping it to become a
manufacturing power house.
  By focusing on the services sector, the Budget attacks the root cause of
the current account deficit problem. The host of incentives given to
develop the service sectors, such as the financial and tourism sectors,
would help the country to earn foreign exchange while steming the outflow
of the local currency, thus alleviating the service account deficit in the
long term. Through its offensive to develop its capital markets and
liberalise its banking industry further, Malaysia would one day pose a
challenge to the financial centres in the region.
balance the material progress of the nation with the well being of
society, as reflected by the generous allocation for social development.
In doing so, it gives full recognition to the important role of the family
and the individual in the development of the nation.
  Describing the balance of payments deficit as `birth pangs' of a new
economic era, Anwar said that this is to be expected for a country
undergoing transformation as it enters the 21st century. The Budget will
help to lay a strong foundation for sustaining long term growth.

Shifting prices: Multinationals and tax authorities face off on the issue
of transfer

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 47

MALAYSIA IS IN need of more transparent tax legislation on transfer
pricing as more Malaysian companies globalise their business activities,
states Price Waterhouse executive director SM Thanneermalai.
  He defines a transfer price as the price charged by a multinational
company (MNC) in a cross-border transaction for the supply or acquisition
of goods, services or intangibles and the provision of finance. Prices
charged in associated company transactions are not normally subjected to
full market forces and may otherwise diverge from prices that would be
charged in similar but independent transactions.
  Transfer pricing is possible through three methods. One way is for the
parent company to impose high prices for goods shipped to its subsidiary
in Malaysia. Alternatively, the parent company can direct its Malaysian
subsidiary to sell goods at lower prices to subsidiaries in third
countries. A third method would be for the parent company to charge
exorbitant royalties where the joint venture involves technical
assistance, technology transfer or management expertise, he elaborates.
  Transfer pricing has been identified as a major problem for tax
authorities because of its effect on profit-shifting between countries as
the level set bears directly on the amount of tax that may be raised in
each country. Malaysian companies expanding abroad thus have to understand
the transfer pricing laws of the foreign countries they are investing in
to avoid being hit by transfer pricing adjustments by foreign tax
authorities.
  Thanneermalai cites for example the case of a foreign tax authority
taking the view that excessive royalties have been repatriated back to
Malaysia. In such a circumstance, the Malaysian company would certainly
approach local tax authorities for a corresponding reduction of the taxes
overpaid earlier. `In such a scenario, you can see that even if Malaysia
wants to keep away from the arena of transfer pricing, the actions of the
other foreign tax authorities will not allow this to happen,' he stresses.
  Generally, other countries such as the United States have attacked
transfer pricing to raise tax revenues when faced with large deficits. The
US Internal Revenue Services implemented stiffer statutory transfer
pricing rules in 1986. Japan's National Tax Agency amended its 1986 rules
on transfer pricing in 1991, he adds.
  Malaysia's international trade has increased significantly in recent
years, with exports for 1995 worth RM185 billion compared with RM45
billion in 1987. Last year's imports amounted to RM194 billion compared
with only RM31 billion in 1987. With the increase in trade levels, there
is a greater likelihood of transfer pricing abuses.
  On a macro level, Malaysia's growing current account deficit under
`other services' hit RM4 billion in 1995. According to Thanneermalai, this
could be a factor prompting the government to examine whether transfer
pricing has contributed to this deficit. However, to date, no published
study has been made on the matter.
  At present, Malaysian tax authorities do not carry out specific transfer
pricing audits. Nevertheless, in tax investigations involving companies
with substantial cross border transactions, the issues around transfer
pricing become the main points of contention between the Malaysian tax
authorities and taxpayers, he points out. `By implication therefore,
Malaysian tax authorities are looking at transfer pricing issues such as
the payment for royalties, services, technical fee and merchandise
involving inter-company transactions across Malaysia's borders,' says
Thanneermalai.
  Although currently there are no specific statutory rules on transfer
pricing, two sections of the Malaysian Income Tax Act 1965 (the Act) can
be invoked when there are transfer pricing abuses: Section 141, which
deals with transactions with non-resident connected persons and Section
140, which is the general anti-avoidance provision.
  Section 141(1) of the Act applies to a transaction which produces to a
resident  `either no income or a smaller income than that which might be
expected to arise owing to the close connection between the resident and
non-resident and to the substantial control exercised by the non-resident
over the resident person.' In such a case, the Director-General of Income
Tax (DG) has the power to tax the non-resident in the name of the resident
on `the income which might be expected to arise from the business of the
resident as if the resident was an agent of the non-resident'.
  Section 141(2) of the Act states that if the profits cannot be readily
ascertained, the DG may assess the non-resident `on a fair and reasonable
percentage of the turnover of the business done by the non-resident
through or with the resident'.
  The second section of the Act provides the DG with wider powers. Section
140(1)(a) of the Act empowers the DG to `disregard or vary the transaction
and make such adjustments as he thinks fit where he has reason to believe
that any transaction has the direct or indirect effect of altering the
incidence of tax which is payable'.
  Section 140(6) of the Act allows the DG to deem certain transactions to
fall within Section 140(1) of the Act. These are transactions between
affiliated companies which `have not been made on terms which might fairly
be expected to have been made by an independent person engaged in the same
or similar activities dealing with one another at arm's length'. However,
there are no statutory rules, case laws or administrative rules in
Malaysia on the definition of the term `arm's length'. The lack of
definitions and guidelines of the above term has occasionally created
problems for taxpayers, states Panneermalai.
  Neighbouring countries which include Indonesia, China, Korea, Japan and
the Philippines have already implemented rules and regulations on transfer
pricing. In fact, Singapore is in the midst of collecting data, a step
before introducing rules on transfer pricing, he indicates. Most of the
countries that have adopted transfer pricing rules acknowledge the
guidelines provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). Malaysian tax authorities are agreeable to most OECD
guidelines although Malaysia is not an OECD member. `Generally, OECD
transaction-based methods such as the comparable uncontrolled price
method, the resale price method and the cost-plus method are acceptable to
Malaysian tax authorities. However, the tax authorities are not in favour
of the profit method unless there is no alternative,' he elaborates.
  Another major setback faced by MNCs in Malaysia is a provision in the
Income Tax statute which gives income tax authorities the right to collect
tax dating back to 12 years. In case of fraud, there are no time
limitations. This is where companies face major problems as they are
unable to retrieve documentation over that length of time due to improper
documentation and storage of the information,' he says.
  `Since we have sufficient legislation to combat any transfer pricing
abuses, Malaysian tax authorities should issue guidelines to determine
whether related party transactions are of arm's-length nature,' he
stresses. Having reasonable and transparent guidelines would definitely
increase the flow of foreign investments into Malaysia. MNCs will know
what the rules are and be able to avoid any future transfer pricing
fiascos.
  Two senior partners of Price Waterhouse, Terry Symons and Michael J
Happell recently gave a talk on global issues of transfer pricing.
Transfer pricing is the current `hot topic' for revenue authorities world-
wide as they get more aggressive in the fight for a share of the MNCs'
world tax revenues, according to Symons. He cites the example of Glaxo
Wellcome where the United Kingdom revenue authorities imposed a whopping
STG200 million (RM804 million) in transfer pricing adjustments.
  Recent tax authority transfer pricing adjustments have had a serious
impact on MNCs world-wide, leaving them open to extra taxation (see
table). In fact, Japan's National Tax Agency (NTA) statistics for the year
ended June 1996 indicate 44 cases with an income adjustment of US$ 450
million earned US$ 275 million in tax and penalties for NTA. NTA
statistics for the nine years since the introduction of transfer pricing
legislation recorded 130 cases involving income adjustments of US$ 1.8
billion, earning NTA a whopping US$ 1.1 billion in tax and penalties.

Stocks to watch: Tenaga Nasional Bhd

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 75

TNB recovered strongly from the recent low of RM8.55 to the current level
of RM10.90. As it constitutes some nine per cent of the KLSE CI, Tenaga
has set the pace for a run-up of the overall market. Technically, it has
formed a double bottom at RM8.55 and the first upside target is at RM11.70
which is close to the current level. Tenaga is expected to consolidate
between RM11.70 and RM10 for the near term.

New shareholders for Tenco?

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 4

TENCO BHD may see new faces on its board soon. Earwitness learns that  a
substantial block of Tenco shares could have changed hands recently at
around RM12 to RM13 apiece. This could probably account for the recent
sharp surge in Tenco's share price from RM12 to RM16 as at press time.
  The new shareholder is believed to be a property developer with strong
connections in northern Peninsular Malaysia. If all goes well, the
property developer may be looking into the possibility of pumping some
sizeable property projects into Tenco.
  Tenco, which was listed on the KLSE second board in Nov 1993, has a
paid-up capital of RM18 million. It is an investment holding company with
four wholly-owned subsidiaries mainly engaged in the manufacture and sale
of industrial adhesives, industrial chemicals, consumer and aerosol
products. It also sells industrial gases, industrial equipment and
building products.
  The range of building products marketed by Tenco includes floormats,
fibreglass wool and boards, polyethylene sheets and tubes.
  The major shareholders of Tenco as at Aug 16, 1996 comprise Wilken Sdn
Bhd (29%), Tan Yik Chin (6.4%), Tan Aik Teck (4.7%) and Tan Lee Ling
(4.4%). Tan Yik Chin is deemed interested in Wilken by virtue of his
shareholding in the company.
  In  May 1995, Tenco announced that the Securities Commission has given
the greenlight to lift the moratorium  of 6.89 million shares held by Tan
Yik Chin, Tan Aik Teck, Tan Lay Lee, Tan Lee Leng @ Tan Lee Fee and
Wilken. With the lifting of the moratorium, the major shareholders were to
have collectively provided a pretax profit guarantee of RM3.42 million for
both the financial years ended Mar 31, 1995 and 1996.
  Since Tenco's pretax profit for the two financial years amounted to
about RM4.45 million each, it looks like the major shareholders have met
the profit forecast.

Theory in practice: As Malaysian and Australian ministers speak of high
tides and pebbles

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 57

THERE IS NO doubt trade ties between Malaysia and Australia mean a lot to
both countries. Barring the occasional hiccup, the relationship between
both countries has generally been warm and cordial.
  Earlier this month, two Malaysian ministers flew to Sydney for a
Malaysia-Australia business dialogue organised by the Asian Strategy and
Leadership Institute. The event, themed `A New Era In Australia-Malaysia
Partnership', drew leading businessmen from both Malaysia (about 40) and
Australia (50).
  In his keynote address, Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa
Mohamed drew attention to some Malaysian industries to be considered by
Australian companies about to venture abroad. Among them were the
production of intermediate and capital goods, construction and building
materials, information technology and computer software.
  In closing the dialogue, Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak
urged Australian business leaders to help develop Malaysia's Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC), telling them that they `should not miss this high
tide in our relations'.
  Such high-level salesmanship does not come from Malaysia alone.
  When Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer was in Kuala Lumpur
last month to address the Malaysia-Australia University Alumni convention,
themed `Malaysia-Australia Relations Beyond 2000', he sent a similar
message. `We have moved beyond the time when governments alone were
responsible for promoting national achievements. The building of links at
the people-to-people level is, after all, the lifeblood of any
relationship,' he said.
  Downer said that the tide of economic, technological and social change
that was sweeping and transforming Australia has created opportunities for
co-operation and partnership between Malaysians and Australians,
particularly in the fields of finance, information technology, marketing,
medicine and education. `Further liberalisation of Malaysia's services
sector should, over time, create even more opportunities in these fields,'
he added.
  The day before Downer gave his speech, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad said Australia could play a major role in helping
Malaysia become an international centre of excellence in higher education.
`It is our hope that Australia, which has several established universities
and institutions, will encourage them to open branches in Malaysia or twin
with local institutions,' he said.
  These speeches highlight the opportunities available in Malaysia and
Australia which will bolster already healthy trade relations, as suggested
by the statistics. According to Malaysia's Economic Report 1996/97, total
trade with Australia expanded by 9.4 per cent to RM4.8 billion in the
first seven months of this year, with Malaysia continuing to record a
deficit.
  Exports to Australia increased by 3.9 per cent to RM1.7 billion while
imports expanded by 12.6 per cent to RM3.1 billion. In the corresponding
period in 1995, Malaysia's trade deficit with Australia was RM1.2 billion.
  Malaysia's investments in Australia stood at A$1 billion last year,
making it the second largest Asean investor after Singapore. About 60 per
cent of Malaysian money in Australia was in the property sector, followed
by mineral exploration and development.
  Downer tells Malaysian Business, `Based on our figures, over 61 per cent
of Australia's trade is with countries of East Asia, while 2.6 per cent of
our total world trade was with Malaysia in 1995-1996. This is up from 2.4
per cent the previous financial year. Malaysia is now our 11th largest
trading partner overall.' (Also see next story)
  Elaborating, he says, `Trade has grown strongly particularly in the more
elaborately transformed manufactures, in both directions. They now make up
26 per cent of Australia's exports to Malaysia.
  `We anticipate further growth in our trade with Malaysia and we would
like that percentage share to grow. Nevertheless, we recognize that
Malaysia is a very competitive market place. Australian products and
services have to be both high  in quality and competitively priced. As the
Prime Minister John Howard says, we are well aware that merely living in
the Asian region does not ensure us an easy road. He noted there are many
pebbles washing up on the economic shores of Asia. We must work hard to
make ours the most attractive pebbles. We cannot be complacent.
  In an interview published in May, the Australian High Commissioner to
Malaysia, William Farmer, was quoted as saying Malaysia was Australia's
second largest market in Asean for services, especially in education and
tourism. Australian investments as at June 30, 1994 stood at A$2.5
billion.
  Farmer said new Australian investments focused more on capital and
technology-intensive activities. Australian investors were also moving
into the transport and distribution sectors, as well as software and
management systems.

Ahead of the times: Singapore Airlines upgrades fleet and service to stay
ahead of the pack

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 80

IF ONE HAD TO name the world's most successful airline marketing campaign,
chances are Singapore Airlines (SIA) would constantly come to mind. The
clever imagery of the Singapore Girl - attractive and unflappable, smiling
at every situation in every corner of the world - has been a winner for
the airline. So has the reputation for excellence that SIA has created for
itself over the years.
  But it takes more than just advertising and a good reputation to keep an
airline right up front these days. The modern fleet of the last decade may
today translate into planes that are behind the times in seating,
electronics and passenger gadgetry.
  Today's airline management not only has to look ahead at who they have
to beat, but constantly look over their shoulders to see who is catching
up fast. It's a juggling act, but one at which SIA's management is
masterful, doubly to be admired because the small island state really does
not have an overload of tourist attractions.
  And for a population as small as that of Singapore's to have an airline
that is one of the world's leaders is an achievement indeed. It
illustrates the value of lateral thinking and bold, forward planning with
which the name Singapore Airlines has become synonymous.
  Right from the outset, the management has set out to be an industry
pacesetter. In those days this airline had Asia's youngest fleet, and
concentrated on being the first in Asia to bring their passengers such
amenities as inflight faxes and telephones.
  And when it came to designing an airport that was just as innovative,
only the best was good enough for Singapore also. Changi was the world
leader, making headlines everywhere when it opened. The second stage of
Changi has been completed, and this is just as good as the first, with the
only justifiable complaint being that there are just not enough moving
walkways to cover the vast distances involved.
  Nevertheless, when it comes to style and efficiency, I would back Changi
against any large airport in the world. Although SIA does not actually own
Changi airport, the smart, modern facilities there are closely associated
with the airline in the passenger's mindset. The bottom line is that, over
the years, SIA has built an enviable reputation, made bumper profits, has
had the cashflow (and where this was not enough, the confidence of bankers
and the investment public) to purchase the latest new aircraft, resulting
in a very large number of brand-loyal SIA frequent flyers.
  Safety and service are other very important aspects when choosing an
airline, and it is a comfort to any air traveller to know that the airline
they choose has a reliable record. In this regard it's hard to find
another Asian airline as decorated as SIA when nominations come from both
airline industry magazines and passenger and travel organisations. Flight
operations and pilot training have been recognised by the US-based
Professional Pilot magazine with its 1994 Airline of the Year award. The
UK travel trade newspaper, Travel Weekly, gave SIA the Best Airline in
Asia award in its 1994 Travel Industry Globe Awards.
  Not only that, in the last eight years, SIA has been nominated seven
times by the prestigious Conde Nast Traveller Magazine Readers' Choice
award for Best Airline - the last award being in 1995.
  Last year proved to be a good year for SIA when, for the sixth year
running, it was awarded the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Travel
Award for Best Airline. It also won the top airline of business travellers
award for the second successive year in an Asia Money 1995 Business Travel
Poll.
  Continued efforts to maintain SIA's service excellence both on the
ground and inflight has consistently earned it international travel and
passenger awards. One of the most telling awards of its diligence in this
regard is the `20 Years of Excellence in International Service' award from
Air Transport World in 1994.
  Not content to rest on its laurels, SIA is presently upgrading its
fleet. The Airbus A340-300E, launched worldwide this April, was made
possible when SIA took delivery of two A340's, acknowledged as having the
quietest cabin in the sky. Another 15 A340's are on order as part of the
airline's commitment to operate one of the youngest and most modern fleets
of any major international airline.
  SIA's managing director Dr Cheon Choon Kong explains, `We rate the
aircraft highly in terms of economy, modernity and comfort. It is a star
performer in all categories. Inspired by this, we have decided to name our
A340-300E the "Celestar." We believe this aircraft will truly be a "star
of the skies."'
  The Celestar A340 will offer passengers more non-stop services and
point-to-point connections. Its long range and medium-density routes
include Jakarta, Bangkok, Melbourne and Sydney. Non-stop services to Paris
that began this month will demonstrate the long-range capability of this
new Airbus Industrie star.
  SIA has made the Celestar its own with some custom additions. Its state-
of-the-art inflight entertainment system, KrisWorld, is found in every
class. Passenger response has been enthusiastic, and it's easy to
understand why. There is a choice of 22 video channels in the KrisWorld
system, along with 12 audio channels, 10 Nintendo games and real-time text
news which is updated on an hourly basis, bringing general news, financial
and sports headlines.
  There is also destination information on 176 cities on SIA's route
network together with a personal in-seat telephone and fax service that
allow passengers to place calls or transmit faxes from anywhere in the sky
to virtually anywhere on the ground.
  Reading in an upright or reclined position is easy with the individual
multi-positioning reading lights. Seat pitch for First Class passengers
has been extended to a generous 74in, offering a real sense of space.
  Raffles Class and Economy Class passengers also have adjustable
headrests with foldable `ears' for further support. Electric leg-rests and
deflatable lumbar supports are offered in Raffles Class, while footrests
give Economy Class passengers improved comfort.
  The airline's Megatop 747s have been refitted, refining the already
luxurious `sleeper' seats in First Class and allowing them to attain a
greater recline and increased height of the leg-rest to almost horizontal.
  Raffles Class passengers enjoy an improved seat pitch of 47in in the
Megatop; the backrest drops back an extra 2in, while the forward-mounted
legrest can be operated by remote control.
  Keeping in touch with passengers' requirements is part of the secret
behind SIA's success. The Silver Kris lounge at Changi is renowned as the
largest and most luxuriously appointed airport lounge on the globe. Here,
the seating capacity for 550 offers an unbeatable range of business and
personal amenities for SIA's First and Raffles Class passengers. Other
Silver Kris lounges are gradually being upgraded worldwide to match the
one at Changi.
  Apart from the inflight KrisWorld advantages of phone calls from the
seat, there are many little touches that keep SIA customers coming back.
Ground staff are always on hand to bid farewell to First Class passengers
either at the boarding gate or in the cabin, and on journeys longer than
four hours, local newspapers are offered on arrival at their destinations.
  For SIA's frequent flyers, a Priority Passenger Service (PPS) guarantees
members access to at least an Economy seat on any flight, provided a
minimum of 24 hours' notice is given. Recently, enhancements to PPS
include extra benefits and a second tier of membership - PPS Solitaire -
for loyal members.
  Cuisine has also been a strong point on SIA which offers Asian dishes
and European cuisine, halal on Middle Eastern routes and by request on
others. It's a formula that works well. Wine lists give the passengers a
choice of excellent German, French and Australian wines. Cocktails,
aperitifs, spirits, liqueurs and beers are supplemented by tea, herbal
teas, decaffeinated tea or coffee, and a choice of liqueur coffees such as
Highland Coffee (with Scotch whisky and whipped cream), Cafe Royale (with
XO brandy) and Cafe Mandarin (with Cointreau, essence of squeezed orange
peel and a topping of whipped cream).
  Other SIA initiatives to take the hassle out of travelling include a
return check-in. This allows passengers travelling to regional
destinations and returning within 48 hours to be issued with boarding
passes for both the outbound and inbound sectors.
  Other check-in improvements include a fax check-in, and for passengers
travelling out of Singapore, there is a check-in facility at SIA's
downtown ticket offices. An automated combined ticket and boarding pass
used on the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur shuttle service has further reduced
check-in time.
  Another key to a good airline is to have a schedule that takes the
passenger, especially the business traveller, to the destination he wants,
with a frequency that will suit his itinerary. For this, SIA has built a
very impressive network covering 73 cities in 41 countries. In addition,
SIA's regional subsidiary, SilkAir, serves 20 Asian destinations in eight
countries.
  SIA acknowledges that until the end of this century, the Asia-Pacific
region will be the fastest expanding area for civil aviation. China is
emerging as a big-growth potential market and SIA currently flies to
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, and will progressively add more
cities as the need arises.
  Indo-China is also ripe for both tourist and business travel expansion,
and SilkAir and SIA service Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi daily, with
Vietianne and Pnomh Phenh covered by three services weekly.
  Japan, however, remains SIA's most important market with Tokyo, Osaka,
Nagoya, Fukuoka, Sendai and Hiroshima accounting for a total of 58 flights
weekly.
  The problem that SIA has is that the other regional carriers all seem to
make a fetish of aiming to overtake SIA in quality. The naming of Malaysia
Airlines as the region's best First Class service last year sent shock
waves through SIA's corridors. Hasty conferences explored how such a thing
could happen, and efforts were redoubled to win back this position.
  If SIA has a fault, it may be that some passengers feel that they are
being taken a little for granted. Automated telephone answering that makes
passengers talk to machines rather than to human operators irritate many,
and the cutting out of inflight amenity packs in Business Class has also
drawn criticism from passengers I have spoken to.
  But these are minor problems, and it's my bet that they will be quickly
and effectively addressed. SIA has always been a quick learner and is
unlikely to let any glitches arise that will lose it passengers. The
airline has always believed in increasing services rather than
discounting, and has consequently enjoyed the loyalty of the premium
frequent flyer clientele. We cannot imagine any situation which will cause
this to change.

More tools of investment: New measures to turn Malaysia into a complete
capital market

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 45

ONE SIGNIFICANT feature of the 1997 Budget is the government's bid to
further broaden and deepen the financial services sector in the country.
  Like never before, measures have been spelt out to make Malaysia a
sophisticated and complete financial market. At present, investors have
limited options. Most will put their money in the equities or futures
market, while the risk averse investor will probably leave it in fixed
deposits to earn interest.
  But thanks to Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri
Anwar Ibrahim, his latest Budget has paved the way for the setting up of a
string of investments tools. For starters, Anwar proposed the introduction
of the over-the-counter (OTC) market and a series of bonds to provide a
benchmark yield curve.
  The OTC market which is similar to the NASDAQ in the United States, is
generally for the quotation of shares of high-profile technology companies
which do not meet the requirements for listing on the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange's main or second board.
  To further promote the financial services sector, the minister also
allowed foreign broking firms to take equity of up to 49 per cent in
domestic brokerages.
  Local brokers can also undertake fund management and underwriting
activities, issue call warrants, manage listing of companies and undertake
electronic share transactions.
  Several economists interviewed by Malaysian Business feel that besides
adding more investment tools, these measures will set the basis for
Malaysia to be a complete capital market. MBf Securities economist Dr
Ghazali Atan says the measures will bring about more flexibility to the
capital market and more options for fund managers to spread the risk of
their portfolios.
  `The OTC market will basically be the KLSE's third board while the
benchmark for bonds enhances the creation of a liquid bond market. At the
same time it will also provide an index for bonds. At present, we have the
equities and derivatives markets. With the bond and OTC markets, there
will be more tools for investors and those who need to raise finance,' he
adds.
  Subsequent to the Budget announcement, the government announced that
Khazanah Holding, its investment arm, will issue a series of bonds to
serve as a benchmark.
  Arab-Malaysian Securities economist Mustafa Mohd Nor echoes the views of
Ghazali and says the measures will induce the creation of more
sophisticated tools of investment. `Without the proposed instruments,
Malaysia is not complete as a regional financial services centre. We have
to start somewhere to build up more capital market instruments,' he says.
  The importance the government places in expanding the capital market
does not come as a surprise considering that there was a significant
increase in funds raised by both the public and private sector from the
market during the first eight months of the year. According to the 1996/97
Economic Report, total funds raised by the public and private sectors
through the capital market increased significantly by 64.2 per cent to
RM20.4 billion compared to RM12.4 billion mobilised the corresponding
period last year.
  Net funds mobilised through the private debt securities market during
the period was RM10.1 billion, a significant increase compared to RM4.9
billion recorded in the corresponding period of 1995. (See table.)
  With the Budget paving the way for the development of a complete capital
market, the question which lingers on our minds is how and when will these
new instruments take off?
  Consider the fact that the Kuala Lumpur Options & Financal Futures
Exchange (KLOFFE) has yet to significantly take off since commencing
operations on Dec 15, last year. Mustafa feels time will tell whether or
not the new instruments for investments and raising capital will take off.
  `Even the present equities market took off only in the early 1990s.
KLOFFE may be slow but given time, it should take off. The main thing is
that we have a base to create more capital market instruments. The opening
up of local broking firms to foreign brokerages is a supporting factor to
develop the local capital market,' Mustafa says.
  Ghazali says the new tools will also likely to see private investors
depending less on banks as a mean for raising funds. `Companies will be
less bound towards banks. The OTC market will enable companies which need
funds to issue shares. These companies need not depend on banks solely for
finance,' he adds.
  Besides banks and financial institutions, merchant banks and fund
management companies also feel another competition coming their way
following measures introduced in the Budget. Anwar had announced the
expansion of the scope of the local brokerages.
  Currently, brokerages are only involved in the trading of shares. But
the Budget has proposed to allow them to manage the listing of companies,
undertake fund management and underwriting activities. The listings of new
companies and underwriting activities are now carried out by merchant
banks.
  Ghazali says the proposed measures are good as they would provide
merchant banks with competition. However, he dismissed any notion that
merchant banks will be adversely hit. He says with the OTC and private
companies allowed to issue bonds, the scope of the capital market will be
enlarged. `Basically the cake will be bigger and there are more players to
share it' he says.
  Moreover, an investment analyst feels merchant banks will not be
threatened as they (merchant banks) are established and provide supporting
services for companies seeking a listing like financing and underwriting.
`In the short-term, there is not much the brokerages can do. Firstly, it
is difficult to set up a corporate finance department while many of the
merchant banks have their steady base of clients. Also, many of the big
local brokerages come under banks or already have an interest in a
merchant bank,' he says.
  Citing the examples of Arab-Malaysian Securities or Rashid Hussain
Securities, the analyst points out that these brokerages already have an
interest in merchant banking activities.
  `Thus it serves no purpose for them to create unnecessary competition.
It merely provides an opportunity for the smaller brokerages without any
interest in merchant banks. But this will take time,' he says.

Way out of Ampang snarl: Prolintas starts work on twin-deck highway above
Klang River

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 38

`THERE ARE just too many people in Kuala Lumpur. New offices, new cars.
Who knows how many more in two or three years' time,' the cabbie muses.
`More buildings will add more cars to the roads. If only more people used
the bus and taxi ...'
  Public transportation may be one way around Kuala Lumpur's traffic woes.
But the latest attempt to ease the city of traffic congestion comes in the
form of an elevated highway. Called the Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway
(KLEH) project, it does not come cheap at about RM100 million per km!
  When completed in 1999, the KLEH will give city motorists extra motoring
space over the Klang River. It will be the main artery linking Kuala
Lumpur's eastern corridor (Jalan Jelatek, Jalan Datuk Keramat, Jalan
Ampang, Jalan Ampang Hilir) to the city centre (Jalan Sultan Ismail).
  Project Lintasan Kota Sdn Bhd (Prolintas) is the KLEH concessionaire.
Its general manager Abdullah Hassan says that among the plus points,
state-of-the-art KLEH is an environmentally sound option, emphasising the
importance of aesthetics. `I can't say whether or not the pillars will be
grey, but basically it will take into account its surroundings,' he says
with a chuckle.
  Part of the reason why the KLEH will be the most expensive highway is
the land factor. Construction is atop prime land in the city, most of
which (except for some private land), belongs to the Drainage and
Irrigation Department.
  The interchanges, as well as the beginning and end of the highway, will
be built over main land mass, not river banks. It is understood that not
all the required land has been acquired. Public relations officer Norhanim
Zakaria says, `We're still in the process of acquiring land for the
project.'
  Another costly factor, according to KLEH project manager Mohd Mazlan
Mohd Yusof, is technology. He says, `The bottom of the pillars are
designed in cut-edged shape so that when the water level rises during high
tide or flood, there is minimum resistance against the pillars, minimising
the back water effect. Their width at 14m is almost double the width of
pillars used for the Light Rail Transit (LRT).' Other costs include
relocating squatters and the diversion of water pipes and power cables
lining the length of the river.
  But in the end, the investment could be well worth it. Abdullah says,
`It will absorb traffic from Jalan Ampang, reduce bumper to bumper
bottlenecks and cut down travelling time to the central business district
by more than half.' Work on the KLEH is also said to be less damaging to
the environment.
  At present, 40,000 vehicles use Jalan Ampang daily. Studies show that it
takes 45 minutes to drive to or out of the city centre and even longer
during peak hours. Abdullah says,`If you build a flyover or expand the
road, two lanes have to be closed. The disruption to traffic and
businesses would be enormous.'
  One estimate by Percon, Permodalan Nasional Berhad's construction
subsidiary, is that the traffic volume in Jalan Ampang alone will increase
to 55,000 vehicles by the year 2005. In less than five years, the city's
population will increase from 1.6 million to 2.2 million. The rush is on
to complete the elevated highway.
  Abdullah says piling work has already begun on the RM700 million build,
operate and transfer (BOT) project starting at the 14-lane toll plaza in
Jalan Datuk Keramat. Phase 1 comprises twin decks with seven interchanges
beginning near Wisma Denmark, rising to Jalan Jelatek, then down to Jalan
Ampang. After Jalan Jelatek, the twin decks merge into one single wider
deck on a two-lane dual carriageway. Seven interchanges connect with
existing roads, the latter serving as secondary roads once the KLEH is
ready. The interchanges are at Jalan Sultan Ismail, KLCC, Jalan Tun Razak,
Jalan Jelatek, Jalan Ulu Kelang, Jalan Kerja Air Lama and Jalan Ampang.
  Phase 2 of KLEH comprises a single deck extension from Phase 1 in Jalan
Jelatek to Jalan Ampang, completing the whole twin-deck highway. Abdullah
says, `Work on Phase 2 will commence when traffic reaches 93,600 vehicles
a day or by the year 2013, even if traffic has not reached that volume by
then.'
  Six kilometres of the 7.4 km KLEH will be elevated - at its highest
point reaching up to 12 metres. Noise barriers will be erected near
schools, hospitals and other sensitive areas. Mazlan says the company is
considering see-through perspex buffers instead of using conventional
concrete panelling. The speed limit? Up to 80km/h on the twin deck and
65km/h where the decks merge into one.
  A consortium of three companies comprising main contractor Percon, sub-
contractors MMC Engineering Bhd and Leighton Holdings Bhd will construct
the elevated portion of KLEH.
  Prolintas, the KLEH concession holder, has a paid-up capital of RM10
million. It is 60 per cent owned by Permodalan Nasional Berhad with the
remaining shares held by Percon (formerly known as Pernas Construction).
  The maintenance job and toll concession has been awarded to Prolintas
for 33 years, starting from the time work commences. Abdullah expects the
company to break even in about 10 years after KLEH opens. `By then, we
should be able to repay our commercial creditors,' he adds.
  Another project source says that if about RM3 million in toll was
collected a month, the potential revenue could be RM36 million a year.
  The first highway to be built above a river boasts a few advantages over
conventional highways. Abdullah says, `It minimises disruption to traffic,
businesses and activities at the main road. As it will be built mostly on
government property, it minimises social problems related to land
acquisitions, especially in a heavily populated area as this.'
  Some squatter settlements will be relocated for the highway but the
numbers are small compared with other projects. Norhanim says about 95
affected squatter families in Federal Territory and another 56 in Selangor
will be relocated to longhouses in Kampung Air Lanjut, Setapak and Kampung
Wira Damai and Gombak.
  Says Abdullah, `The Klang river now flows along the central channel in
the middle. The highway's concrete pillars on both sides of the river
banks only affect water flow during flood or high tide. After the pillars
are built, work concentrates on the top, hence disruption to life below is
minimised. `The pillars' foundation will be layed by bored piling, a
screw-in technique which eliminates the hammering thunders of the
conventional method.
  Fears have been raised over the river's eco-system. Experts say that
without ultra violet rays, bacteria in the river would fester and
ultimately destroy its eco-system. But Mazlan assures that it is not a
problem. `The elevated twin decks will be separated 12m edge to edge to
allow direct sunlight to the river below.'
  Mazlan says, `I believe the end result will be pleasant. It is
environmentally sound and we are building an alternative access out of KL.
The project will straighten out meandering parts of the Klang River and
incorporate a masterplan to beautify it.
  `At present, there are bends in the river which are collection points
for rubbish and debris. Once these are straightened out, water flow will
become smoother.' Below KLEH, the Drainage and Irrigation Department will
build walkways with handrails for pedestrians and joggers.
  After 25 years of building roads, bridges and highways, Percon has
established its name as an infrastructure builder. It has completed RM1
billion worth of projects including the Istana Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, the
Seremban-Kuala Lumpur highway improvement project, two packages of the
North-South highway project, drainage and earthworks for Package 5 of the
KLIA at Sepang, the KL-PJ highway and the Gambang-Kuala Lepar Highway
(Kuala Lumpur to Kuantan). Its current projects include the Shah Alam-
Petaling Jaya expressway and the Malaysian Embassy building in Bangkok.
  The KLEH is a substantial investment for the future, for Percon and
motorists who use the highway. Abdullah says, `If this project proves to
be suitable, it will be a launching pad for us to export our expertise
overseas.'

Satellite parts from Zasna

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 4

ZASNA Technology Sdn Bhd, a company linked to Nepline Bhd executive
chairman Dr Nik Mohd Zain Omar, will become the first Bumiputera company
to manufacture hardware and components for satellite receiver systems.
  Industry sources tell Earwitness, Zasna will be teaming up with a German
company, Ge-tronic Seislinger Electronic. They also say that the joint-
venture will initially export the products to Ge-tronic in Germany, which
will in turn market the products worldwide.
  Ge-tronic is a well-known company which supplies satellite receiver
multiswitches and cable TV (CATV) amplifiers to original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) customers such as Philips and Nokia.
  The sources say the multi-million ringgit factory will be located in
Pengkalan Chepa, Kelantan. Nik has plans to eventually list Zasna on the
main board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).
  This is not Nik's first venture in Kelantan in his personal capacity. He
is also teaming up with several entrepreneurs to set up Kelantan's first
private hospital in Kota Bharu.

FOOD COMPANIES WITH A HEART SHOULD LOOK TO SOUTH ASIA

Despite the increased supply of food and an upturn in social
conditions, malnutrition remains a serious problem in South
Asia.
It also presents an opportunity for firms and nonprofit
organizations that want to focus their charitable food-
distribution efforts. The region includes Bhutan, Bangladesh,
India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka-Qwith a
population
of 1.22 billion people.

More than one-half the world's underweight children of
preschool
age are South Asian. With the region's population growing
faster
than its economy, food availability remains relatively low,
and
has not shown much improvement in recent years.

Problems include a lack of education of mothers as well as
poor
distribution systems. Officials say it is clear that
educating
women is one key to improving nutrition in the region. The
chart
above shows the number of girls who are enrolled in primary
school
for every 100 boys in the same age group.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in
the
1980s, the share of underfed in the region fell 6 percent.
South
Asia's per capita food energy supply grew from about 2,070
kilocalories daily in 1975 to almost 2,250 kilocalories in
1990.
But the region's 101 million underweight children are still
nearly
double the number in Sub-Saharan Africa. Malnutrition stunts
the
mental and physical growth of one-third of children in the
region,
says the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

A large proportion of this is caused by deficiencies of
Vitamin A,
iodine, and iron. Nearly one-half the children in the group
aged 6
to 11 in Bangladesh and almost one-third in the tiny
Himalayan
kingdom of Bhutan, are afflicted with goiter caused by iodine
deficiency, which retards brain development.

United Nations officials are puzzled by the persistence of
high
levels of malnutrition in the region.

"We in UNICEF believe there must be something wrong with the
strategies being used," says regional chief Urban Jonsson. He
points out that South Asian governments are the largest
spenders
on nutrition, but with little effect.

There is, however, some good news from nongovernmental,
community-
based programs.

SUCCESS STORIES
In Bangladesh, severe protein malnutrition dropped 14 percent
between 1985 and 1994 in areas covered by locally run
schemes.
Similar initiatives in India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka
have
slashed nutritional deficiencies dramatically. About 20
community-
based projects have been singled out as successful by the
UNICEF
South Asia office, which suggests that governments can learn
from
these success stories.

South Asia can also learn from Thailand, which UNICEF cites
as the
best example of a nation that improved national nutrition
policies
and strategies on the basis of the experience of community
projects.

Political commitment at all levels, a high level of literacy,
especially among women, community organization and
involvement,
and the infrastructure that can deliver basic services were
among
the key factors for the success of nutrition strategies
identified
at a regional meeting.

"Long term nutrition improvements in the region are strongly
associated with female educational levels. Research in
Pakistan
has shown that the likelihood of having an underweight child
in
the household where the mother has no education is three
times
that of the household where the mother has primary
education,"
says a paper presented at a regional meeting on National
Plans of
Action for Nutrition.

The trend of female enrollment at secondary level is upwards,
from
24 percent in 1975 to 35 percent in 1990, but the region's
progress in educating females is still too slow to make a
dent in
malnutrition.

JAPANESE CONTINUE TRADITION OF GIFT GIVING

The high value of the yen is opening up the vast Japanese
gifts
market to foreign suppliers. Japanese people give each other
YEN10
trillion (US$96 billion) in gifts each year. While the
corporate
gifts market has shrunk in this tough business time, personal
gift
giving is thriving and was worth YEN7.7 trillion (US$74
billion)
in 1994.

A report from the Hong Kong Trade Development Council says
that
Japanese consumers' tastes are increasingly diversified, and
their
sales of imported gift products should increase. The greatest
personal gift givers are Japanese women in their 20s and 30s.
They
tend to favor inexpensive, fashionable items such as
handkerchiefs, pouches, well-designed jewelry, and
accessories.

Gift-giving is well ingrained in Japan's culture. Apart from
set
events such as religious ceremonies or weddings, birthdays or
the
birth of a baby, presents are given to neighbors, relatives,
and
acquaintances. Young people give gifts to friends and
coworkers to
express feelings of gratitude, happiness, or sometimes
sadness.

For the business gift, popular items used by companies for
promotions or incentives include electronics (calculators,
watches) small electrical appliances, kitchenware, interior
items
such as CD racks, travel bags, stationery, knitted goods,
flashlights, pocket cameras, and lighters.

ASIAN MEN MAY BE THE NEXT BIG SKIN-CARE MARKET

As Asia's population ages, it is possible to cash in on a
number
of new trends in skin care, according to reports in Asian
Retailer. Postwar baby boomers in Asia are beginning to see
signs
of wear and tear in the mirror. Couple this with greater
affluence, and the breakdown of social taboos that have
prevented
men from buying cosmetic products and new opportunities
emerge.

The magazine reports that high-class cosmetics houses are
riding
high on a boom in antiaging creams and potions, and already
lower-
priced versions of these lines are hitting the supermarket
toiletry departments. It says that the Watson pharmaceutical
store
chain of Hong Kong finds that antiaging merchandise is
becoming
important in its product line.

Among the skin-care buying customers is an increasing number
of
men. While few products are targeted directly to Asian men,
there
are indications that men are buying women's products,
especially
those with little or no fragrance.

Other items that are growing in demand are blood pressure
monitors, anti-cholesterol remedies, vitamins, and health
food
supplements.

TIME PAYMENTS INCREASE BUYING POWER IN HO CHI MINH CITY

Sales of imported goods in Ho Chi Minh City have jumped with
the
reintroduction of time payments, but they are not for
everyone,
according to Vietnam Investment Review. The fortnightly
business
newspaper, which is published in Vietnamese and English,
reports
that more than 100 shops in the commercial capital of
southern
Vietnam now offer credit on everything from a new Honda to
the
latest personal computer equipment. Relatively strict
conditions
apply: some stores provide credit to state employees only,
while
at others the customer must have a certificate from his or
her
employer guaranteeing repayments will be deducted from wages.

With time payments, demand for computers has increased by 150
percent as higher-income Vietnamese use the new payment
schemes.
There is tough competition among about 100 computer stores in
Ho
Chi Minh City, and other marketing devices include special
offers
for students and for new businesses.

Not everyone is happy. Domestic manufacturers complain that
sales
of their generally less-expensive models are dropping as
consumers
use credit to afford more-expensive, usually imported, items.

JAPANESE TAKE THEIR COLD REMEDIES SERIOUSLY

Getting to school and work every day is an obsession with the
Japanese, no matter how ill they feel. That may be one reason
that
the Japanese spend $5 per capita every year soothing the
common
cold, the most spent by any of the world's six largest
markets for
cough and cold remedies. Cold remedies represent 11 percent
of the
Japanese market for the entire sector.

While the Japanese focus on colds, residents of the United
States
spend about the same amount per capita ($5.50) for cough
remedies,
according to MarketLine International.

MarketLine analysts say that the market for over-the-counter
(OTC)
remedies can be expected to grow as Japan joins other
developed
countries in trying to cut back on healthcare expenditures
and
instilling a sense of personal responsibility in consumers.

While many U.S. and European companies are entering the
Japanese
OTC market, Taisho Pharmaceutical company, which is
practically
unknown outside the Japanese market, continues to hold a
strong
position.

ROOM FOR GROWTH IN INSURANCE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION

The Pacific Rim, which in 1993 had insurance premiums of
about
$375.8 billion, has the greatest potential for insurance
market
growth of all regions in the world, according to a new report
on
insurance in emerging markets, published by Datamonitor
International.

China alone represents about one-quarter of the world's
population
but ranks 25th in terms of premium income. Its premium growth
rate
is about 30 percent a year and it currently has a per capita
premium income of just $3, compared with per capita premiums
of
about $473 in Taiwan. China is typical of the markets in the
region that combine high premium income growth with very low
insurance penetration.

The combination has started to tempt multinational insurers
who
realize that a rapidly growing, but immature market adds up
to
untapped opportunity.

Other countries with high market potential, such as India and
the
Philippines, have really not started to grow yet. India will
shortly privatize its entire insurance industry, which should
create competition-based growth that will start to release
the
market's potential.

Currently, Japan's insurance industry dwarfs its Pacific Rim
neighbors. It is now the second-largest insurance industry in
the
world. Insurance companies have successfully adapted western
methods to suit the Japanese taste for investment. Even car
insurance often has a built-in investment element.

Japan's insurance industry registered an increase of 1.4
percent
between 1992 and 1993, compared with South Korea's growth in
the
same time period of 8.5 percent. Between 1991 and 1992, South
Korea's insurance industry grew even faster at 18 percent.

According to data from the Japan Institute of Life Insurance,
annuity policies in Japan have grown as worries about the
National
Pension Fund have grown. In 1994, 95 percent of Japanese
households had life insurance. Annuity policies have been
especially popular among the young who are worrying about
their
eventual retirement. Among all households, ownership of
annuities
rose 7.6 percentage points between 1991 and 1994, while they
rose
from 9 percent to 24.6 percent among people under age 30.

New life insurance products for women have contributed to the
growth in Japan and women may also be prime targets for
insurance
in emerging markets as more women become contributors to
household
incomes.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE BECOMES A FLASH POINT IN NEW ZEALAND

There may be a market for teaching would-be New Zealand
immigrants
in English.

New Zealand wants to be seen as part of Asia, but it is
scaring
away Asian migrants with a compulsory English-language test,
and
immigrants are risking a more-than-$13,000 bond if they don't
learn English quickly enough.

Asian New Zealanders are unhappy with Wellington's
introduction in
1995 of an English proficiency test for would-be immigrants
which
they feel is targeted mainly at Asians.

Asian migration to New Zealand has increased rapidly in
recent
years. Migrants from North and Southeast Asia comprised
24,000 of
the 50,000 residence visas granted in the past year.

Foreigners who want to migrate to New Zealand must pay a
deposit
that will be lost if they fail to pass the English-language
proficiency exam within a year. They must also pay a $160 fee
for
their residence visas.

Learning English is not a completely academic exercise
because how
you speak English may affect your acceptance in New Zealand.
Uma
Shakti Ba, a student services development officer at Auckland
University says the way immigrants speak English largely
determines how they are treated in New Zealand. "Your accent
plays
a role in how people judge your English ability here. However
well
educated you may be in English, if you have an accent it is
seen
as incorrect. If it is not the English they wish to hear, you
will
be judged as incompetent," she told Inter Press Service.  "I
see
it happen here every day."

Government officials admit that the new language test may
dampen
immigration from some Asian countries, but they say it will
also
affect immigration from non-English-speaking European
countries.

Soo Lee Lim, director of the Auckland Chinese Radio AM 1476,
agrees that many New Zealanders are opposed to Asian
migration,
but she says there is a stronger view that New Zealand should
not
be overpopulated. "On the whole, the Kiwis are broad-minded
people. That's my experience," added Lim who migrated from
Hong
Kong five years ago.

There is, however, a strong feeling within the Asian
community
that New Zealanders should be thankful to Asians and
especially to
Asian money which helped pull New Zealand out of recession.
Asian
investments in New Zealand and the country's exports to Asia
have
risen dramatically since 1991. One-third of the country's
tourists-Qa major foreign exchange earnerQ-come from Asia.
Brunei
invested more than $20 million, for example, in 1993.
Business
experts say they have never seen this kind of wealth coming
into
the country before.

But Lim says small business migrants from Asia find it hard
to
make money here because most local products like fruits and
meats
are controlled by monopolies. "It's not easy for foreigners
to
break into this system," she said. "When we come here we have
to
start from scratch."

She says they would have made more money had they remained in
Hong
Kong. Most business migrants coming here are not from the
very
rich segment, but from the upper middle class. Typically they
are
in their 40s, and they are seeking a quiet life and a less-
pressured school environment for their children.

Migrants from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Malaysia are mostly
newly
rich who tend to show their wealth by dressing well, driving
sleek
cars, and buying big houses. "It attracts some jealousy from
the
local people," Lim said.

New Zealanders have been complaining that Asian business
immigrants are not creating jobs for locals, preferring to
run
small family businesses. "After the past four years, I think
they
are quite disappointed with us," says Lim, and business
monopolies
and communication barriers don't help either.

"Given 10 to 20 years, after we are familiar with the system
and
the customs, I'm sure we'll be able to contribute to this
country," she adds.

GOING OVERSEAS?  HERE'S AN EXCELLENT BUSINESS REFERENCE...

Whether you are hiring native employees, relocating employees
to
another country or trying to get yourself ready for a stint
overseas, a good cultural and business reference book is
invaluable.

Craighead's International Business, Travel and Relocation
Guide to
78 Countries,1996-97 includes a general introduction to each
country, an economic and political overview, sections on
doing
business in the country, money, banking and taxes,
communications
and media, living in the country, health and safety,
preparing for
a trip, arriving and getting around, lodging, dining and
nightlife, leisure activities, and suggested additional
reading.

The three-volume set is useful because the country reports,
though
designed for the business person, also take into
consideration the
family. In the "doing business" chapter, for example, there
are
sections on work ethics, employment conditions, power
structure
and hierarchy, business networking and business services. For
most
countries, there is a commentary especially addressing the
concerns of business women.

For personal consideration, such issues as taxes, housing,
household help, importing pets, and driving conditions and
owning
a car are covered. The guide lists restaurants, cafes,
museums,
and other places that you might wish to take a colleague if
it is
up to you to make the social arrangements.

We were especially happy to see references that we do not see
elsewhere such as information on faith healers in the
Philippines
or the importance of remittances to the economy of that
country.
Again in the report on the Philippines, readers are warned
not to
rent a house or apartment that doesn't already  have a
working
phone line installed. The reason is that installation of a
telephone may take six weeks to six months or longer. You
will
also learn that corporations often use messengers for local
communications because telephone service is so unreliable.

COMMUNIST CHINESE COMBINE HISTORY WITH CAPITALISM

Hoping to capitalize on a domestic audience of well over 1
billion
people, a group of old Chinese revolutionaries is planning a
theme
park to celebrate one of the seminal events of China's
Communist
history.

Known as the "Long March Park of the Red Army" and located on
a
240-acre site in a southwestern Beijing suburb, the park
would
commemorate the trek 60 years ago in which the beleaguered
Communist forces sought to escape annihilation by the
nationalist
government of General Chiang Kai-Shek.

Theme parks are not new to China. Yunnan province in southern
China is home to a multimillion dollar park reflecting
Chinese
society, particularly its varied ethnic minorities, while a
Chinese version of Disneyland, to be funded by overseas
investors,
is reportedly under discussion.

In 1934, besieged Chinese communists led by Mao Zedung broke
a
blockade by the Kuomintang (KMT) nationalist party and
embarked on
a year-long, 6,000-mile escape that became known as the Long
March. Many of the 80,000 men died as they traveled over the
uncompromising terrain. It has gone down as a heroic saga in
Chinese Communist history.

In order to draw crowds and better depict the historical
event,
organizers are seeking to use all the latest technological
and
special effects normally associated with Western-style theme
parks.

The park will include sound and lighting effects, a simulated
firing range, a space observatory, movie theaters, ferris
wheels
and merry-go-rounds, cable cars, and rides on army tanks and
armored personnel carriers, and it would even include China's
first bungee-jumping tower.

"We want to show the Long March events and recreate them to a
scale for the general public," said Liu Chengan, a Communist
Party
official involved in the planning, adding that the park will
have
other attractions in order to draw the crowds.

Tourist developments
With social freedom and money to travel, a growing number of
China's 1.2 billion people are making pilgrimages to
rediscover
the country's revolutionary past. To cash in on the travel
rush,
government officials are converting revolutionary bases into
tourist meccas.

In Hunan province, for example, restaurants and hotels
appeared
to accommodate the tourist influx that accompanied the
celebration
of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Party
chairman
Mao Zedong. The main drawing card was Shaoshan, Zedong's
hometown.

In November, China Daily, the official English-language
newspaper,
reported another tourist development in the Jinggang
Mountains on
the border of Hunan and Jianqxi provinces, where Mao and
other
Communist revolutionaries first launched their peasant
uprising
against the Chinese nationalists.

Although such initiatives would have shocked Chinese
officials 20
years ago, no one in today's China is bothered by the idea of
Communism's historic past being a selling point for today's
businessmen.

Planners say that today's young people are so ill-informed
about
and uninterested in recent history that it would be a waste
of
time to try to teach them without the Western-style
packaging.
They say they must combine amusement with education.

Getting funding for the $20 million Long March Park is
proving
difficult.  Planners are unlikely to seek foreign investment
because that would be embarrassing to the government, which
has
not yet confirmed monetary commitment to the park. Planners
had
hoped to break ground in 1995, but have not because of a lack
of
funding.

Organizers also have logistical problems to iron out. Local
officials project that as many as 10,000 visitors a day would
come
to the park even with a $5 entrance fee. But they apparently
don't
know how they would move all those people around the hilly
terrain
and winding roads.

TIANJIN IS AN UNDERDEVELOPED CITY WITH IMMENSE PROMISE

A walk along the Haihe River in downtown Tianjin City is a
surprisingly peaceful affair, especially for China. A few
motorcycles and cars (mostly taxis) cruise the riverside
road, but
overall, the impression is of a sleepy town, not one of
China's
second most important industrial center and container port.

Tianjin is the least known of the three urban centersQ-the
others
are Beijing and Shanghai-Qthat are under direct control of
the
national government. Located 90 miles southeast of Beijing,
Tianjin is often overshadowed by its more important neighbor.
Nevertheless, it has gained a reputation as one of China's
best-
run cities and has become a favorite of several major Western
and
Japanese manufacturers. But Tainjin's development has been
much
quieter than that of splashy Shanghai or powerful Beijing.

This is a conservative city, but one whose foundation and
strategies for the future give it a substance unusual in
free-
flowing, fast-growing urban China.

Tianjin has a population of more than 8.8 million. More than
two-
thirds (5.8 million in 1993) of the population lives in the
city
center and its suburbs. The United Nations estimates the
population of the urban agglomeration at 10.4 million in
1994,
with a projected growth to 17 million by 2015. It ranks 14th
among
the world's largest urban agglomerations.

The city center has a unique flavor, mixing a variety of 19th
century European architecture styles, highlighting its
history as
a treaty port, similar to, yet very different from,
Shanghai.
Shanghai was only a small fishing village until the arrival
of
Westerners. Tianjin has a long history as an important
trading
center in China, in no small part due to its location so
close to
Beijing, yet with easy access to both inland and port
navigation
routes.

The municipality encompasses 11,305 sq. km. and includes five
rural counties in addition to urban center and suburbs.  It
is
China's third-largest city and a major hub with some of the
best
transportation links in the country. It is also a pleasant
city,
with more than one hundred parks, both large and small.

Per capita living space is small at 6.9 sq. m. The city
endured a
highly destructive earthquake in 1976 (in Tangshan) that
closed it
for a couple of years and forced the reconstruction of a
substantial amount of its housing. All households have
running
water, but hot water availability is small. Use of household
gas
is high, 89 percent in 1993, compared with 86 percent in
Beijing.

The municipality's economy is one of China's largest, with a
Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) of 53 billion yuan in 1993.  The
economy is
centered on automobiles, electronics, and chemicals. The city
has
one of China's largest automobile manufacturing industries,
built
in conjunction with Japanese automakers, and has been on the
cutting edge of telecommunications production under the
leadership
of companies such as Motorola.

Tianjin was one of the first cities to set up a Foreign
Investment
Office and a Foreign Services Center. This city is expected
to
emerge as an "export center," although until the last few
years,
imports exceeded exports. Nevertheless, with the high-quality
leadership of its former mayor, Li Ruihuan, the city began to
develop its status as a forward-thinking, yet conservative,
economic center.

Growth has been consistent and not insubstantial, and Tianjin
has
become a favorite of foreign investors. However, the city
still
possesses a surprisingly underdeveloped consumer market.

Tianjin Consumers
Tianjin's residents' quality of life lags somewhat behind
that of
residents in China's other major coastal cities (Beijing,
Shanghai, and Guangzhou). Per capita GDP in 1993 was 6,075
yuan,
70 percent of Beijing's and only one-half that of Shanghai
and
Guangzhou. Overall, however, the standard of living is higher
than
in the nation as a whole, with residents consuming 42 percent
more
than the national average.

Consumption patterns
Expenditures on all major categories of goods have increased
substantially since 1990. Expenditures on food increased 51
percent from 1990 to 1993. Even more importantly, the desire
for
diversity, edibility, and convenience has been growing among
Tianjin's consumers.

Food consumption represents over 54 percent of all living
expenditures, a larger share than in the nation as a whole.
Tianjin is a meat-eating city, with larger-han-average
consumption of beef and lamb which, to a degree, reflects the
eating traditions of the region. As a proportion of total
expenditures, sugar consumption is less than in Shanghai and
Beijing, but more is spent on other flavorings.

Vegetable consumption has not increased substantially in the
last
several years, but according to a 1991 consumer survey, the
supply
and variety of vegetables have increased.  Tianjin has been
an
active participant in the "vegetable basket" project,
designed to
provide ample supplies of food, especially vegetables, for
urban
dwellers.

The 1991 consumer survey also suggested that 61 percent of
Tianjin's residents are concerned with nutritional values.
Only 11
percent, however, were interested in specialty products,
brand
names, and delicacies. Current figures for these items are no
doubt significantly higher, as imports and processed foods
have
become increasingly available. Now the supermarket sections
of
department stores are filled with a variety of Chinese and
Western
snacks and sweets, and these store sections are jammed with
customers.

Western retailing in the city has lagged significantly behind
foreign investment in the city.  The main shopping streets of
Tianjin are narrow and filled with a variety of small shops,
restaurants, ice cream stores, and only one major modern
department store. Although situated just a few blocks from
the
quiet riverfront, these streets are busy. The ambiance is
more
traditional here than in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
With
few high-profile non-Chinese retailers, the retail district
reflects the traditional preference for localizing individual
product lines along streets. Thus, off the main shopping
street,
one can find the flower street, the wedding street, and most
importantly, several centers for textiles.

Tianjin remains an important textile center, and 18 percent
of
total retail purchases were for clothing in 1993.  Not
surprisingly, Tianjiners prefer conservative styles. Clothes
tend
to be modern, tailored, yet comfortable. Fashion trends do
not
drive clothing purchases in the way they do in Shanghai or
Guangzhou, but quality is important.

Consumers in Tianjin are often considered by market
researchers
and retailers as a subset of the Beijing market, in spite of
its
own long consumer tradition, dating back to its years as a
treaty
port.  It is large enough, and important enough, to be
considered
in its own right.

A LIFESTYLE ENTERPRISE
The first, and still only, non-Chinese department store was
opened
by Isetan (a Japanese retailer) in 1993.  Isetan Tianjin
adjusted
its product lines and price points to accommodate the lower
incomes and preferences of local residents.

Located next to the main train station across the river from
downtown, yet within walking distance of the city center,
this
store has not been constricted by the narrow streets and
limited
retail space on the other side of the river.  It is thus able
to
carry a wider range of goods in various price ranges. Isetan
still
caters primarily, though not exclusively, to high-middle-
income
earners. Nevertheless with its location, size, and diversity,
this
store has become what the company describes as a "lifestyle
enterprise" for Tianjin.

Ownership of major consumer durables compares favorably with
both
Beijing and Shanghai. In 1993, for every 100 households,
there
were 77 sewing machines, 89 refrigerators, and 43 stereo
recorders. Ownership of other consumer goods, such as VCRs,
stereo
systems, and computer games was less, but still substantial,
and
conforms to the phases of distribution in household income
defined
in the consumer survey. Household electrical appliances and
durable goods were the first phase, gold jewelry and
cosmetics
were the second phase, and interior decorating materials and
small
household appliances were the third phase.

Consumerism may not have overwhelmed this city quite yet, but
its
components are clearly expanding. Television ownership is at
almost 100 percent of households, and the shrinking of book
and
magazine readership reflects trends underway nationally.
According
to one estimate, one favorite television program in Tianjin,
aired
during the lunch hour, is watched by almost three-quarters of
the
residents.

Similarly, in the last two to three years, expanding
telecommunications has become a central goal of the city,
aided in
no small part by investments of telecommunications giants
such as
Motorola and GE. In 1994, 18 percent of urban residents had a
telephone, and more than one-quarter of households had
installed
phones. During that year the number of lines more than
doubled to
1.1 million. Cellular phones and pagers are becoming
increasingly
important.

Nevertheless, the relatively slow growth of Tianjin's economy
has
both held down the proliferation of high-income earners and
inhibited the consumer explosion seen in the last few years
in
Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou.

However, several economic, political, and demographic
characteristics favor the future of this northeast city and
bode
well for the continued development of its consumer market.

Location and Transportation
Tianjin is on the main Beijing-Shenyang and Beijing-Shanghai
rail
lines and just two hours by train from the capital city.
Travel
between the two cities became even easier in the last three
years
with the opening of the Beijing-Tianjin expressway.

It is Tainjin's port, though, that is the centerpiece of this
city's past and current economic development. The original
port
was on the Haihe River in Tianjin city. Heavy silting forced
it to
be moved 40 miles downstream to Tanggu on the Bo Hai Sea
prior to
World War II. This port, which lies within the municipality's
boundaries, was expanded in 1976 into a major container port.

The Tanggu port had 68 cargo berths in 1993,  of which 37 are
10,000-ton class deep-water channels. In addition, special
berths
for coal, petroleum and ore are currently being built.
Freight
volume has grown at a rate of more than 20 percent annually
in
recent years.

The basic passenger transportation infrastructure within the
city
is only now speeding up.  A short (7.4 km) and simple (trains
ride
on one track) system was built in 1982, and is currently
being
expanded.  The first phase of the upgrade began in 1995.
During
the second phase, the system will be expanded by construction
of
another 4.16 km of subway and 5.17 km of elevated railway.
Due to
be completed by 1999, this is only the first part of the
city's
plan to build a railway network totalling 170 km.

Economic Development
Since 1993, the pace of change in the city has increased.
Now it
is part of what has been described as the "third wave" of
Chinese
development. The first wave included Guangzhou in southern
China,
the second was Shanghai, and the third includes Beijing,
Tianjin,
and the provinces along the Bo Hai [Sea] Rim of northeast
China.
In 1992, the state had announced that Tianjin was to be
developed
as the socialist Hong Kong of North China. The planned
development
included expanding an already existing New Economic and
Technical
Economic Development Zone (TEDA) centered on the port in
Tanggu,
expanding Tianjin's city center into a financial center, and
developing a free trade zone within Tianjin in the next
decade.

TEDA, located in Tanggu, forty miles from the center of
Tianjin,
was cited in a series of economic reports of China's special
economic zones as the best-managed zone in the country. It
encompasses 33 sq. kilometers and has a population of
slightly
more than 227,000. Transportation between the city center and
TEDA
improved substantially with the extension of the Beijing-
Tianjin
Expressway into the zone in 1993, but construction of a
dedicated
road is still a year or so in the future. The zone, which
began
with only 12 joint venture enterprises, has grown
significantly.
By the end of September, 1994, more than 1,400 enterprises
had
located in the zone, with an output value of 100 million
yuan.
The zone has become a favorite of foreign manufacturers, who
find
its investment climate easier to manage than that of Beijing,
Shanghai or Guangzhou.

Names of companies that have invested in the New Tech Zone
read
like a who's who of international businessQcompanies such as
Otis
Elevators, Motorola, Mobil Petroleum, Coca-Cola, IBM, and
AT&T.
TEDA has clearly benefited from the quality of its
administration
and organization.

TEDA administers all aspects of the zone from a single office
with
employees drawn from universities rather than the typically
more
entrenched city authorities. Corruption, rampant in Shanghai
and
Guangzhou, is rare here.

Regulation of the zone has been designed to facilitate
investment.
Land costs have been held to less than one-half those of
Shanghai.
The power supply is consistent, and the government has set up
its
own training facilities as well as made several other
accommodations for zone investors.

Binhai Free Trade Zone and the Tianjin Financial Center
The Binhai free trade zone and the Tianjin financial center
are
designed to reinforce the overall attractiveness to foreign
investors of this city as well as to create a comprehensive
economic center. Binhai Economic Region consists of 2,270 sq.
km.
in the eastern part of Tianjin city. It has a population of
almost
one million residents, of which two-thirds are
"nonagricultural."
Significant investment has been made in this zone in an
effort to
improve its water and power supply, and several other
infrastructure developments are currently underway.

Similarly, plans are underway to create a financial center in
downtown Tianjin.  This center, covering 85,000 sq. meters is
being built with both domestic and foreign funds and is
intended
to become the major cog in a network of foreign and domestic
banking.

Prospects for the Future
Tianjin's potential for growth is substantial.  In addition
to its
strong industrial base, city residents are well-educated, and
it
is home to one of China's premier universities. Its 11.7
percent
illiteracy rate in 1990 was second only to that of Beijing
(11
percent).  Labor mobility is comparatively high, and the
labor
force is well-educated.

In addition, the leadership of Tianjin is sophisticated,
concerned
with both fiscal stability and creating a positive and
flexible
environment for investment.  Combined with a strong
infrastructure, both social and economic, this bodes well for
the
future.

The potential of this city is not going unnoticed in China,
particularly in Beijing. Lower real estate prices (less than
one-
third that of Beijing) have driven some of Beijing's newly
wealthy
residents to purchase homes in the municipality.

Nevertheless, there is a shortage of high-quality office and
living space for foreign investors. However, Tianjin's real-
estate
market has not exploded, unlike the overheated markets of
Beijing,
Shanghai, and Guangzhou, where overbuilding has distorted the
local office-space market.

With the city's solid foundation, excellent transportation,
and
high-quality infrastructure, the future looks bright for
Tianjin.
However, development in this city will likely be without
massive
investment from the central government. Beijing has, instead,
staked its future on the growth of Shanghai and the Yangtse
River
Delta.

Funding growth will have to come from creative planning by
municipal authorities.  Many of these authorities have been
discouraged because they expected that creating a high
quality
economic environment would automatically generate growth.  As
Tianjin's reputation grows, investment will likely increase.
But
in the meantime, Tianjin will remain an important, although
underdeveloped, urban center.

STUDY SHOWS WEALTH MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN ATTITUDES TOWARD
RELIGION

With the exception of the poorest groups, socioeconomic status
seems to make little difference in how Europeans view the
importance of God in their lives.

A Eurobarometer study among a representative sample of the
population in the 12 countries that were members of the European
Union at the end of 1994 finds that among groups A through E1,
about one-third of respondents say God is important to them. An
equal share say God is not important in their lives. The rest are
somewhere in between.

As we have seen in earlier polls, God seems more important in the
lives of women over age 55 who are less well educated and poorer
than the rest of the population.

Among respondents whose education ended before they were age 16,
48 percent say God is very important in their lives. Among
respondents in the E3--the poorest--socioeconomic group, 56
percent say God is very important in their lives. The younger the
age group, the less likely they are to say that God is important
in their lives.

Catholicism prevails
Roman Catholicism, various Protestant religions, and Greek
Orthodox are still the main religions in Europe among those who
say they "belong" to a religion. Fundamental Muslims constitute
less than 1 percent of the total population.

In France, the United Kingdom, and Luxembourg one percent of
respondents say they belong to the Muslim religion; in the other
nine countries that were part of the European Union at the end of
1994, fewer than one percent make that claim.

One-half of those polled say they belong to the Roman Catholic
religion, with the highest shares in Portugal and Ireland (91
percent), Luxembourg (89 percent), Italy (88 percent), Spain (79
percent), Belgium (67 percent), and France (63 percent).

Nineteen percent of respondents say they belong to a Protestant
religion, with the highest rates in Denmark (72 percent), and the
United Kingdom (44 percent).

The least religious countries are The Netherlands and the eastern
part of Germany. Forty-eight percent of the Dutch say they belong
to no religion, and 69 percent of those living in east Germany
give that response. There is an even split among Catholics and
Protestants in the western part of Germany, with 40 percent saying
they are Catholic and 43 percent saying they are Protestant.
Thirteen percent do not claim a religion.

Greece is the one country which claims a religion not shared by
many others. Ninety-eight percent of respondents say they are
Greek Orthodox. Seven percent of respondents in the Netherlands
also claim that religion.

Does "belonging" mean
being "religious"?
In some countries, there is a strong correlation between belonging
to a particular religion and "seeing oneself as religious."  These
are probably the countries where religion has the most influence
over behavior.

More than 80 percent of respondents in Greece, Italy, and Portugal
say they are religious, compared with 59 percent of respondents in
the 12 countries surveyed. The highest share of those who say they
are religious is in Greece (93 percent).

In the Netherlands, where 48 percent of respondents claim no
religion, 50 percent of respondents say they see themselves are
"religious."

Atheism is highest in France, where 19 percent of respondents say
they are  atheists. Despite the fact that 63 percent of the French
say they belong to the Roman Catholic Church, only 46 percent say
they are religious.

Except for Ireland and Italy, where 12 and 7 percent of
respondents, respectively, say they attend religious services
several times a week, overall about 4 percent of Europeans say
they attend religious services several times a week.

Twenty-two percent overall say they attend once a week, with 64
percent of Irish and 35 percent of Italians saying they attend
services once a week. A recent poll by Gallup found that 42
percent of U.S. respondents said they attended services in the
previous seven days.

Thirteen percent of Europeans overall say they never attend
religious services, with the highest shares in France (21
percent), Belgium (17 percent), and the UK (16 percent.) Fully 15
percent of respondents in Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands
say they never attend religious services.

Despite the fact that 30 percent of eastern Germans say they are
atheist and 33 percent say they are nonreligious, only 9 percent
say they never attend religious services.

CZECHS ARE EUROPE'S CHAMPION BEER DRINKERS

If they gave out gold medals for beer consumption, the Czechs
would win.

In 1994, Czech breweries produced 38.34 million hectoliters of
beer. In the last quarter of 1995, production was running about 1
to 1.5 percent behind production in 1994. The 1995 estimated
annual per capita domestic consumption was 160 liters per person,
ahead of the Germans. In 1994, it was 161 liters per person.

The president of the Czech Association of Breweries, Antonin
Kratochvile, believes that the reasons for the decline in sales
this year were a cooler summer, Slovak government barriers against
the sale of Czech beer, as well as some decline in exports to the
former allies in East and Central Europe. He does not foresee
major changes in the near future and thinks that in the next three
years, domestic beer consumption should remain stable. This means
that growth in beer production and profits will depend on exports.
Kratochvile sees the most promising export potential to the
countries of East and Central Europe as well as to Russia.

In 1995, the Czech beer exports did well in the German, United
Kingdom, and U.S. markets; exports to Russia also grew.  The total
beer exports reached 1.8 million hectoliters. Foreign producers
have made little impact in the Czech market, capturing less than
one-tenth of one percent so far. This apparently has little do to
with prices. The Austrian brewery, Zwettel, offers its beer at the
price of the Czech premium beer, but well-known global brands--
such as HeinekenQ-are up to three times more expensive than local
beers.

Kratochvile does not think that domestic newcomers in the category
of larger breweries have a chance to succeed on the Czech market.
Their numbers have decreased steadily from 104 breweries in 1970
to 79 in 1980, and 71 currently. If foreign brewers want to
participate in the Czech market, he believes they will best do so
in mergers with medium-sized breweries or joint ventures.

Besides the large Czech companies there are also 14
"minibreweries," but their market share taken together is
relatively small. The ten largest breweries together claim a 49.4
percent market share.

GERMANY CONTINUES AS A STRONG CAR MARKET

Among the five largest markets in Europe, Germany was the only one
where sales value of medium-sized passenger cars grew between 1989
and 1994, according to a new report from MarketLine International.
The other growth market worldwide was the United States, which is
the world's largest market for medium passenger cars.

On the basis of a constant 1994 foreign exchange rate, the global
value of medium-sized passenger car sales declined from $194
billion in 1989 to $173.9 billion in 1994, providing an indication
of how tough the auto market has become.

The definition of medium-sized cars is different in Europe and
Japan than in the United States. In the lower-medium group in
Europe and Japan are models such as Rover 200, Renault 19, Ford
Escort, VW Golf, and Toyota Corolla.  Upper-medium cars include
Ford Mondeo, Opel Vectra, Renault Laguna, Peugeot 405, and the BMW
3 series.

In the United States the lower-medium category includes Pontiac
Grand Am, Dodge Spirit, Ford Contour, and Honda Civic. In the
upper-medium category are Honda Accord, Ford Taurus, Nissan
Maxima, and Toyota Camry.

In 1994 nearly 10.4 million medium-sized cars were registered/sold
globally, up 2.8 percent over 1993. Medium-sized car registrations
peaked in 1989 at about 11.9 million. Globally, sales of medium
cars are split almost equally between lower-medium and upper-
medium cars. The table at left shows the number of
registrations/sales of new medium-sized passenger cars in 1994, by
country.

General Motors led the market in 1994 with a 19.5 percent share of
the medium-sized passenger car market. Ford and Toyota took 11.8
percent, and 11.7 percent respectively.  The leading eight
companies account for 76.3 percent of all medium-sized car
registrations globally.

In 1994, the United States had the largest number of dealers
selling medium passenger cars (35,136) and hence the lowest number
of medium car registrations per dealer at 101. Spain has the
fewest dealers selling this size car and the highest registrations
per dealer at 227. MarketLine says this indicates the highly
focused distribution network in Spain.

The medium-car market is forecast to rise 8.7 percent globally
between 1994 and 2000, with Germany expected to overtake Japan as
the second-largest market globally. By 2000, first-time
registrations in Germany are expected to rise to 2.1 million
compared with 1.9 million for Japan. The prediction is based on a
forecast of stronger economic growth in Germany during the period.

RESIDENTS OF PRAGUE MOVE FROM BUSES TO CARS

In the first nine months of 1995, car sales in the Czech Republic
grew nearly 40 percent compared with the same time period in 1994.
In those nine months, 77,985 new cars were sold. In addition,
81,497 used cars were also sold. Both figures include new and used
cars imported from Western Europe.

The most successful car manufacturer was SEAT (the Spanish VW-
owned concern). Ford sold the most small trucks and vans. The
table on page 5 shows the top-ten manufacturers in sales in the
first nine months of 1995.

The penetration of cars in the Czech Republic has grown from 241
cars per 1,000 persons in 1991 to 287 per 1,000 in 1994. In Prague
the growth has been especially dramatic: from 283 per 1,000 in
1991 to 418 per 1,000 in 1994.

The number of people using public transport declined from 4.9
million passengers in 1991 to 4.3 million passengers in 1994, a
decrease of about 12 percent. In some other post-Communist
markets, this drop has been even more dramatic: in Hungary, 25
percent; Poland, 33 percent; and in the former East Germany, 55
percent.

EUROPEANS BELIEVE IN EATING THEIR FRUITS AND VEGGIES

Europeans are getting the message that eating habits may have
something to do with the risk of cancer. A survey by Eurobarometer
(see source, pg. 2) underscores the importance of structuring
messages for foods in a way that is compatible with cultural
context. For example, it is probably easier to promote high-fiber
products as contributing to good health in Ireland, Denmark, the
Netherlands, and Belgium than it is in other markets because
people there believe that high fiber has a good effect on cancer.

When asked the question, "For each of the following, do you think
that eating more of it increases the risk of getting cancer,
decreases it, or has no effect?," responses varied by country.

The Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Belgians are most likely to
believe that alcohol increases the risk of cancer, while the
British, Dutch, Danes, and Irish believe that the consumption of
alcoholic drinks has no effect on the risk of cancer.

Greeks, Italians, and Irish think red meat will increase the risk
of cancer, while the French, Dutch, Danes, and British do not
think it will.

Consumption of salt seems to be the most uniformly agreed-upon
risk factor, with about one-third of citizens of the European
Union seeing salt as increasing the risk of cancer. Twenty-eight
percent of people overall say sugar can increase the risk of
cancer, but 63 percent of the French and Dutch, 62 percent of
Danes, and 59 percent of the British believe it has no effect.

Green vegetables are highly rated by respondents, with 45 percent
overall believing that consumption of them will decrease the risk
of cancer. That view is most prevalent in Ireland, Denmark, and
Spain. Fresh fruit gets similarly high marks.

SIZZLE SLOWS IN THE BRITISH FAST-FOOD MARKET

In 1995, the fast-food market in the United Kingdom increased by 4
percent to GBP5.37 billion, representing about 16 percent of the
total catering market. Market Strategies for Industry (MSI)
forecasts the market to grow by 3 percent in real terms in 1996.
Increase in consumer spending and continued penetration into new
markets are the two main reasons behind the growth forecast.

MSI projects that the UK market for prepared sandwiches will reach
GBP1.92 billion when final turnovers are tallied for 1995. The
sandwich sector is expected to be one of the strongest for the
rest of the decade.  Hamburgers, however, are expected to lose
some of their sizzle for the rest of the decade; that sector's
growth is projected to decline, after about 5 percent growth
between 1994 and 1995.

Pizza and pasta were expected to grow about 3 percent each during
1995.  In the UK, these two sectors have been widely marketed with
discounts, and MSI says the value of the pizza and pasta market is
being restricted because of this marketing strategy.

Fish and chips, the British tradition, was projected to grow only
2 percent during 1995, apparently being put under pressure by the
increased choice in the fast-food market. This sector is expected
to peak in 1997 and then begin a slow decline.  The market for
fried chicken, on the other hand, increased 5 percent to about
GBP347 million in 1995, and is expected to grow at least 2 percent
in 1996.

Chinese and Indian takeaway foods are becoming slightly less
popular, according to the MSI study, increasing in real terms by
only 1 and 2 percent, respectively, which MSI says reflects an
actual decline in sales.  The market for these items is expected
to remain flat in the next year or two and to decline towards the
end of the decade.

DIRECT MARKETING SHOW FINALLY GETS A EUROPEAN CHARACTER

Database marketing and the use of electronic media are the two hot
topics in direct marketing today, not only in the United States,
but in the rest of the world as well.

International Direct Marketing Week, to be held January 24 to 26
in Paris, will give you the European perspective on these issues.

Speakers from Europe, including the managing director and the
marketing director of Germany's Bertelsmann Online, which recently
invested in America Online, will comment on topics such as
"integrating the electronic media into a commercial strategy" and
how to create business relationships via on-line.

A session on the legalities of selling and creating other
transactions on-line will also assist companies that want to sell
via new technologies but also want to respect the laws of the
countries in which they sell.

In the past, this conference and others on direct marketing have
often featured many of the speakers you would hear if you attended
a similar event in the United States. A review of the program for
this year's French event shows virtually no American speakers.
This means a better learning environment for those who are truly
trying to understand the European viewpoint. The event offers the
additional benefit of a large and active trade show, which will
quickly bring you up-to-date on direct-marketing services-Q
including listsQ-in Europe.

DIRECTORY OF E. EUROPE AND CIS BUSINESSES HELPS FILL A VOID

So you want to find wholesalers for sporting goods and toys in the
Baltic countries and Eastern Europe? Other than contacting your
competitors to learn the names of their distributors, where can
you start?

One possibility is a directory that covers a wide range of SIC
codes. It's called Major Business Organizations of Eastern Europe
and the Commonwealth of Independent States 1995/96, published in
the United Kingdom by Graham and Whiteside and distributed in the
United States by Gale Research.

Turning to the index based on business activities, by country, you
will find three wholesalers of sporting and recreational goods and
toys and hobby goods in Bulgaria, one in Russia, two in Hungary,
three in Poland, and one each in Romania and Slovakia.

Turning to the actual listing for a company, you find full contact
information, bank references, the number of employees, activities,
and the names of directors and senior managers. In many cases, the
most-recent information on total sales is provided, along with the
date the business was established and the number of its employees,
two indicators of stability. If you already know the name of a
company and need additional information to find out whether it is
a legitimate business, the directory is also an excellent place to
start.

Graham and Whiteside's company directories for many regions of the
world are also available on-line through the Company Intelligence
services of Information Access Company as well as on CD-ROM.

INSURERS LIKE TO KEEP THEIR BRANDS' NAMES IN PUBLIC VIEW

One of five insurance companies in the United Kingdom says that it
would not advertise if its competitors did not do so. Yet,
companies recognize that advertising is their most important
promotional tool in a market that is growing very little and is
highly competitive.

These are some of the findings of new research on the ways that
financial companies in the United Kingdom spend their marketing
dollars.

In auto and homeowners' insurance, direct writers such as
Churchill and Direct Line are battling to attract a larger share
of a finite market. They must advertise continuously to encourage
new customers to contact them. In the life and pensions market,
150 companies are vying for the same customers and are suffering
from consumer distrust following scandals in the sales of personal
pension policies.

A survey of advertising managers in financial services by
Datamonitor found that advertising is their most important
promotional tool, but direct marketing use is expected to increase
by the year 2000. Financial services companies already account for
about 25 percent of the direct mail sent in the UK.

Datamonitor analyst Brian Evans-Jones says that even if direct
marketing increases, advertising would not die out. "Companies
still need to attract new customers before they can hit them with
mailshots. What we will see in the future is advertising and
direct marketing working in harmony: one attracting new customers,
the other dealing with them afterwards."

EDUCATION LEVELS OF EUROPEAN PRINT MEDIA READERS ARE RISING

Results of the sixth Pan-European Survey (PES6) of print media
readers in 14 European countries are in and find that one-third of
print readers now have post-graduate qualifications. The survey,
carried out by Research Services, involves more than 7,000 face-
to-face interviews in 14 countries.

Other general findings of the survey, which monitors readership
for a host of newspapers, newsmagazines, and in-flight magazines
across Europe, are that English-language use is becoming more
prevalent, that educational levels are up among readers, and that
the share of readers who work for multinational organizations is
on the decline.

Specifically, the European Union now has about 125 million
English-speakers. Among PES6 survey respondents, 68 percent use
English and 40 percent use it regularly at work. The survey also
found that 73 percent of respondents now have at least a college
degree, compared with 68 percent in the last survey.

BRITISH WOMEN FACE BALANCING ACT

More women are breaking through the "glass ceiling" in the United
Kingdom. At the same time, three-quarters of women still cook the
evening meal in their households. And overall, women suffer higher
levels of stress than 10 years ago.

About 15 percent of women now experience "a lot" or a "great deal"
of stress, with those aged 35 to 54 the most likely to be under
duress, according to a government study, Social Focus on Women.

The study also shows a pattern of growing financial independence
and spending power among British women, accompanied by increased
social status. Despite the positives, women in the UK are
struggling to balance their traditional family roles with growing
opportunities in the outside world.

An explosion of part-time employment has brought increased numbers
of women into the labor force. In 1994, 12 million female
residents of the UK were working. The proportion of economically
active women rose from 37 percent in 1971 to 44 percent last year.
The share of part-time work increased 19 percentage points over
the last decade, to 45 percent of the women who work. About 80
percent of women with part-time work say they do not want a full-
time job, mainly because of family commitments.

About one-half of women believe that a mother should not work
while her children are younger than school age, but about 30
percent consider part-time jobs acceptable for women with pre-
school children, and over 60 percent think they are acceptable for
women with school-age children.

Despite shifts in favor of women in the workplace, women still
have traditional roles in the UK, notwithstanding opinion polls
which show a widespread belief among both sexes that domestic
tasks should be shared.

A 1991 opinion survey cited in the report indicated that both men
and women think cooking the evening meal should be shared equally.
But when asked who actually cooks, 20 percent said that meal
preparation was jointly shared. In 9 percent of households, the
evening meal was prepared by the man. In 70 percent, the woman was
responsible.

With traditional male activities such as repairing household
equipment, 31 percent thought they should be shared equally. In
reality, 82 percent of these tasks were done by men.

Women are waiting longer to get married and to have children,
often because of increased career opportunities. The average age
for a first birth within a marriage rose from 24.8 years in 1971
to 28 years in 1993.

Having children can, however, still have a negative impact on a
woman's career. Many women who have children have less opportunity
for advancement than women who do not take career breaks to bring
up children.

THE EARNINGS GAP
Many women continue to earn less than men in comparable jobs. In
April 1994, for example, one-third of female employees earned
GBP190 (about $300) or less per week compared with 13 percent of
male employees. Conversely, three-quarters of males earned over
GBP230 per week, compared with only one-half of females.

Even so, women now have more money of their own. Almost 75 percent
carried some form of "plastic money" in 1993, with one-third
having a charge credit card.

More are taking on long-term financial responsibilities as well.
The proportion of women holding a mortgage in their own name more
than doubled between 1983 and 1994, to 17 percent, while the share
of men with their own mortgage went up only three percentage
points, to 20 percent, during the same period.

After food and housing, women are most likely to spend their money
on household goods. Compared with men, women spend more on
clothing and considerably less on motoring.

In their leisure time, women are abandoning traditional
activities. Dressmaking, knitting, and needlework, practiced by 48
percent of women 10 years ago, have declined in favor of
participation in the audio-visual revolution. Listening to
records, tapes, and CDs has increased among women from 62 percent
to 75 percent in 10 years.

Virtually all womenQ-99 percentQ-watch television at least once a
month. Satellite television is watched most by women aged 25 to
34. Soap operas, followed closely by drama series, are the most
popular TV programs among women.

Despite television's popularity, women still find time to read.
The share of women who read regularly rose from 61 percent in 1983
to 71 percent in 1994. However, women are less likely than men to
read a national newspaper--54 percent compared with 66 percent.
Instead, magazines enjoy tremendous popularity. Four of five of
the most popular weekly magazines are for women.

Women  also read men's magazines. About 200,000 read the pop music
magazine, The Face, which is aimed mainly at young men, and 30,000
women read Penthouse, which is aimed at the adult male.

About two-thirds of women went to the cinema last year. Young
women are the most regular cinema goers, with 87 percent of those
aged 15 to 24 attending once a year or more.

Alcohol plays an increasing role in women's lives. The share of
heavy drinkers has gone up, with 11 percent drinking more than the
government-set "sensible" level of 14 units of alcohol per week.
Young women aged 16 to 24 drink on average just over seven units
per week--three times more than those aged 65 and over.

Women spend, on average, more of their income on tobacco, and have
been slower to quit smoking than men.

THE ROLE OF MARRIAGE SHIFTS

Inequality among women in the United Kingdom has increased as a
result of greater access to jobs and wealth. The gap between rich
and poor women has been widened by a significant rise in numbers
of "dual earner" couples, according to two studies on incomes and
families by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

A growing number of working women now enjoy prosperity and social
status on a par with their male counterparts. On the other hand,
there is an expanding pool of single and unemployed females unable
to break into the job market. Women who maintain a household with
children are most likely to be in the lowest income bracket, while
two-earner couples are over-represented in the top brackets.

In 1981, male earnings accounted for nearly three-quarters of
total household income. By 1991, this had fallen to two-thirds. In
dual-earner families, the difference is even more marked, with
women who worked full time in 1991 bringing in an average of 42
percent of family income.

THE ROLE OF MARRIAGE CHANGES
The growth in female employment, together with the greater
availability of contraception, has brought couples closer
together, according to the Rowntree Foundation. Yet paradoxically,
there has been a substantial increase in divorce.

There is now  a greater acceptance of premarital sex and
cohabitation. Marriage is seen as a means of enshrining a
relationship rather than as a legal nicety preceding and
legitimizing parenthood.

Far from being the death knell of a traditional institution, this
shift in attitude indicates how much more is expected of marriage,
the Foundation says.

"Marriage is increasingly regarded as an evolving institution," it
concludes. "[Its] modern role is to confer public recognition on
the relationship between two adults whose parenthood may be
neither imminent nor assured."

The Foundation cites a survey which found that people in the
United Kingdom were more likely than in other European Union
countries to regard the primary role of family as "providing love
and affection," rather than "bringing up and educating children."

Marriage, however, is no longer a source of stability. Four out of
ten marriages now end in divorce in the United Kingdom, and the
number of marriages is at its lowest level in 150 years.

GERMANS SHOP FOR FRESHNESS

This is the second part of a two-part series on consumers in
Germany. The first part appeared in the December issue of
Market:Europe and included basic demographic data about the states
in Germany as well as economic, employment, and education
information. To obtain a copy of Part I, call W-Two Publications
at (607) 277-0934.

Germany's retail trade totaled DM 685 billion in 1992. Almost 90
percent of this money was spent in stores, but some DM 78 billion
were not. One out of five retail businesses was not store-based;
these businesses employed almost 10 percent of the 388,000 retail
employees.

Mail-order firms, of which there were 10,000 with about 100,000
employees, accounted for DM 40 billionQ-slightly more than one-
half of this nonstore turnover. The rest flowed through kiosks and
"nonstationary" sales locations.

One of the latter channels is open-air markets, which still play a
significant role in the life of the ever-freshness-conscious
German consumer, who goes shopping almost daily. In the large
cities, these markets are assembled at the crack of dawn on
parking lots or town squares, then moved to another location in
the early afternoon. They travel from borough to borough on a
weekly schedule and typically offer a wide variety of produce,
baked goods, meats, fish, eggs, cheeses, and the all-important
cold cuts, as well as flowers, some clothes, and perhaps baskets
or jewelry.

Another source of competition for Germany's grocery chains is an
increased number of food cooperatives. More than 2,000 are now
operating in the country. Members use their group purchasing power
to buy directly from farmers. Members sometimes work in the
business or pay a membership fee, but they get the advantage of
lower prices and fresher, often organically grown, food.

The market for organic food in Germany is about $2.1 billion, less
than 2 percent of the $176 billion that consumers spent in 1994
for food. Co-ops have a 3 to 5 percent share of the organic
market, according to data published by The Week in Germany.

Germany continues to suffer under the severely restrictive shop
closing time law which, with few exceptions, prohibits
storekeepers from keeping stores open on Saturday afternoons, all
day Sundays, and past 6:30 p.m. during the week. Consumer
dissatisfaction with this tired statute appears finally to have
reached critical mass, however, and changes are discussed ever
more forthrightly in the media and some political circles.

For the time being, the trade unions--the main proponents of
keeping the law as is--still have the upper hand, but their reign
is eroding. Methods used to dodge the regulations include
greengrocers who forget to close on time and bakers who on Sundays
sell only to club members. (As we went to press, the government
had just introduced a legislative initiative that would permit
stores to stay open till 8 p.m. on weekdays as well as on Saturday
afternoons.)

Gas stations, which are for the most part exempt from the law
because they cater to the traveling public, long ago turned into
minimarkets, with the result that, just to pay for gas, one
frequently has to stand in line behind grocery shoppers.

"Airports and train stations have turned into shopping centers
with travel opportunities," writes Stern, Germany's biggest mass
market magazine. In a representative poll, the magazine found that
30 percent of the population want the shop closing time law
stricken entirely, and another 30 percent were in favor of
liberalization. Almost two-thirds were against keeping on the
books the law that prohibits bakers from making fresh rolls on
Sundays.

Bakeries may serve as the perfect example of the unreasonableness
of the trade unions' position. Whereas they oppose a
liberalization of the closing time law ostensibly in part to
safeguard the existence of small and medium-sized enterprises,
three small bakeries go out of business every day. Apparently the
law does little to help them fight the regional superbakeries'
success. The big bakeries are also in favor of liberalization in
order to be able to compete with competitors from neighboring
countries who operate under less-restrictive conditions.

Germans are, by the way, European champions in bread consumption.
Statistically, each German eats 81 kg (178 pounds) bread per year.
Whole grain and rye breads are still predominant, but varieties of
white bread have above-average growth rates.

The recent flat retail sales climate (see Market:Europe June 1995)
shows few signs of improvement. In the first half of 1995, in
nominal terms, retail trade remained stable; in real terms, it
declined by 2 percent.

The retail woes have begun to affect store rents. Except for the
very best addresses, rents for retail space in the downtown areas
of big cities have eroded up to 5 percent, and for the first time
in years, interesting spaces are relatively freely available.

The average store rental in fine downtown locations is about DM
120 per square meter for small locales and DM 83 for large ones.
But there are regional differences and, in general, one can expect
substantially lower rents in eastern and southern towns.

Commercial rentals are, of course, most expensive in the biggest
cities. For a small store expect to pay DM 220 per square meter in
Bremen and Stuttgart, DM 300+ in Dortmund and Essen, and up to DM
400 in the best locations in (West) Berlin, Hamburg, Koln, and
Munchen. Larger storefronts rent for between DM 60 and DM 120 per
square meter less than smaller storefronts.

THE GREEN CONNECTION
Whatever you sell, the green angle is important in Germany, it
seems. Ikea, for example, advertises cups made from recycled
glass. A company called memo, "the supply house for the
environmentally conscious," provocatively asks in one of its print
ads whether the reader is an armchair culprit and offers office
supplies and furnishings "that are good for humans and nature."

Tengelmann-Qa supermarket chain which in 1984 banned turtle soup
and frog's legs from its shelves and now boycotts products from
Norway because of that country's record regarding whales-Q
pioneered the ban on detergents containing phosphates (now
nationally accepted) and declines to stock PVC beverage
containers, chlorine-bleached paper products, and one-way pens and
tableware, among other environmentally questionable products.

Pioneer Tengelmann is by no means alone. "The traditional
shopkeeper's credo, according to which trade just offers the goods
and the customer alone decides [what to buy], is losing
importance," wrote Die Zeit, Germany's most respected liberal
weekly. "Merchants want to pursue actively their role as
gatekeeper between producer and consumer."

Hertie, one of the biggest department store chains in the country
and another forerunner of green thinking, removed many nongreen
products from its salesfloor and introduced more environmentally
conscientious packaging. In cooperation with BUND, a respected
environmental organization which tested more than 300 cleaners for
this project, the retail giant introduced a collection of 38
especially environment-friendly household cleaners. Mail-order
giant Otto sells "affordable and environmentally friendly" washing
machines and television sets; competitor Neckermann offers an eco-
fridgeQin conjunction with Greenpeace.

The polling institute Emnid found that 69 percent of shoppers paid
attention to environmental issues. One in five households told the
Federal Office for the Environment that it made substantial
changes to address environmental realities. The Office found that
80 percent of the population think of themselves as
environmentally conscious, and that about two-thirds are willing
to act that wayQ-unless buying green hits the pocketbook too hard.
One in two consumers was not willing to pay more for green
products; most of the rest tolerated a premium of no more than 10
percent.

Ten years after the beginning of the eco-boom, it is no longer
that easy to differentiate a product simply by its greenness. On
the one hand, the driving forces, the consumers, are a bit weary
in face of conflicting claims and an inflation of eco-this and
eco-that, and on the other, German advertising law, which
prohibits comparisons, can make it difficult to position a product
in context. Furthermore, customers expect concrete, understandable
benefits, not fuzzy promises. To that end it is also important
that ecology-mindedness not be confined to a single product;
rather, the entire company must be credibly engaged.

Consumer Credit and Payment Methods
Seven of eight Germans do not have a credit card. One reason for
this low penetration may be that credit cards' usefulness is
limited because they are not nearly as widely accepted as they are
in some other countries. Germans also are a bit wary of the very
concept of disposable credit.

Every-day monetary transactions are made almost exclusively in
cash, and Germans pay bills usually by transfers among financial
institutions. For the payment of recurrent bills, most Germans
have placed orders for automatic deduction from their giro
transfer accounts. Besides regular banks, Postbank AG, one of the
three institutions that emerged from the breakup and privatization
of the government's monolithic Deutsche Bundespost, is a major
player in the giro transfer market.

Meanwhile, the number of bankruptcies continues its three-year
climb. The Federal Statistics Office reported 11,542 insolvencies
in the first five months of 1995, up 15.9 percent from a year
earlier. About one quarter of the total of 2,305 May 1995
bankruptcies were filed in the new Lander; the 1,725 cases in the
west meant an increase of 9.9 percent as compared with May 1994.

Similarly, the number of individuals with overdue debts has risen
by 1 million in the last three years to well over 8 million.
Delinquent debtors do not come exclusively from the socially
weaker stratum of society, but more and more doctors and
pharmacists are unable to meet their obligations, too.

TRAVEL
Are recession, high unemployment, and ever-higher paycheck
deductions finally taking a bite out of German travel habits? It
is too early to tell. Whereas a steadily growing percentage (39
percent in 1992, 40 percent in 1993, and 41 percent in 1994) of
west Germans remain at home, their eastern cousins pick up the
slack and ever-more-frequently use their still relatively new
freedom to see the world.

In 1994, 54 percent of Germans vacationed for five days or more
(1993, 55 percent), and 45 percent (46 percent in 1993) were away
from home for two weeks or more, found a B*A*T Freizeit-
Forschungsinstitut study. East Germans travel for an average of
12.9 days, and west Germans for an average 16.4 days.

One in four vacationers remained in Germany. Fifty-eight percent
of these national tourists were aged 65 and older, and 27 percent
of them were aged 14 to 29.

As always in the last 20 or so years, Spain (11 percent), Italy (8
percent), and Austria (8 percent) were the top-three international
destinations for German vacationers, together drawing more German
travelers than all national tourist destinations together.

The trend to one-person households benefits the tourist business
as, according to the B*A*T study, money that otherwise would be
spent on children, flows into travel. Fifty-six percent of
traveling families, 69 percent of vacationing couples, and 82
percent of singles with Wanderlust could afford an international
trip in 1994.

When asked about their dream destinations, almost one in two
Germans named the Caribbean. Other tropical island paradises such
as the South Sea, Bali, Java, the Maldives, and Hawaii received
frequent mentions. Australia (+12 percentage points in 1994 as
compared with 1991), the Dominican Republic (+9), and South Africa
(+6) are the newest trendy destinations, whereas Florida, Egypt,
and Russia led the pack of destinations rapidly losing attraction.
No doubt the attacks on tourists in each of these markets have
helped to dull their luster for Germans.

In the first half of 1995, overnight stays in German hotels,
motels, and guesthouses with nine or more beds were up 4 percent
as compared with the first six months of 1994. The new Lander and
east Berlin registered a hefty growth rate of 16 percent, whereas
the west saw only a 2 percent increase.

The number of overnights of national guests grew 3 percent to
123.1 million, and the number of overnights of foreigners
rebounded 5 percent to 14.7 million.

Italians (+110,000 overnights/+16 percent), Japanese (+67,000/+13
percent), and citizens of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
(+61,000/+5 percent) led all other nationals with respect to
growth rates. With +38,000/+3 percent, U.S. citizens were in sixth
position. Overnights by visitors from The Netherlands, however,
who constitute the single-largest group of visitors to Germany by
country of origin, declined by 6,500, or 0.3 percent.

Media and Advertising
Newspapers are Germany' most important advertising medium; they
attracted 31 percent (slightly more than DM 10 billion) of all
advertising spending in 1994. The 420 daily newspapers publishing
in the fourth quarter of 1994 sold over 30 million copies per
issue, two-thirds of them to subscribers. The 32 weeklies sold
more than 2 million copies each week, but saw their advertising
revenue shrink to DM 416 million (minus 7.7 percent) as compared
with 1993. Advertising spending on supplements decreased 4.8
percent to just under DM 270 million.

Magazines, which garnered 3.3 billion advertising deutschmarks in
1994 (+2.8 percent compared with a weak 1993), numbered just over
700 and sold a cumulative 123 million copies per issue in the
fourth quarter of 1994; the 963 journals sold 17.3 million copies
per issue and earned DM 2.2 billion (+1.0 percent) through
advertising. (All figures take into account only titles that are
accredited with IVW, an industry watchdog that verifies print
media distribution and, since 1994, radio and TV advertising spot
broadcasts.)

Television is the second-largest advertising medium, commanding 17
percent of the entire advertising pie. Its 1994 advertising income
was DM 5.6 billion, an increase of 16.6 percent compared with 1993
and four times as much as 10 years ago. Almost 90 percent of these
advertising deutschmarks (up from 70 percent in 1992 and 14
percent in 1988) flowed in the coffers of private TV stations.

Presently home-shopping programs are limited by law to a maximum
of one hour per channel per day, but the industry hopes that the
1996 broadcast treaty will eliminate this barrier. Home Order
Television (H.O.T.), a joint venture of a television channel and a
mail order company, began a pilot project in October, and QVC and
the Swedish Kinnevik are reportedly poised to beam their programs
into German homes.

In 1994, Germans registered 32.3 million television sets and 36.2
million radios. The fee attached to this household-based mandatory
registration finances the "public-legal" media, which until 10
years ago were the only players on German airwaves.

Of the 37.4 million reception points (households, workplaces, and
lodgings), 23.2 million (62.0 percent) were wired for cable in
1994, and 14.6 million (39.2 percent of total) were actually
hooked up to cable reception. Cable penetration was highest in the
three city Lander (Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen), where it was 55
percent and higher. Other western states averaged around 40
percent of cable hookup, while eastern Lander fell between 12 and
25 percent of reception points actually being hooked up.
(Anecdotally, it seems that everyone not hooked up has a satellite
dish on the balcony.)

One television channel's study showed that people in east and west
differed markedly in their TV-viewing habits. People aged 14 and
older in the east spent 212 minutes daily in front of the
television set compared with 183 minutes in the west. This
imbalance reverses itself as late in the day as 10:30 p.m., when
west Germans become more likely to watch than east Germans. West
Germans find information, variety and entertainment shows, and
domestic police dramas more interesting than do their eastern
cousins, whereas the latter are especially fond of game shows,
infotainment, and U.S.-made police dramas.

With DM 1.1 billion (+12.9 percent) in 1994, radio earns three
percent of the advertising deutschmark. 1994 was the first year
that private radio stations pulled in more advertising money than
the 'public-legal' stations, whose advertising income shrank 10.4
percent from a year earlier to DM 492 million (43 percent of total
advertising spending on radio). Private radio's income jumped 41
percent to DM 643 million.

Advertisers spent DM 276 million in the 3,718 movie houses in
1994, up 5.9 percent compared with 1993. Even though 1993 was a
banner year with movie ticket sales surpassing all expectations
(+23.2 percent over 1992), the number of tickets sold in 1994 was
up again to 132.8 million (+1.8 percent). Multiplex theaters are
relatively new in Germany and they are doing well at drawing
advertising. Even though there were only 13 such centers in
Germany in 1994 (another 15 to 20 are in the concrete planning
phase), they had a 13 percent share of movie house advertising
expenditures.

The age distribution of the movie-going public is as follows: 24
percent are aged 14 to 19, 47 percent are aged 20 to 29, 16
percent aged 30 to 39, and 13 percent aged 40 or older. There are
slightly more female than male moviegoers in the age groups 14 to
19 and 40 and older. The group aged 14 to 19 represents 6.9
percent of the population but constitutes 15.2 percent of
moviegoers. They are the only age group that is overrepresented.

Total investment into direct-mail advertising was estimated at DM
11.2 billion for 1994; postage alone accumulated to DM 4.5
billion. In that year Deutsche Post AG, the private successor of
the erstwhile Deutsche Bundespost, which also included what became
Deutsche Telekom AG and the aforementioned Postbank AG, delivered
4.6 billion pieces of "infomail" (mass advertising addressed to
specific patrons) and 1.9 billion pieces of "mail drop shipments"
(unaddressed material delivered to every household on the route).

Closing
Five years after unification people still have to come to grips
with the costs. For westerners these costs are real and
immediately reflected in their monetary and job security concerns;
for easterners costs include widespread unemployment and a
lingering second-class citizen status.

Enthusiasm for unification has been steadily waning in polls;
perhaps it is being replaced by acceptance of and arrangement with
reality, however.

The rugged German economy seems to weather the giant sucking sound
of the eastern vacuum, and polls consistently show that the
present federal government enjoys broad popular support. To this
reporter such voter confidence would seem to indicate that,
despite all the pains and hardships unification has brought, the
German people in the final analysis say, "We can live with thisQ
somehow." The continued strength of the deutschmark seems to
indicate that indeed they can.

NEW MEASURE FOR INDENTIFYING LATIN AMERICAN CONSUMER SEGMENTS

Identifying appropriate consumer segments for specific products
and services is not always an easy thing to do in Latin America.
In these emerging markets, consumers' tastes and purchasing power
can differ widely from country to country, and even from city to
city within a country.

Enter the Socioeconomic Allocator  (SEA), a measure of consumer
socioeconomic status developed by The Gallup Organization, Miami,
Florida. SEA measures variables of occupation, education, type of
building material of the home, and ownership of an automobile and
selected durable goods.

Gallup's study identifies eight distinct consumer segments within
the Latin American population. These segments fall into the three
categories of upper class--emerging professional elite and
traditional elite; middle class--progressive upper middle, self-
made middle, skilled middle, and self-skilled middle; and working
class--industrial working class and struggling working class.
Following are descriptions of one segment each of the upper, the
middle, and the working class.

*UPPER: Of the two upper socioeconomic segments identified by
Gallup's SEA, the emerging professional elite accounts for 14
percent of the total sample population.

This group is highly educated--51 percent has graduated from
university or technical college. They are employed in top-level
executive and professional occupations. Surprisingly, this segment
is very young--65 percent are under 40 years old, and single--45
percent.

These consumers are most likely to own the durable goods that
represent the good life. Over 90 percent own a VCR, color
television set, automobile, washing machine, and vacuum cleaner.
Eighty-nine percent own a credit card.

When it comes to new products or services, this is the market to
target. Thirty-two percent of the members of this segment own
cellular phones.

Entertainment is another big spending category for this group--
over 60 percent list dining, dancing, and going to the movies
among their interests; 48 percent are interested in buying
records. Although sports do not rank high on their list of
activities, 26 percent express interest in swimming, 18 percent in
tennis, and 17 percent in boxing.

*MIDDLE: The self-made middle class (11 percent of the total
population) has the most buying power. Higher education is not a
key factor in the success of this group. None of the members of
this segment has any schooling beyond the secondary level; the
majority completed only primary school.

Instead, the members of this group built their way to success
through entrepre-neurial skills, as is evident in their relatively
older age--40 percent are over age 40.

Of the four middle-class segments, this group has the highest
level of ownership of credit cards--46 percent--and automobiles--
81 percent. Household appliances such as a vacuum cleaner and
washing machine are more common among this segment, and the
presence of air conditioning is more likely.

Sixty-one percent of these consumers express interest in
activities with their children. This translates into a market for
children's toys and clothes. This group also likes to shop for
small electronic appliances.

For entertainment, nearly 60 percent like dining, 48 percent like
going to the movies, and 45 percent like driving. When it comes to
sports, 51 percent prefer soccer, but 23 percent named swimming
and 21 percent boxing.

Religious activities are also important  to this group, as
reported by 46 percent.

It's important to note that although the progressive upper-middle-
class and the skilled-middle-class segments do not currently have
the purchasing power of the self-made middle class, they do
reflect the growing trend in Latin America of greater emphasis on
extended education.

*WORKING: The industrial working class represents the better
consumer market of the two working-class segments. Half of this
segment is between the ages of 20 and 39, and one- third are age
40 and older. Fifty-seven percent are married.

Extended education is not the norm for this group. Only 16 percent
has more than a secondary education.  Twenty-four percent has a
secondary school education, and 29 percent only a primary
education.

While 92 percent own color TV sets, listening to the radio is as
popular as watching television. Nearly half enjoy going to the
movies, but going shopping, especially for clothes and jewelry,
are favorite pastimes with well over half of this group, as are
decorating and cleaning the house.

Religious activities figure prominently in the lives of this
segment. Eighteen percent also mention interest in keeping a
personal diary, the highest share of all eight segments.

FREQUENT FLIER PROGRAM TAKES FLIGHT

With the wave of privatization of government-owned companies
sweeping Latin America during the 1990s, many Latin American
airlines were launched into open markets. In order to compete more
effectively--especially with large United States' airlines--and to
attract frequent travelers, several airlines joined together to
create LatinPass, a frequent-flyer program. By banding together,
these airlines can offer travelers service and frequent flier
miles to more Latin American gateways and flights between the
United States, Canada, and Latin America than any one U.S. airline
can offer.

LatinPass started in January 1995 with 14 South and Central
American airlines and U.S. Air as participating members. The
company's processing center in Miami, Florida, handles enrollment
for all LatinPass frequent fliers living outside Latin America. To
avoid duplication of miles, LatinPass keeps a database of the
frequent-flier programs for each of the participating airlines

LatinPass has invited Caribbean airlines to join, and  BWIA of
Trinidad, APA of the Dominican Republic, and Air Aruba are
currently negotiating agreements with the program. Eventually,
LatinPass hopes to expand to include all Latin American airlines
that fly into the United States and to expand participation to
European and Asian airlines flying into Latin America as well.

Hertz and Avis car rentals, Diners Club International charge card,
and Radisson Hotels currently participate in LatinPass. Avis and
Radisson offer miles at any of their Latin American, Caribbean,
North American, and European outlets.

Mariott Resorts International is expected to join in the near
future. AT&T is also negotiating membership with plans to offer
miles for points in their True Rewards program as well as to
develop a co-branded calling card.

LatinPass, 1600 N.W. Le Jeune Rd., Suite 200, Miami, Florida

WINES LOSE OUT IN THE ALCOHOLIC DRINK MARKET

The market for alcoholic drinks in Latin America increased 11
percent over the 1990s, but beer is clearly the alcoholic
beverage of choice in the region. In 1994, beer accounted for 80
percent of the sales volume of alcoholic drinks for the major
Latin American markets, according to Euromonitor International.
Wines and spirits accounted for the other 20 percent.

Beer sales are generally driven by demographics. Men aged 18 to 24
are traditionally the big beer market, and that age group is still
growing in Latin America; but young Latin American women are
drinking beer as well. In addition, the region's young adults tend
to use beer as much as a thirst quencher as an alcoholic beverage.
Other factors influencing beer sales are the region's rising
disposable incomes, increased advertising, and beer's low price
compared with other alcoholic drinks. While the alcoholic drinks
market will continue to grow through the rest of the decade, beer
sales will gain even more of the market share--83 percent by
Euromonitor's estimates.

Per-capita consumption of beer varies by country. Venezuela, for
example, averaged 78 liters per capita in 1994, the highest in the
region despite its relatively small population size. Mexico's
large population, on the other hand, consumed only 36 liters per
capita that same year.

When it comes to volume, Brazil and Mexico are the leaders, with
sales of 5,994 million liters and 4,207 million liters,
respectively, in 1994. These two countries will continue to
dominate the market in sales volume through the rest of the
decade--not surprising, given their large populations. As for
ranking in the global beer market, two Latin American countries
are among the top ten--Mexico ranks 7th and Venezuela 8th.
Colombia ranks 14th.

There are some niche markets within the overall beer market. Dark
beer, for example, is a popular seasonal drink, with the greatest
amount of sales and consumption occurring during the winter
months.

Not only is Latin America a key market for beer consumption, it is
also a key beer producer. Of the twenty largest beer brewers in
the world, six are located in Latin America and account for over
11 percent of the total world beer production.

Even as beer consumption is increasing, the market for other
alcoholic beverages--wines and spirits--is declining. Even in
Chile, where wine has long been a traditional alcoholic drink,
beer sales surpassed wine sales in 1994. Only Argentineans
continue to drink more wine than beer--42 liters to 31 liters per
capita. However, when Latin Americans do order wine, they are
likely to order a better-quality wine. Both these trends--less
wine consumption but of better-quality wine--will continue through
the rest of the decade.

While these trends point to a healthy market for beer sales, don't
be surprised to see a counter trend emerge encouraging less
consumption of alcoholic beverages as awareness and concern about
alcoholism develops.

OPINION POLL HIGHLIGHTS CONCERNS OF LATIN AMERICANS

In June of 1995 the Latinobarometer completed its survey of eight
Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico,
Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

More than 9,000 respondents aged 18 years and older were asked to
identify the main problems their countries face socially,
economically, and politically. A range of economic problems were
identified by respondents--inflation, low salaries, and poverty.
Their responses offer marketers a better picture of the overriding
worries and concerns influencing consumer attitudes and purchasing
behaviors.

In Mexico and Venezuela, 27 percent and 31 percent, respectively,
named inflation as the biggest concern for their country. Twenty
percent of Uruguayans and 18 percent of Chileans were concerned
about low salaries.

Not surprisingly, poverty is viewed as a major problem in several
countries, and was mentioned by 16 percent of respondents in
Paraguay, 13 percent each in Peru and in Chile, and 12 percent in
Brazil.

Despite economic concerns, a significant share of respondents in
Chile and Brazil also put health concerns on the list: 11 percent
in Chile and 19 percent in Brazil.

The 1990s has been a time of major changes in Latin America as
countries shift from closed economies, often tightly controlled by
the military, to open, market-oriented economies with many
formerly government-owned businesses now privatized. Yet, the
Latinobarometer survey shows that, in the minds of the people,
things change slowly. Most Latin Americans still see their
governments, rather than the budding corporate structure, as
wielding the most power. And in some countries, the military is
still seen as more powerful than business.

For example, more than one-half of all respondents in Mexico and
Peru named the government as more powerful than either big
business or the military. This is not surprising in view of the
recent events in those countries, where economic policies and
decisions made by the governments have had an immediate and
dramatic effect on the business environment. In Venezuela and
Brazil responses were more evenly distributed among the three
choices. In Paraguay, 61 percent of respondents said the military
held the most power.

Respondents in Argentina saw things in their country completely
differently. Only 14 percent saw the military as having more power
than either the government or big corporations, but 61 percent
said big business was the most powerful.

Although this was the first Latinobarometer survey in Latin
America, it follows the long tradition of the Eurobarometer in
Europe. For more information on Latinobarometer, see Market:Latin

DON'T OVERLOOK MEXICO'S FOOD MARKET

Despite Mexico's economic problems over the past year, caused by
the devaluation of its peso in late December 1994, the country
offers an unparalleled opportunity for food marketers, reports
PROMAR International, a strategic marketing and business
consultancy. Demand for processed food, which was just beginning
to grow before the peso devaluation, will return, PROMAR
International predicts. This, along with Mexico's growing
population, will make market conditions ideal for processed-food
manufacturers. But in order to be successful, manufacturers must
be willing to enter the market now, and stay in it for the long
term.

Although Mexico's current food chain--production, distribution,
and consumption--is highly fragmented, government economic
policies and market and industry influences will help to
streamline it and make it more efficient.

Demographic factors will also force the system to become more
efficient. More women entering the work force will put a premium
on time and convenience just when disposable income is rising.
Furthermore, the extensive U.S. influence through television and
advertising, as well as the presence of U.S. and multinational
companies operating in the country, will educate the consumer to
more choices in brands, services, and values.

The costs of entering the market now may seem formidable,  but
they are likely to rise over the next few years. PROMAR suggests
that food manufacturers may want to form partnerships with
domestic companies or simply buy a domestic operation.

by this market, order The Food Market in Mexico: Development After
Devaluation (cost GBP7,500). Contact Zoe Hamilton, Head of

WHERE BRAZILIANS GO, CAN JAPAN BE FAR BEHIND?

Ties between Brazil and Japan are likely to strengthen in the next
century, predicts  Ricardo Sergio de Oliveira, director of the
international division of Banco do Brasil. In an interview with
the Japanese newspaper Nikkei Weekly, Oliveira says the new
century is likely to see a proliferation of business, industrial,
and cultural alliances between the two countries.

Brazil's wealth of natural resources and Japan's technology can
work together to the benefit of both countries. Recently, Japan's
Export-Import Bank provided a loan to finance Japanese exports to
Brazil. In addition, many Japanese companies are making use of
Banco do Brasil's services at its outlets in Tokyo and Hamamatsu.
Although the bank provides loan and deposit services for the
150,000 Brazilians of Japanese nationality living and working in
Japan, nearly one-half of its banking activities come from
Japanese businesses.

Brazil's connections with other Asian countries such as Hong Kong,
Singapore, and China are developing as well. Oliveira sees this as
an extension of the growth and development Brazil will experience
over the next century.

NO PAN-REGIONAL TREND IN LATIN AMERICAN CINEMAS

The global rise of VCR ownership and video movies, and of
satellite and cable television over the past few decades put a
dent in movie audiences. With the introduction of multi-plexes,
which offered better-quality sound and pictures, and provided
bright, modern surroundings, movie attendance started to pick up
again. The early 1990s actually saw a surge in movie attendance in
many parts of the world, especially in some emerging markets in
the Asia-Pacifc region, while in most of the developed countries,
movie attendance continued on a downward slide.

Movie attendance in the seven major markets of Latin America is
mixed, but it has not returned to the level of the mid-1980s.

Film Distribution International: Rights and Markets, a resource
book published by Baskerville Communications Corporation, tracks
the trends in the cinema industry as well as in video movie
rentals, and the penetration of cable, satellite, and pay-TV. The
book provides information on over 50 countries throughout the
world, including the seven major consumer markets in Latin
America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and
Venezuela.

In Brazil, for example, movie attendance in 1985 was 91 million
but slid slightly to 90 million in 1990. It then climbed to 95
million in 1991 only to drop precipitously in 1992 to 73 million.
In 1994, movie attendance was once again on the rise in Brazil,
reaching 78.5 million by that year's end.

Argentina experienced a similar curve in cinema attendance,
although the levels of attendance in the 1990s were less than half
those of the 1980s. From 52 million in 1985, movie attendance in
1990 dropped to 25 million. Attendance bottomed out in 1991 at
14.7 million, then began a slow climb.  Although numbers for 1994
are not available, by year end 1993, cinema attendance was
definitely on the rise, with 22 million movie-goers recorded for
that year.

On the other hand, cinema attendance in Mexico, Chile, and
Colombia has been steadily declining.

Despite the unpredictable trends in cinema attendance in Latin
America, advertising in cinemas has steadily increased (although
cinema advertising represents only a small portion of overall
advertising in the region). In Argentina, revenues from cinema
advertising were almost five times as much in 1994 as in 1991. In
most of these seven countries, however, the increase in revenues
for cinema advertising is not as high.

AFFORDABLE PRICES, QUICK SERVICE DRIVE FAST-FOOD SALES IN CENTRAL
AMERICA

People in Central America are interested in convenience and
willing to pay for it. Over the past five years, the number of
fast food outlets in Honduras, Guatemala, and Costa Rica has
increased significantly. In El Salvador, new marketing formats
such as convenience stores are a big success. For example, after
adding convenience stores to their gas stations in El Salvador,
Esso Automarkets saw total sales increase 96 percent, with fast
food becoming a best-selling item.

A research study conducted by Panorama Internacional in Central
America indicates that over a period of five years the number of
fast-food outlets in Honduras tripled while the number in
Guatemala doubled. According to this study, Central Americans like
pizza, hamburgers, and fried chicken much in the same way that
Americans do. And the success of fast food in this region is due
to the same factors that make it successful up northQfast service
and a variety of food alternatives at affordable prices.

Both multinational and local companies compete in Central
America's fast-food market. Pizza Hut, McDonald's, and Burger King
are the dominant multinational companies. Together they account
for 78 percent of the fast-food outlets in Costa Rica and for 21
percent of fast-food outlets in Guatemala. In Honduras,  Pizza Hut
and Burger King account for 36 percent of the fast-food outlets.
Other multinational fast food companies competing in Guatemala,
Costa Rica, and Honduras include Wendy's, Taco Bell, Domino's
Pizza, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Subway, and Wimpy's.

As for local companies, there are at least 12 large companies in
those three countries, of which Pollos Campero and Bigos are the
most important competitors in terms of number of outlets. Pollos
Campero is present in Guatemala and Honduras, with 38 and 6
outlets, respectively, and Bigos is an Honduras-based company with
11 outlets.

Fast-food competition is greatest in Guatemala and least in Costa
Rica, where there are only seven companies with a total of 63
fast-food outlets. Honduras has nine companies with 83 outlets,
and Guatemala's 173 outlets are owned by just 15 companies, 8 of
which are local companies.

According to Panorama Internacional, multinational companies
target the middle-to-high-income consumer, while local companies
focus more on the mass market.

Menus offered by local fast-food companies revolve around local
tastes and preferences, while multinational companies tend to
stick to their menus offered worldwide. However, some of the more-
successful multinationals in Central America have found that
modifying their menus to incorporate local dishes pays off. For
example, gallo pinto, a typical breakfast dish in Costa Rica, is a
popular addition to some fast-food menus.

In addition, some multinationals have adapted marketing strategies
to the local needs of each country's consumers. For example, Pizza
Hut offers the Executive Discount Card, a membership program which
gives employees from participating member companies significant
discounts on meals eaten at Pizza Hut restaurants. Since it is
common practice in many Latin American countries for employers to
subsidize their employees' mid-day meal, this discount plan meets
the needs of employers and employees.

There is no doubt that the fast-food market in Central America is
growing. Those interested in this market will want to assess the
level of competition and the competitors, both multinational and
domestic companies, in each country. In addition, the ability to
be flexible and  to adapt the product to the local tastes of each
country, and to design marketing strategies geared to the needs of
the local market, will go a long way to ensure success in this
fast-growing fast-food market.

JAMAICA: CARIBBEAN POWERHOUSE IN THE MAKING

Jamaica is poised to become a key business market in the
Caribbean. This achievement has come about over the past few years
as a result of the government's commitment to making Jamaica into
a market economy with a strong private sector.

Policies are now in place to spur economic growth and attract both
domestic businesses and foreign investors. Among these policies
are changes in taxes and customs tariffs. Since the election of
prime minister Percival J. Patterson in 1993, many government-
owned businesses have been privatized, including NCB Bank and Air
Jamaica, the national airline. Other privatizations have occured
in airline services, telecommunications, hotels, and sugar and
banana companies. Privatization of the state-owned petroleum
corporation, PETROJAM, and railway, Jamaica Railway Corporation,
is in process.

These changes and the government's commitment solidify larger
changes that have evolved in Jamaica over the past few decades.
Once an agriculture-based economy that relied on exports of sugar
and bananas, Jamaica's economic base has shifted twice--first to
mining and then to services.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, mining of bauxite and alumina
for export replaced agriculture as the major economic activity. In
more recent years, the service sector, including tourism,  has
taken the economic lead, boasting the largest growth.

The service sector now accounts for 55 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP), while the goods-producing sectors--
agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction--contribute
only 45 percent of GDP. Between 1990 and 1994, banking and
communications services nearly doubled, and tourism increased
steadily, earning Jamaica the title of top Caribbean destination,
according to International Travel Trade Gazette.

Jamaica's official language is English. The country gained
independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, although its
government structured itself as a parliamentary democracy in the
tradition of the United Kingdom. But intense political party
rivalries within the country since then have overshadowed
Jamaica's government.

Jamaica still faces some problems.  The robust growth experienced
throughout the 1980s slowed in the 1990s to just one percent
annually. The country's dependence on imports and the slow growth
of exports are major problems.

Inflation and currency depreciation also pose problems for
Jamaica, although inflation has seen a steady decline in recent
years. In 1994 inflation was about 27 percent, down from 30
percent in 1993. By the first quarter of 1995, inflation was 3.4
percent, down from 8.1 percent for the same period in 1994. As of
October 195, the Jamaican dollar exchanged at about J$37 to US$1.
Jamaica also has a heavy foreign-debt burden.

Crime is on the rise and, to some extent, has dampened tourist
interest in the country.

RELIANCE ON IMPORTS
Historically, Jamaica's economic structure was organized to
produce industrial raw materials for export while consumer goods
were imported. In recent years, Jamaica has tried to correct this
imbalance but, as yet, the range of goods produced locally is
limited, and imports continue to grow. Exports of goods and
services averaged only 59 percent of GDP in 1994, while imports of
goods and services were 64 percent of GDP during that same year.

Apparel is one export that has seen significant growth in Jamaica.
Since 1989 apparel exports to the United States increased 60
percent, according to LA/C Business Bulletin.

Alumina, bauxite, sugar, and bananas accounted for over 60 percent
of total exports of approximately $1.2 billion in 1994. Jamaica is
the world's third-largest producer of bauxite, which remains the
country's largest export. In 1994, bauxite production reached its
highest level since 1980. Production for 1995 will be considerably
less, however, due to a strike over wages early in the year that
interrupted production at nearly three-fourths of the country's
bauxite refineries.

Sugar and sugar products, bananas, citrus, coffee, cocoa, spices,
and rum have long been Jamaica's major traditional agricultural
exports, but, except for coffee and rum,  their total production
has declined.

Jamaica relies heavily on imports of both consumer goods and
production resources. Total imports exceeded $2.1 billion  in
1994, of which 63 percent were raw materials and intermediate
goods for further processing. The rest are consumer goods, meaning
Jamaica is a good market for all kinds of consumer goods. Most of
Jamaica's imports come from the United States, followed by
Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, and Canada.

Emigration helps slow growth
Jamaica's population of 2.4 million has grown slowly over the last
few years, at about 1 percent annually. Slow population growth is
due to declining fertility and to emigration.

The total fertility rate (TFR) in 1995 was 2.4 children. The
average TFR for the Caribbean region is 2.9. (Total fertility rate
is the average number of children born to a woman during her
lifetime.) Yet, despite a low fertility rate, Jamaica's population
is young. Thirty-three percent is under the age of 15. In
countries with a large proportion of youth it is unusual to have a
significant share of the population in the older age group. Yet,
in Jamaica, eight percent of the population is over age 65.

The reason for this unusual juxtaposition of young and old
population is the high level of emigration from Jamaica. An
estimated 20,000 young and middle-aged adults leave Jamaica each
year to pursue education or employment in other countries, often
not returning to Jamaica until retirement.

In addition, Jamaica attracts a number of retirees from other
countries who choose to spend their golden years in the Caribbean.
Jamaica's group aged 65 and older, which includes both Jamaican
and foreign retirees, is made up in part of consumers with
comfortable incomes, well-developed consumer tastes, and specific
needs to which marketers can cater.

HOUSEHOLD REMITTANCES ARE IMPORTANT
Jamaica is quite rural. Although urbanization is increasing at
about 1.4 percent a year, only 53 percent of the population
currently lives in urban centers. Somewhat surprisingly, the 1982
census data showed greater numbers of females than males in urban
centers.

Average household size in Jamaica is about 3.8, down from 4.2
persons in the 1982 census.

GDP per capita, a rough estimate of household purchasing power,
was about $1,565 in 1994, although this number is distorted by the
continued depreciation of the Jamaican currency. Actual GDP per
capita has grown by only about $50 since 1989. However, the true
level of disposable income is higher since, in many households,
income is supplemented by remittances sent from family members
living overseas. In fact, remittances sent home to Jamaica have
surged, according to the Economic and Social Survey of Jamaica
1994. Private transfers, the largest share of which is
remittances, reached $214 per head in 1994.

The Jamaican Survey of Living Conditions 1993 shows an average
annual per capita household expenditure of about J$23,408 (US$716
at 1993 rate of exchange), a decline in real terms compared with
1990.

Levels of consumption vary considerably among income groups. The
top 10 percent of income earners spent 12 times more on
consumption than did the bottom 10 percent. Sixty-six percent of
all households spent less than J$8000 (or US$245) per month in
1993.

Consumption expenditures also vary by region. Per capita
expenditure in the Kingston metropolitan area, where 33 percent of
the population lives, exceeded the country average by 31 percent
in 1993. Per capita consumption was lowest in the rural areas,
where 47 percent of the population live.

Spending on food accounts for 54 percent of total consumer
expenditures. Clothing and footwear account for nearly 12 percent
each, and fuel, household supplies, and transportation for
approximately 6 percent each. However, household food consumption
is augmented by home production, from gardens or farms. In fact,
home production accounts for 5 percent of overall food
expenditures. Home production accounts for a larger share of
consumption in rural areas, the food-producing areas. Root crops,
tubers, fruits, vegetables, and poultry are dietary staples.

Although in some Caribbean and Latin American countries it is
common to have well-to-do households side by side with very poor
households, this is not the case in Jamaica. The wealthy and the
not-so-wealthy live in distinct neighborhoods, although in some
areas one drives through the poorer neighborhoods to reach an
affluent neighborhood. Around the Kingston metropolitan area, for
example, many wealthy people live in the hills, middle income
people live in the lower areas, and poor people live in the
flatlands.

CONSUMER MARKET
United States culture has a strong influence on Jamaica's culture.
Jamaica is just an hour's flying time from the United States, and
economic relations between the two countries are centuries old.
The flow of people between the United States and Jamaica further
accounts for this strong influence.

Tourists from the United States account for about 60 percent of
the nearly 1 million annual stopover visitors to Jamaica. Also,
tens of thousands of Jamaicans have migrated to the United States
over the years, and emigres from Jamaica to the United States
typically move back and forth. Jamaican students return after
years of living in the United States, and so do many retired
workers. U.S. goods are also dispersed by hundreds of travelers
returning to Jamaica with large boxes and suitcases brimming with
articles to be sold through informal distribution channels.

U.S. media have perhaps the strongest influence of all. The
Statistical Yearbook 1994, published by UNESCO, reports about 330
thousand television sets licensed or in use in Jamaica during
1992, most tuned to U.S. stations despite the availability of
several hours of local programming. Satellite dishes are
everywhere--on rooftops and dotting the landscape, especially in
the more affluent neighborhoods.

Radio is even more prevalent with over 1 million radio sets in the
country. Three newspapers are published daily and numerous foreign
magazines and newspapers are also available.

All of these media carry advertising for businesses and consumer
goods. Advertising agencies, both local and foreign-owned, abound
in Jamaica. The 1994/95 telephone directory for Greater Kingston
lists 67 advertising agencies and counselors, including
internationally known McCann-Erickson.

Consumer goods, whether imported or domestically produced, are
sold in modern supermarkets and malls, boutiques, and hotel gift
shops. Goods are marketed through billboards, radio and talk
shows, and sponsorships of beauty contests and sports events. U.S.
fast-food chains have franchise outlets in Jamaica, including
Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut,
Domino's, and Popeye's.

As in the United States, the use of credit and debit cards is
growing rapidly.

Telephone penetration is increasing, and in 1994 there were nearly
400,000 lines. Use of cellular phones is also increasing rapidly
with the number of cellular phone customers approaching 25,000 in
1995. Fiber optic equipment is speeding communications between
cities and rural areas and facilitating international
communication, making it ever easier and more economical to do
business in Jamaica.

LABOR FORCE
The labor force currently exceeds 1 million workers, about 44
percent of the total population and 68 percent of persons aged 14
and over (the working age in Jamaica). Female labor force
participation rates are high. Forty-one percent of women aged 14
and above are in the labor force, compared with 47 percent of
males. Jamaica's work force is well-educated and highly skilled.
The literacy ate is 98 percent. Nearly one-quarter of the work
force has some education beyond secondary level, according to
Craighead's International, Business, Travel, and Relocation Guide
1996-97, although only 4 percent have actually graduated.
Approximately 6 percent have vocational degrees. Use of
professional titles, such as Doctor or Professor, is considered
good business manners.

Unemployment is a problem in Jamaica, and women and young persons
are the hardest hit. While overall unemployment was 15 percent in
1994, the actual unemployment rate for males was 10 percent and
for females, 22 percent. Worse yet, according to Labor Force
Survey, 48 percent of those unemployed in October 1994 were
workers between the ages of 14 and 24.

Government "downsizing" through privatization accounts for some of
this unemployment--the government work force was cut by over 20
percent. Data from the Statistical Institute of Jamaica shows
employment increasing across all categories, and there has been a
steady increase in jobs in the private sector, especially in
services and in self-employment. But for workers in agriculture
and fishing, jobs are decreasing due to a decline in manufacturing
output and agricultural exports.

Direct labor costs are low by U.S. standards. In 1994, the average
hourly wage of workers in businesses with 10 or more employees was
approximately J$37, or less than $1.15. Wages are generally even
lower in establishments with fewer than 10 employees. Even so,
wages have kept pace with Consumer Price Index increases over the
last few years.

According toLA/C Business Bulletin, the government no longer sets
wage guidelines for the private sector other than the minimum
wage. In 1995, the minimum wage was increased from $J350 to J$500
per week, or from US$10.54 to US$15.05 (with the exchange rate of
J$33.22 per U.S. dollar at that time).

Although Jamaica's work force is literate and skilled, the
government is emphasizing the importance of higher and technical
education to cope with increasing labor market technology.
Despite an otherwise disciplined economic plan with limited
expenditures, the government is allocating about 10 percent of its
total spending in the 1990s to education.

Enrollment at post-secondary institutions, including the
University of the West Indies, has increased despite
implementation of a student cost-sharing plan. As a further
emphasis on the importance of technological training, the College
of Arts, Sciences, and Technology (CAST) was converted into the
University of Technology (Jamaica U Tech). Current enrollment is
over 6,000.

INFRASTRUCTURE
Jamaica has natural harbors, many of which cater to transport and
cruise vessels. There is specialization among the ports, however.
Cruise ships stop at Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, and Port Antonio.
More than 50 percent of all incoming cargo is handled at the Port
of Kingston. Most of the outgoing cargo is loaded at ports other
than Port of Kingston.

Many international shipping lines maintain offices in Jamaica, and
others are represented by various steamship agencies. Over 14
million tons of cargo were transported in and out of Jamaica in
1994. Transshipment cargo--cargo entering the country temporarily
en route to other countries--represented nearly 12 percent of
total cargo movement in 1994 and is growing rapidly.

Air traffic is served by two international airports, one located
near Kingston on the southeast end of the island, the other near
Montego Bay in the northwest. The latter airport serves most of
the tourist resort areas and accounted for two-thirds of passenger
arrivals in 1994. Fifteen foreign airlines fly in and out of
Jamaica, in addition to Air Jamaica.

THE FUTURE
In 1994, Jamaica implemented its National Industrial Policy, a
plan to upgrade the country's infrastructure to better accommodate
increasing economic activity. All ports and airports will be
upgraded, and new port transshipment facilities will be built to
take advantage of the boom in transshipment service. Construction
of a new airport terminal in Montego Bay is already underway.

The 1995-96 fiscal year is the last one during which Jamaica is
covered by an International Monetary Fund borrowing agreement.
Jamaica's economy appears to be stabilizing, although it has grown
only slightly since the start of the decade.

International reserves have grown substantially, and foreign
currency can now be obtained from banks and cambios reducing the
level of black-market activity.

 CHILE: CHILE'S DEAL WITH THE MERCOSUR: BOLIVIA TO FOLLOW?

 Chile finally signed an agreement on commercial association with the 
Mercosur on 25 June. The deal, which effectively makes Chile an associate 
member of the trading bloc, will come into force on 1 October. This deal, 
and the somewhat fudged framework agreement with Bolivia, were driven 
forward by Argentina, which held the rotating six month presidency of the 
Mercosur until the end of June. The presidency for the next term is held by 
Brazil, which is keen on making similar agreements with Colombia and 
Venezuela.

 The Mercosur's agreement with Chile will not make the country a full member 
of the Mercosur and will mean that any future agreements between the 
Mercosur and other countries will have to be agreed by the Mercosur and also 
by Chile (the so-called four plus one formula). The Argentine foreign 
minister, Guido Di Tella, admitted that Chile's position could be seen as an 
intermediate step: he said that the Mercosur would like Chile to have an 
even closer relationship and did not rule out this possibility. The big 
sticking point here though is external tariffs: Chile has a fixed 11% tariff 
while the Mercosur's tariffs range in bands from zero to 20%. 

 The agreement between the Mercosur and Chile runs to 58 articles and 27 
chapters which deal with topics such as commercial and customs arrangements, 
fiscal policy, capital movement and integration of infrastructure. The two 
sides also agreed on a dispute settlement procedure based on a panel of 
experts. Under the terms of the agreement roughly 80% of the trade between 
the Mercosur and Chile will face immediate tariff reductions of 40% and more 
than 90% of the value of the products traded between Chile and the Mercosur 
will be free of tariffs in eight years' time.

 Some products (mostly agricultural, but also carparts) have been excluded 
from the arrangement. In Chile's case these products are meat, edible oil 
and sugar. Chilean production of these products will be protected by tariffs 
for 15 years.  Chile's wheat tariffs will only start to come down after 
eight years, provided that 90% of the rest of the trade between the Mercosur 
and Chile is free of any tariff, as is envisaged. The Chilean wheat market 
will be open to its Mercosur partners from 2014.  

 Sticking points. One of the thorniest issues that had to be resolved before 
the agreement was signed was over rules of origin. The Mercosur's rule is 
that 60% of a product has to be manufactured in the Mercosur area to be 
considered local and therefore eligible to be bought and sold free of 
tariffs in the Mercosur. Chile broadly agreed with this but wanted 
exceptions made for some bottled foods, clothes and printed and computer 
goods coming from Chile.

 Argentina made a concession on textiles and shoes, agreeing that Chilean 
products could enter its market on the same terms as other Chilean products. 

 The two sides have also fudged the issue of whether in future agreements 
the concessions offered to a third country should automatically be offered 
to the other parties to this agreement. The two sides agreed to set up a 
committee to study this. 

 One big attraction of the deal with Chile from the Mercosur's point of view 
is Chilean agreement for the use of its ports to ship Mercosur products to 
the booming markets of East Asia. 

 Bolivia. Di Tella said that the Mercosur and Bolivia had agreed on 
mechanisms covering 80% of the trade between the Mercosur and Bolivia. They 
failed, however, to sort out a deal for the other products. Bolivia wanted 
an asymmetrical deal under which the Mercosur would open its market to 50% 
of Bolivia's exports but Bolivia would only open up to 25% of the Mercosur's 
exports. Bolivia also wanted a special deal on local content: 40% instead of 
the Mercosur's 60%.

 The two sides have now come to an agreement: signing a framework document 
at the end of June that commits them to negotiating a free trade deal within 
90 days. This deal is supposed to come into force on 1 January 1997. 

 According to Alejandro Mayoral, the Argentine foreign trade minister, what 
the Mercosur has done with Chile is sign a framework agreement that will 
allow each Mercosur country to then sort out bilaterally its tariff 
arrangements with Bolivia. This, he pointed out, was very different from 
what had been arranged with Chile, and the framework agreement with Bolivia 
was more likely to be a model for future Mercosur trade agreements with 
Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, Mayoral said. 

 He argued that this was an extension of the old Aladi (Asociacion 
Latinoamericana de Integracion) system, which grades each country according 
to its economic development and uses this as a basis for fixing trade 
preferences. This means that each country in the Mercosur could have 
different trade arrangements with a third country with tariffs ranging from 
12% to 41%.

 REGION: HELMS BURTON: PREPARING FOR RETALIATION: TO TRY AND HEAD OFF THE US

 So far the US has only been criticised for approving the Helms-Burton law 
which seeks to penalise non-US companies which do business or invest in 
Cuba. The law was even discussed at the recent G7 summit in France: the 
other industrialised countries made it clear to the US that they disagreed 
with the law but agreed to wait a bit longer before they launched a 
concerted protest at an international body such as the World Trade 
Organisation.

 What everybody is waiting for is 15 July. By then President Bill Clinton 
has to decide whether to allow the sanctions envisaged by the Helms-Burton 
Act to be imposed. If he does so, he is likely to trigger a welter of 
reprisals from two of the US's most important trade partners, Canada and 
Mexico.

 The penalties envisaged by the Helms-Burton law (or to give it its proper 
title, The Cuban Liberation and Democratic Solidarity Act) are due to come 
into force from 1 August. Last month the US published details of how it 
would apply these provisions of the Act (the so-called Title III) and a list 
of which companies would be subject to them.

 Blacklist. In accordance with the law, the US warned three companies that 
they were falling foul of the Helms-Burton Act by using assets which were 
claimed by their original US owners. The three companies are Sherritt 
International, a nickel mining company which uses nickel deposits and 
equipment claimed by Freeport MacMoRan; Domos from Mexico and Stet from 
Italy, both of which are developing Cuba's telephone system with assets 
claimed by the US company AT&T. Though these companies have 45 days to 
withdraw from Cuba or face the penalties, they have all said that they will 
not withdraw from Cuba.

 On the other hand Cementos Mexicanos, the world's third largest cement 
company, has bowed to US pressure and told Washington that it will withdraw 
from Cuba. Cemex had already suspended its activities in there as a 
precautionary measure. 

 Around 340 Mexican companies, all with business and investments in Cuba, 
could be affected by the Helms-Burton Act. 

 So far, Mexico has taken a more conciliatory attitude to the Act than 
Canada. Mexico seems determined to go through all the Nafta hoops before it 
starts to take reprisals. Canada, on the other hand, has already prepared 
its retaliatory legislation. It is only using the Nafta mechanisms as a 
back-up. 

 Nafta hoops. Mexico has asked for a meeting of the Free Trade Commission, 
which is composed of the three countries' trade ministers, to discuss the 
issue raised by the Helms-Burton Act. Mexico intends to argue that the 
Helms-Burton Act violates Nafta. Herminio Blanco, the secretario de Comercio 
y Fomento Industrial (Secofi), called for the  meeting under Article 2.007 
of Nafta.

 Canada. Blanco's Canadian counterpart, Arthur Eggleton, has also called for 
a trade ministers' meeting but has already drafted retaliatory action. 
Canada had previously held two bilateral meetings with the US on this issue, 
to no avail.

 Eggleton accused the US of taking aim at its foes but shooting its friends. 
He said Canada was the US's closest ally and that if the US has a 
disagreement with Cuba it should not take it out on Canada.

 Canada's government has drawn up legislation which would allow its citizens 
to sue in Canadian courts to recover any losses caused by Helms-Burton and 
to block the enforcement in Canada of judgments handed down under any 
objectionable foreign law, such as  the Helms-Burton Act. 

 The Canadian legislation is in the  form of an amendment to the Foreign 
Extraterritorial Measures Act. The amendment also raises the maximum fine 
under Fema from Can Dollars 10,000 to US Dollars 1m to match the maximum 
imposed by Helms-Burton.

 The government, which has been criticised for proposing the changes as 
amendments to a current act rather than proposing them to parliament, says 
that the counter-measures will be in place by 1 November. This is the first 
date by which companies could be punished by Helms-Burton. 

 Pre-emptive. The Canadian action is specifically designed to stop President 
Bill Clinton authorising implementation of the penalisation clauses of the 
Helms-Burton Act. The President has the right to impose or suspend the 
provisions of the law according to his view of events in Cuba, though the 
first period of authorisation expires in mid-July.

 Concerns. Both Canada and Mexico are worried that their companies and 
nationals could be punished by the US for doing business with Cuba. The most 
controversial provision of the Helms-Burton Act gives US companies the right 
to sue any company in the world for the losses it claims to have suffered 
from the use of its expropriated assets in Cuba.

 Besides this, the US government also has the right to refuse entry to 
executives (and their families) of companies who trade and invest in Cuba. 
Already the children of some senior executives at Mexican companies with 
extensive businesses in Cuba, have been withdrawn from US universities. 

 Mexican companies trade and invest extensively in Cuba. In 1995 the two 
countries exchanged goods and services worth US Dollars 363m, according to 
Secofi. This was nearly twice as much as in 1994. 

 Mexican argument. Herminio Blanco at Secofi argues that the Helms-Burton 
Act clearly infringes both chapter 11 and chapter 16 of Nafta, which 
enshrine the free circulation of investment, trade and businessmen 
throughout the territory of the three Nafta signatories. 

 Schedule. Under the terms of Nafta, a commission has to be convened within 
10 days of one of the members calling for it. (Both Mexico and Canada have 
done so). The Mexicans lodged their application on 18 June, but the 
commission failed to meet by the beginning of July. Nafta rules stipulate 
that as the next stage a complainant can call for a Nafta panel to be set up 
to consider the issues. This panel, which will be composed of experts and 
officials, has five months to reach a decision.

 Reprisals. Although the Mexican government's line appears to be to exhaust 
Nafta procedures before taking unilateral action, some Mexican senators are 
already preparing retaliatory legislation. Rodolfo Becerril Straffon, a 
member of the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional and chairman of 
the senate's trade committee, has tabled a draft bill which would penalise 
companies owned by Cuban-Americans which wanted to do business in Mexico. 
Another suggestion is that companies that withdraw from Cuba because of the 
Helms-Burton law should be fined. 

 Becerril Straffon said that the tricky part of such a bill was to ensure 
that it did not lead to further countermeasures by the US against Mexican 
companies trying to do business in the US. The senate has plenty of time to 
come up with a solution, as it is currently in recess and not due to 
reassemble until September. 

 The senate reckons it is in a strong position. It notes that according to 
Secofi, Mexico's imports from the US increased from US Dollars 41.6bn in 
1994 to US Dollars 46.3bn in 1995. 

 Cuba. The island's government is also working hard on ways of getting 
around Helms-Burton, the Cuban minister of foreign investment, Ibrahim 
Ferradaz said. He refused, however, to go into details about what the 
government would (or could) do. He pointed out that the international 
community had objected in very strong terms to the law and the people most 
penalised by it would be US executives wanting to do business in Cuba.

 The minister was speaking during a trip to Europe last month (June) to 
promote Cuba's new free trade zones. Although no zones have yet been 
created, there is legislation in the works to set them up, probably in 
Mariel, Cienfuegos and the area around the airport at Havana. Ferradaz said 
that the legislation would be designed to attract foreign investors and 
create jobs. 

 Regional objections. Apart from Canada and Mexico, the US's closest allies 
in the region reckon that the US has overstepped the mark. Venezuela's 
foreign minister, Miguel Angel Burelli, said that Helms-Burton broke the 
first principle of international law which was that one country could not 
apply its laws to another. He said that Venezuela would continue to do 
business with Cuba and not stop businessmen from travelling there. 

 Burelli noted that the OAS had also asked its legal committee to comment on 
the scope of the Helms-Burton Act. He said that 32 of the 34 members of the 
OAS had voted for the report on the Act. [Dominica was an absentee, while 
the US voted against].

 Honduras was another country to support the OAS report. The foreign 
minister, Delmer Urbizo Panting, said that there were some elements of 
extraterritoriality about the law which needed clarification. 

 Russia: An official close to the Russian foreign minister, Yuri Primakov, 
said that he doubted that the Helms-Burton Act would affect Russia's 
relations with Cuba. 

 Mexico: Three Mexican daily newspapers, La Jornada, El Financiero and 
Excelsior are now free to circulate in Cuba. Currently Excelsior is sending 
about 50 copies a day to the island. The papers are sold for dollars in 
tourist resorts. Other foreign publications on sale in Cuba include Hola, 
Cambio 16 and El Pais from Spain, Le Monde from France and Corriere della 
Sera from Italy. 

 Spain: The right-wing government of prime minister Jose Maria Aznar is 
taking the most pro-US line. Aznar announced that Spain would stop official 
cooperation with the Cuban government. The projects covered by this 
programme are minuscule (the only one still running is for a bakery) but the 
symbolic effects of the suspension are far more significant. The Cuban 
government is fretting that Spain might end a US Dollars 160m credit line 
which insures Spanish exporters to Cuba. Another vulnerable project is the 
Instituto de Cooperacion Iberoamericana which is providing US Dollars 2m to 
help repair one of Havana's aqueducts. 

 Chile: The Chilean government said that seven Chilean companies could be 
vulnerable to the Helms-Burton Act. The bulk of the companies involved have 
made investments in Cuba's citrus industry, though one has invested in the 
shoe industry and another in the tourism sector. The companies involved are: 
Zapatos Dolphin and in the fruit sector Ingelsco, New World Fruit and Pole. 
The three companies with tourism investments are Latinexim, Santa Ana and 
Inmobiliara Santa Cruz. Altogether Chilean companies have invested about US 
Dollars 60m in Cuba.

 The right in Chile alleges a US Dollars 23m credit line to finance Chilean 
humanitarian exports to Cuba from the Banco del Estado de Chile has been 
used to finance newsprint which is used for propaganda.

 REGION: AROUND THE BLOCS

 Mexico: Mexico's trade is becoming even more dominated by its North 
American partners, the official Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia 
e Informatica reports. It noted that despite government efforts to diversify 
the country's trade, the US and Canada accounted for 86% of Mexico's exports 
and supplied 78% of its imports. In the comparable period of 1995 the 
figures were 80% for Mexican exports and 70% for Mexican purchases.

 Mexico's free trade deals with other Latin American countries (Bolivia, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile and Venezuela) are not doing as well. In the 
first quarter of this year only 8% of Mexico's exports went to Latin America 
and only 5% of its imports came from the region. Only Chile, among Mexico's 
regional partners, has seen its exports to Mexico increase between the first 
quarter of 1995 and the first quarter of 1996.

 Overall Mexico's exports in the first quarter were US Dollars 21.9bn and 
its imports were US Dollars 20.3bn. 

 Chile/Mercosur trade: Chile's trade with the Mercosur boomed last year. In 
1995 Chilean exports to the four Mercosur countries were US Dollars 1.77bn. 
This was 157% up on 1994's figure.

 The Mercosur's exports to Chile increased by 154% in 1995 to US Dollars 
2.56bn.

 Chile/Mercosur deal:  President Eduardo Frei has agreed that congress 
should have the right to vote on the trade deal with the Mercosur. 
Previously the government had been unwilling to do this arguing that the 
deal was an extension or modification of existing Aladi arrangements and 
therefore there was no need for congress to become involved. The opposition 
parties had argued that the deal was in fact a treaty and therefore should 
be submitted to congress.

 The foreign minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, said that the President was 
making a goodwill gesture and not setting a precedent.

 EU: The EU's relations with the Mercosur are getting closer. An EU 
commissioner, Miguel Marin, attended the recent Mercosur summit in Argentina 
(at which the deal with Chile was signed) Earlier the EU's (almost 
powerless) parliament agreed a framework trade agreement with the Mercosur. 

 Labour challenge: Three groups from Mexico and the US are protesting over 
alleged labour violations in Mexico. Human Rights Watch/Americas, the 
International Labor Rights Fund and the Mexican Association of Democratic 
lawyers submitted a petition in mid-June to the US National Administration 
Office claiming that the Mexican government has not upheld workers rights 
and in particular has impeded their freedom of association and their legal 
rights of a fair trial and appeal. 

 The case will go a long way to settling whether Nafta can be used to uphold 
Mexican labour rights. The USNAO was set up to respond to violations of the 
North American Agreement on Labour Rights, commonly known as the Nafta side 
agreement on labour.

 In their petition the three groups accuse Mexico's federal conciliation and 
arbitration tribunal of repeatedly violating the labour side agreement in 
its deals with the former union at the fishing ministry.

 According to the petition, the tribunal has prevented members of the 
independent fishing ministry union (the Sindicato Unico de Trabajadores de 
Secretaria de Pesca) from exercising their right of freedom of association 
and to organise a union. This behaviour started in 1995, when the union ws 
replaced by one that was more loyal to the ruling PRI. The tribunal, which 
deals with issues involving public sector employees, used a law that 
prevents government agencies recognising more than one government entity. 
Once the new union was recognised the SUTSP was outlawed. 

 The executive director of Human rights Watch/ Americas, Miguel Vivanco, 
argues that what the tribunal has done falls into a pattern in which the 
laws and structures of pro-government unions in Mexico are used to inhibit 
independent union activity. he said that he hoped Nafta's labour rights' 
side agreement would be strong enough to resolve both the case and the 
fishing ministry's wider problem. 

 The USNAO panel has 60 days to decide whether to take the case. Even if it 
does, it has no powers to force a change or a remedy upon Mexico. The Human 
Rights Watch/America people realise this and say that the true test will be 
how the Mexican government reacts to the findings. 

 The omens are not good. The government failed to act even after the SUTSP 
won some favourable rulings in the Mexican courts.

 On the other hand, the ILO argues that this case is much stronger than 
previous cases dismissed by the USNAO because it focuses on the law than 
restricts the number of unions in federal workplaces. This law is, according 
to Joel Solomon, Human Rights Watch's research director, a clear violation 
of the Nafta side agreement that guarantees that workers can organise unions 
free of government interference. 

 The Mexican counterpart to the USNAO is currently  considering a claim from 
the Mexican telecommunication workers' union which claims that a US company, 
Sprint, closed down a San Francisco office to prevent a unionising effort by 
235 employees. The Mexican NAO has agreed to delay action until the US 
National Labor Relations Board makes its final ruling on the case. 

 Costa Rica-Chile: The two countries have agreed on an investment protection 
deal. The deal will be signed during President Eduardo Frei's visit to Costa 
Rica in July. This has suddenly become important following the purchase of 
the Del Monte fresh fruit company (which has US Dollars 200m worth of 
investments in Costa Rica) by Chilean investors. Chilean companies also have 
important investments in the Costa Rican fertiliser company, Fertica. 

 Mercosur/Textiles: Brazil has agreed not to cut the period for financing 
textile imports from six months to one month. Its Mercosur partners had said 
that this measure would damage their textile exports to Brazil. Brazil has 
also been criticised by Paraguay and Uruguay respectively for blocking 
exports of dairy goods and rice from its two neighbours.

 MEXICO: WHY ZEDILLO MUST PROSECUTE RAUL SALINAS TO BOLSTER LAW AND ORDER

 As we warned last month, President Ernesto Zedillo's run of luck so far 
this year was overdue a reverse. The government has had a bad month: the 
unrest in the south of the country, which we examine in some detail in this 
issue, has been capped by the appearance of the Ejercito Popular 
Revolucionario in Guerrero. Political analysts in Mexico have hinted very 
broadly that the EPR may be a group of agentes provocateurs, set up by the 
authorities to justify a crackdown.

 The yearning for law and order is not confined to the government. Even the 
EPR called for more law and order in its Declaracion de Aguas Blancas: a 
strange demand for a group that is also apparently calling for the overthrow 
of the state.

 Opinion polls in Mexico City show that the rise in crime is the main 
concern. This is why the President's decision to replace Mexico City's 
police chief with a general (who in turn has appointed soldiers to key 
positions) may well be politically astute. 

 Yet establishing the rule of law means, as the ordinary Mexican 
understands, curbing the rule of men. This means that the government has to 
make up its mind about the Salinas brothers. There is growing evidence that 
Raul Salinas de Gortari made money because his brother was President. So far 
the focus of the investigatory efforts, both official and by the media, have 
been on Raul. His brother, and other key people in his entourage, have just 
as many questions to answer. 

 If President Zedillo is serious about reform, unraveling the tangled 
affairs of the Salinas brothers is vital. Raul must be brought to trial. 

 The case will clearly pose a serious problem for the ruling Partido 
Revolucionario Institucional where the Salinas brothers still have large 
numbers of supporters. But Zedillo could turn this to his advantage, using 
the case to separate the party from the government, which is the key 
objective of his political reform programme. 

 Zedillo could also argue that such a dramatic court case, culminating in 
the conviction of Raul, could help the PRI in next year's mid-term 
elections. And the PRI is going to need all the help it can get.

 The economy is still centrifuging: the export companies and the rich are 
doing well but for the domestic economy and the poor life is getting 
tougher. It seems almost inevitable that the US Federal Reserve will start 
to raise short-term US interest rates in the autumn to slow down the US 
economy. Once this happens, Mexican exporters may well start to feel the 
pressure.

 MEXICO: GUERRERO: ANOTHER REVOLT?: OR AGENTES PROVACATEURS

 The government tried to play down the sudden appearance of another 
guerrilla army, the Ejercito Popular Revolucionario, in Guerrero. The 
guerrillas, who appeared to be well-equipped and armed with new guns, made 
their appearance on 28 June at Aguas Blancas, the site of a brutal massacre 
of 17 peasants exactly a year earlier: that massacre and the revelation of 
the ham-fisted attempt by the governor of the state, Ruben Figueroa, to make 
it appear that the peasants were armed, forced his resignation earlier this 
year.

 Upstage. The EPR's sudden appearance upstaged 5,000 other political figures 
who had come to pay homage to the peasants killed in the massacre. Among the 
notables attending the ceremony at Aguas Blancas, was Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 
the left-wing presidential candidate (and probable victor) in 1988. He was 
clearly surprised by the EPR's appearance and annoyed when they started to 
read a document they called the Declaracion de Aguas Blancas. 

 This declaration appeared to be a justification for the armed struggle. It 
termed the government anti-democratic and committed to protecting the 
interests of foreigners and the business class. The document claimed that, 
against a background of institutionalised violence, the armed struggle was a 
legitimate and necessary means for a people to recover their national 
sovereignty and the rule of law.

 The EPR. The guerrillas themselves numbered about 100, according to those 
at the ceremony. The Secretaria de Gobernacion and the Procuraduria General 
de la Republica were more precise: they said that exactly 38 'armed persons' 
interrupted the ceremony as it was concluding. 

 The guerrillas had their faces hidden with balaclavas and handkerchiefs 
(like the Zapatistas) and were dressed in olive-green military fatigues. 
They were armed with AK-47s, which are known in Mexico as cuernos de chivo 
(goats' horns). 

 The guerrillas laid flowers at the tombs of the massacred peasants before 
reading out their declaration. During the reading of this document, the 
guerrillas claimed that they numbered 500 and were active right across the 
mountains in the south of the state. They said that the organisation had 
arisen after men and women from the oppressed sectors of society had 
realised that they must organise themselves to fight back against their 
exploiters.

 One theme that runs through the declaration is the need for justice. This, 
the EPR reckons, can only be achieved by overthrowing the existing 
government. 

 One significant difference between the EPR and the Zapatistas is that the 
EPR does not make any claims to be speaking for the Indians. The EPR also 
seems to be much more aggressive: it called for the creation of popular 
tribunals to judge enemies of the people. 

 On the evening of 29 June, the EPR (apparently) stopped motorists on the 
highway between Mexico City and Acapulco and gave them copies of the 
Declaracion de Aguas Blancas. This led to a confrontation with the police. 
The guerrillas, according to the police, opened fire on them from a lorry 
which they were using to block the road. Three policemen and one civilian 
were wounded in the exchange of fire before the masked members of the EPR 
escaped. The police say that they found weapons and explosives in the lorry. 

 Government response. Like the PRD, the federal government doubted that the 
EPR was anything more than a publicity stunt. The government said that the 
only subversive groups in the mountains were drug traffickers and criminal 
bands.

 Nevertheless, the federal government sent 3,000 troops and police up into 
the mountains to try and flush out the guerrillas. The government said it 
would ensure that the army took more care than it did in Chiapas, where it 
was used to reclaim territory occupied by the Ejercito Zapatista de la 
Liberacion Nacional in 1994.

 Guerrero, more than Chiapas, has a reputation in Mexico for being the last 
redoubt of guerrilla bands. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the remnants 
of Maoist focos holed up in the mountains. They were only dispersed when 
their ideological leader, professor Lucio Cabanas was killed in December 
1974. Cabanas was the leader of the Partido de los Pobres. 

 Criticism. Unlike the Zapatistas, whose leader subcomandante Marcos 
impressed the middle-classes with his wit and general air of romance, the 
EPR has annoyed the middle classes. One of the most annoyed was Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas, one of the PRD's most senior figures. The EPR's arrival at the 
tombs of the massacred peasants interrupted his eulogy of them. All of the 
murdered peasants had been PRD members. 

 Cardenas and other senior PRD figures at the ceremony left Aguas Blancas 
almost as soon as the guerrillas appeared. Cardenas then issued a fierce 
statement from Mexico City. He called the EPR's appearance a grotesque 
pantomime. He said that the appearance of the group 'disguised as guerrillas 
would have been unimportant if it was not for the fact that they were 
carrying heavy weapons.' He called the 'guerrillas' both 'irresponsible' and 
'provocative'. He accused them of being under the control of those who had 
ordered the killing of the 17 peasants a year earlier. 

 Other politicians as well as NGOs, the Church and businessmen have said 
that an armed uprising is a dead end and that the EPR risks undoing what the 
Zapatistas have achieved. 

 Gonzalo Ituarte, a priest in San Cristobal de la Casas, said that the EPR 
would definitely have an effect on the peace talks between the government 
and the Zapatistas but it is still too early to speculate on what the effect 
will be. 

 Some analysts have even claimed that the EPR is a group of agentes 
provocateurs, set up by the authorities to link the left-wing Partido de la 
Revolucion Democratica to guerrillas and more importantly, head off the 
investigation into who knew what about the cover-up of the massacre at Aguas 
Blancas.

 This scepticism is shared by locals who say that the army has been 
patrolling the mountains for the past couple of years and found traces of 
guerrillas. In Chiapas, it should be remembered, the army found several 
camps six months before the Zapatistas seized San Cristobal and the other 
towns on 1 January 1994. The army, though, thought that the camps were not 
important.

 MEXICO: OAXACA: MORE GUERRILLAS?: PRD CLAIMS

 Hector Sanchez, a PRD senator and a likely candidate for the governorship 
of the state, claims that Oaxaca, a traditionally polarised state, is also 
on the point of revolt. He claimed that there were guerrillas to the south 
and east of the state and in the northern Indian communities there was a 
feeling that the political system had failed them and they needed to resort 
to arms to make their points.

 Sanchez claimed that the state government, headed by Diodoro Carrasco, was 
to blame for letting the situation get out of hand. He said that the 
Oaxquenos are irritated at what is happening in Chiapas, where Indian issues 
are (now) treated delicately.

 Oaxaca, which was the scene of bitter feuds and fighting in the Revolution, 
is still a very Indian state. According to the 1990 census, 40% of the 
state's 3m inhabitants  either speak an Indian language or are dependents of 
a head of a family who is either bi-lingual or a monoglot speaker of an 
Indian language.

 Government. According to the senator, the state government does not realise 
that the state is a tinderbox. He accused the government of not realising 
that the chorus of complaints were about similar things: political 
assassinations, squabbles over the results of elections, crime, the 
hopelessness of the law enforcement agencies, the use of troops in the state 
and the lack of democratic accountability were all part of the same story. 
The state government prefers to view each case as a product of a unique 
circumstance. 

 Carrasco admitted that there had been and there still were social problems 
in the state and pressure for the fight against poverty to be speeded up but 
he flatly denied that any of the agitators on social questions had links to 
armed groups, with political and ideological objectives. 

 The senator claimed, in Proceso, a news magazine, that the heavy handed use 
of troops to try and prevent the Zapatistas establishing their organisation 
in Oaxaca could trigger an uprising. The army, under the pretext of clamping 
down on drug traffickers, has been moving into Indian villages and 
interrogating Indian leaders. The focus of this activity has been in the 
Sierra Sur where hundreds of police and soldiers have been searching for 
Zapatistas.

 Politics. What is clear is that electoral violence (including 
assassination) is on the increase in the state. According to Proceso, there 
have been at least 11 political assassinations in the past six months. In 
April alone first Feliciano Riano Lopez, the president of the Comisariado de 
Bienes Comunales de San Lucas Atoyaquillo and two of his supporters were 
gunned down by a group, presumably hired by local landowners, and then 
Orlando Guerra Guerra, a leader of the local left-wing opposition was killed 
by Mariano Guerra Lopez, the mayor and a member of the ruling Partido 
Revolucionario Institucional.

 MEXICO: CHIAPAS: MASSACRE: IN NORTH OF STATE

 The outbreak of political violence in the north of the state in June has 
left 26 people dead. In the first half of 1996, clashes between the ruling 
Partido Revolucionario Institucional and the opposition Partido de la 
Revolucion Democratica and the Partido de Trabajo have cost 34 lives.

 According to the opposition parties and human rights organisations, the PRI 
is backed by thugs known as guardias blancas. These groups are financed by 
local landowners and politicians and even federal deputies. 

 The violence may be the start of an attack on civil society, said Samuel 
Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. He is also the president of 
the Comision Nacional de Intermediacion, which is trying to mediate between 
the government and the Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional.

 The people behind the killings, according to the bishop, are being backed 
by the authorities. He said that in several cases where witnesses were 
prepared to testify the authorities refused to act. he said that the 
killings had been responsible for driving 800 peasants from their homes.

 The bishop pointed out that the authorities, instead of acting, preferred 
to blame priests for fomenting the social unrest in the area and even 
sometimes being involved in murder. He also claimed that the authorities 
were using evangelical Christians to try and weaken the support for the 
Roman Catholic Church in the area of conflict. 

 The big problem in the state, besides the Zapatistas, is land. The peasants 
want to use it for subsistence farming while the landowners prefer ranching. 
According to figures from the state government, 80% of the people in the 
area where the killings are most numerous are illiterate and landless. 

 Zapatistas: The government is due to hold another round of talks with the 
Zapatistas on 8 July. This will follow their Foro Especial Para la Reforma 
del Estado, which was scheduled for the first week of July. As a token of 
good faith, the Zapatistas would like the government to release 17 
Zapatistas held in prison and cancel the arrest warrants for other Zapatista 
leaders. The government negotiators, in the form of the Comision de 
Concordia y Pacificacion, are disposed to agree.

 MEXICO: POLITICAL REFORM: PRD PROTESTS OVER TABASCO: AND WITHDRAWS FROM 
political reform talks

 The left-wing Partido de la Revolucion Democratica has withdrawn from the 
political reform debate that is being held in the national congress. The 
PRD's decision, which is more symbolic than practical, came after President 
Ernesto Zedillo made a visit to Roberto Madrazo, the governor of Tabasco on 
25 June. The PRD saw this visit as a gesture of support for Madrazo.

 The government accused the PRD of trying to use the negotiations over 
political reform as a lever to achieve its own political ends. The PRD is 
well aware that the main opposition party scored a success by refusing to 
take part in the negotiations over political reform until the result of an 
election in Huejotzingo, in the backwoods of Puebla, had been resolved in 
its favour. 

 The PRD has accused Madrazo, and produced supporting evidence, of breaking 
the legal limit on how much could be spent on his (successful) election 
campaign in 1994. According to the PRD, Madrazo spent 128m pesos on his 
campaign: at the then prevailing exchange rate that was US Dollars 43m (or 
more than President Bill Clinton spent on his election campaign in 1992). 
The defeated PRD candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said that the 
President's visit to Madrazo was unwise and provocative. Wisely, Lopez 
Obrador chose to spend the day of the President's visit in Monterrey, in 
Nuevo Leon. Lopez Obrador is one of the three candidates to take over from 
Porfirio Munoz Ledo as president of the PRD.

 The PRD has accused Madrazo of taking money from some doubtful sources, as 
well as breaking the law on election spending. In particular, the party has 
accused him of taking US Dollars 4m from Carlos Cabal Peniche, the former 
head of the (now bust) Banco Union-Cremi. Peniche is now on the run, with 
warrants out for his arrest. He has been accused of using his fresh fruit 
business as a front for drug-running.

 Violence. The PRD was also angry at being blamed for the violence that 
accompanied Zedillo's visit. There were riots in the capital Villahermosa 
which left 20 people injured. 

 The riots were at their worst when the President visited the state's 
Procuraduria General de Justicia. The PRD claims that the riots were caused 
by the PRI, which assembled 200 thugs, armed them with machetes and then set 
them loose. The PRD said that the people who caused all the trouble had also 
demonstrated in favour of Roberto Madrazo. The PRD admitted to trying to 
seal off the capital from the rest of the state for the duration of the 
President's visit but claimed that its protest was peaceable. It said that 
the police did nothing to stop its supporters manning the roadblocks from 
being attacked by the Priistas 

 According to the authorities, the PRD's supporters blocked the roads 
leading to Villahermosa and burnt a  bus that was bringing Priistas to a 
rally in the city. The authorities also say that the PRD burnt a lorry as 
well as causing damage to other vehicles. The authorities said that two of 
the PRD's leaders, Julio Cesar Alvarez Santos and Alejandrino Alvarez, were 
leading attacks by PRD supporters on the passengers in the bus. Both men are 
local PRD deputies. The authorities also claimed that another PRD leader, 
the federal deputy, Octavio Romero, was leading another band of Perredistas 
who were blocking the road between Villahermosa and Ciudad del Carmen. 

 The unrest around Villahermosa led to the President cutting short his visit 
and departing from his published schedule. After the President had left, 
somebody threw a petrol bomb at Lopez Obrador's house in Villahermosa. 

 Demand. The PRD has now demanded that the national congress declare Tabasco 
ungovernable and that the current state government should be replaced. What 
the federal PRD deputies are asking is for the national congress to declare 
that the authorities in Tabasco have lost their powers, technically 
desaparicion de poderes. 

 This is a legal term which can only be declared by the federal congress. It 
means that the federal authorities recognise that the state government no 
longer has the legal and political authority to carry out its duties.

 The PRD argues that the state government is no longer in control and that 
the federal authorities must now, as the constitution envisages, step into 
the breach. One PRD leader in the state, Rafael Lopez Cruz, made the barely 
veiled threat that there was a danger of people in Tabasco taking the law 
into their own hands. 

 The PRD pointed out that the day after the President's visit, Priistas had 
stormed the XEVA radio station to broadcast a message of support for 
Madrazo. They added that two days after the President's visit, local Priista 
deputies and officials had attacked Julio Cesar Alvarez Santos, the PRD 
deputy and supposed leader of the demonstrations on the day of the 
President's visit, in the local congress. 

 Federal level. The PRD has also called on the federal Procuraduria General 
to complete its investigation into Madrazo's election expenses. The local 
PRI had tried to claim that the federal authorities had no rights to 
investigate elections in the state, but the supreme court ruled against 
them. The Procuraduria investigation, though, is proceeding slowly.

 The PRD denies that it is playing politics over constitutional reform. The 
head of the party in the lower house, Jesus Ortega, said that the first 
condition for the party's resumption of talks is that the PRI publish its 
final, edited version of its proposals for constitutional reform.

 The second condition was that the main parties should set up a so-called 
mesa de coyuntura which would sort out the politics of introducing the 
reforms. The PRD would be happy for the question of Madrazo's election to be 
settled at the same time. 

 The PRD's third condition for rejoining the discussions is that the 
authorities in Tabasco should abandon their attempt to gaol the Perredistas 
whom they blame for the riots during the President's visit. 

 State of play. The discussions on constitutional reforms are currently 
trying to take on board the proposals made by the Partido Accion Nacional. 
The PAN had withdrawn from the discussions for three months, during which 
the PRI, PRD and the Partido de Trabajo, reached an agreement in April. The 
PAN wanted to get the result of an election in Huejotzingo overturned. 

 After winning its point a month ago, the PAN rejoined the discussions in 
congress. Currently legislators are considering 27 modifications to the 
constitution and a further 80 amendments to other laws. 

 The main change, which is supported by all the parties, is for the 
President and congress to surrender their (dominating) roles in the 
Instituto Federal Electoral. The IFE is in charge of running federal 
elections. The current proposal is that there should be an absolute majority 
of independents on the IFE board and that its president should be chosen by 
at least two thirds of congress. 

 The parties have also agreed that the Tribunal Federal Electoral, which is 
responsible for resolving election disputes, should now be answerable to the 
supreme court rather than the President. 

 A mechanism for the allocation of federal funds for elections was also 
agreed by the two parties: 70% should be awarded according to votes won 
while 30% should be awarded in inverse proportion to votes won. The 
government has also conceded that Mexicans resident abroad should be allowed 
to vote.

 The parties are now trying to find ways of turning these agreements in 
principle into legislation.  

 PAN. After getting its way over Huejotzingo, the PAN is now trying to 
behave in a statesmanlike way. Its president, Felipe Calderon Hinojosa, said 
that the riots in Tabasco did nobody any good.

 The party's secretary general, Juan Antonio Garcia Villa, has accused the 
ruling PRI of deliberately trying to stall the electoral reform programme. 
He accused the PRI of wanting to keep the negotiations deliberately 
ambiguous. The PAN's congressional leader, Ricardo Garcia Cervantes, accused 
the PRI of delaying talks for meetings where no firm proposals were made or 
crazy ideas were floated. 

 Garcia Cervantes pointed out that the politicians were running out of time. 
He said they had to agree on reforms, by the end of this month (July) at the 
very latest. If this did not happen, it was unlikely that the 1997 mid-term 
elections would be held under the new system. 

 The PAN complains that the PRI refuses to distinguish its position from the 
other parties. This, it says, will enable everybody to reach compromises 
that will work.

 MEXICO: THE PRD ELECTION: THREE CANDIDATES: 1.4M VOTERS

 The country's third largest party, the left-wing Partido de la Revolucion 
Democratica is electing its new president on 14 July. The PRD's  1.2m 
members are all entitled to vote in the secret ballot. 

 The three candidates are Heberto Castillo, a veteran senator from Veracruz; 
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the PRD leader in Tabasco and Amalia Garcia, a 
member of the party's national committee.

 Our bet is that Lopez Obrador will be elected. He is younger than Castillo 
and better known than Garcia. Castillo is the most interesting: he is 
campaigning on a platform of better organisation for the party and a 
harnessing of support from environmentalists and other activists. 

 The winner will take over from Porfirio Munoz Ledo, one of the senior 
Priistas who left the ruling party in 1987 to support Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in 
his run for the presidency in 1998.

 Mass suffrage. In order to enable most of its members to vote, the party 
expects to set up 6,000 polling booths across the country. Gerardo Unzueta, 
the head of the PRD's election committee and a former member of the Partido 
Comunista,  says that this part of the election alone will cost US Dollars 
400,000. 

 This will be the first time that a political party in Mexico has used a 
method that allows (most) of its members to vote. Previously, parties such 
as the PAN (the clericalist opposition party) held special congresses to 
elect members.

 The PRD claims that this method is the most democratic way to elect a new 
leader. The PRD says that it will even allow members who join at the polling 
station to vote.

 The party expects voting to be heaviest in the capital where it claims to 
have 135,000 members. It also has 48,000 members in Chiapas and 33,000 in 
Jalisco. Other important states are Sonora with 27,000 and Cardenas's home 
state of Michoacan, which has 25,000 perredistas. 

 PAN: Vicente Fox, the governor of Guanajuato and a possible presidential 
candidate in 2000, if the constitution is changed to allow the children of 
foreign nationals to become President, shocked both the PAN and the country 
by saying that Petroleos Mexicanos should be privatised. Fox, who was 
recently on a visit to New York, was quoted as saying that Pemex, a national 
icon, should be sold off. Although Fox has not denied what he was reported 
to have said, he has backed away from repeating it.

 Fox has long had a stormy relationship with some of the more orthodox 
Panistas, such as the former party president Carlos Castillo Peraza. Fox is 
widely thought to be out of sympathy with the current party president (and 
Castillo protege) Felipe Calderon Hinojosa. 

 In a long interview in Proceso, Fox appears to rule out an alliance between 
the PAN and the PRD in either of the next two elections (the mid-term 
congressional elections in 1997 and the presidential elections in 2000). He 
points out that under the current election law, alliances between registered 
parties are specifically outlawed. Indeed the PRD had to become a new party 
in order to fight elections as the party of the united left.

 MEXICO: THE DROUGHT: MAIZE IMPORTS TO DOUBLE TO 7M T IN 1996: STRUCTURAL 
adjustment in agriculture

 The consequences of the drought in northern Mexico are beginning to become 
severe. On 30 May, 400 women and children stopped a train at San Nicolas de 
los Garza, near Monterrey, by putting cement bars across the tracks: they 
then carried away 40 tonnes of food in buckets. On 11 June, 50 youths 
stopped a grain train in the same area and raided it. 

 According to Mexican Commentary, a twice-weekly E-mail publication, an 
official report on the drought in Chihuahua found that 77 indigenous people 
(mostly children and the elderly) had died because of malnutrition and 
associated conditions in the first four months of the year.

 As we have reported regularly this year, the drought has become steadily 
worse. At the end of June, Proceso  published an in-depth report on the 
state of Mexican agriculture. The report was a damning view of recent 
Mexican agricultural policies. 

 Over the past three years Mexico has grown to become the US's fourth 
biggest agricultural market. According to US agricultural exporters, 
Mexico's maize crop (which provides the country's staple food, tortillas) 
averages between 12m and 15m t a year, but demand from human beings alone 
runs to 22m t.

 Proceso claimed that the government would have to spend at least US Dollars 
4bn on grain imports this year. The agriculture minister, Francisco 
Labastida Ochoa, said that the country would have to import between 8m and 
10m t of food. He reckoned that this would cost at least US Dollars 1.9bn.

 Labastida claimed that the country's stocks of food were adequate: he said 
that the Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares (Conasupo) had four 
months worth of meat and grains in its stocks. 

 This may be an overestimate: farmers are beginning to demand back crops 
which they have sold to Conasupo: at General Frias, members of the Frente 
Democratico Campesino said that they wanted 1,900 t of beans back. They said 
that Conasupo had paid them only 1,940 pesos a tonne when the market price 
was 4,000.  

 Labastida also claimed that the government would not alter its policy of 
subsidising staple foodstuffs. He said that the tortilla subsidy alone would 
cost 6bn pesos this year. 

 Infrastructure strains. The huge increase in Mexican imports of grains is 
putting a heavy strain on the country's infrastructure. Recently 30,000t of 
maize could not be unloaded at the port of Coatzacoalcos for two weeks 
because there were not enough railway wagons to transport the grain. 

 Cycle. The government has admitted that this year's production of grains 
will be badly hit by the drought. Farmers have been unable to sow for the 
spring summer season. The worst hit states according to the government are 
Baja California Sur, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Durango, Nuevo Leon, Sinaloa, 
Sonora and Tamaulipas.

 The problems this year follow on from a poor crop last year. US figures, 
cited by Proceso, put last year's harvest in Mexico at 23.77m t of grains 
and oilseeds. This was 11% down on the previous harvest of 26.8m t.

 The Union Nacional de Organizaciones Regionales Campesinas y Autonomas 
reckons that this year Mexico's maize, wheat, rice and bean crops will be 
13% down on 1995's. It reckons that the oilseeds crop will be 33% down. 
Unorca reckons that the country will have to import more than the regular 3m 
t of maize it has averaged over the past six years. The deputy trade 
minister has said that the government expects to import 5m t of maize and 
250,000t of beans. According to Ricardo Celma, director of the Consejo 
Norteamericano de Granos Forrajeros, the Secretaria de Comercio y Fomento 
Industrial has already authorised maize imports of 7.3m t for 1996. 

 The government reckons that the drought in these states (the worst for 50 
years) has prompted an increase in immigration. The government says that 
day-labourers have lost 25m working days because of the drought.

 Worries. Mexico has been using credit to help buy grain from US farmers. As 
part of the bailout package last year, the Mexican government got a credit 
line from the US Department of Agriculture of US Dollars 1.1bn which it has 
drawn down. 

 The problem this year is that US farmers are loth to allow grain to go to 
Mexico at subsidised rates. Ranchers in particular are putting pressure on 
the US government to halt the exportation of animal feed to Mexico. US 
ranchers say that the price of their animal feed has increased because of 
the drought in the Great Plains and that they have been forced to cut their 
losses by slaughtering cattle early. They now want the US to halt grain 
exports so that the price of feed can come down and they can start making a 
profit again.

 The US harvest this year is likely to be well down on last year's 275m t. 
The wheat crop this year is likely to be around 56m t (or 3m t less than 
last year. Wheat available for export is likely to be around 26.5m t (or 35% 
less than last year). The same sort of figures apply to maize. 

 Policy issue. The Mexican government is being criticised for having to 
spend so much on imports when it could avoid them by investing a fraction of 
the money in domestic agriculture. In particular, farmers say that the 
government should encourage banks to lend to agriculture. Farmers leaders, 
from the Congreso Agrario Permanente and the Union Nacional de Trabajadores 
Agricolas, claim that bank lending to agriculture has dropped by 50% since 
the economic crisis and the consequent increase in bad debts. 

 The Union Nacional de Organizaciones Regionales Campesinas y Autonomas 
recently distributed a report, Mexico y la Seguridad Alimentaria, which 
claimed that Nafta had severely damaged the prospects for 80% of Mexican 
farmers: the 3m ejidatarios and the 2.5m small farmers. Unorca also blames 
the agricultural reforms pushed through by the Salinas government (as a 
result of Nafta) for the fall in agricultural output. Essentially, the 
Salinas administration wanted to move from subsidising maize production to 
subsidising small maize producers. 

 The report reckons that the country will have to import a third of its food 
this year. This is despite a 29% fall over the past six years in demand for 
basic grains. 

 Dams: An official report by the Secretaria de Agricultura reported that at 
the beginning of June the country's 137 dams, which have a capacity of 
135,000m cubic metres, held only 10,000m cubic metres of water. This is only 
5m cubic metres more than the lowest figure ever recorded. The water levels 
at the beginning of June were 15,000m cubic metres below the normal level 
for this time of year and 15,000m cubic metres below the levels of a year 
ago. In round figures, the dams now hold 68% less water than they did a year 
ago.

 MEXICO: GAS: PRIVATE PIPELINES: 10 NETWORKS

 The government is inviting bids from the private sector for the 
construction of 10 new pipelines to supply industrial zones with natural 
gas. 

 One of the most attractive franchises will be to supply Mexico City. Its 
16m people use 350m cubic feet a day. Guanajuato also looks promising: its 
industrial zones at Leon, Salamanca, Celaya and Irapuato are also heavy 
users of gas. 

 The government hopes that bids will be made over the next 18 months and 
that the licences will be awarded and work will start at the end of 1997. 

 Pemex: The government's second attempt to sell off the country's 
petrochemical industry is not going well. Even the government admits that 
there are lacunas in the documentation.

 MEXICO: THE UNIONS: TEACHERS' DEMO ENDS IN VIOLENCE: MEXICO CITY POLICE 
chief sacked

 The President sacked Mexico City's police chief at the end of May after his 
brutal crackdown on a teachers demonstration in the capital. To the horror 
of the opposition the new police chief is General Tomas Salgado. Salgado 
further alarmed the opposition by saying that he in turn would appoint 
soldiers to the principal police jobs in the capital.

 The dissident teachers were demonstrating for higher wages. They wanted a 
doubling of their US Dollars 150 a month salaries. Their union had settled 
for a 10% rise in January and a further 12% rise in May. 

 The official teachers union, the Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la 
Educacion, is one of the most powerful unions in the country. Its head, Elba 
Esther Gordillo, has been mentioned as a possible president of the ruling 
Partido Revolucionario Institucional. The teachers have embarrassed  
President Ernesto Zedillo before when he was minister of education. They 
forced him to withdraw a revisionary history textbook that put a positive 
gloss on the Porfirio Diaz period. Earlier textbooks had focused on the 
Revolution, which followed Diaz's fall, as laying the basis for modern 
Mexico. 

 The demonstration against the smallness of the pay award was led by the 
dissident Coordinadora Nacional de Trabajadores de la Eduacacion. The police 
argued that they had been attacked, but the President, in sacking the police 
chief David Garay, said that they had used too much force. 

 Fears that the country might be facing a wave of labour unrest are abating. 
The university teachers at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico have 
settled for the 12% increase offered. 

 On the other hand the Sindicato de Telefonistas is taking a tough line with 
Infonavit, the state organisation charged with supplying cheap housing. The 
union says that Infonavit has not been offering mortgages to telephone 
workers in proportion to the worker's contributions. 

 The telephone workers' union is one of the strongest in the country. It has 
survived the privatisation of the state telephone company, Telmex. The 
union's leader, Francisco Hernandez Juarez, has long squabbled with other 
unions which he sees as arms of the ruling PRI.

 The telephone workers' union is also concerned that Infonavit has not 
invested the money collected from workers wisely. Most of the money is 
currently held in low-yielding government bonds. The union wants its 
members' contributions to be invested in higher yielding (but not 
speculative) instruments. 

 Colosio killing: The judge has said that he will take another month to 
decide whether Othon Cortes Vazquez was in fact the man who fired a second 
shot in the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Colosio was the ruling PRI's 
presidential candidate. He was killed on 23 March 1994 in Tijuana.

 Othon Cortes's lawyers argue that the prosecution case is weak: they point 
out that the only witness who says that he saw Cortes fire a shot was 17 
metres away. Another two witnesses who claimed to see Cortes brandishing 
what looked like a gun could not agree on his appearance. The defence also 
noted that the prosecution had not found the gun that Cortes was supposed to 
have fired, nor had they produced any forensic evidence to suggest that he 
had fired any gun. 

 The prosecution alleges that Cortes fired into Colosio's body while the 
convicted assassin, Mario Aburto, fired at Colosio's head.

 The Procuraduria General de la Republica said that the investigation into 
the supposed plot behind Colosio's assassination would continue to be run by 
Pablo Chapa Bezanilla, even though he was now moving to be subprocurador de 
procedimentos penales.

 MEXICO: FOCUS ON THE SALINAS BROTHERS: THE PRESSURE MOUNTS

 The scandal over the way Raul Salinas de Gortari, the elder brother of the 
former President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, acquired his wealth refuses to 
die down. At the end of June, following a couple of US TV investigations 
into Raul's finances, the procurador general de la Republica, Antonio Lozano 
Gracia, announced that the Mexican authorities were investigating to see 
whether Raul had committed tax evasion. He is already in prison, accused of 
being the mastermind behind the assassination of the secretary general of 
the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Jose Francisco Ruiz 
Massieu.

 According to the investigation, broadcast on CBS, Raul had used false 
identities to accumulate US Dollars 300m in bank accounts outside Mexico. 
The implication is that Raul used his position as a senior official, and his 
relationship with his brother, for his own purposes. A programme on NBC 
implied that the President knew of this.

 The procurador said that his investigation had already discovered that Raul 
had understated his assets in Mexico alone by US Dollars 24m. In his 
position at the Comision Nacional de Subsistencias Populares, Raul's annual 
income should never have exceeded US Dollars 190,000. 

 The procurador is coming under pressure to take evidence from Amy Elliot, 
Raul's banker at Citibank. She is presumed to know more about Raul's 
finances than anyone else. CBS claimed that she had already been 'secretly' 
interviewed by officials from Mexico, the US and Switzerland about her 
client. CBS said that she had checked into Raul's background and been told 
that the money he was depositing came from the sale of a construction 
company.

 The procurador also claimed that the notion that Raul was involved in drug 
trafficking comes from the US Drug Enforcement Agency. 

 According to an article in La Jornada, which seems to draw on information 
that Raul gave to the Swiss authorities when they interviewed him in gaol 
last year, US Dollars 86m of his fortune was payment for advice he gave 
Mexican firms. Raul apparently said that this money would be used to set up 
an investment fund to promote Mexican economic development after his brother 
left office.

 This chimes with what Carlos Peralta, the head of Iusacell, a mobile 
telecoms company, said in January: he said that he had paid Raul US Dollars 
50m towards a fund. 

 Property: Before the programmes were broadcast the authorities seized 13 of 
Raul's properties on the Pacific coast. He has 10 apartments and two 
building lots in Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo and one apartment in Acapulco.

 Carlos: The government tried to deny that it has dismissed its ambassador 
to Ireland, Agustin Gutierrez Canet, for sponsoring the interview between 
the commentator, Jorge Castaneda and the former President, Carlos Salinas. 
It said that it had offered Gutierrez Canet the ambassadorship to Haiti 
which he had turned down. 

 The foreign minister, Jose Angel Gurria, said that the ambassador had lost 
the government's confidence and that the Irish post was important since 
Ireland held the presidency of the EU for the second half of 1996.


 Wages: The government said that claims from the independent Alianza Civica 
that President Zedillo's pay had trebled to 82,000 pesos (US Dollars 10,900) 
a month over the past 18 months were nonsense. It said that the President's 
pay had in fact dropped from 124,372 pesos (US Dollars 16,583) to 59,139 
pesos (US Dollars 7,885) a month. The Alianza was equally surprised when the 
presidency claimed that President Salinas had been paid US Dollars 36,050 a 
month. The Alianza thought he was being paid US Dollars 4,000.

DIVIDED OPPOSITION: THE PAN

As campaigns for the gubernatorial and midterm congressional elections
move into the final stretch, the PRI could hardly be in a better position.
Deep divisions have been reactivated within both major opposition parties
-- the rightist National Action Party (PAN) and the center-left
Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), as their leaders battle over
candidacies and campaign strategy.  The bitter fights waged in party
conventions have exacerbated factionalism and created confusion among
party rank-and-file, while publicly displaying the two top opposition
parties' disorganization and lack of definition.  Needless to say, the PRI
and government publicists have hammered these points across in the print
and electronic media.

While no one expects the opposition to gain ground in this year's
elections, to be held on August 18, the voting outcome will be highly
significant.  First, the PRI sees it as absolutely vital to recover
votes lost in 1988 to verify its historic claim of being "the party
of the 74 majorities." If the PRI can win more than 50% of the vote
cleanly, so much the better.

For their part, the PAN and PRD are locked in a bitter battle to secure
the position of the nation's second strongest electoral force after the
PRI.

In the 1988 elections, the National Democratic Front (the pro-Cardenas,
four-party coalition) overtook the PAN to become the strongest
opposition force, winning 31% of the national vote in the presidential
race, according to official statistics.

The strength of the Front forces (now registered as the PRD) has rankled
the administration ever since, because Cardenas's strong showing in the
official vote count caused Salinas's legitimacy to be questioned when he
took office.  Since the beginning of this year, senior PRI officials have
confidently predicted the demise of the Cardenista PRD party in this
year's elections, asserting that the PRD will only get 15% of the vote.
PRI leaders see similarly dim prospects for the PAN, and they predict
the conservative party will "return to its historic levels" of perhaps 20%
of the vote.

The best chances for significant opposition victories -- numerical or
moral -- lie in the gubernatorial races (see Mexico Service April 10,
1991).  In San Luis Potosi, a broad opposition front, the Coalicion
Democratica, which includes the PAN and PRD and other political and civic
groups, is considered a serious challenger to PRI candidate Fausto Zapata.
(It would hurt the administration little to sacrifice Zapata, who is
identified with the administration of former President Luis Echeverria;
other Echeverria associates --like Colima gubernatorial hopeful Socorro
Diaz -- are being sacrificed as part of the Salinas administration's
message that the liberal wing of the PRI is dead.)

In Guanajuato, PAN candidate Vicente Fox is considered a strong
contender against the PRI's Ramon Aguirre, an unpopular former
Mexico City mayor who has weak ties in the state.  The surprising, last-
minute registration of PRD candidate Porfirio Munoz Ledo (see XI-13),
however, opens up new scenarios.  According to some observers, Munoz
Ledo could come in second after Aguirre.  This would represent a moral
victory for the PRD, particularly because Guanajuato is traditionally a
PAN stronghold, being one of the Catholic bastions dating from the days
of the Cristero war.  Perhaps more importantly, if Fox is relegated to
third place, this sends a devastating message to the PANistas, like Fox,
who oppose negotiating with the PRI government.

In the senatorial races, the only major contest where the opposition has
a strong chance of winning is in Mexico City.  Observers now say the
PAN contender, Vicencio Tovar, could upset PRI challenger Manuel
Aguilera, who is a little-known figure in the mammoth capital.  PRD
challenger, Heberto Castillo, a former presidential candidate for the ex-
socialist party coalition (PMS), is well known and well liked in the
capital and cannot be discounted.

PAN and PRD are expected to win a modest number of Deputyships that
are elected by direct majority vote, particularly in their respective
strongholds of Baja California, Sonora, Yucatan and Chihuahua, and
Michoacan and Guerrero.  The strongest hopes for PAN and PRD are
the "proportional representation" or "plurinominal" contests in which
Deputy seats are apportioned according to the percentage of votes won
by each party in a congressional region (called "circumscription") that
takes in several states.  Proportional representation traditionally favors
opposition parties of all stripes because it grants seats to parties that
won less than a majority vote.  (Indeed, proportional representation was
included in the 1970 political reform as a means of creating spaces for
opposition participation and provides for a more pluralistic, less
hegemonic political system.)

While PAN and PRD might each win dozens of proportional
representation seats, neither party is expected to equal its take in the
1988 races, which gave an unprecedented 110 seats to the PAN and close
to 50 seats to the parties that made up the National Democratic Front.
Most observers predict the real winner at the polls will be what Mexican
wags call "the abstentionism party."  This group of non-voters typically
ranks high in all Mexican elections, and by tradition the congressional
races evoke even less participation than the presidential contest.  In
this, Mexicans correctly identify the presidency as the key office in their
political system.

In this SPECIAL REPORT, MS begins a two-part series focusing on
internal divisions in Mexico's leading opposition parties.  In this issue,
we examine the splits afflicting the PAN.

NATIONAL ACTION PARTY

The PAN regional and national conventions earlier this year underscored
the divisions within the party between the neo-PANistas and the so-called
"traditionalists," or "democratic forum."  In the last decade, and
particularly since 1985, the neo-PANistas have gained power in the
party, and this year they virtually secured control of all key leadership
posts and the overwhelming majority of congressional candidacies.

ASCENDANCY OF NEO-PANISTAS

The neo-PANistas are the businessmen-turned-activists who have pushed
the PAN to take a higher profile and challenge the government more
openly.  As such, they have moved away from the more traditional,
sedate style of a loyal opposition party adopted by the PAN from its
founding in the 1930s through the mid-1970s.  The fiercest advocates of
this position are wealthy northern ranchers who were infuriated -- and
politically motivated -- by former President Echeverria's 1976
confiscation of private ranches in the fertile Yaqui and Mayo valleys of
Sonora state.  Former PAN gubernatorial candidate for Chihuahua,
Francisco Barrios, and PAN President Luis H. Alvarez, a Chihuahua
businessman, exemplify the neo-PANistas.

The neo-PANistas are allied with and inspired by conservative forces,
particularly the far-right civic group, Desarrollo Humano Integral,
Asociacion Civil.  Today, the PAN has largely abandoned its traditional
role of crying out against fraud, corruption and mismanagement in the
PRI government in favor of a new tune.  Since President Salinas came
to power, he has preempted the PAN's program by deepening the
economic liberalization program, hinting at an end to the agrarian reform
lands (ejidos) and has begun courting the Roman Catholic church,
allowing it greater latitude in society.  In this context, the neo-PANistas
have been the first in Mexico's oldest opposition party to cooperate with
the PRI by holding regular meetings and negotiations with Salinas.

Their strategy of alliance with the government is based on a congruence
of ideology with Salinas and the fact that the PAN secured an
unprecedented 106 Chamber of Deputy seats (of 500 total) in 1988,
giving the party the swing vote on issues such as constitutional reforms
that require a two-thirds majority.  Concomitantly, the PRI gained only
a 10-seat majority (with 260 seats), and was compelled to forge an
alliance with PAN in order to pass constitutional reforms.

Seeking to capitalize on their newfound strength, the neo-PANistas
eagerly entered into talks with the government aimed at influencing
policy.  Early on, Salinas scored an important victory by gaining PAN
support for the constitutional reform that revised the electoral code and
set the new rules that will govern the 1991 races.  Support for the
electoral reform is the single best example of how much the newly
ascendant ideologues of the PAN are willing to compromise with the
government.  The electoral reform vote took place just three weeks after
former PAN presidential candidate Manuel Clouthier died in a car
accident.  Clouthier was an adamant opponent of such collaboration and
specifically opposed voting with the PRI to pass the electoral reform.

Neo-PANistas justify this action by saying that they demanded and got
government compliance to formulate a new and clean voter registration
roll. In exchange, however, the PAN voted for electoral rules that
limit or close off opportunities for opposition representation in the
legislature.  These are the "governability clause," which provides that
the party winning 35% of the vote will automatically be awarded 50% plus
1 of the Chamber of Deputy seats, and a prohibition on the formation of
electoral coalitions.  Most analysts believe the governability clause
favors the PRI because no opposition party has ever been awarded more
than 31% of the count in official election results; they say the PRI
would not have supported the measure if it would harm its own interests.
Also, the electoral reform bans the formation of coalitions, such as the
four-party National Democratic Front, which backed Cardenas and nearly
toppled the PRI in 1988.

In exchange for collaborating on the electoral reform, the PAN has
reaped rewards on several fronts.  First, it has gained unprecedented
electoral victories, most notably the governorship of Baja California.
Central government collusion in the PAN win is suggested by the fact
that PRI President Luis Donaldo Colosio went on national television to
announce the victory of PAN's Ernesto Ruffo at the same time that PRI
leaders in Baja California were still debating the outcome.  Building on
its newfound strength in the legislature, the party has become an
influential mediator of government policy.

The association with the ruling group has also bolstered the party's
treasury -- a direct outcome of the ascendancy of the neo-PANistas, who
overturned the 50-year policy of refusing to accept money from the
government.  The PAN now receives financial support assigned it by the
Interior Ministry in proportion to the number of votes won by the party
in national elections.

It is doubtful that the PAN-PRI alliance will become a permanent feature
of Mexico's political landscape, even though it has served Salinas's
interests well.  The informal association became mutually beneficial in
1989 when a shaken PRI, commanding a slim 10-vote majority in the
Chamber of Deputies, was obliged to seek cooperation to gain passage
of constitutional reforms.  In a formal sense, the alliance has fallen into
disuse ever since the October 1989 electoral reform.  Since then, Salinas
has not advanced a single legislative initiative that would require a two-
thirds majority.  Additional constitutional reforms are probably being
held back until after the new Congress is seated, with the PRI expecting
that more than two thirds of the seats will be occupied by loyal PRIistas.
As a result, the August mid-term congressional elections could severely
curtail the PAN's newfound power.

DISSIDENTS OR FORISTAS

The rise of the neo-PANistas has been countered by a faction that
defends the traditional PAN stance as an uncompromising opposition
party that cuts no deals with the government.  The fissure widened
during the debate about allying with the PRI to approve the electoral
reform.  The PANistas who opposed that alliance have formed a group
called the Foro Doctrinario y Democratico.

The Foristas oppose negotiations with the government and are pressing
for greater rank-and-file participation in party conventions and selection
of party nominees, and in the political system as a whole.  On the issue
of electoral fraud, the Foristas follow the lead of Clouthier, who staged
hunger strikes to protest fraud and steadfastly refused to negotiate with
the PRI government any compromise regarding electoral procedures and
outcomes.  In this, they are similar to the so-called "intransigent"
faction in the PRD, which is identified with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who
adamantly refuses to meet with President Salinas for private talks,
demanding instead that talks with the government be conditioned on the
prior setting of an agenda.

Indeed, two prominent Foristas have joined the "National Accord for
Democracy," a pluralistic group launched by Cardenas that calls for
clean elections and negotiations to set the terms of a peaceful transition
to democracy.  For the coming August elections, the Foristas call for no
talks between the national PAN leadership and the government that could
decide outside the ballot "on the outcome of congressional and
gubernatorial races."

Foristas have occupied important leadership posts in the party in recent
years, from which they have been able to confront directly the neo-
PANistas.  Mexico City PAN President Jose Angel Conchello and Nuevo
Leon PAN leader (and former presidential candidate) Pablo Emilio
Madero are Foristas who have led head-on confrontations with
ideological opponents in the party.  Other leading figures of the dissident
group include former party Secretary-General Jesus Gonzalez Schmal,
Deputy Bernardo Batiz, former Federal Election Committee delegate
Juan de Dios Castro and Mexico City Assemblyman and former PAN
press spokesman Gonzalo Altamirano.

Guanajuato gubernatorial candidate Vicente Fox is also a Forista.  Fox
is an important figure in PAN because the party generally lacks strong
candidates for senior elective offices.  Fox is considered a serious
contender for that governorship, thanks to his personal dynamism, his
repeated stumping of Guanajuato state and the flatness of PRI candidate
Ramon Aguirre and internal PRI squabbles.  However, Fox's
identification with the Forista cause worries the party's national leaders
who, it is said, are willing to sacrifice him order to cement the neo-
PANistas' stranglehold on the party.

Foristas who campaigned to run as PAN candidates for Congress were
blocked in their bid for nomination at both the national and Mexico City
PAN conventions.  At the national convention, the National Executive
Committee vetoed the candidacy of Jesus Gonzalez Schmal, a former
Deputy, as a Mexico City Assemblyman.  Gonzalez Schmal had won
68% of the convention's vote for his nomination.  Forista Jose Angel
Conchello opted to withdraw from the competition for proportional
representation slots after he was excluded from the party's list of pre-
candidates.  At the Mexico City convention, rivalries between the two
factions were opened wide when neither Abel Vicencio Tovar, a neo-
PANista, nor Forista Bernardo Batiz captured the necessary 66% of the
vote for securing the nomination.  In two rounds of voting, Batiz won
52% against 48% for Tovar.  However, Tovar came out the nominee
when the issue was put to a vote by the National Executive Committee
which defeated Batiz, 13 to 3.  Batiz blames his defeat on his activism
as a Forista.

The rough handling of Foristas has precipitated a predictable airing of
the party's dirty linen in public.  Gonzalez Schmal has publicly protested
the veto of his candidacy (which the party's senior leaders refuse to
confirm), claiming that he was given no reasons for the rebuff.  In early
June, Batiz announced his resignation from his post as vice-coordinator
of the PAN delegation in the Chamber of Deputies.  His resignation
came after Tovar, PAN's congressional coordinator named two non-
Foristas as vice-coordinators to take over his responsibilities while he
campaigned for the Senate.  At the same time, a letter circulated among
PAN Congressmen calling for the resignation of Batiz from the
coordinator post.  Batiz has launched barbs at the party, saying it is
running for the distinction of being the "second official party" after the
PRI.

CONCLUSION

Facing the upcoming elections, PAN's national leadership is in a hopeful
mood.  Party President Alvarez confidently predicts the PAN will take
five governorships: Vicente Fox in Guanajuato; Rogelio Sada Zambrano,
in Nuevo Leon (see POLITICS); coalition contender Salvador Nava in
San Luis Potosi; Moises Canale, in Sonora; and Arturo Nava Bolanos in
Queretaro.  In addition, party leaders believe that PAN candidates will
win 74 direct majority deputyships (primarily in Baja California,
Chihuahua, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Mexico City, Nuevo Leon, San Luis
Potosi, Sinaloa, Sonora and Yucatan).

However, most political observers expect the PAN will win only one
governorship outright -- perhaps Guanajuato -- and, at most, a second
statehouse in coalition with the PRD in San Luis Potosi.  And taking
even 74 deputyships would still leave the PAN delegation diminished in
comparison with its showing in 1988.

This year's races are likely to be even tougher for the opposition than
1988.  The PRI campaigns are more intense, as the ruling party is
forewarned this time about popular discontent, and is taking steps
through populist spending programs to woo voters.  The divisions within
the PAN can only debilitate the party on the eve of elections that are
likely to bring setbacks for the conservative party.

BANAMEX PUT UP FOR BID

With Banamex formally put on the block on July 2, the bank
privatization goes into full swing.  In a press conference on July 4,
Finance Undersecretary Guillermo Ortiz, in charge of bank
privatizations, announced that all these privatizations should be
completed in the first half of 1992.

The government will sell off its 70.7% holding in Banamex, the largest
and most profitable in Mexico, in several tranches.  The sale conditions
differ from those of the other banks so far offered, owing to Banamex's
size and relative importance.  Some 31% of its shares will be offered
through an auction mechanism; another 20% will be offered to directors
who form part of regional boards and already have expressed an interest
in participating.  The winning bidder will have the right to the shares not
taken up by the regional directors.  The remaining 20% may also be
purchased by the winning bidder in order to attain the 51% necessary for
overall voting control -- although it is likely that most of this will be
placed, subsequent to the award of the controlling stake, with foreign
investors.

Payment terms for the auctioned shares are: a deposit (in Cetes) of
Mex$150 billion (US$50 million) prior to the auction on August 23; 20%
of the bid price to be paid five days after the award; and four other equal
installments at 30 day intervals after that date.  Bids are due to be
awarded by September 6.

Banamex currently has a market capitalization of approximately Mex$12
trillion (US$4 billion), implying that 20% would cost US$800 million.
With a net worth of US$1.8 billion, this implies a current ratio of price
to net worth of 2.2 times: should the bank go for 2.5 times net worth,
as is expected, this would represent an overall value of US$4.5 billion.
The bank's Mex$78 trillion (US$25 billion) in total assets represents
25% of the Mexican banking system, and its profits for the first five
months of 1991 were Mex$512 billion (US$170 million).  With
annualized profits of approximately US$400 million, this would put
Banamex's prospective P/E at current market levels at 10 times earnings.

Key bidders for Banamex are likely to be Roberto Hernandez and the
Accival brokerage; Manuel Senderos and the Grupo Desc (to whom we
understand that Alberto Bailleres, a major industrialist, has allied
himself); and the Visa group, headed by Eugenio Garza Laguera (which
already has all elements of a financial group, except a bank, through
Grupo Vamsa, and formerly owned Banca Serfin).  Hernandez, who was
the underbidder in the Telmex auction, is currently the favorite for
Banamex.  However, Desc has a good chance.  The Visa group is
considered to be more interested in recovering its former bank, Serfin.

SWELLING CONTINGENCY FUND

Guillermo Ortiz also stated that the Contingency Fund, formed as a kind
of reserve to protect Mexico against oil price fluctuations has already
amassed US$4.5 billion.  Funds have come from the Telmex
privatization (both the controlling stake and L shares), which have
brought in approximately US$4 billion, and some of the proceeds
(estimated by the government at US$632 million) from the three banks
already sold off (Multibanco, Banpais, Cremi).  With only half the year
gone, the government has practically achieved its US$5 billion
privatization target for this year.

PEMEX ISSUES ECU BOND

In the first such bond issued by a Latin American borrower, Pemex
placed an ECU100 million bond in the Eurobond market, according to
a July 5 announcement.  The bonds have a term of 3 years, a coupon of
11.5%, and were priced at 100.05, giving a yield of 11.48%, equivalent
to 9.68% in dollars.  The lead manager was Paribas, with co-managers
Swiss Bank, Bear Stearns, Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Bankers' Trust,
Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch.

This latest bond issue follows a total of US$650 million raised through
seven issues by Pemex, Nafin and Bancomext in 1990.  The coupon is
the lowest yet achieved by a Mexican state borrower.  It represents the
beginning of a second financing stage for Pemex.  In the first, the state
oil company sought to reestablish its image as a borrower in international
markets (after the 1982 debacle): the second stage is intended to fund its
expansion program.  Pemex plans to raise US$500 million annually over
the next four years, which would cover at least 10% of its investment
program during that period.

The "voluntary" return by Mexican borrowers to the international market
is considered by the Mexican government as a sign that the debt crisis is
over.  The key change from 1978-1982 borrowing patterns is that, so
far, all Mexican financings have been made through bond and equity
markets.  This approach offers marketable instruments and spreads the
risk over a broad range of investors.  The earlier practice of direct bank
borrowing, which concentrated the risk, led directly to the 1982 crisis.

FREE PESO FUTURES

The market for exchange rate cover (coberturas cambiarias) was extended
to the free rate on July 1.  The new system has several limiting features:

* Participants must be corporations in the private sector.

* Settlement, although denominated in dollars, will only be in pesos.

* Terms are between 72 hours and 365 days.

* Rates will be set with reference to free rates fixed for Tesobonos
(government short-term loan instruments denominated at the free rate).

As of July 5, quotations for exchange rate cover at the free rate were
exactly the same as those for the controlled rate.

The introduction of this market could lead to two positive outcomes over
the medium term for Mexico: unification of the free and controlled rate,
and introduction of a more orthodox peso-dollar futures (or forward)
market in Mexico.  This development, as well as the return to the
international marketplace (see previous item) would mark the final stages
of rehabilitation of the Mexican economy following the 1982 crash.

COMERCIAL MEXICANA DEAL

Comercial Mexicana, one of three major Mexican supermarket chains
(along with Cifra and Gigante), has associated with Price Club of the US
in a 51-49% joint venture.  They plan to set up 12 stores, beginning in
December, the first one to be located in the heavily populated middle
class suburb of Satelite in Mexico City. Comercial Mexicana, which
owns 75 stores throughout Mexico, went public earlier in 1991 on the
Mexican Stock Exchange.  Price Club operates 59 stores (51 in the US
and 8 in Canada) on a wholesaling formula.  The initial plan for the
Mexican venture is to supply US-made products, but the new stores will
be gradually moving towards stocking Mexican merchandise.  Price Club
already supplies several of Comercial's competitors in Mexico, and it is
rumored that they have stopped these purchases since hearing of its
linkup with Comercial. Gigante, the other main supermarket chain, is
likely list its shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange in July.  It intends
to make an up to US$200 million share offering through Inverlat (in
Mexico) and an international underwriting group led by Bear Stearns.

KOREAN AUTO INVESTMENT

Kia Motors, Korea's third largest auto manufacturer, announced on June
26 that it plans to invest up to US$2 billion in an auto assembly plant in
the state of Tamaulipas or Sonora.  Other major Korean chaebols
(groups) that already have investments in Mexico include Daewoo
(televisions), Hyundai (containers and trailers), Goldstar and Samsung
(both electronics).  Korean companies are clearly intent on imitating
Japan in using Mexico as a platform for entry into NAFTA.

PEASE LETTER ON FORD LABOR PRACTICES

US Congressman Don Pease (D-Ohio) is preparing a letter to President
Carlos Salinas questioning the handling of a recent labor dispute at the
Ford plant in Mexico City.  Pease is a member of the House Ways and
Means Committee, the key committee with oversight over the free trade
negotiations.  His inquiry into Mexican labor practices, as reported by
the official news agency Notimex, could set a precedent for ongoing US
congressional questioning of the Mexican government for the duration of
the FTA talks.

The letter will express the congressman's concern about the dispute over
which labor confederation is to represent Ford employees.  Copies of the
Pease letter will be sent to the US Trade Representative, senior officers
of the Ford Motor Company and the United Automotive Workers union.

The Pease inquiry stems from a year-long dispute over whether the Ford
workers would be represented by the PRI-affiliated Confederacion de
Trabajadores Mexicanos (CTM) or by the less official Confederacion
Obrera Revolucionaria (COR).  Earlier this year, the CTM allegedly won
the majority of workers' votes to renew its control of the union.
However, COR-affiliated workers, who claim to have the allegiance of
55% of the 3,000-plus members, demanded a recount. Official results in
the June 3 reballoting gave a slim majority to the CTM -- with 1,325
votes against 1,112 for the COR.  That narrow margin has raised
questions in many quarters.  PRD congressmen denounced the recount
in advance, revealing that Labor Minister Arsenio Farell had intervened
to favor the CTM.  They disclosed a letter signed by Farell in which he
requested Trade Minister Jaime Serra Puche's "intervention to make
Ford see the grave consequences it would bring to lose."  Several days
before the new balloting, Senator Paul David Wellstone (D-Min.)
expressed his concern about the fairness of the recount procedure in a
letter addressed to Mexican Ambassador to the US, Gustavo Petricioli.
"From my point of view, the letter [of Farell] puts in serious doubt the
impartiality and fairness of the preparation of the election for
representation of the Ford plant.  I am very worried that underground
intimidation, such as open violence, not be repeated in this conflict," the
Senator wrote, alluding to attacks by shock groups on the union picket
lines on Jan. 8, 1990 that ended in the death of one worker, Cleto
Nigmo Urbina.  On the day of the recount, workers had to make their
way through police lines manned by traffic cops, anti-riot squads,
highway police and judicial police and Interior Ministry agents to cast
their ballots while helicopters flew overhead.

Following the alleged CTM victory in the recount, workers supporting
COR were threatened with loss of their jobs.  The CTM has demanded
that COR backers who want to continue working at the Ford plant must
sign a letter which says: "...due to confusion or lack of thought, I
expressed my vote (in the June 3 recount) in favor of the COR, however,
in reasoned reflection I have reached the consideration of accepting fully
my union discipline as much for the organization I belong to...as for the
CTM, which has always been characterized by its defense of workers."
As the free trade talks progress, more US Senators and Congressmen
with close ties to the US labor movement are sure to scrutinize Mexican
labor practices very closely.

NUEVO LEON ELECTIONS

The leadoff contest in the gubernatorial stakes, in Nuevo Leon, offers a
preview of what to expect from the August 18 contests in the other
states, hints at upcoming administration policy, and puts to the test
government promises that electoral procedures will be cleaned up (MS
XI-13).  The outcome shows that charges of electoral irregularities are
unlikely to be put to rest this year.

As expected (XI-8), PRI candidate Socrates Rizzo held a strong lead over
PAN and PRD challengers in preliminary returns from the July 7 Nuevo
Leon state gubernatorial elections.  With more than 60% of the vote
counted, Rizzo had won 62% of the ballots, against 38% for PAN
challenger Rogelio Sada and 3% for PRD contender Lucas de la Garza.
According to official statistics, more than 50% of eligible voters cast
their ballots.  This is a high voter turnout for Mexico where abstention
rates of 65% or more are common in state elections.  Early returns had
no information on the outcome of the vote for 26 state congressional
seats.  The turnout for all parties other than the three leading contenders
was abysmal: 0.2% each for the Partido Popular Socialista and the
Partido del Frente Cardenista de Reconstruccion Nacional, both satellite
parties controlled by the PRI; 0.1% for the Partido Autentico de la
Revolucion Mexicana, another PRI satellite; less than 0.2% for the
conservative Partido Democrata Mexicana and the locally based Partido
Liberal Revolucionario.

The Nuevo Leon campaign was significant in that it was the first real
three-way race for governor in country's history.  Each of the candidates
of the three leading parties -- PRI, PAN and PRD -- is a prominent
figure, has roots in the state, and commands a strong base of support.
In a sense, Rizzo was the least locally based of the leading challengers.
He was launched as candidate for Monterrey mayor in 1988 by then-
Programming and Budget Minister Carlos Salinas de Gortari.  Once in
the mayorship, and bolstered by official backing from the central
government, he was able to preempt the governor in many functions, and
succeeded in completing public works programs that gained him
popularity. Rogelio Sada is a prominent business leader descended from
the founding families of the Monterrey industrial establishment.  He was
CEO of the glass giant, Vitro, until six years ago when the firm ran him
out for participating openly in PAN party politics.  He enjoys a strong
following among the PAN's traditional constituency, the conservative,
pro-business upper class and the middle classes.

Lucas de la Garza, PRD candidate, is the son of a popular former
governor.  A cattle rancher, de la Garza served the previous governor
for five years as planning director and was the top cabinet official
(Secretario de Gobierno) for the sitting governor, Jorge Trevino, until he
resigned to protest corruption in government.  De la Garza's natural
constituency is in the state's rural areas, but his charisma, home-style
campaigning and reputation for honesty have gained him support in
Monterrey as well. Rizzo's closeness to President Salinas lend a special
note of significance to the governor-elect's pronouncements, which can
be interpreted as a signal of the policy thrust the Salinas administration
has in mind for the remaining half of the sexenio.  At the July 2
ceremony closing his campaign, Rizzo proposed a Pacto Nuevo Leon
which, he said, would improve the standard of living in the state.  The
seven points of the Pacto are:

* Internationalization of Nuevo Leon: make the state into a beachhead of
economic modernization in preparation for the FTA;

* Decentralization and regional development;

* Growth with order: improve urban transportation, emphasizing electric
transport;

* Improve the quality of life: substitution of fuel oil with natural gas in
industry and promote supply of ecological fuels;

* Safety and justice: create an office to defend citizens, set up a Human
Rights Commission and a special appeals office to improve the
administration of justice;

* Modernization of finances and public administration: renegotiate the
state debt, extending the repayment period and improving the interest
rates;

* Democratic Solidarity: "implement democracy as a form of life that is
not reduced to political and electoral aspects, end arrogance and
arbitrariness of public officials."

On a symbolic level, the close of the Rizzo campaign also sent some
clear messages.  The ceremony, attended by 9,000 PRIistas, was held in
Cintermex.  This is the new international trade center built by the major
Monterrey enterprises on land donated by the government to serve as a
convention center and to house permanent exhibits of Monterrey industry
products, including ordering and shipping facilities.  Rizzo took
advantage of the setting to leave behind his former life as an activist in
an ultra-left group related to the Spartacus League.  Seeking to touch all
the right buttons for his audience, Rizzo embraced the conservative
Monterrey values, saying, "I believe in the family as the essential pillar
of society.  I believe in the enterprising spirit, in the strength and
values of the work ethic that have created the Nuevo Leon of today."  In a
highly unusual statement for a PRIista, Rizzo overlooked the formal
separation of church and politics and said, "I believe in God above all
things."

The Nuevo Leon gubernatorial and state congressional contest also
marked the debut of the new federal voter registration list and voter
credentials.  It thus provides early warning of problems that may be
expected to plague the six gubernatorial and nationwide congressional
races on August 18.  Opposition parties of all stripes reported
irregularities that would permit fraud or prevent eligible voters from
casting a ballot.  Political parties received the voter registration list
later than scheduled, allowing them minimum time to correct errors on the
padron.  PRD militants detected names that appeared three and four
times on the voter registration list. In addition, the list of designated
opposition party observers scrambled the names of poll-watchers and
their respective districts, forcing opposition parties to work quickly to
correct these errors.

The Federal Electoral Institute delegate for Nuevo Leon, Roberto
Villarreal Roel, reported July 5 that more than 228,000 voter credentials
had not been distributed, meaning that 15% of the state's 1,564,972
voters were effectively disqualified.  Two days before the election, PRD
candidate Lucas de la Garza charged the PRI was organizing shock
groups to intimidate voters and "carrousel" operations to transport PRI
supporters to different voting booths to vote several times.  De la Garza,
saying he had received information from high-ranking state PRI sources,
claimed that the PRI had already decided how many votes it would
obtain in various districts.

PAN and PRD had arranged to run a joint operation on election day to
detect and report election fraud and to compare voting results.  The two
parties agreed to "share" poll-watchers, with PRD militants covering the
polls in rural areas and PAN in charge of the greater Monterrey polling
booths. The two parties will cross and compare information gathered by
their poll-watchers about the vote counts at each precinct.  The election
was to be watched by at least 150 observers gathered by the Asamblea
Democratica por el Sufragio Efectivo (ADESE), a national, pluralistic
group formed by representatives of opposition parties, human rights
groups and civic associations.

Nevertheless, the elections themselves were marred by a series of
irregularities.  PAN candidate Sada Zambrano alleged that the ballots had
not been appropriately signed by electoral officials at the state capital.
There was a heavy voter turnout in two large townships governed by
PAN mayors, but insufficient ballots available at voting booths: the State
Electoral Commission sent only 200 ballots to precincts that had
registered 1,000 voters.  Throughout the day, "carrousels," traditionally
operated by the PRI, were reported to be carrying voters to different
locations to vote several times.  Poll-watchers from the PAN and PRD
parties were expelled from several precincts.  In districts that are
opposition strongholds, voters were allowed to vote without credentials,
a move alleged to favor the PRI.  One person was arrested for stealing
a ballot box and another charged with trying to organize a carrousel.

Other serious irregularities reported in rural areas included no ballots
sent to the rural town of Montemorelos, and in the towns of Mier y
Noruega and Dr. Arroyo, the location of voting booths was scrambled
so that citizens did not know where to cast their ballots.  By the close of
election day, the PRD issued a list of 69 irregularities - although it is
not clear how much difference they would have made, while Lucas de la
Garza, the PRD candidate, said it was too early to make a judgement
about them.

ELECTION DEBATE INTENSIFIES

This experience will only intensify the growing controversy over
electoral procedures and the government's intention of democratizing
Mexican political life.  The PRD delegation in the Chamber of Deputies
proposed on July 3 that the August 18 elections be postponed until
September 22.  The purpose would be to allow enough time to hand out
credentials to all eligible registered voters and to provide political
parties with the voter registration list enough in advance of the elections to
allow for corrections to be made.  The proposal is to be debated in the
Chamber beginning July 8.  As the preparations for the Nuevo Leon
election demonstrate, the government has been unable to meet either of
its self-imposed deadlines for handing out the voter registration lists or
distributing voter credentials to all eligible voters.

Questions about the government's intentions are being raised anew
because of recent statements made by President Salinas that indicate that
economic reform takes a higher priority that political reform.  During his
trip to Europe (see below), President Salinas stated that democracy
cannot become strong nor justify itself in the absence of appropriate
economic conditions. "For that [reason] stability has a high priority,
because without it the reforms of the productive apparatus, expectations
and even the social spirit (could) be placed at risk," Salinas told Czech
President Vaclav Havel.  Also in Europe, Salinas reiterated his
administration's refusal to admit international observers to elections.

These comments sparked a sharp response from PAN President Luis H.
Alvarez.  Speaking in Monterrey, at the close of the PAN  gubernatorial
camapaign, Alvarez said, "We will insist that in Mexico economic
measures cannot be successful if they are not matched by an opening in
the political sphere.  A common effort between people and government
is needed to face the challenges, and this can only take place in a
democratic setting."  Those thoughts were echoed by the director of the
Manufacturers' Chamber of Nuevo Leon, Mariano Montero Zubillaga,
who commented that "We see some advances in political matters,
although the ideal would be for those advances to be more rapid in order
to match the economic opening."

SALINAS TOUR OF EUROPE

The primary goal of President Salinas's early July swing through Europe
was to seek foreign investment, particularly in Germany and Italy.  The
purpose of the visits to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, according
to sources close to the president, is to observe first hand the
transformation of those societies.

In Germany, Salinas met with the presidents of Volkswagen and
Mercedes Benz.  Both automotive giants announced new investments:
US$900 million to expand the VW plant in Puebla, and DM27 million
for Mercedes Benz, which will begin producing light trucks in Mexico.
In Germany, the two governments signed an agreement establishing a
mechanism for holding bilateral talks to strengthen cooperation, and
another arranging joint financing, with a German loan and Banobras
credits, for construction of a second light train line in Guadalajara.  At
the conclusion of the German tour, Trade Secretary Jaime Serra
announced that more than 60 German firms have pledged to invest about
US$3 billion in Mexico over the next few years.

During his brief visit in Czechoslovakia, Salinas met with President
Vaclav Havel, and called for a European dialogue with Latin America.
Reflecting on the contradictory forces of Balkanization that is breaking
up European republics and globalization of national economies, Salinas
averred that foreign financing and opening of trade opportunities are the
necessary ingredients to bolster incipient democracies.  In this regard,
Mexico sees the successful completion of the Uruguay Round of the
GATT as critical, the president said.

In his meeting with Salinas, Soviet President Gorbachev expressed his
interest in deepening ties with Latin America and Mexico.  The two men
discussed the free trade agreement, Cuba and the July 18-19
Iberoamerican Summit to be held in Guadalajara.  Cuban President Fidel
Castro is to attend, which could lead to policy decisions about relations
in the hemisphere with the Castro regime.  In a press conference,
Gorbachev announced that he will make a state visit to Mexico next year.
The presidents signed agreements that provide for Pemex to offer
technical assistance in reconstruction of an oil refinery, setting up a
direct telephone line between the two countries, and establishing joint
cooperation in combatting drug trafficking.

Salinas also held talks with Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian
Federation, and former Foreign Relations Minister Eduard
Schevardnadze, who resigned from the Communist Party hours after his
meeting with the Mexican president.

Salinas was accompanied on his trip by leading Mexican businessmen
including Carlos Slim, owner of Telmex, Claudio X. Gonzalez, director
of Kimberly Clark and presidential adviser on foreign investment, and
Roberto Hernandez, head of the Accival brokerage.

EXCHANGE AND METALS

The exchange rate continued to devalue by 40 centavos/day.  During the
period, exchange cover for the free rate was introduced (see FINANCE),
on the same lines as that for the controlled rate.  There was no difference
in quotes between free and controlled rate cover.  This could be the
prelude to an eventual unification of rates, but the government seems in
no hurry.

INTEREST RATES

Rates for 28-day Cetes backed up for two successive weeks, with 91-day
paper rising in sympathy, as the government mopped up liquidity with
larger Cete issues.  With projected real rates close to 6%, we consider
it unlikely rates will rise much further.

STOCK MARKET

The stock market index advanced by 3% over the period, although it is
still just off its June 6 high of 1,131.  The period began with a fall of
28
points (to 1,052) in sympathy with the Dow, itself influenced by the
Nikkei, which had plunged on the Nomura revelations.  It was choppy
for the rest of the week, closing on June 28 (the end of the month and
the semester) at 1,058.

Influenced by the Dow, the market showed a strong upswing at the
beginning of the second week, with rises of 19, 18, 2 and 23 points on
the first four days of trading, before profit taking on July 5 pushed it
back down to 1,114 at the end of the period. An analysis of the market
for the second quarter and the first semester is provided in this week's
SPOTLIGHT.  In it, we continue to recommend 30% in stocks in:
Cemex, Cifra, Codumex, Kimberly, Telmex and Ttolmex.

There is no change in the overall MS portfolio recommendation:
positions of 10% in Adjustabonos, 25% in Tesobonos, 30% in stocks,
30% in money market instruments and 5% in BIBs.

MEXICAN STOCK MARKET: FIRST SEMESTER 1991

Favorable developments on the financial and privatization fronts have
lifted stock prices beyond the highs achieved in the previous quarter, and
the market still has plenty of momentum.  The Bolsa index shot ahead
by 32% from April through June (up from 28% in the first quarter),
cresting at a record 1,131 on June 6.  For the semester, the gain was
68% in peso terms and 65% in dollars (see Table 1B in printed copy of
newsletter).

In this regular quarterly MS analysis of the Bolsa, we look at the
market's performance in the second quarter (see Mexico Service, April 10,
1991 for first quarter results) and the first half of 1991, breaking down
the surveyby sector and individual companies.  Then we consider the factors
moving the market, prospects for the remainder of 1991, and offer our
stock portfolio recommendations.

SECOND QUARTER TRENDS

The market had closed the previous quarter at a record 803 points.
(Note that the final three zeroes were removed from the index on May
13; for purposes of this analysis, we have dropped these three digits for
earlier figures retroactively).  That spurt was followed by four distinct
phases in the market's behavior in the second quarter, with alternating
periods of advances and consolidations.

April 1-17: Scaling new heights

By the end of the first week of April, the market had risen to 859 and
continued on its upward course in the second week, reaching a new peak
of 934 on April 17.  Fueling the drive were the bull market in the US,
where the Dow broke 3,000 on April 17; generally favorable reviews of
Salinas's April visit to the US and Canada to promote the FTA; and
market anticipation of a successful selloff of the government's Telmex
L shares, which boosted the Telmex stock quotation.

April 18-May 6: Consolidation

Following the explosive advances in the first half of April, the market
took a breather, mainly on technical grounds, through the beginning of
May.  It had doubled back to 919 on May 6.

May 7-June 6: Further advances

The following period saw the Bolsa breaking a succession of records,
propelled by two important developments.  One was the success of the
Telmex issue as priced on May 13, reinforced by positive news for the
FTA as two key US congressional committees rejected resolutions
blocking extension of the fast-track on May 14, and as other obstacles
were cleared away thereafter.  The index leaped from 931 on May 7 to
993 on May 9, and attained a new closing high of 1,008 on May 13
(without the index adjustment that day, it would have broken through the
one million barrier).  By May 17, it had soared to 1,018.  The index was
further spurred the following week by positive fast-track votes in the
House on May 23, putting it up to 1,045, and the Senate on May 24;  by
May 31,  it had reached 1,096.  The market crested on June 6 at an all-
time peak of 1,131 (80% above its level at end-1990).

June 7-28: Second Retracement

Following May's extraordinary performance, the market went through
a period of consolidation in June, dropping back to 1,080 by June 21.
The main influences during this period were the announcement of the
first three bank sales at higher prices than expected, which caused
switching on the margin between nonbank and bank stocks by some
Mexican investors.  A slight backup in interest rates also took its toll,
as did profit-taking to cash in on the gains of the previous month.  Even so,
the market closed the semester on June 28 at 1,058, only 6% off its all-
time high.  This meant a 68% advance in pesos and 65% in dollars over
the end-1990 level.

SECTORAL PERFORMANCE

SECOND QUARTER

Against the average (index) increase of 32%, eight sectors came in above
average and twelve below (see Table 2 in printed copy of newsletter).
Only three sectors failed to keep pace with the 3% estimated CPI increase
for the quarter. The top eight groups were as follows: Banks, Construction,
Insurance, Clothing, Brokerage, Food, Groups and Tobacco.  Financial
concerns (banks, insurance, brokerage) dominated the lineup owing to
euphoria over the bank privatization and the potential synergies from the
formation of financial groups.  The Construction sector was spurred on by
continued strong performances by the cement companies (Cemex, Ttolmex).
Food was boosted by good results for Bimbo, and Groups by the big hikes in
the shares of Contal and Visa, whose main holding is Femsa.
Metallurgy, Electricals and Engineering, at the other end of the scale,
did not even beat inflation.  The primary cause of this weak performance
is the unmarketable nature of the stocks in the Metallurgy and
Engineering sectors.  In the Electrical sector, share prices of telecoms
suppliers (Ericsson, Indetel) also failed to lift off due to investor
concerns that Telmex, under new ownership and management, would
squeeze their margins.  Codumex also showed little positive movement.

Several high capitalization, marketable sectors are clustered in the area
above inflation, but below the average.  In the Utilities sector, Telmex -
- with the dominant weighting -- turned in a moderate 26%.  In Steel,
Tamsa's 24% increase also held down the overall sectoral results.
Exporting sectors (Chemicals and Mining) continued to do relatively
poorly, pending confirmation of a US recovery.  Paper and Stores stocks
adjusted downward after relatively strong performances in the previous
two quarters.

FIRST SEMESTER

For the first half of the year (see Table 3 in print copy of newsletter),
there are just five sectors that beat the index increase of 68%, with 15
sectors underperforming.  Only three sectors did worse than inflation,
estimated at 9% for the period. The big advance in Construction stocks
reflected a major catchup by Cemex and Ttolmex, which had underperformed
the market during the two previous years.  The surge in bank stocks is
attributable to movement on  the  privatization  front;  when  the  first
three banks were sold at multiples of price/book at least 50% higher than
had been expected, the sector was revalued overall.  The strength showed by
Groups reflected advances in Contal, Visa and Desc.  A major runup in
Telmex prices prior to the latest phase of its privatization underpinned
the move in Utilities.  Steel's good showing was accounted for by
advances in both Tamsa and Sidek (which still has about half its assets
in Steel, with the rest in tourism).

At the bottom of the ranking, Mining stocks were damaged by soft
demand for exports (stemming partly from the US recession), and
specifically by stagnant metals prices; all the key mining players
(Penoles, Grupo Mexico, Frisco and Sanluis) underperformed the
market.  The next two sectors from the bottom, Electricals and
Metallurgy, slipped badly in the second quarter, driving their first-half
positions down.  The Electrical sector was undermined by the poor
performances of Indetel and  Ericsson, which were not compensated by
a reasonable increase in Codumex.

Beating inflation but still below average were: Drinks, Food, Brokerage,
Insurance, Clothing, Tobacco, Consumer Goods, Paper, Engineering,
Stores, Autoparts and Chemicals.  Of these stocks, the advance in
financial stocks (Brokerage and Insurance) in the second quarter did not
overcome their relative stagnation in the first.  Meanwhile, of the main
marketable sectors, Paper and Stores drew back from their
overperformance in the previous year, while Chemicals continued to be
hurt by the US recession.

INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES

SECOND QUARTER

Of our 88-company sample, 31 overshot the Bolsa's general advance of
32% and 57 fell short of it (Table 5 in print copy of newsletter), while 29
matched or fell below the estimated 3% inflation for the period.  The
fifteen stocks that did not move at all (0% increase) reflect mostly lack
of marketability rather than price stagnation.

Financial companies dominated the top ten stocks.  The sharp increases
in the price of Vamsa (insurance), Atlanti (bank), Cbobsa (brokerage),
Confia (bank), and Promex (bank) all reflect the current euphoria about
bank privatization and the formation of financial groups.  Also
outperforming the index were Comermex, Banamex, Cremi, Bancen,
Bacomer, Banorie, Serfin, Banorte, Banoro, Intenal and Inverlat.  This
means that 16 of the 31 companies that outdid the index were financial
stocks.

Nonbank high achievers were Visa, a holding company with illiquid
stock whose price caught up with that of its key holding, Femsa; Cemex,
whose profits were improved by price increases and reduced debt; Vitro,
benefitting from the turnaround in Anchor; Sidek, boosted by investor
perceptions that it is the only strong tourism play in the market; and
Ttolmex, benefitting from higher cement prices.

In the below-inflation group, companies whose stocks are relatively
visible and marketable include telephone suppliers (Ericsson, Indetel and
Latinca), still subject to a squeeze from Telmex's new cost-minded
management; mining companies suffering from weak metals prices (e.g.
Frisco, Sanluis, Grupo Mexico, Penoles); and chemical exporters hit by
the US recession (Neromex, Celanese, Carbide, Borden). In the middle-
range are companies that did not keep up with the index but still did
quite well (by most country standards).  Femsa, Telmex, Cifra, Tamsa,
Apasco, Kimberly and CMA stocks are marketable and a positive case
can be made for their prospects.

FIRST SEMESTER

Over the first semester, 21 stocks raced ahead of the 68% gain in the
Bolsa index and 67 came in behind it, with 33 of these stocks
underperforming estimated inflation of 9% (Table 6 in print copy of
newsletter).

Of the 21 highest-ranking stocks, there continued to be a preponderance
of financial institutions: Atlanti, Promex, Cremi, Bancomer, Banamex,
Vamsa, Banoro, Serfin, Intenal.  However, unlike the second quarter
alone, they are not generally among the top performers; other,
nonfinancial stocks surpass them because of excellent performances in
both quarters.  These stocks include Cemex, Contal, Eaton, Nadro
Sidek, Tremec, and Ttolmex in the top seven places, with Telmex
placing 11, Visa 12, Vitro 16 and Apasco 19.

At the lower end of the scale are marketable companies in the Mining
(Sanluis, Frisco, Grupo Mexico) and Electrical (Indetel, Ericsson,
Latinca) groups.  The middle range contains several companies that did
well last year (Cifra, Sanborn, Kimberly, Crisoba) and appear to have
leveled off.

MARKET FACTORS

The major trends of the first and second quarters overlapped for the most
part, but with a marginally different emphasis.  The key driving forces
were as follows:

* Mexican investors focused on banks and financial companies.  Their
interest was only reinforced in the second quarter when prices under the
first three bank privatizations exceeded the most optimistic estimates.
This optimism spilled over into evaluations of most other financial
companies and lead to a leveling off of nonfinancial stocks.

* Foreign investor demand continued to set the tone for prices of non-
financial stocks (foreigners may not buy bank or brokerage stocks, and
insurance stocks are illiquid).  Foreigners continued to focus on highly
marketable, high-capitalization stocks with strong product focus and a
domestic orientation.  This explained the strength of companies such as
Contal and Sidek, the cement companies, and Telmex.  It also accounts
for the relative weakness of conglomerates such as Desc and Alfa).

* Weakness in the stocks of internationally oriented companies.
Chemical and mining operations continued to do poorly, as the market
remained uncertain about the duration of the US recession.

PROSPECTS

In our last report (XI-8), we stated that if Mexico reaches a historic
price/earnings multiple of 20, it would imply an index level of 1,150.
The index is not quite at this point yet, as we reckoned without the
earnings strength of the first quarter.  The index peak of 1,131 was
reached on June 6, with a historic P/E we calculate at around 18 and a
price/book value ratio of around 180%.

The outlook for further gains is favorable, as the same positive factors
will continue to operate in the market in the third quarter:

* strong earnings growth for most companies in 1991 combined with
better-than-expected GDP growth (higher than 4%);

* continued price flexibility under the Pact, permitting higher operating
and net profit margins;

* further reductions in nominal and real interest rates despite the current
blip (see MARKETS);

* continued foreign investment in the Mexican market; and

* ongoing improvements in capital market mechanisms.

Factors that could put a brake on stock prices include an increase in the
number of new stock issues, or a diversion of repatriated Mexican capital
away from the stock market and into bank privatizations.  However, on
most fundamental valuations, the Mexican market is still rated lower than
most Asian emerging markets with similar growth prospects.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Of the stocks in the MS portfolio, only two -- Cemex with 79% and
Ttolmex with 52% -- performed better than the average of 32% in the
second quarter.  The other stocks advanced as follows: Telmex 26%,
Cifra 25%, Kimberly 15%, and Codumex 6%.  Assuming an equal
weighting in each stock, this provides an average return of 34% against
the index average of 32%. Over the semester, the portfolio did even
better.  Stock gains have been: Cemex 210%, Ttolmex 121%, Telmex
92%, Cifra 60%, Kimberly 39%, and Codumex 38%.  Again equally
weighted, this would produce an average return of 93%, against the
market index of 68%.

Given the continued positive outlook for the market, we still recommend
retention of the existing portfolio at 30% (cost) in stocks.  We still have
not reached the point when out-of-favor stocks (Conglomerates, Mining,
Chemicals) will return to popularity: this could occur before our next
quarterly report, and we will advise readers accordingly.  Therefore, our
recommended peso stock portfolio remains invested in Cemex, Cifra,
Codumex, Kimberly, Telmex, and Ttolmex.

By Georges, they're gorgeous!

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By Hisham Harun

WHEN my two friends and I were invited by French fashion export agent
Beatrice Bostyn to view several items from Georges Rech's latest
Fall/Winter accessory collection from Paris, we didn't quite expect to be
thoroughly bowled over.
  So what if Rech was famed for integrating creativity with realism, or
that he was one of the pioneers to revolutionise ready-to-wear in the
early 60s... we've seen so many great designs by numerous top couturiers
and so how much different could Rech be?
  Then we saw his new line of bags, scarves, shoes and jewellery which
were simply displayed on Bostyn's hotel room bed. We were captivated, to
say the least. Why, we even picked up some items with intent to buy.
  Sweet as she was, however, the marketing executive who had brought the
items down with her couldn't help us here as she was assigned by her
company, Anne Mucci, to look for potential Georges Rech distributors in
this region.
  The items Bostyn had brought with her would have to follow her to the
next destination, Singapore, and then later to Hong Kong and "a few other
places" before going back to the world's fashion capital.
  So there we were, clinging on to some of the most vibrant flowy floral
silk scarves, jewellery pieces, bags and shoes, feeling a tad
disappointed.
  Under Rech's establishment, big and bold jewellery that belonged to the
80s looked nonetheless elegant and classy.
  The smaller, simpler pieces looked chic and sophisticated while the more
artistic, almost avant garde ones, were contemporary, fun, stylish and
most importantly, still wearable.
  Rech's jewellery - that formed bracelets, necklaces and earrings - took
on basic oval, round or square shapes and came either in matte silver or
gold. Onyx and sparkling clear Swarovsky crystals were the main stones
used.
  The belts were mostly slim, and came in shades of brown and black with
silver and gold detailing as well as the popular GR logo that didn't seem
too loud or overbearing but gelled naturally with the overall look.
  In keeping with current trends, one could see that Rech also included
Prada-like buckles and the ever-popular Paloma Picasso criss-cross in his
range.
  Both the shoes and belts collection in ebony conformed to the minimalist
requirements of all that's classic and refined.
  Besides the generous flower prints, most of his designs for the scarves
were presented in a delicious offering of brown and red hues. Ribbons and
fruits were also the main focus.

Your last chance to catch `Tanah Abang'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

By Shuib Taib

TANAH Abang, a period play produced by Panggung Negara, will end its run
at Auditorium DBKL tomorrow. The curtain rises at 8.30pm.
  Tickets priced at RM10 can be obtained from Panggung Negara (tel:
2943022) or Matic (tel: 2643929).
  Scripted and directed by Onie Moraza, Tanah Abang tells of the British
intervention in the administration of Perak in 1528. In order to
strengthen his position, Sultan Muzaffar Shah (played by Karim Latiff)
decides to marry Tun Merah (Erma Fatima) and make her the new queen.
  However, his intention is misconstrued. Tun Merah's parents and brother
think he only wants her to fulfil his sexual needs, thus making her a
gundek or mistress. Tun Merah is naturally disgusted by the thought.
Besides, she has a long-time fiance.
  Also in the cast are veteran actor Zulkifli Zain who plays Megat
Terawis, Sidek Husin (Anjang), Mustafa Abu Bakar (Pedro) and Wan Norazlin
(Tun Perabu).

Just think: Childers, a true servant of justice

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

By Chandra Muzaffar

ONE of the most courageous and eloquent voices in the eternal struggle for
a just world is silent.
  Erskine Childers died of a heart attack on Aug 25 in Luxembourg hours
after making an impassioned speech on his favourite theme - the importance
of UN reform - at the 50th anniversary congress of the World Federation of
United Nations Associations (WFUNA) of which he was Secretary-General. He
was 67.
  In the last few years of his life, Childers campaigned with relentless
vigour for a United Nations which in its structure and content would
reflect the interests of the majority of humankind.
  He wanted the UN General Assembly in particular strengthened because it
was that one political organ in the UN system that, theoretically at
least, treated each and every member state as an equal.
  But the UN, he argued, should go beyond the nation state. It should,
through the creation of a new tier, give real meaning to that fundamental
concept embodied in the UN Charter, namely, "We, the peoples of the United
Nations."
  It was one of his great sorrows that the UN had been hijacked by the
powerful in the North, especially after the 1991 Gulf War. It was being
used against the nations of the South.
  For Childers, the UN was vital for the well-being of the South or the
Third World. It gave them the collective security that they needed in a
world dominated by the elites of the North.
  In a 1993 essay, essay he noted that, "The arrival of the Third World in
the United Nations ... was a truly epochal, history-making moment ... for
the whole of humankind ... For it was the first moment in the entire
history of human life on this planet when all of its societies could meet
in one place, supposedly on terms of equality and mutual respect among
nations large and small, to strengthen common standards of behaviour and
to develop and then implement all across the world common programmes for
peace, justice, and social and economic equity."
  But Childers knew that if the UN had failed to realise the aspirations
of the people of the South, it was because the entire international system
was weighed against the interests of the majority of humankind.
  The intellectual, economic and social, and political frameworks had been
established in such a manner that they facilitated the dominance of the
world by a small minority located largely in the West.
  Western intellectual domination, for instance, "closed down, placed in a
straitjacket, all indigenous processes of intellectual enquiry and
evolution of political and social institutions of most of humankind...
Whole peoples were taught that nothing in their culture, however long
proven and however vibrant, was any longer worth anything; that the only
way to that condition called `progress' was to learn from their colonial
masters."
  As he lamented the intellectual suppression of the South, so did
Childers lambast the gross iniquities in the economic and social relations
between the North and the South.
  He was never tired of highlighting that indisputable fact that in the
Nineties, the 20 per cent Northern minority controls 82.7 per cent of
world gross national product; 81.2 per cent of world trade; 80.5 per cent
of domestic investment; and 94 per cent of research and development.
  Childers would often quote the UN Development Programme which has
calculated that "the developing countries are losing over US$500 billion a
year in income that they could earn, because of protectionist barriers
against the exports they try to sell to the North, because of Northern
manipulation of interest rates on their borrowings, and because of other
structural inequities between the North and the South. That is to say that
the policies of Northern governments are preventing the developing
countries from earning 10 times all the official aid they receive from the
North."
  For Childers, the political framework of the North-South divide was also
a major cause of global tensions and conflicts.
  He bemoaned "the imperial legacy of grafting the western centralist
nation state onto every society in the world, whether or not that
structure had the remotest relevance or "fit" to the value-systems of a
given culture."
  It is partly because of this that ethnic conflagrations continue to
break out every now and then in many post-colonial societies.
  These conflagrations deeply troubled Childers which is why he often
implored the UN to develop mechanisms that could deal with ethnic and
cultural conflicts.
  The UN - its shortcomings notwithstanding - had a very special place in
Childers' heart for it was in the UN that he built his career.
  He joined the UN secretariat in 1967 and worked with almost every organ
and agency within the UN system in different parts of the world for 22
years.
  His last UN post was that of Senior Adviser to the UN Director for
Development and International Economic Cooperation.
  After his retirement, he continued to travel all over the world talking
and writing about global injustices with that passion and commitment that
was his trademark.
  It was at one such conference on UN intervention and national
sovereignty in Sigtuna, Sweden in May 1992 that I first met with Erskine
Childers.
  We met a couple of times after that and corresponded with one another.
  When Just World Trust (JUST) established an International Advisory
Panel, he was one of the first persons I approached to become a member. He
accepted the invitation with much enthusiasm.
  Later, in December 1994, he was one of the main speakers at the JUST
international conference on "Rethinking Human Rights" in Kuala Lumpur.
  At the conference and in a television interview I did with him, Childers
spoke in great detail about how crucial it was to organise and mobilise
the South to fight the injustices in the global system.
  Indeed, fighting for justice was in the genes of the man. His
grandfather was a revolutionary who gave his life for the cause of Irish
freedom.
  Executed by the British in 1992 for treason, Erskine Childers won
international fame as the author of the classic, The Riddle of the Sands.
  His son, also Erskine Childers, became President of Ireland and was also
a steadfast advocate of social justice.
  It is one of the sad ironies of life that the second Erskine Childers
also died after delivering a speech.
  Coming from a family with such a strong love for justice, was it any
wonder that the third Erskine Childers took up cudgels on behalf of the
oppressed and the downtrodden?
  It is significant in this regard that the cause that first attracted the
energy of the young Childers was Palestine.
  His first book, Common Sense about the Arab World, was a product of this
commitment. His second book, The Road To Suez: A Study In Western-Arab
Relations, expanded the ideas in the first book and articulated profound
concerns about inter-civilisational ties which remained dear to Childers
till the end of his life.
  In more specific language, Childers felt that the West has been terribly
unjust in its treatment of Arab, and, in a larger sense, Islamic
civilisation.
  The West has to this day sought to block out its collective
consciousness its immeasurable debt to the Arabs and Muslims for "the very
rise of Western civilisation itself".
  Childers called this "the largest self-induced amnesia in human
history".
  His incisive analysis of this phenomenon is contained in one of his most
brilliant essays entitled "Amnesia and Antagonism" which JUST helped to
distribute worldwide.
  In it Childers employs meticulous scholarship to illustrate how in
almost every sphere of human activity, Europe borrowed heavily from Arab
and Muslim sources.
  From medicine and mathematics to architecture and the arts to government
and commerce, the European Renaissance absorbed a whole variety of ideas
and institutions from the Islamic world.
  As an example, Childers observes that, "The million word Qanun of Ibn-
Sina (980-1037) cataloguing all then-known ailments, diseases and their
treatments, was the prime textbook of the new medical schools at Paris,
Bologna, Montpellier, Padua and Naples and continued in use until the
early eighteenth century."
  The adamant, arrogant refusal to acknowledge the pervasive influence and
impact of Islam upon the West was not the only injustice which concerned
Childers; in the interface between the two civilisations, the West has
also displayed a great deal of antagonism towards Islam.
  He attributes Western antagonism to theological differences, to the
Muslim occupation of parts of Europe, to the Crusades, to colonialism, and
to contemporary neo-colonial interests.
  It is mainly because of the desire of the centres of power in the West
to protect and perpetuate their economic interests, specifically oil, that
certain important Western governments pursue foreign policies that are so
palpably unjust to the Muslim world - especially those countries that are
determined to preserve their independence and autonomy.
  Childers regarded this as a formidable obstacle to any Western-Islamic
dialogue.
  In fact, he believed that, "The dissolution of the Russian-Soviet empire
has released the West from its historically brief fixation with that
particular "East", just as its concerns with its original demon-East -
Islam - have begun a new cycle of volatitily."
  In order to break this volatile cycle, the West, Childers was convinced,
should try to be just and fair to Islam and Muslims.
  Whether it was the relationship between the West and Islam or the divide
between the North and the South, Erskine Childers' paramount
consideration, it is apparent, was justice. It is, in that sense, that he
was a true servant of justice with very few parallels in the modern world.

Bolshoi Ballet set to mesmerise KL folk

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 5

By Hafidah Samat

IT isn't everyday that Sleeping Beauty wakes up to paint the town red. But
the Bolshoi Ballet of Tashkent is offering nothing less with their
mesmerising performances when they stage a three-act ballet of the 19th-
century classic Sleeping Beauty, in Kuala Lumpur.
  The performance, which will be taking centrestage for two days starting
Oct 31, is organised by Event Management (EM) Consultants Sdn Bhd in
collaboration with MAA-Medicare Kidney Charity Fund.
  To formalise the understanding between MAA-Medicare and EM Management
Consultants Sdn Bhd, a memorandum was signed recently.
  Signing on behalf of MAA-Medicare was Datuk Lee Lam Thye, a member of
the Board of Trustees, while EM Consultants was represented by its
managing director, Syed Isa Syed Alwi.
  According to Lee, the primary aim of the MAA-Medicare Kidney Charity
Fund is to provide more affordable dialysis treament to patients
throughout the nation.
  "In only one-and-half-years, we have successfully set up three charity
dialysis centres which are located in Kuala Lumpur, Teluk Intan and
Butterworth," he adds.
  The largest is the one in KL which is treating 89 patients and has 19
haemodialysis machines. The Teluk Intan branch has seven machines and
treats 14 patients, while the Butterworth branch, which was launched in
May, is treating seven patients with five machines.
  "Our efforts have benefited more than 110 patients who are charged RM99
per bicarbonate treatment. This is much cheaper than those charged by
private clinics and hospitals which are between RM150-RM250 per
treatment," says Lee.
  According to Lee the urgent need for more charity centres is evident as
insufficient funds and the lack of machines have caused many unnecessary
deaths.
  "These projects require huge funding. Besides appealing to corporate
bodies and the public for financial support, we are open to co-operating
with any party to organise fund-raising activities," says Lee.
  And of course, one such event will be the Bolshoi Ballet's performances
in KL. According to Syed Isa, the 120-member troupe will include 40
orchestra musicians and 53 dancers.
  "The Bolshoi Ballet is in the middle of its Asian tour and Malaysia will
mark its first stop," says Syed Isa.
  "We strongly feel that this cultural exposure will enable Malaysians to
witness world-class performances ...
  "We will ensure that its two-hour show is going to be entirely different
from any other ballet performance," say Syed Isa.
  All proceeds from the performances will be forwarded to MAA-Medicare
Kidney Charity Fund.
  "We hope to donate about RM500,000 to the fund, but this depends on the
ticket collection," says Syed Isa.
  The production of Sleeping Beauty was first staged in St Petersburg in
1890 and was adapted from Charles Perrault's fairy tale.
  Tickets for the charity premier show on Oct 31 are priced at RM250,
RM350, RM550 and RM800. Tickets for the performance on Nov 1 are priced at
RM180, RM250, RM450 and RM800.
  For corporate bodies, tickets can be purchased in various packages of
differing amounts and privileges.
  For futher information, call Abdul Aziz of EM Consultants Sdn Bhd at 03-
9811129 or MAA-Medicare Kidney Charity Fund at 03-4447906.

Music magic from piano duo

By Shuib Taib

WHEN you are on your own in a foreign land, the will to "carry on"
inevitably becomes stronger despite the odds.
  Take Dennis Lee, for instance. Born in Penang, the professional pianist
has come a long way since the first time he played the piano. Like most
professional musicians, Lee also had to sit for one exam after another to
upgrade himself.
  At 14, Lee won a scholarship to study piano - with Angus Morrison - and
violin at the Royal College of Music. Having obtained his Bachelor of
Music with First Class Honours and his Masters of Music, he then received
an Austrian government scholarship to study with Joseph Dichler in Vienna
where he earned both the Akademie Diploma with Distinction and the
Stepanow Prize.
  And when he was in Venice, Lee had to continue his piano lessons in
Milan. He had no money then.
  "Then again, music has nothing to do with economics. It's not only for
the rich, and no one should be deprived of it," chips in his wife, Toh
Chee Hung.
  Lee, who was penniless at the time somehow managed to find his way to
Milan for his practices. This he did religiously until he completed his
course.
  "I think music is magic. It is multi-functional and can help train your
mind. It teaches you to be disciplined, helps you to co-ordinate and to
use your five senses to your advantage," says Lee.
  It was also in Milan that Lee met his wife, Toh.
  "You could say that, for us, Europe is where it all happened. Musically
speaking, it's where classical music began and it is also where we first
met." While Lee had to travel from Venice to Milan, Toh travelled from
Switzerland for her piano lessons with the same 95-year-old teacher named
Kodaly.
  "For geographical reasons, we are now based in London as it's difficult
to stay in Asia and travel to Europe regularly to fulfil engagements,"
explains Toh.
  Like Lee, Toh also sat for many examinations and won many prizes. Born
in Singapore, Toh studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London under
Max Pirani. She then won the Sterndale Bennett Prize, Christie Moore Award
and MacFarren Gold Medal (the top piano prize).
  She has also made recordings that have been aired worldwide over the BBC
World Service. Before finally residing in London, she held various
professional posts in Switzerland.
  While Lee has performed in Washington DC, Japan, Malta, France, Germany,
Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, Toh has toured Britain, US, Canada,
Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark and the Far East.
  Their 1996 appearances include performances in France, Italy, US,
Canada, Malaysia and the Barbican Centre in London.
  Lee and Toh are in Malaysia for a series of special performances - two
held over the weekend in Ipoh and Penang and the third tomorrow - called
"Piano Duo" where, for the first time, they are featured side by side.
  Although it is rare to see two pianists playing simultaneously, Lee says
that "it should be interesting to hear different interpretations of the
same melodies. We will do four songs together and one solo piece each".
  "You will hear stereo-phonic sound and it should also be interesting to
see two people in action at the same time."
  Their final performance will be held tomorrow at the Petaling Jaya Civic
Centre at 8pm. Tickets, priced at RM30, can be obtained from Yamaha Music
branches in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya as well as Sedaya Music College
and L & J Music Studio, Old Klang Road.

First person: Why some films turn me into a wretched sob queen

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

By Saleha Ali

I TRIED but I still cried.
  Okay, if you must know, movies have a way of affecting me up close and
personal. Forget about self control, the tears will just roll.
  Last week, I found myself weeping unabashedly in the theatre (yet
again!) as this guy puffed his last breath in the arms of his lady,
stricken as he was with some malignant brain disease.
  I wasn't sure who was more devastated, me or the silver screen blonde.
As I stumbled out of the darkened cinema, I remembered why I had vowed to
see tear-jerkers only in the safe haven of the living room.
  You see, once the lights go up and reality bites, red puffy eyes are
just a no-no.
  This crying game will strike when you least expect it too. For instance,
is Independence Day a heartrending tale? Far from it, right?
  Hmmm, that was what I thought. No prizes for guessing who left the
cineplex with a wrung-out heart and an all-night sniffle after seeing the
newly-widowed US President holding on to his little daughter for strength.
  On assignment in Singapore some time ago, I caught a movie called Bright
Lights Big City, about a young man coming to terms with his mother's
impending death from cancer.
  That struck too close to home. A colleague, Joan, who shared the same
experience, broke down in floods too.
  Boy, was I glad I was home alone when I saw The Joy Luck Club. Grief
struck at almost every juncture and at the end of it, I felt faintly
dehydrated.
  The film, on the lives of four courageous women and their rapport with
their daughters, was only too reminiscent of my sometimes turbulent
relationship with my late mother.
  I saw my enterprising, take-the-bull-by-the-horns Mak in the mothers and
caught glimpses of the hurting child that I used to be in the daughters.
  You see, because of Mak's constant chidings (she used to think I was the
world's greatest procrastinator), I thought she loved me least until I saw
her hastily wiping away tears when I made my maiden voyage to KL to attend
college years ago.
  Altitute doesn't help matters, I have discovered. The watertap can still
flow some 15,000km above sea level.
  I recall seeing several in-flight movies which left me completely
bereft. One was Father Of The Bride II (I know, I know!).
  You see, while it had a good dosage of Steve Martin's hilarity, there
were also plenty of tender father-daughter bonding scenes, not unlike
moments when my dad carried me on his back at age five to do some awesome
underwater swimming and gave me the thumbs-up when I brought home my first
domestic science achievement - a wobbly concoction called cornflour mould.
  The list goes on. Watching The Mambo Kings turned me into a wretched sob
queen. It was seeing the sacrifices that the older sibling made to keep
the younger one afloat that got me.
  Another film, Mr Wonderful, about a couple who separate only to discover
that there are many invisible threads holding them together, sadly
reminded me of ... well, never mind.
  So, you get the picture. Tales of family, loss of a loved one, human
bonding, unrequited love, injustice and missed opportunities touch me in
the raw.
  I wish sometimes that I could crow along to Jim Carrey's antics but
slapstick humour leaves me cold. No, you would not find me buying popcorn
in readiness for an Ace Ventura evening.
  Nor am I inclined to drool over brawny Arnie Schwarzenegger in The
Terminator or hunky Bruce Willis in the Die Hard series.
  But I relish feature films which are warm and witty, with a pulse on
real life situations. I appreciate lines which remind us of something or
someone.
  But then again, these are the very movies which can ruthlessly peel away
at the layers of armour we wear to shield off the elements.
  I would like to think it is all therapeutic, this blubbering and losing
all sense and sensibility watching films like Sleepless In Seattle, French
Kiss and Forget Paris, not to speak of the out-and-out "heavies" like
Cyrano De Bergerac and The Scarlet Letter.
  But it has made me distinctly wary of even titles like Pinocchio and The
Hunchback of Notre Dame....!

Enlightening on AIDS

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 9

By Cheah Chor Sooi

THE deadly HIV/AIDS is the cover story for this month's issue of Jelita.
  Writer Lily Haslina Nasir interviews Health Ministry Public Health
Department AIDS/HIV Division deputy director Datin Dr Harrison Aziz
Shahabuddin as well as Tenaganita director Irene Fernandez on the issue.
  They agree that every woman should have the right to question her hubby
if she is doubtful of his health status.
  "The present mind frame that the decision to pursue sexual intercourse
lies with the man should change.
  "Women have the right to probe if they become suspicious of their
spouse's movements. The truth is, it has become more difficult these days
to ascertain if one party has remained faithful to the other."
  Jelita relates the first-hand experiences of women who have fallen prey
to the disease because of their husbands' infidelity.
  Early detection helps greatly to counter the spread of the disease. Find
out the necessary steps to take if the medical check-up shows that you are
a carrier or have contracted AIDS.
  There is also a list of counselling bodies and voluntary organisations
that can lend a hand to ease suffering.
  In the world of dresses, view the elegant kebaya and baju kurung made
contemporary after being fashioned from silk and batik.
  For those taking exams, Jelita gives tips on how to get good grades.
  Annual subscription rate for Jelita is RM64.30 in Peninsular Malaysia
and RM84.30 for Sabah and Sarawak.
  Maxima cardmembers enjoy a special subscription rate of RM56.20 for
Peninsular Malaysia and RM73.70 for Sabah and Sarawak.

Bead stringer's adroitness draws the crowd

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By Azura Abas

CULTURAL EXTRAVAGANZA ... Nonrinji Mantuku from the Rungus tribe was a
star attraction with her bead work at the "Mini Sabah" promotion at the
Sungai Wang Plaza in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
  The promotion was among a host of cultural activities held in
conjunction with Malaysia Fest which was launched on Saturday night.
  Mantuku, 36, from Kudat, a full-time beads stringer in her village,
said: "It only takes me a day to string beads with simple patterns while
it takes almost a week to complete those with difficult patterns."
  She learnt it from her mother when she was only 10 and hopes her six
daughters will continue the colourful tradition. Beads are the main
decorative items of the tribal women.
  Other attractions of the promotion included demonstrations on making the
Kota Belud parang or machete, Tandek rattan mat, Ranau tree bark yarn,
Nabawan bag and Kota Merudu basket-weaving.
  The 15-day promotion was launched by Sabah Tourism and Environmental
Assistant Minister Nahalan Damsal.
  Meanwhile in Petaling Jaya, the Pahang Government launched its Cultural
and Arts Festival under the theme "Treasures of Pahang".
  State Culture and Arts Committee chairman Datuk Law Kee Long launched
the festival using a traditional blow-pipe to burst a balloon filled with
coloured particles at the foyer of Subang Parade shopping complex.
  It was then followed by an Orang Asli dance and several cultural dances
staged by a State cultural group.

KL to play major role in R&D of renewable energy resources

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By Syed Nadzri in Harare

MALAYSIA will play a major role in the development of renewable energy
resources in the absence of a strong commitment from the West towards
international efforts in this area.
  Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the country was
always prepared to be at the forefront of research and development
strategies to counter depleting energy sources.
  "We are showing our commitment and will continue with our efforts," he
told reporters after attending an investment briefing at the Zimbabwe
Industrial Corporation office yesterday.
  Dr Mahathir's affirmation came a day after he was appointed vice-
president of the World Solar Commission which is organising the Second
World Solar Summit here from today.
  He is one of the two vice-presidents of the commission headed by
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. The other is Pakistani President Farouq
Ahmad Khan Leghari.
  The presence of Dr Mahathir and Leghari added the only sparkle to the
otherwise lacklustre summit which was supposed to be attended by no less
than 14 heads of government.
  Asked on the poor turnout, especially the absence of leaders from
developed countries, Dr Mahathir said he could not find a clear reason.
  "Maybe they are not interested in solar energy," he quipped.
  The Prime Minister was also asked whether the commission would face
problems due to lack of financial support from the richer countries.
  He admitted that development efforts would be a little difficult because
"people with funds are not too keen".
  Later in the afternoon, he witnessed the signing of investment
agreements involving YTL Corporation which has won the privatisation
contract of a power station at Hwange.
  Asked on the role of Malaysian companies in the development of Zimbabwe,
the Prime Minister said the firms could contribute effectively based on
their experiences in Malaysia which had trodden Zimbabwe's path before.
  "Zimbabwe is at the begining of an industrial process and this is
somewhat similiar to what Malaysia went through several years ago.
  "At the moment, Malaysian companies are concentrating on infrastructure
development. Once this is achieved, they will venture into other areas,
especially labour-intensive industries," he said.

Interview checklist

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Nor Azlina Abdul Wahab

YOU can't escape them. For most of us anyway. For employment or enrolment
in a tertiary institution, the interview can determine, in a large part,
your acceptance or rejection by the other party.
  In an interview, which is a face-to-face meeting, communication skills
are required. This is not as complicated as it sounds. You won't need to
attend classes to acquire such skills. What would be useful is a checklist
of what you would need, and need to avoid.
  Before the interview, make sure you:
  * Confirm your attendance by calling up the organisation or sending the
reply cards if required.
  * Find out the exact location of the interview prior to the session so
that you will know your way around on the big day.
  * Read and find out more about the job or course that you are applying
for and the organisation or the institution involved.
  * Prepare the relevant documents in a file. Don't have them folded or
stapled together.
  * Prepare intelligent questions, such as "What are the job/course
prospects?"
  * Prepare the correct attire and be presentable. Avoid wearing colours
that are too bright. Try to wear soft, but not dull, colours. Avoid jeans
or T-shirts.
  * Arrive early and act in a proper manner while waiting for your turn.
  During the interview:
  * Do knock on the door before entering unless the door is being opened
for you.
  * Do greet the interviewers appropriately and wait until you are asked
to be seated. Sit straight, but not stiffly with your hands folded over
defensively.
  * Do watch your body language. Avoid habits such as picking your nose or
biting your nails.
  * Do relax and answer positively but politely. Avoid answering with a
simple "yes" or "no". Try to use "Usually, but...", or "Yes, unless...",
or even "It depends on what you mean by..."
  * Do take the chance given to ask questions.
  * Do watch out for the interviewer's tricks. Try not to be angry easily.
Furthermore, do not curse in any language.
  * Do thank the interviewer for seeing you when leaving.
  Even though the qualities that interviewers look for differ depending on
the situation, there are a few aspects that are usually evaluated. These
are:
  * Physical appearance, which includes your dressing.
  * General knowledge.
  * Special skills that you have.
  * Personal interests.
  * Your attainments.
  This may not be the A to Z guide on interviews, but it is a basic
checklist for that all-important date.

Health threat from poor alien worker screening methods

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By Ramlan Said

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Malaysian Medical Association today expressed
concern over weaknesses in the health screening procedures for foreign
workers which are posing a threat to public health.
  Dr Tibbs Fernandez, chairman of its Private Practitioners Section, said
this was the reason behind the increase in cases of communicable and
contagious diseases in the country, some of which had for years been
successfully controlled or eradicated.
  Public health would be at risk as the diseases were contractable, he
added.
  He said reported cases like malaria, tuberculosis and elephantiasis at
government hospitals among foreign workers were disproportionate to their
population in Malaysia, indicating the seriousness of the problem.
  He said even diseases that had never been seen or detected for a long
time in Malaysia like kala-azar had surfaced. Kala-azar is a viral
infection which causes inflamation of the liver.
  "No doubt the country's development is partly dependent on foreign
workers but it should not be at the expense of public health."
  There are about two million foreign workers in Malaysia.
  Dr Fernandez was speaking to reporters after chairing the section's
first national working committee at Bangunan MMA. Also present was MMA
president-elect, Dr Milton Lum.
  Dr Fernandez said the diseases were most probably brought in by foreign
workers who came mostly from less developed countries with inferior public
health systems.
  He said the problem could be overcome through a concerted and systematic
approach from the authorities, like stricter enforcement especially in
nabbing illegals and enhancing screening procedures.
  "For instance, one problem that can be ironed out is the refusal by some
Immigration Department offices to use a medical examination form with a
new format for foreign workers although the Health Ministry and MMA have
agreed on it."
  Dr Fernandez said the council had tried to solve the matter with the
Task Force on Foreign Workers but was unsuccessful.
  He also said medical tests for foreign workers should not be monopolised
by certain groups. He declined to elaborate on the matter.
  Dr Fernandez added that MMA fully supported action against those found
manipulating medical tests for foreign workers, even if it involved
private doctors and laboratories.
  "The medical screening exercise is time-consuming and costly especially
for employers.
  "But we can't afford to cut corners as the consequences would be
disastrous."
  A standard medical test for a male and female foreign worker costs RM205
and RM220 respectively.
  Dr Fernandez said the council viewed with concern the danger posed by
the foreign workers, especially those who entered illegally as the latter
were not subject to any health screening tests.
  "If left unchecked, it can turn into a national security problem.
  "Nobody knows the exact number of the illegals, so the magnitude of the
problem could be far worse.
  "We fear we will reach a stage where diseases like malaria and
tuberculosis can be easily contracted by, or passed to, the public."

Picture perfect: Caring for the camera

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Zahari Zakaria

BESIDES picture-taking accessories, a complete photographic outfit should
contain a range of accessories for maintaining and repairing equipment.
  Like any equipment, cameras and lenses need a certain amount of
attention if they are to continue functioning accurately.
  Heavy use, particulary on location, inevitably causes wear and tear, and
certain moving parts, optical surfaces and integrated circuitry are
sufficiently delicate to be affected by dirt, moisture, heat and cold.
  The basic maintenance programmes consist of care in use, regular
cleaning and regular checks of major systems. In addition, damage may be
repaired by the user, although this should be approached with caution.
  Regular checking of all camera functions is an important precaution.
Familiarity with the sound, feel and appearance of the mechanisms makes it
easier to identify potential faults and can be an aid to repair. A good
occasion is when the camera is empty.
  There are, in most cameras, five major systems in the camera body -
shutter, wind-on, mirror box, viewfinder and metering, and three in the
lens - focusing, aperture diaphragm and aperture lingkage.
  The slower speeds of the shutter can be checked visually by opening the
camera back, holding the camera to the light and triggering the shutter
from its slowest speed to its highest.
  Speeds of about half a second and longer can be timed, while
progressively reducing the speed-setting makes it possible to judge speeds
even to about 1/125 second, as each should appear to be about one half the
duration of the previous one. Faster speeds cannot be reliably assessed by
the eye.
  The winding mechanism should feel and sound smooth and an additional
check is to watch the movement of the film leader when a new cassette is
installed. In use, the rewind lever on a 35mm single lens reflex will
move, although not necessarily each time the film is moved on.
  The mirror operation in a single lens reflex can be checked from the
front with the lens removed, both during normal operation and by moving
the mirror lock-up lever fitted to some models.
  Any significant problems in the viewfinder system will be immediately
obvious, but the seating of the viewing screen should be checked by
inspection.
  Any optical faults in the viewfinder which might affect accurate
focusing can also be checked by opening the shutter and the camera back,
fitting a lens and focusing an image on a piece of tracing paper held
against the open shutter.
  This should compare with the focus as seen through the viewfinder. The
best immediate check of the metering system is to compare it against
readings from at least one other meter.
  Two likely lens-focusing faults are a slack mechanism and lateral
movements, and both can occur through extended wear and tear.
  The first can be checked by holding the lens face down and watching it
to see if the focusing bow slips down under its own weight.
  Lateral movement can be seen through the viewfinder while shifting the
focus; it does not effect the recorded image but is distracting.
  The aperture diaphragm should be checked visually, with the lens both on
and off the camera, for smooth operation and to make sure that it stops
down to the full range of apertures.
  Careful handling of photographic equipment under normal circumstances
can be vital to avoid later problems or damage. Both front and rear lens
surfaces, and the body aperture can be protected with caps and clear glass
filter.
  When carried, equipment should be packed carefully. In use, moving
controls like the cocking lever and the rewind lever should be operated
smoothly and without straining.
  In storage, tensioned parts, which include the shutter mechanism and the
full automatic diaphragm (FAD) should be left slack.
  Equipment should be regularly serviced by professionals. A well-used
camera, for instance, should be serviced at least once a year.

important precaution, the equipment should be regularly serviced by
professionals.

ONE of the kings of France was a vicious and cruel man. He loved torturing
his enemies to death and his favourite method was to wrap them up in
animal skin, let them escape and hunt them down with dogs, letting the
animals tear them to pieces.
  For all his cruelty, however, he was also fascinated by animals. He kept
an elephant, monkeys and bears. He had a tame lioness even, which he often
took with him as he travelled throughout his kingdom.
  His weirdness reached new heights when he asked the Abbot of Baigne, a
local cleric, to produce a concert using swine voices.
  The abbot (who was probably used to the king's nonsense) agreed and
asked for a sum of money which was immediately delivered to him.
  He gathered hogs of all ages and got them together under a tent. He kept
them under a cover of velvet and made an organ out of them.
  How?
  His "keys" to the organ were little spikes which pricked the hogs on
command. Apparently he delighted the king and his companions that day.
  About 400 years later, the instrument created by the abbot was adapted
by the inventor of the so-called Porco-Forte.
  This device, however, was a little different. The pigs were put in a
partitioned box and their tails projected through holes.
  With a keyboard mechanism, the tails were pinched to produce a
harmonious range of oinks.

HERE is a relaxation method for those who feel tense after a hard day's
work or at school. It may seem a little strange to do it at first but if
you keep at it, you'll find yourself more energetic and relaxed than ever
before:
  Do a little stretching before the exercise. Gently please! No bouncing
and forced stretching which can only heighten tension.
  Find a place free of interruptions. Loosen all clothing and remove
watches, belts and glasses.
  Lie down and close your eyes. Feel the heaviness in your body. Feel your
body melting into the ground. Breathe deeply. Again, no forced efforts.
Breathe as deeply as you possibly can.
  Keep this breathing up for another two minutes.
  Now curl your toes up as  tightly as possible. Hold to a count of five.
At that point release and relax. Feel the difference?
  Next, tense up the muscles in your lower legs like the feet, calves as
well as the toes. Count to five and release. Enjoy the feeling.
  Next, tense up the muscles in the upper as well as lower part of the
legs. When you feel the tension, tense them a little more. Count slowly to
five and release. As usual, enjoy the feeling.
  Then tense up the buttocks, lower back and abdomen. Hold for a count of
five and release.
  The upper torso such as the shoulders hold a lot more tension. When you
tense them, do so more than for the other parts of the body. Hold for a
count of five and release.
  Now, tense up your arms. Hold them for a count of five. Release and let
them hang loose at your side.
  Squeeze the muscles of your face like your jaw, cheeks and scalp. Hold
for a count of five and as usual, release. Feel the relaxation in every
part of your face. This exercise makes you look younger!
  Now tense your entire body, starting with your toes and working your way
up. Hold for a count of five. Now relax. Unwind. Release. Let go. Mentally
scan your body for any tense parts and relax that body part.
  Now count to five slowly. At the end of the count, open your eyes. Keep
up the practice and your sense of well-being will experience a dramatic
increase.

Towards more open education (HL)

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By A. Kathirasen; Noor Adzman Baharuddin

PENANG, Sun. - A more open education with stress on critical and creative
thinking, and the atmosphere to voice them, is needed for Malaysia to
progress in the information age, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim said today.
  He added that Malaysia could not afford a copycat mentality, especially
in the field of science and technology, if it wanted to progress and
compete in the global arena.
  "We need in Malaysia today an education which is open; where people can
voice their views, offer and accept criticism while being committed to
acquiring a diverse range of knowledge and skills.
  "We need to master new skills and disciplines to progress. A country
will not progress if its knowledge is copycat knowledge; if its
scientists, experts and knowledgeable persons simply copy what others have
said and done.
  "We must have innovative technology, creative minds and critical
thinking for society to progress."
  In this context, he said, it was also important to master the English
language.
  Anwar said this when launching the Penang Free School Foundation at the
PFS hall this afternoon. Also present were Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh
Tsu Koon, PFS Foundation chairman Tan Sri Mohd Sheriff Mohd Kassim, old
boys Tengku Datuk Ahmad Rithauddeen and Tan Sri Elyas Omar, and PFS
principal Mohd Ismail Ibramsa.
  "We want Malaysians to master Bahasa Malaysia. It is the national
language. But we also want Malaysians to master other languages,
especially English. While we maintain Bahasa Malaysia as our national
base, our attitude should be global. This means better mastery of
English."
  He said many Malaysians wanted to learn various languages. Mandarin, for
instance, was now being encouraged as it had potential to be a language of
the economy. More people were picking up Tamil too, just as an increasing
number are learning Japanese, French and German, he added.
  "Mastery of other languages would not obstruct the usage of Bahasa
Malaysia or result in the sacrifice of Bahasa Malaysia. We are promoting
English after being satisfied and convinced that the promotion of Bahasa
Malaysia will proceed undisturbed at a greater pace."
  He said the country could progress only if it pursued a more open policy
and encouraged the mastery of English and other languages so that more
knowledge could be derived from the mastery of these languages and used in
taking the country to greater heights.
  The Finance Minister said while academic excellence was important, it
should not be at the expense of the creation of a wholesome adult and the
inculcation of moral and religious ideas.
  "At present there is too much stress on our schoolchildren. Parents
appear obsessed with academic excellence - at the expense of the birth of
a wholesome man.
  "I do not deny that Malaysia needs academic excellence - that we need to
master new disciplines - but it should not stop there. Emphasis should be
placed on morality. Critical and creative thinking should be our goal too.
  "How can we progress if the thinking habit is absent, the love of
scholarship is not there?" he added.
  Anwar also reminded Malaysians of the need to temper material goals with
moral goals, adding: "There is excessive and unbridled individualism today
in our country. This has caused the downfall of many civilisations in the
past. If the motivation is materialistic and individualistic, we will be
in trouble. And that is why wholesome education is needed."
  The Deputy Prime Minister praised PFS, the oldest English school in the
Asean region, for coming up with the foundation and suggested that the
board prepare a list of all successful old boys and get them to contribute
to its fund.
  The foundation is a charitable organisation to raise and donate funds
for upgrading and improving the school and to carry out activities in the
interest of the school. Mohd Sheriff, who is also chief executive officer
of Khazanah Holdings, hopes to set up a RM5 million trust fund.
  Anwar later received RM494,000 in donations from various groups,
organisations and companies including RM375,000 from the Kuala Lumpur and
Selangor PFS old boys association headed by Mohd Sheriff, RM100,000 from
old boy Datuk Md Zain Yusof and his relatives and friends, RM34,000 from
PFS, and RM11,000 from Elyas.
  Earlier in Prai, Anwar urged politicians and community leaders to
encourage more youths to participate in team sports and recreational
activities.
  He said by doing so, they would not idle their time away, and could put
to good use their youth and strength towards racial harmony and nation-
building.
  "Let's stop nagging them on what they should do with their youth.
  "Instead, provide useful programmes and activities such as canoeing,
hill-climbing, jet-skiing and the various games and sports to them so that
they can participate actively as a team.
  "Also, don't just provide them with the programmes and activities that
can be participated by all, but we must also join them so that they can
fully understand why we are encouraging them to do so," he said after
participating in an eight-km canoeing competition along Sungai Prai, from
Titi Timbul in Sungai Dua to the Seberang Prai Municipal Council
recreational park in Ampang Jajar.
  It was organised by the State Youth and Sports Department to promote
Sungai Prai and the Ampang Jajar recreational park as a major watersports
centre in Seberang Prai.
  Also taking part among the 400 participants were Chief Minister Tan Sri
Dr Koh Tsu Koon, his deputy, Datuk Mohd Shariff Omar, State Land,
Entrepreneur and Co-operative Development Committee chairman Abdul Latiff
Mirasa and several State Assemblymen.
  Anwar also reminded schools against being too obsessed with achieving
academic excellence that they neglect or downplay the importance of sports
and athletics.
  Earlier when launching a cleanliness campaign in Jalan Tuna here, Anwar
said the Government would not budge from its policy in requiring housing
developers to build low-cost houses in their schemes.
  "We have to insist that they comply with the requirement (of building
low-cost houses in their schemes) since this is the only way to ensure the
poor can enjoy affordable housing," he said.
  More than 200 flat-dwellers took part in a gotong-royong, held in
conjunction with the ceremony.
  He also urged all developers to fully understand why it was necessary
for them to assist the Government in providing ample affordable housing
for the people.
  Anwar also took to task some residents, especially flat-dwellers, who
refused to participate in cleanliness campaigns organised in their
neighbourhoods.
  "It is for the good of all. Gotong royongs help ensure your surroundings
are clean besides fostering closer relationship among neighbours," he
said.
  Later, when witnessing the sale of 8.4ha land, valued at RM6.5 million,
belonging to the Sungai Pelet area farmers' organisation to JKP Sdn Bhd in
Penanti, Anwar praised the organisation for its efforts to venture into
non-agricultural activities which could bring bigger returns for its
members.
  JKP Sdn Bhd, a company formed by the State Bumiputera Steering and Co-
ordination Committee, plans to carry out a RM40 million mixed development
project on the land.
  The company was represented by its managing director Dr Zulkifli Hassan
while the organisation was represented by its chairman, Adnan Ramli.
  At the same function, Adnan announced the organisation's purchase of 20
shophouses in Taman Sama Gagah, costing RM6.9 million, from Permatang Pauh
Realty Sdn Bhd.

Klang heartbeat: Motorcycle thefts getting serious

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By Annie Freeda Cruez

THEFTS of motorcycles are becoming a serious problem in Klang especially
with at least 150 of them being reported stolen every month for the past
few months.
  Strangely, there are many who are not reporting the theft of their
machines  to the police in the hope that they would recover their
motorcycles or for reasons only known to them.
  Klang district police chief Assistant Commissioner Aziz Ariarasa
Abdullah strongly feels thefts of motorcycles can be prevented if owners
are more responsible and take proper security measures.
  He said many of the motorcycles are stolen when the owners leave their
machines unattended with the keys still in the ignition, not properly
locked or in places known for such thefts.
  "There were even instances when thieves rode away with motorcycles after
the owners left their machines running while going into a shop to get
something," he said.
  "If people are more careful, many of the motorcycles would not have been
stolen."
  He said the public should take the initiative to protect and safeguard
their property.
  He said motorcycle thefts could be reduced only with the co-operation of
the owners who had to ensure their machines were always locked up
properly, possibly with additional security locks.
  Motorcycle thefts have been reportedly high at Kampung Delek, Berkeley
Garden, Taman Sentosa, Jalan Meru, Jalan Kapar, Bandar Sultan Sulaiman,
Jalan Kem and Taman Sri Muda.
  Most of these bikes, especially the brand RXZ Yamaha, were reported
stolen near flats and shopping complexes in the district.
  Aziz said the recovery rate of stolen motorcycles per month was about 15
to 20 per cent with many of them found abandoned along road sides and
recovered during police operations.
  Recently, police arrested eight youths aged between 15 and 20 years,
mostly school dropouts and recovered from them eight stolen motorcycles.
  "People steal motorcycles for joyrides, transportation, to resell them
for cheaper price or to cannibalise and sell to illegal racers," said
Aziz.
  He said many of those who steal motorcycles for joy-rides were
schoolchildren and youths.
  Aziz said it would surprise many that there were even people who
"borrow" motorcycles as a means of transport to take them to a particular
place where on reaching they abandoned the machines.
  "Those who actually steal them are groups of youths usually school
dropouts who sell them at a cheaper price to unsuspecting buyers in
estates and Felda schemes or cannibalise the parts to sell to illegal
racers to make quick money," he added.
  So far this year, Aziz said, the police had picked up eight such groups
or in police jargon "pocket groups" with each group comprising between
three and seven people, and recovered several stolen motorcycles.

Many candidates seeking clarifications on functions

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

PENANG, Sun. - Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today
he was getting letters from Umno Ministers and leaders contesting for
posts in the October party elections, seeking clarification on functions
they could attend following the ban on election campaigning.
   Speaking in his capacity as Umno disciplinary committee chairman, he
said: "Several of them have written to me seeking my advice on certain
programmes that they were slotted to attend. I have cleared some
programmes and disapproved some programmes."
  He was asked on the fact that many Umno Ministers were not attending
even official functions following the directive of the Umno supreme
council that they should not attend functions which could be construed as
campaigning.

City sidewalks: Ugly attitude of urban indifference

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By Balan Moses

CONSIDER this assumption: As a nation develops and people become more
sophisticated and knowledgeable with better education, civic consciousness
should be heightened.
  Right-thinking people will probably rationalise this as being logical
and, therefore, theoretically quite probable.
  But does this actually happen in Malaysia, or closer home, in Kuala
Lumppur today?
  Let's look at the facts. Between January and July this year, City Hall
collected RM6 million in fines and compound penalties from a total of
228,042 notices issued to the public.
  This is RM400,000 more than what was collected for the same period last
year. Are city folk regressing as far as civic responsibilities are
concerned?   Facts, invariably cold and bare, give an accurate picture.
They are neutral and do not lie.
  What then ails city folk that they end up paying so much to the
authorities in fines and compounds for civic infringements?
  As Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif said on Saturday (see story
on Page 23), the figures show that some city folk are not interested in
observing the law.
  Lamenting on the increase in fines and compounds, he said it was not a
good sign of the times.
  More received compound notices for not paying metered parking charges in
the first seven months this year compared with the same period last year.
  They paid a total of RM2,792,175 to City Hall for the period this year
for the offence.
  The local authority collected RM1,267,130 from hawkers for a variety of
offences while traffic offences brought in RM1,220,480.
  Other offences that brought in substantial amounts in fines were
committed under the Earthworks By-Laws 1988, Parks By-Laws 1981, Streets,
Drainage and Building Act 1974 and the Collection, Disposal and Management
of Garbage By-Laws FT 1981.
  Why this indifference among city folk to rules and regulations?
  A critical look around will show that indifference to rules are not the
only thing city folk are guilty of.
  Many are also indifferent to fellow Malaysians and in some cases, their
neighbours.
  Granted that there is an equal number or more of caring Malaysians who
always rise to the occasion when it comes to caring for others, the ugly
Malaysian syndrome and the number of people subscribing to it is
frightening.
  Why do people dump rubbish along roads and in front of their neighbours'
homes? Why do people wantonly dirty public toilets?
  Why have more road bullies surfaced recently? Some men have even taken
to assaulting women drivers, something unheard of before.
  Why do drivers end up in fist fights over trivial issues like cutting
lanes or blaring the horn?
  The Press has also reported recent cases of people standing by while
robberies were being committed.
  The environment, especially green lungs and forests, are also becoming
victims of indifference. Some businessmen are beginning to think that a
concrete jungle and the almighty ringgit are what life should be all
about.
  They do not have time to stop and smell the flowers.
  Something needs to be done to check this rot before it is too late and
such abberant behaviour becomes an accepted part of Malaysian culture.
  City folk have to sit up and ask themselves if indifference is what they
want to leave behind as a legacy to their children.
  We, as a society, will suffer if this becomes a reality.
  The authorities also have a role to play in helping Malaysians become
more caring and responsible.
  The young should be taught the need to help and care for one another,
regardless of their station in life. After all, this is what community
living is all about.
  Religious education, regardless of the faith, will go a long way in
inculcating civic consciousness among people.
  In the final analysis, however, change has to come from within. City
folk, and others, should give their best in making Kuala Lumpur and the
nation a better place to live in.
  * Sometimes, the most obvious things are the last seen. And so it may
have been in the case of the city-above-the-river Kuala Lumpur Linear City
(KLLC) project.
  The river and its reserve were there waiting when some developers were
busy cutting trees and hills for projects.
  We could have saved some of our natural heritage if the project had been
proposed earlier.
  The KLLC, to be built over the Sungai Klang, will result in a deeper and
wider Sungai Klang besides a squatter-free environment along the river
which will ensure a less polluted waterway.
  The People-mover Rapid Transit system which runs alongside the river is
another benefit accruing from the project.
  The mega-project itself will cover 117.6ha over a 12km route along the
river.
  It will stretch above and along the Sungai Klang between the Jalan Tun
Razak bridge at the upstream and the Jalan Klang Lama bridge downstream.
  It will have offices, entertainment centres, restaurants, hotels,
medical centres and apartments on arch frames over the river.
  While the benefits cannot be denied by way of more space for
development, the authorities also have to ensure that the project is
environment-friendly.
  This means that they have to ensure that the quality of river water is
not affected by the project.
  At a time when many children have not seen cows or goats save for what
is shown on television or in movies, we hope they will not forget what a
river looks like.
  We hope there will still be something of the river to see when the
project is completed. With the deepening and widening of the river, we
also hope it will lose its ugly brown hue for a healthy colour.
  It is left to be seen if the KLLC will spawn similar projects over other
rivers in the city.
  Some have raised the question of whether the project is violating the
guidelines of the Drainage and Irrigation Department.
  The authorities have to provide acceptable answers to such questions.

Town Planning head to perform duties of council secretary

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

KOTA BARU, Sun. - The Kota Baru Municipal Council has appointed its Town
Planning Division chief Kamaruddin Mamat to take over the duties of the
council secretary.
  Its president Hassan Abdullah said the appointment which was approved by
councillors at the special full council meeting today took effect
immediately.
  He added Kamaruddin was asked to perform the duties because MPKB did not
recognise the appointment of Shokri Mohamed.
  The council and the State Civil Service Commission are facing a standoff
following the council's rejection of Mohd Aiseri Alias to the post of MPKB
deputy president and Shokri as secretary.
  Hassan said MPKB had nothing against the two officers but did not
recognise their appointment by the commission because they were not made
according to procedures.
  Under service circular 5/1989, appointment to the two posts can only be
made upon the council's request. However, Hassan had said that the
commission did not refer the matter to him before making the appointment.
  However, he added, the council would not ask the two to leave or vacate
their posts.
  "I have no plans to take any action against the two but would appreciate
it very much if the commission withdrew the appointment," he said after
chairing the meeting.
  Hassan also did not rule out the possibility of the council filling the
posts with officers of their own choice.
  "If we do appoint our own people to fill the two posts, they would have
to be appointed by the State Exco," he added.

Feedback: Letter: Towards a better bus service

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By A Regular Commuter

ON taking over the Sri Jaya operated bus service 244 (Klang bus stand-
Bandar Utama through Pusat Bandar, Damansara Utama, Damansara Jaya and
Taman Tun) recently, Intrakota has redesignated the route as 21C.
  In addition, it has renamed Service 21 as 21A, and introduced 21B to Lot
10, giving all three services a common path between Bandar Utama and Bank
Negara.
  Unfortunately, the rather pale yellow dot-matrix numbers on a light
black, often greyish black, background becomes readable only when the bus
is almost upon one.
  Is it possible for Intrakota, which no doubt has the interests of both
commuter and driver at heart, to have the numbers boldly displayed as Sri
Jaya did?
  Would it also be possible for Intrakota to make available the schedule
of buses on this route so that, while allowing for the time of day and
uncertain traffic conditions, one can attempt to minimise waiting time?
  Can it be possible as well to have this information displayed at the
terminals at least for the benefit of all?
  When, for example, does the first bus leave either end of the route in
the morning and when does the last bus do likewise?
  Now that commuters can only board the bus one at a time - and at
terminals when the bus is ready to move - should not steps be taken to
inculcate the habit of queueing?
  For example, during the initial days, a security guard could be
stationed at the Klang bus stand during peak hours to ensure commuters
wait in line.
  In the mornings and evenings and during peak periods, one only has to
see the rush to board buses at the Klang bus stand to realise how
immeasurably advantageous it would be for all concerned - young and old,
men and women, drivers and management alike - to have such a system
enforced.
  Despite its many idiosyncrasies, Service 244 was predictable. Regular
commuters would undoubtedly in due course have the information to manage
their commuting but at this stage of Intrakota's takeover, the company
should make such information more widely available.

Feedback: Letter: Bugged by flood problems

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By Joe and family

WE are an elderly couple who have been staying alone in a TOL home at Loop
Road, Seremban for some 30 years now.
  Often our house and nearby homes get flooded when a nearby river
overflows during heavy rain.
  Although some digging at the river was done sometime ago, the situation
has not improved.
  On Sept 2 at 3.30am, flood waters entered our home and there was not
much we could do as the flood waters damaged our carpets and furniture.
  We aren't against development but such things should not mean that we
suffer as a result of it.
  We are appealing to our State Assemblyman and MP to please look into
this and help us improve the situation here.
  The Menteri Besar has promised titles to this place during the last
elections but nothing has come about so far.

Penang takes court action against 10 for polluting rivers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

By K. Suthakar

PENANG, Sun. - The Penang Water Authority has initiated legal action
against 10 private landowners for allegedly polluting rivers in water
catchment areas.
  The charges included that of diverting water flow illegally.
  A source said some of the cases were being heard while others were in
the pre-trial process.
  The action is being taken following the gazetting of all rivers as
catchment areas in April 1994 under the Penang Water Authority Enactment
1972.
  The cases included development which had polluted rivers as early as
1991.
  The source said this when commenting on a recent New Straits Times
report that pollution resulting from encroachment into catchment areas by
developers was threatening the quality of water supply in the State.
  The report quoted State Infrastructure Facilities, Transportation and
Telecommunications Committee chairman Datuk Dr Hilmi Yahaya as saying that
the water authority had detected mud and E. Coli in the raw water supplied
to water treatment plants.
  He was also reported to have said the State Government had yet to
gazette land around the rivers as catchment areas "due to limitations in
the law".
  The source said three catchment areas on the island - at Teluk Bahang,
Sungai Pinang and Air Itam - were facing serious water pollution problems
caused by encroachment.
  Private landowners who have put up structures to tap the potential of
eco-tourism have been blamed for this state of affairs.
  "We have detected toilets built near rivers and some people diverting a
stream to create a `private reservoir' for water durian trees.
  "We have also detected a bungalow in the catchment area. The Penang
Island Municipal Council had removed the roof as it was an illegal
building, but the owner has since put up a new roof," the source said.
  The source also said the water authority had taken a developer in Teluk
Bahang to court two years ago for allegedly polluting a river from
hillslope cutting activity. The case is pending.
  Meanwhile, Penang Housing Developers Association chairman Datuk Eddy
Choong said the authorities should allow owners of land within catchment
areas to develop their property. However, he advocated conditions such as
a minimum distance from rivers to ensure pollution was averted.

Feedback: Letter: `Killer' Seremban junction

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By G. Tarlochan Singh Gill

LOOP Road in Seremban and its surrounding areas have seen much improvement
lately with the upgrading of roads, the new Sungai Senawang, construction
of new bridges and overall renewal of Tenaga cables.
  Thanks to efforts undertaken by wakil rakyat Goh Siow Huat and Datuk
Wong See Wah, who have visited the areas frequently.
  Furthermore, another Bailey Bridge has been completed and was officially
opened on Sept 8, to the relief of many residents of Kampung Semarak and
surrounding areas whose schoolgoing children now have a proper access to
go to the Jalan Loop schools, and the working class group.
  However, attention has not been given to the "killer junction" (picture
above) at the trunk road which leads to Taman Rasah Jaya, Taman Thivy
Jaya, Taman Blossom Park, Taman Blossom Heights and the many housing
estates which have sprung up in the area over the years.
  Even southbound traffic ply this road to get to Port Dickson and Kuala
Lumpur via the south toll plaza.
  As a result of the heavy traffic, there have been many accidents at the
spot.
  Recalling an incident, a motorcyclist was dragged to his death some 200
metres while coming out from Taman Ujong and colliding with a car coming
downslope towards the town from Rasah Jaya. Months later, a pasar malam
operator was dragged similarly along this stretch.
  Since then, there have been more accidents, including fatal ones.
  It is advisable to have traffic lights controlling the Taman Ujong and
Taman  Blossom Park traffic flow, possibly also with a new approach route
to Taman Ujong at the upper section for oncoming traffic.
  Residents staying nearby are so used to the sounds of "bangs" that they
would quickly quip satu lagi, meaning one more accident, when they hear
one.
  The accidents at the nearby Rahang overhead railway bridge and Jalan
Tampin-Jalan Tuanku Antah junction have also kept the Seremban traffic
police very busy, especially during weekends.
  Since this falls under the Seremban Municipal Council's traffic
committee, it is hoped the committee will act promptly before more lives
are lost.

Feedback: Letter: One lane access problem

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By Wife of Agitated Driver

PLEASE do something about the one lane going in and out of Plaza Phoenix,
Km 10.4 Cheras.
  The junction is the only access to 14 housing estates in the area.
  In addition to the one lane problem, there is also a big hole at the
junction, adding to the massive congestion which lasts throughout the day.
  Two-way lanes have been turned into one lane. It would not surprise me
if accidents were to occur and even result in lives lost as motorists
using the lane to get to work or return home are getting very impatient.
  Can someone do something about this? Just getting out of this place
during peak hours to the main road in Cheras takes almost half an hour.
  Think of the precious time wasted. And even in town, we have to face the
crazy traffic situation.
  I know that jams are everywhere. But residents in Cheras have been
putting up with traffic jams for quite some time.

Concert in honour of Tamil poet

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 18

THE Temple of Fine Arts Malaysia will stage a Sangeetha Nruthya Nataka
Upanyaasam entitled Krishnaarpanam at the PJ Civic Centre on Thursday.
  The programme celebrates Shri Oothakkadu Venkatasubbier's selected
inspired outpourings.
  This is the first time a concert in recognition of the poet is being
attempted in the country although most Carnatic music lovers here are
familiar with the Shri Thyagaraja's compositions.
  Venkatasubbier was a poet, musician-cum-saint who lived 350 years ago in
the Tanjor district of South India, dedicating his life to Krishna.
  Many of his pieces such as Alai Paayuthey, Paal Vaadiyum and Aadathu
Assangathu are popular pieces to those who appreciate Tamil poetry.
  Most lovers of Carnatic music and the bharatanatyam dance form are
familiar with his immortal composition Taye Yasodha.
  Many of Vekatasubbier's compositions are a delight to dancers because
the percussion sounds are rhythmic in character.
  TFA's music department director Suresh Ramachandran said the
presentation of song and music would follow the traditional Nadopasana
style of Vadya Gita Brindam or a vocal and instrumental ensemble.
  The 50-member ensemble includes instruments like the veena, violin,
flute, harmonium and mridangam.
  "Adding to this and giving visual imagery to the saint's inspiration is
an exposition of Abhinayam and Nrittam by our dancers," he said.
  "To enable the younger generation to appreciate the programme, we have
decided to explain and compere the evening both in English and Tamil."
  The programme will see the presentation of seven numbers.
  Admission is by invitation and enquiries can be made by calling 03-
2743709.
  TFA has also made an appeal to members of the public to sponsor the
souvenir programme, promised to be a quality publication with translations
and transliterations in English and Tamil.

Stipe's report: Maszeli suspended three days

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 43

APPRENTICE Maszeli Amin pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding and
was suspended three day by the Stipendiary Stewards yesterday. He was
astride Allez Allez III in Race 6.
  The Stipe's report is as follows:
  RACE 1: Park Lane III (S Sam), Vietnam Ranger (A John) and Caro Lad (I
Azhar) which were difficult to be boxed, will each be required to pass one
starting stall test prior to them being declared to race again. Inside the
final 100m, Caro Lad drifted out under pressure, causing Bendemus to
steady. Jockey I Azhar was warned to make more attempt to keep his mount
on a straight course in future.
  RACE 2: Near the 300m, Aspen Gold (App M Zaini) was steadied when
Fullmarks (I Azhar) was carried inwards by Pay Me Cash (A John) which
shifted in.
  RACE 3: Soviet Wonder drifted outwards in the closing stages of the race
carrying Mega Gold (WH Lao). Jockey WH Lao (Mega Gold), placed second,
lodged an Objection against Soviet Wonder, being declared the winner, on
grounds of interference in the last 200m of the race. After considering
all of the evidence, the Race Meeting Stewards were of the opinion that
the incident had not affected the result and the Objection was overruled.
The result stood and Jockey Lao's deposit was refunded.
  App SH Lee was warned to make more attempt to keep his mount on a
straight course in future.
  RACE 4: Acting on veterinary advice that Haramoun (J Saimee) was
coughing, the Race Meeting Stewards ordered its withdrawal. Jockey SY
Leong, the rider of Gleam, reported that this horse did not act in the
going.
  RACE 5: Trainer D Baertschiger was fined $50 for failing to produce the
correct colours on Silently Yours.
  Near the 600m, Bellotto Glory (KL Oo) was steadied to avoid the heels of
Jade Princess II (SH Oh).
  RACE 6: Rounding the 800m turn, Dear Sir and Brown Sugar were both
checked when tightened between Treasure Dragon (App T Ong) which was
hanging out and Allez Allez III (App M Maszeli) which shifted in. This
incident also resulted in Track Lark II having to be steadied. At a
subsequent Inquiry, App Maszeli, in the presence of his master, Trainer D
Dragon, pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding under MRA Rule 149
(a) (ii) in that he allowed his horse, Allez Allez III, to shift in on the
turn at the 800m mark causing varying degrees of interference to Brown
Sugar and Dear Sir. The Panel took into account mitigating circumstances
and suspended App Maszeli from riding in three race days with effect from
Mon, 16 Sep 96. He was advised of his Right of Appeal.
  Near the 100m, Jockey SH Oh the rider of Valid dropped his whip when
attempting to straighten the horse who had a tendency to lay in. He
pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding under Rule 149 (a)(ii) and
fined $500. He was informed of his Right of Appeal.
  RACE 7: Approaching the 1100m, mark Charming Star (V Sivan) began to
buck repeatedly losing some ground. Charming Star will be required to pass
a 100m, gallop trial from the barrier and veterinary examination.
  Trainer JF Heng was questioned about the apparent reversal of form of
King Of Hearts II (WH Au-Yeung). He explained that this horse had returned
from a break prior to which he had problems with its off-fore hoof.
  RACE 8: Rounding the home turn, Martina (App B Tai) when racing tight on
the inside of Because Of You II (KL Oh) steadied and then stumbled
dislodging App B Tai. Game Of Bridge (SH Oh), Showgirl VIII and Sparrow
Hawk had to take evasive action losing some ground. Shortly after this
incident, High Colours stumbled over the fallen rider, App Tai, dislodging
App SH Lee. Wings Of Freedom (L Cropp) and Air Jumbo had to take evasive
action losing some ground.
  App Tai was taken to hospital for observation and a statement concerning
the fall will be taken from App Tai when he is available.
  RACE 9: Approaching the 300m mark, Sunway was held up for a run on the
inside when Dingsheng (M Narredu) drifted inwards. Jockey KK Loh was
questioned regarding his ride on Sunway in the early part of the race. He
advised the Panel that his instructions were to settle the horse in mid
field but he found that the pace was too fast and he ended up further back
than he had wished.
  RACE 10: Shortly, after the start, Raphael Gold (M Narredu) was
tightened when Yes It's True (P Carbery) and Jiwa Jiwa (TM Wan) both
shifted ground. Linford (J Saimee) was also tightened when River Palace
(KL Oo), and My Encore (L Cropp) both shifted ground.
  An investigation will be opened into the running and handling of
Chattaronga II (CH Chua).

Palm oil

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 35

CRUDE palm oil physicals ended sharply lower the week in moderately active
trading, in line with the weaker CPO futures contract and uncertainty in
the Chicago market.
  Talks that palm oil production for end-August will be 15 percent firmer
over July contributed to a bearish sentiment on the cash market.
  Estimates by private crop forecaster Ivan Wong that end-August oil palm
production would increase by 11 percent to about 800,000 tonnes from July
while palm oil stocks to grow to 775,000 tonnes from the official figure
of 754,634 in July, however was factored in by the market.
  A lack of fresh leads and uncertainty over the market's trend in the
immediate and near term contributed to lacklustre trading on the cash
market.

Rubber

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 35

THE Malaysian rubber market closed mixed to lower last week in overall
quiet trading despite brokers regaining confidence to trade actively in
the market.
  The International RSS One buyer was unchanged from last Friday at 329.00
sen per kg while SMR 20 declined by one and a half sen to 314.00 sen per
kg.
  Improved buying interest from local traders and increased overseas
enquiries, had boosted prices Thursday.
  A dealer said there would be encouraging buying interest in the
immediate term, following traders' response to what they describe as
"comfortable" price levels.
  The market see-sawed in a tight range owing to the uncertainty in
regional markets and the lack of fresh factors.
  The International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO) daily market
indicator price for Friday (September 12) was at 250.30
Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg.

Berita Harian-EON East-West Tour 1996.: Cycling.: Domingo dominates stage
five

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 44

By Zakri Baharudin

THE Philippines strengtened their lead in the overall team standings after
Enrique Domingo won the fifth stage of the Berita Harian-EON East-West
Tour from Taiping to Sungai Petani yesterday.
  Domingo's time of three hours 33:11.41 not only enabled his team to pull
away from the rest but it also allowed him to snatch the overall leader's
yellow jersey from teammate Victor Espiritu.
  Kuala Lumpur B's Wong Ah Thiam came in second in 3:34:57.12 while Harris
Fadzillah Osman of Kuala Lumpur B was third, a futher 56.71 seconds
behind.
  Domingo put up a strong performance and led the first breakaway 30km
after the starting line near Pondok Tanjung.
  He maintained his lead through the flat and narrow 140km stretch and
pulled away again with about a dozen other cyclists near Selama.
  "With this win, I have avenged our defeat in the first stage of the
Tour," said Domingo.
  "I knew that this stage was in the bag because as I got closer to the
end I could only see Wong trailing me," added the 26-year-old who works
for the Philippine Star daily.
  Philippines coach Bart Flores was glad that his cyclists adhered to his
orders.
  "My plan is working, especially now that the team are in a solid
position," said Flores.
  He added that it would be very difficult for any of the other teams to
win the overall championship at the end of the Tour in Langkawi.
  Meanwhile, Kuala Lumpur A coach Ng Joo Ngan admitted that his strategy
didn't quite work out.
  "The Philippines are a strong team but I didn't expect them to break
away as early as in Kamunting," said Ng.
  All 86 riders will lineup at the Kuala Muda District Council office to
begin the 137km stage six from Sungai Petani to Alor Star today.
  RESULTS - 140km stage five from Taiping to Sungai Petani - Individual: 1
Enrique Domingo (Phi) 3hrs 33:11.41, 2 Wong Ah Thiam (KL B) 3:34:57.12, 3

Tin

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 35

TIN price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) settled the week 11 sen
lower at RM15.02 per kg from the previous Friday on overall higher
offerings and volatility on the London Metal Exchange (LME), dealers said.
  An overall drop of three-month tin on the LME by US$30 from last Friday,
resulted in sentiment being easier which sparked off a wave of
liquidations by miners.

Taking stock: Prestar may scale new highs in profit growth, turnover

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 34

By S. N. Lock

AS the KLSE second board continued on its unabated record-breaking surge,
some second board counters went about their consolidation while some
others were in a hurry to complete their base-building consolidation to
join in the superbull bandwagon.
  On Friday, some second board counters broke out of their recent lull and
maintained their technical composure while the second board underwent its
meaningful consolidation in late afternoon trade.
  Prestar Industries Bhd (Prestar) was one such counter that bucked the
KLSE SBI trend on Friday while Sin Kean Boon Group Bhd was the other.
  Prestar was incorporated under the Companies Act 1965 as a private
limited company on July 12, 1984 by some members of the Toh family.
Subsequently, it was converted into a public limited company on June 27,
1994 when it changed its corporate identity to its present form. The
change in its corporate identity was a move that prepared Prestar for its
listing on the KLSE second board.
  Prestar is principally involved in the manufacturing and trading of
wheelbarrows, building materials and material-handling equipment hardware
which includes hand-trucks, wheels and hot-dip galvanised overhead
transmission accessories and parts.
  The manufacturing set-up of Prestar was originally intended to
complement the marketing and trading services of YK Toh Marketing Sdn Bhd
which was involved in the importation and distribution of hardware,
building materials and material-handling equipment. The group later
diversified into the manufacturing of other related material-handling
equipment like hand-trucks and hot-dip galvanised products.
  Besides meeting the domestic demand for wheelbarrows, Prestar embarked
on an international marketing campaign and has successfully secured orders
from the United States of America, Japan and Middle East countries. With
the increasing domestic and export market demands, Prestar undertook an
expansion programme when it moved to its new factory in Rawang.
  In July 1995, Prestar subscribed to a 35 per cent equity stake in
Zelleco Metal Galvanising Sdn Bhd. The remaining stake in the joint
venture company was taken up by Selleco, a subsdiary of Malaysian
Resources Corporation Bhd. The joint venture company was formed to
undertake projects undertaken by MRCB-PNB Consortium.
  Chartwise, Prestar made its debut on the KLSE second board on Sept 20,
1995 when its shares were traded from an intra-day low of RM3.26 to an
intra-day high of RM3.62 before easing to close at the RM3.54 level with
913,000 shares changing hands.
  Immediately after its listing on the KLSE second board, its price trend
went sideways for the next 2 1/2 months before embarking on its first
upleg to RM7.45 on Jan 23, 1996. Prestar's price trend corrected down to
RM5.00 on Feb 13, 1996.
  A new uptrend unfolded immediately after its price trend reversed out of
its short consolidation. The feverish uptrend with the KLSE second board
run-ups sent its share prices to yet another all-time historical high of
RM10.60 on April 26, 1996.
  The ensuing second board corrections sent its price trend all the way
down to RM5.50 on June 3, 1996. A strong technical rebound to RM8.15 on
July 17, 1996 followed by a swift retreat to RM6.20 on July 30, 1996 set
the stage for its current uptrend breakout. Its share prices closed at
RM9.00 on Friday.
  Here are the readings of some of its technical indicators:-
  Moving Averages: Prestar's current prices continue to stay above all its
10-, 20-, 30-, 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages in their bullish
sequential order.
  Momentum Index: Its short-term momentum index has since reversed to the
upside following its recent successful re-test of its neutral reference
line.
  On Balance Volume: Its short-term OBV is firmly staying above its 10-day
exponential moving averages after moving sideways for four months.
  Relative Strength Index: Its 14-RSI staged a decisive breakout of its
immediate overhead resistance at the 65 per cent level.
  OUTLOOK:
  After establishing its market leadership in wheelbarrows, hand-trucks
and other material-handling equipment in the domestic market, Prestar is
on the move once again.
  Its joint venture with Selleco into a galvanising project for works
undertaken by MRCB-PNB Consortium and its venture into the manufacture of
steel guard rails (used mainly as road dividers) clearly signalled its
determined diversification into supplying projects related to
infrastructure development of the country.
  Apart from its diversification into infrastracture projects, Prestar
moved further upstream when it acquired a 70 per cent stake in Summit
Steel Service Centre Sdn Bhd. Summit Steel Service Centre Sdn Bhd sheers
steel into coils and supplies them to the steel industry, including metal
stamping companies.
  Its diversification exercise coupled with its domestic market leadership
in material-handling equipment will afford Prestar to scale newer highs,
both in terms of turnover and profit growth. This will continue to
underpin share prices.
  Technically, Prestar's decisive breakout of its immediate overhead
resistances (See Prestar's weekly bar chart - D3-D4 - and daily bar chart
- E1-E2) clearly signals a trend reversal to the upside. Its price trend
has successfully taken out the neckline (E1-E2) of its double-bottom
pattern formation.
  Its pattern measuring objective is likely to take Prestar's short- to
intermediate-term to stage a re-challange of its all-time historical peak
at the RM10.60 level.

Currency review: Currency review

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 34

THE greenback is poised to strengthen further against the ringgit in the
weeks ahead on the softening ringgit interest rate outlook. Although the
ringgit was steady against the greenback last week, we expect a declining
ringgit trend to commence soon. The greenback closed Friday at 2.4895,
unchanged from the week before.
  * THE Singapore dollar's recent rise took a turn downwards against the
ringgit last week. This was due to the unloading of Singapore dollars by
an institution last week. The Singapore dollar closed Friday at 1.7640,
down from 1.7700 the previous Friday. Although still on a medium term
bullish trend, the dollar's rise could continue to be checked this week.
  * THE Japanese yen continued to fall against the ringgit last week amid
expectations that the BoJ would maintain the yen's interest rate at its
historic low. This expectation was strengthened further when data on
Friday showed that Japan's second quarter gross domestic product shrank
0.7 per cent. The yen closed Friday at 2.2560, down from 2.2780 the week
before.
  * AFTER being boosted by the previous week's tension in the Middle East,
sterling pared its gains last week against the ringgit. The latest
economic figures show that the UK economy is growing steadily. This could
mean the end of further UK rate cuts and should be bullish for sterling in
the medium term. Sterling is not expected to rise just yet.
  * THE Australian dollar surged against the ringgit and other currencies
Monday on the expectation that global inflation would boost Australian
commodity prices. But the dollar weakened Thursday and Friday when the
central bank hinted that there was still room for lower Australian rates.
The Australian dollar closed Friday at 1.9750, from 1.9688 the previous
Friday. It is expected to be steady this week.

Technically speaking: KLCE CI's short-term trend shaping up well

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 32

By S. N. Lock

SHARE prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange closed broadly higher last
week. The bullish run-ups on the KLSE second board spilled over to some
second and third liners on the main board. Selective buying support on
blue-chips and index-linked counters underpinned the KLSE Composite Index.
  Persistent retail buying support chased KLSE second board counters on
Monday but blue-chips and index-linked counters continued to trade lower
amid lack of institutional support. In its earlier trading the CI dipped
to its intra-day low of 1,101.40 points before recovering to close at
1,104.28.
  The broader market ignored news that Malaysia's gross domestic product
was higher at 8.4 per cent in the second quarter of the year when compared
with 8.3 per cent the previous quarter. From the look of things, it was
expected and within the confines of some fund managers' forecasts.
  The KLSE Second Board Index cooled momentarily on Tuesday when its
advance was clipped 5.44 points, or 0.97 points, to 555.55 level. However,
the SBI managed to post an all-time intra-day high of 566.41 points in its
earlier trading
  Some investors switched from speculatives on the second board coupled
with some renewed buying from institutional investors sent the CI 7.47
points higher to 1,111.75 level on Tuesday. Many investors viewed the
second board as way overstretched and took profits accordingly. This
explained why the SBI suffered its first loss following four consecutive
daily upticks.
  Contrary to many investors' expections, the SBI reversed when retail
players resumed buying second board counters. Some second board counters
were marked up with triple-digit gains. There was talk that some fund
managers who missed the second board run-ups were waiting for the second
board bubble to burst before returning to invest in blue-chip stocks.
  While the second board continued with its unabated record-breaking run,
many analysts started to question the overvaluations on some second board
counters. On Friday, there were bouts of profit-taking pressure on second
board counters but bargain huntings managed to absorb the selling pressure
remarkably well.
  Reflecting the consolidation mood of the broader market, the CI managed
to put up a good show when it gained 12.22 points, or 1.10 per cent, to
close at 1,117.55 points on Friday. The KLSE All Share EMAS Index rose
4.28 points, or 1.34 per cent, to 324.20.
  The KLSE Industrial Index recovered 21 points, or one per cent, to
2,114.21 level. The SBI jumped 17.85 points, or 3.22 per cent, to 572.24
points.
  On the sectoral performance analysis, the property sector was the top
gainer with gains of 3.86 per cent followed by second board in second
place with a gain of 3.22 per cent. Elsewhere, all other remaining sectors
posted gains ranging from 0.26 per cent to 2.57 per cent.
  Chartwise, the CI recovered from its initial setback on Monday when it
staged a successful re-test of its 1,100 support.
  The next four trading sessions saw the strong buying support on blue-
chips counters. The following are readings of some of its technical
indicators:
  Moving Averages: The KLSE CI managed to recover above its 10-, 20-, 30-,
50- and 200-day moving averages while its 100-day moving averages
continued to hover.
  Momentum Index: Its short-term momentum index moved out of its recent
falling field trend.
  On Balance Volume: Its short-term OBV trend staged a re-penetration of
its 10-day exponential moving averages.
  Relative Strength Index: Its 14-RSI continued to trade within the
confines of its neutral zone.
  OUTLOOK:
  The KLSE CI successfully moved out of the upper two per cent standard
deviation band of its Keltner Channel. Similarly, it managed to break out
of its short-term downtrend (See KLSE CI's Daily Bar Chart - B3-B4). Both
of these technical scenarios suggest that the CI's short-term trend is
fast improving as it approaches its next bullish time window.
  From its weekly bar chart, the CI continued to stay within the gradual
upward path of its Andrews' Channel. Its immediate-term Andrews' Channel
provides glimpses of the CI's intermediate-term perspectives.
  The CI violated the Andrews' lower median line (See KLSE CI's weekly bar
chart - A5-A6) in November 1995, but was quickly vaulted back into the
channel, staying right below its median line (A1-A2). Once again, it
staged a successful re-test of the support of its lower median line (A5-
A6) on July 30, 1996.
  Thus, the CI's short- and intermediate-term perspectives are shaping up
very nicely as it approaches its next bullish time window. This week, the
CI is poised to take out its immediate overhead resistance at 1,123 point
level. Its next resistance zone hovers around 1,140-1,155 points.
  The SBI is poised to crack the 600 level this week amid intermittent
profit-taking. Rotational plays will once again feature prominently as the
SBI will continue to move along its uptrend channel (See KLSE SBI - C1-C2
and C3-C4).

Clean-up Day team clears up 620kg of rubbish

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

KLANG, Sun. - A car-seat, a baby-walker and motorcycle spare parts were
among the "treasures" collected at The Body Shop's Fifth Annual Coastal
Clean-Up at the esplanade, Port Klang, today.
  More than 100 participants from The Body Shop, Klang Municipal Council,
Klang Youth Council and Red Crescent societies from schools here scoured
the 1.5 kilometre esplanade for trash dumped by inconsiderate people.
  The total amount of trash collected weighed 621.20 kilogrammes.
  The clean-up was held in conjunction with International Coastal Clean-Up
Day which is co-ordinated by the Centre for Marine Conservation in
Atlanta, the United States.
  CMC is a non-governmental organisation which co-ordinates more than
200,000 volunteers in clean-up efforts around the world on the second
Sunday of every September.
  The Body Shop's public and media relations manager, Molly Fong, said it
initiated the first Malaysian clean-up in 1992 and had co-ordinated annual
clean-ups at different coastlines, including at Langkawi, Tioman and
Pantai Morib.
  Today's clean-up was launched at 9.30am by Sementa Assemblyman Datuk
Abdul Rahman Talil.
  Mina Foong, managing director of The Body Shop Malaysia, said the clean-
up was to single out the kinds of rubbish dumped indiscriminately.
  Participants recorded information about the trash collected on data
cards which will be sent to CMC. The information will be processed and
become part of CMC's annual International Coastal Clean-Up report.
  Foong said CMC would use the report to lobby Governments, the United
Nations and companies whose products were commonly found in coastal trash.

Using cards to pay toll by year 2000

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

By Mimi Syed Yusof

SUNGAI SIPUT, Sun. - Motorists in the Klang Valley will have to use
electronic cards for payment under the open toll system which will be
introduced in the year 2000, Works Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu said.
  He said the central electronic toll collection system would reduce
manpower at toll stations.
  "The best option is to introduce electronic toll cards as a mode of
payment for motorists entering the Federal capital," he told reporters
after attending a badminton exhibition match yesterday.
  Samy Vellu said the proposal was submitted to the Cabinet at its meeting
last Wednesday.
  The move would ensure smooth toll collection as motorists need not queue
for long periods at toll booths.
  Under the system, motorists will have to purchase the electronic toll
cards.
  The Minister also said the Cabinet had requested his ministry to submit
a report on the system within two to three months.
  On the system, Samy Vellu said a central collection agency would be set
up to collect all toll payments via the electronic cards.
  The agency will then channel the payments to all the companies and
concessionaires of road projects.
  He said to date 12 road projects outside Kuala Lumpur had been approved.
  After the roads are completed there will be toll stations every three or
five kilometres along the roads leading to the city centre.
  "This means there will be about 200 toll stations around the Klang
Valley," he said, adding that several companies had recommended that an
intelligent system be implemented to facilitate toll collection.
  On whether Projeck Lebuhraya Utara Selatan would be included in the new
system, Samy Vellu said PLUS would be exempted because it dealt with long-
distance travelling based on the closed toll concept.
  "The focus is now on the toll collection system in Kuala Lumpur which
will include all the roads around the capital and from Kuala Lumpur to the
highways," he said.
  Also included are the Federal highway and roads from Kuala Lumpur-Shah
Alam, the integrated highway from Kuala Lumpur-Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur
International Airport in Sepang, Shah Alam-Putrajaya and KLIA, Jalan
Kuching to Kuala Lumpur and Shah Alam-Petaling Jaya.
  Another route is Jalan Cheras-Batu 7 Kajang which is connected to the
North-South Expressway.
  Samy Vellu said the system must be adopted because it was the best way
to collect toll from all the entry points of the city centre.
  He said the ministry would also hold discussions with consortiums of
road projects in preparing the proposal.
  He said six companies had started work on several toll stations and at
least two would start collecting toll when the roads are completed.
  He also said experts would be called in to study the situation and to
provide feedback.

`Ban Singaporeans from buying food'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

TAIPING, Sun. - The Federation of Malaysian Consumer Association wants the
Government to ban Singaporeans from taking any food items out of Johor
Baru.
  It has proposed that the Government check the car boots of Singaporeans
leaving Johor Baru for the purpose.
  Speaking at a press conference after a forum on current consumer issues
organised by the Consumer Association of Taiping held at a leading hotel
here, Fomca president Mohamed Hamdan said the move was aimed at protecting
consumers in Johor Baru.
  He said if the Singapore Government could have a half-tank policy to
check on the petrol tanks of cars entering the republic, then it was not
unreasonable for the Malaysian Government to check the car boots of
Singaporean motorists to prevent them from taking away food items.
  Mohamed Hamdan said as the country was not self-sufficient and importing
many essential food items like rice, flour, fish and chicken, it was
unfair for Singaporeans to be allowed to take away food items from
Malaysia.
  "How can we allow Singaporeans to take away our imported essential food
items," he said.
  Mohamed Hamdan also cited as an example how Malaysia was importing wheat
100 per cent.
  He added that the Singapore Government was imposing a lot of
restrictions on Malaysians entering the republic.
  Mohamed Hamdan said since food had become costly in Johor Baru, it was
wise for Malaysia to control the "re-exportation" of such items by non-
Malaysian individuals.

Hamdan: Open system a burden

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

IPOH, Sun. - The Federation of Malaysian Consumers Association president
Mohamed Hamdan Adnan said today the open toll system requiring motorists
who enter Kuala Lumpur to pay toll was a burden to consumers.
  He said consumers were currently burdened with many taxes, which
included paying the highway toll.
  He said the association would only support the system if the Government
ensured that the public transportation system and infrastructure
facilities within the Klang Valley were up to the mark.
  While agreeing that this would help reduce traffic congestion within the
city centre, Hamdan said without a proper public transportation system,
the open toll concept was inappropriate.
  He also said there were other ways to reduce city centre traffic
congestion such as moving activities from Kuala Lumpur to other parts of
Klang Valley.
  "Kuala Lumpur is congested because development is currently concentrated
there.
  "The Government should also consider other alternatives such as
organising activities outside the city and to put a stop to development
plans within Kuala Lumpur," he told reporters after giving a talk at the
Old Andersonian Club on current consumer issues.
  Hamdan also said the Government should not concentrate solely on
development within the city but that it should be balanced and spread out
evenly.
  He proposed that the Government set up townships outside the city
centre. He, however, said development of townships should not harm the
environment but should be properly planned so that it would complement the
outskirts of the city.
  "The Government should not burden the consumers by asking them to pay
without giving them an option," he said.

State aims to reduce number of poor families

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 8

By Sa'odah Elias

SABAK BERNAM, Sun. - The Selangor State Government aims to reduce the
number of poor families to less than one per cent of the State's
population before the end of the century.
  The number of families living below the poverty line in Selangor
currently stands at 2,302 or slightly over two per cent.
  Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib said besides direct help
and assistance, various programmes would be introduced to provide members
of these families with new skills to enable them to better their lives.
  "Through our concerted poverty eradication programme, we hope to reduce
the number of poor families in Selangor to below 1,000 by the year 2000.
  "With the help of the State Poverty Eradication Foundation, we are
confident of meeting this target," he said at a key presenting ceremony to
14 proud homeowners whose houses were built by YBK.
  Each of the two-bedroom houses built under the YBK Desa Kasih scheme in
Kampung Tebuk Pulai near here cost about RM20,000 which includes the value
of a piece of land measuring 15 by 21 metres.
  They were built for families in the district identified as being very
poor. Besides a house, each family was provided with 20 hydrophonic cases
to enable them to venture into hydrophonic farming.
  Muhammad said in the effort to eradicate poverty in Selangor, emphasis
would be placed on upgrading the skills of the people to enable them to be
independent and discourage them from expecting Government handouts.
  He said the programme, which also encompassed the poor in urban areas,
would be further intensified over the next few years to ensure their place
in the mainstream of development in the State.
  He said the rural poor would be supplied with new farming skills while
those in urban areas would be provided with business opportunities with
the setting up of stalls and hawker centres.
  YBK chairman Datuk Zainal Abidin Sakom said since 1991, the foundation
had provided monetary aid to 481 families living in Malay traditional
villages to repair or rebuild their houses under the Lindungan Kasih
scheme.
  Under the Desa Kasih scheme, he said, three housing schemes - which have
benefited 90 homeless families - had been built.

Gold cheaper by RM3 per gm due to price war

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 8

IPOH, Sun. - The price of the top three grades of gold is down by RM3 per
gramme after a price war between Federation of Malaysian Goldsmiths and
Jewellers' Association members and non-members.
  Perak branch chairman Y.M. Chong said the price reduction came about
after an emergency meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Sept 3.
  "We are doing this to stabilise the price of gold in the local market,"
he told a news conference today.
  He said about 200 members in the State had been advised to adhere to the
association's resolution although their profit margin could be cut to less
than five per cent.
  Chong said non-members were selling gold at a lower price and this was
seriously affecting the business.
  "In the past, it was up to 12 per cent but we are making a sacrifice to
alert consumers of what is happening in the industry," he said, adding
that the price was expected to go up early next year.
  He said the 999 (24 carat gold), which was sold at RM39 per gramme, was
now being sold at RM36, 916 (22 carat) from RM37 to RM34 and 835 (20
carat) from RM34 to RM31.
  Chong claimed many non-members sold gold to customers at a cheaper rate
but this was of inferior quality.
  "There are also goldsmiths who offer gifts like radios and cameras.
  "This could be a sales gimmick to sell off inferior quality gold," Chong
said.
  He said these errant goldsmiths refused to become members because they
had to adhere "to our strict business ethics, rules and regulations".
  "We self-regulate ourselves by investigating members if customers
complain they have been cheated or shortchanged by them," he said.
  He advised consumers to buy jewellery from reputable goldsmith outlets
who were also members of the federation.
  Chong said customers could not get good resale prices for their
jewellery if they bought inferior items.
  He said the standard rate was 18 per cent off the current gold market
price.
  Chong said the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry's
enforcement unit also periodically checked the outlets.

Hotel Equatorial opens doors in Ho Chi Minh City

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 8

By Shareem Amry in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

THE Hotel Equatorial chain was extended to seven locations when its latest
addition in Ho Chi Minh City officially opened its doors on Saturday.
  Owned by Singapore-based Planergo Pte Ltd, the RM87.5-million hotel was
opened by the acting chairman of Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, Vo
Viet Thanh.
  Pembangunan Anika Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hotel Equatorial
(M) Sdn Bhd, is the biggest shareholder in Planergo with a 31 per cent
stake. Arab-Malaysian Development has 20 per cent, while Singapore's
NatSteel Properties Pte Ltd and Lim Kah Ngam (Investment) Pte Ltd hold
23.75 per cent and 20.25 per cent respectively.
  Vietnamese entrepreneur Phan Thanh holds the rest.
  Speaking after the launch, Planergo's executive chairman Datuk Lim Kong
Wai said:
  "We think things will improve here, especially since Vietnam established
relations with the Asean. We even upgraded the hotel because of our
confidence in Vietnam's economic reforms."
  The hotel now registers an occupancy rate of between 40 and 50 per cent.
  The chain extends to Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Singapore, Jakarta, Guangzhou
and Shanghai.

Golden Valley expects RM20m from sale of lots

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 30

GOLDEN Valley Golf Resort Bhd expects a return of RM20 million from the
sale of 180 bungalow lots at its course in Air Panas, Jasin, Malacca.
  Its executive director, Azman Abdul Ghani, said the 180 lots were 7,000
to 15,000 square feet in area and were being sold for between RM14 and
RM16 per square foot.
  "Those who had purchased these lots can choose from our 10 models of
bungalow houses. Our subsidiary company will construct them at a cost of
RM200,000 to RM500,000," he said.
  Azman added buyers would also get a free membership to the golf club
which is worth RM36,000.
  He told this to reporters after witnessing Chief Minister Datuk Seri
Mohd Zin Abdul Ghani launch the project on Saturday.
  The development of the bungalow lots is the second major project
undertaken by Golden Valley.
  Its previous project was a 27-hole golf course with a clubhouse, seminar
facilities, a karaoke lounge and a Japanese hot bath on 160ha.
  Azman said the company had spent RM8 million on the infrastructure for
developing the bungalow lots.
  He said owners who chose to let their houses could get assistance from a
Golden Valley subsidiary.
  Future projects for the company include the development of chalets and
220 service apartment units.
  "This project would be completed in five to eight years and we hope the
profit generated from this and our other projects would spur our drive to
become a listed company," Azman said.

Emerging companies: Company profile: Saujana sees lots of opportunities
waiting

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 30

By Zuraimi Abdullah

AS suggested by the Malay word saujana, which is often associated with the
phrase sejauh mata memandang (as far as the eyes can see), Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange main board-bound Saujana Consolidated Bhd sees its days of
glory not within its grasp yet.
  "The horizon is endless, and so are the opportunities," managing
director Abu Bakar Mohamad Nor said during a recent interview.
  Although it has carved a niche for itself in the hotel and golf course
management business the company believes there is a lot more business
opportunities to be seized.
  Recalling the history of Saujana, Abu Bakar said it all began in the
early 1980s when Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, after
returning from an overseas trip, instructed Peremba Group of Companies -
via the Urban Development Authority - to set up a company to manage hotel
cum golf resorts.
  "Peremba at that time was under UDA, and the Prime Minister who was in
his early years in office, had this vision. Thus, Saujana came into
existence.
  "Eventually, with the combination of expertise from three good partners
- Hyatt International, Peremba and Saujana itself - and after some
problems, we have grown to what we are today."
  Saujana now owns and operates the renowned Hyatt Regency Saujana Hotel
and Saujana Golf and Country Club, both in Subang Jaya, Selangor, and
develops and markets computerised information systems as well as sells
turf equipment to golf clubs.
  And more recently, it diversified into the property sector after
acquiring 30 per cent equity in developer PGK Sdn Bhd.
  Abu Bakar said Saujana was proud to have built the country's best golf
course at the Saujana Golf and Country Club. The 18-hole course had been
voted the best course by Golf Malaysia magazine in 1991, 1993 and 1995.
  He admitted Saujana had benefited much from its link with its parent
company, Peremba.
  The alliance with Hyatt was formed over eight years ago. The partnership
allayed Saujana's fears of stiff competition in the hotel and hospitality
industry.
  "When we mention the name Hyatt, the thing that crosses people's mind is
its five-star hotel. During the recession, when several hotels were coming
up in the Klang Valley, we still managed to record an occupancy rate above
75 per cent."
  Abu Bakar said Hyatt Regency enjoyed an average occupancy rate of 74 per
cent last year and 82 per cent for the first six months this year. This is
high when compared with the 66 per cent registered by other hotels in
Peninsular Malaysia.
  About 75 per cent of Hyatt Regency's customers are corporate and
business travellers and of this, about 65 per cent are repeat customers.
  Now after eight profitable years, Abu Bakar said Saujana wanted to
introduce the concept in other places in the country.
  "Future expansion will be geared towards synergistic growth consistent
with our core business."
  He foresees more golf courses will be built, providing greater business
opportunities for the company.
  "The best way to exploit this is to support them through full
utilisation of our Toro turf equipment and Club Car golf buggies. We have
already captured 70 per cent of the market share in turf equipment.
  "On top of that, we believe many local authorities are going to develop
parks and football fields and they still need our machinery.
  "Furthermore, many other hotels as well as airports need our products
like the buggies," he said, adding that Saujana is the sole distributor
for Toro products and the golf buggies.
  It also plans to increase its land bank, which stands at 7.6ha and
located close to Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah International Airport in Subang.
The land was initially earmarked for the development of 569 units of
condominium.
  "Although the development of the condominiums has been approved, we will
still evaluate other proposals to maximise returns on investment and those
that complement our core business."
  Saujana is now scouting for land in Johor, Phuket in Thailand and Bali
in Indonesia for property development.
  "We are now talking to several parties. In Johor, we hope to secure
about 400 acres (160ha) of land. As for Phuket and Bali, we cannot say
much as the discussions are still at the preliminary stage," he said.
  Abu Bakar said Saujana, backed by expertise from Peremba and its
associated company PGK, was capable of undertaking any property
development.
  PGK is now developing Bandar Baru Wangsa Maju in Kuala Lumpur which is
expected to be completed in about 10 years.
  The company recently completed Phase Six of the project and to date has
recorded sales of about RM650 million.
  He ruled out the possibility that the property sector would supplant
Saujana's core business, saying that income from both sectors would
probably be the same in a few years.
  "In the next few years, our hotel business and property business each
will contribute 40 per cent to our revenue. The remaining 20 per cent will
come from our golf business."
  Currently, the core business contributes about 60 per cent of its income
and property 30 per cent.
  Saujana has forecast a pre-tax profit of RM15.76 million for the
financial year ending 1996. Last year, it made about RM11.18 million.

Electrolux aims for larger market share in Asean

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 28

By Noorzita Samad in Stockholm, Sweden

SWEDISH home appliances giant Electrolux AB aims to be among the top three
suppliers of washing machines, refrigerators and vacuum cleaners in Asean
by the year 2000.
  The target was set amidst its comprehensive plan to capture a larger
share in Asia's emerging consumer markets - traditionally dominated by
price-competitive products from Japan and to a lesser extent, South Korea.
  Apart from Asean countries, other potential markets in Asia identified
by Electrolux are China and India.
  And having set its goal to make further inroads into Asia, Electrolux
has consistently focused its efforts in developing products as well as
widening its investment in manufacturing operations in various Asian
nations.
  The group recently unveiled a new range of environmentally-friendly
products known as AlphaCare in Singapore.
  The new Electrolux washing machine, refrigerator, vacuum cleaner, built-
in oven and gas hob, and microwave oven will be launched in Malaysia,
Indonesia and Thailand next month.
  Its senior executive vice-president and chief financial officer Lennart
Ribohn said EIectrolux hoped the introduction of the AlphaCare range would
provide an impetus towards realising its goal of becoming tops in Asean.
  The group is aiming for a 20 per cent market share of washing machines
and a 10 per cent market share of refrigerators in Asean within the next
four years.
  It is estimated that by then, the washer market in Asean (excluding the
Philippines) will be worth about US$500 million (RM1.25 billion) and
refrigerator, almost US$1 billion.
  Ribohn said this to a group of journalists from Malaysia, Thailand,
Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong and China during a visit to Electrolux
global headquarters last week.
  The group also visited Electrolux-Zanussi factory in Pordenone, near
Venice in Italy; the group's vacuum cleaner factory, quality control and
testing facilities in Vastervik, about 280km from Stockholm; and,
Electrolux Home Centre and retail shops in Sweden's capital city.
  Ribohn said the group was now evaluating the feasibility of setting up
manufacturing facilities in the Asean region.
  Although he declined to disclose the possible locations and the
estimated investment for the ventures, Ribohn said the plants would
produce washing machines and refrigerators.
  They will likely be in the form of joint ventures with local partners,
with Electrolux maintaining the majority control.
  The deals are expected to be finalised by the end of this year, said
Ribohn, who also heads the new markets division which besides Asia also
includes Latin America, Eastern Europe and parts of Africa.
  Electrolux (Malaysia) Holdings Sdn Bhd deputy managing director S.N.
Soon was quoted as saying last month that the company planned to increase
its investment in Malaysia through the establishment of another factory.
  He said the company had yet to determine what to manufacture, adding
that the final plan would be decided by its Stockholm head office.
  Electrolux now has a vacuum cleaner factory in Shah Alam, Selangor.
  Electrolux is not a newcomer to the Malaysian market, having been around
since the 1970s. In fact, Electrolux is almost synonymous with vacuum
cleaners in Malaysia.
  But there is more to the group than just vacuum cleaners.
  It also produces other household appliances, commercial appliances and
outdoor and industrial products. It manufactures washing machines,
dishwashers, industrial-size laundry machines, lawn trimmers and
chainsaws, to name a few.
  Last year, sales reached 115.8 billion Swedish Kroners (RM45.16
billion).
  The group now manufactures appliances under a number of brand names of
companies which it had acquired over the years. In 1994, for instance, it
took over German appliance company AEG Hausgerate.
  It shifted to higher gear in its global expansion drive with the
acquisition of the famous Italian brand name, Zanussi, in 1984.
  Electrolux now has investments in more than 90 countries in commercial
appliances, industrial products and outdoor products.
  While its brands are tops in Europe and North America, sales in Asia
only contributed 5.1 per cent to the group's turnover last year.

     16 Sep 1996, page 28

AGENDA Istimewa Sdn Bhd, a member of the Gasing Heights group, will soon
open for sale Phase One of its shop-offices at Kesuma Lakes, a RM2 billion
township in Semenyih, Selangor.
  The three-storey shop-offices have an average built-up area of 22X70
feet, with prices ranging between RM425,000 to RM730,000.
  They are located within the proposed shopping mall area, between the
residential and commercial sections of the township, the company said in a
statement.
  Sales of the shop-offices are expected to be as brisk as those for the
bungalow lots, which breached RM120 million since the launch in July.
  Kesuma Lakes is a 548ha self-contained township comprising residential,
commercial and industrial development with facilities such as a private
college, four schools, a medical centre, police and fire stations.

Germany's Vega eyes Malaysian mart

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 28

GERMAN-BASED Vega AG, which produces unplasticised polyvinyl chloride
window and door systems, will join up with Malaysian companies to market
its products.
  "The companies will buy the (window and door) profiles from us as well
as the machinery for cutting the profiles. We hope to identify long-term
partners by the end of the year," regional manager (Asia Pacific) Lionel
Teng said in a statement.
  He added that the company had taken the first step towards regional
expansion by increasing the use of its softline system of window and door
profiles for the Asian market.
  "Veka is also seeking to consolidate its foothold in markets such as
Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines.
  "To date, we have formed strategic alliances with manufacturers in
Singapore, Thailand and Brunei," said Teng.
  To cater for the requirements of the Asia Pacific market, Veka has
developed a "tropical compound", which safeguards against discolouration
of uPVC from prolonged exposure to intensive solar radiation, heat and
humidity.
  "In Malaysia, profiles will be developed in co-operation with leading
architects and designers to ensure local appeal."
  Veka headquarters is in Sendenhorst, Germany and it also has operations
in the United States, Britain, Belgium, France, Spain, Poland and China.

RM1b sales expected form Lestari Perdana

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 28

SAP Holdings Bhd expects RM1 billion in sales from its latest development
project, Lestari Perdana, situated next to a forest reserve in Selangor.
  The 400ha project will see the mushrooming of bungalows, semi-detached
units and link houses situated within an integrated garden township.
  Residents will also enjoy facilities such as fibre optic networks, a
hypermarket, a private hospital as well as schools and community halls.
  The project, managed by SAP Air Hitam Properties Sdn Bhd, is expected to
be completed within eight to 10 years.
  Sales of the first phase of the project, comprising bungalow lots, was
launched in Kuala Lumpur Saturday.
  SAP Air Hitam general manager (property sector II) Ahmad Azhar Hanafi
said the response had been satisfactory with 65 of the 200 bungalow lots
sold during a soft launch a month ago.
  "Sales from the 65 lots amount to RM20 million," he told reporters,
adding that the cost per square foot ranges from RM28 to RM37 while the
bungalow built-up designs range from 8,000 square feet to 17,000 square
feet.
  SAP is now finalising the details and plans for the link houses and
semi-detached units which are expected to be launched mid next year.
  Lestari Perdana is the latest of a string of housing development
projects undertaken by SAP.
  Other projects under the company include Taman TAR in Kuala Lumpur and
Bandar Baru Selayang.

Bank to expand savings products

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 26

By Kasmiah Mustapha

PACIFIC Bank Bhd plans to boost its savings products and services in
response to the Government's call to nurture the saving habit especially
among schoolchildren and workers.
  President and chief executive officer Tan Sri Dr Lin See Yan said with
this in mind, the bank intends to introduce more savings products targeted
at people from various ages.
  "Our savings programme will be divided into four phases, starting from
age one right up until the person retires, as the needs of the public are
different."
  To develop the saving habit among the public, the Government has also
formed a Cabinet Committee on Savings, envisaged to help raise the
national savings rate and reduce the savings-investment gap.
  The country's savings rate which currently stands at 34.3 per cent is
insufficient to balance the needs for investment, which has reached 40 per
cent.
  Lin said as a first step, Pacific Bank has launched the Dolphin Save
account nationwide, to coincide with the opening of its branch in Bandar
Sunway, as part of its national savings campaign drive.
  Holders of the Dolphin Save account, who are children aged 12 and below,
will enjoy a free personal accident insurance coverage up to 10 times the
account balance and extended two-way insurance coverage which covers both
children and adults.
  Lin said through the systematic programme and a good branch network,
Pacific Bank hopes to attract more depositors. Last year, Pacific Bank's
total deposits were RM5.5 billion.
  "To date, the amount has increased to RM6.5 billion and we hope to
record total deposits of RM7 billion by the year end."
  Speaking to reporters after officiating Pacific Bank's latest branch in
Bandar Sunway on Saturday, Lin added the bank plans to have 60 branches by
the end of the year from 57 at present.
  "We believe with a strong branch network, we would be able to attract
more depositors and at the same time encourage people to save."

Telekom gets Amalan Tepat jobs

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 26

TELEKOM Malaysia Bhd has been given the exclusive rights for the next five
years to provide telecommunications infrastructure for projects conducted
by Amalan Tepat Sdn Bhd in Malacca.
  This includes the A Famosa Golf Resort in Alor Gajah.
  Telekom expects to spend a total of RM4.2 million as an initial cost to
provide telecommunication facilities there and to Amalan Tepat's other
projects in the near future.
  A memorandum of understanding was signed between the two companies on
Saturday in Malacca.
  Amalan Tepat was represented by its managing director Alex Lau while
Telekom by its senior vice-president, Dr Mohd Khir Harun. Also present
were Telekom's general manager for main trade and Government, Adnan Rofiee
and Amalan Tepat's executive director, Kevin Lau.
  Lau said Telekom was chosen for its wide experience in the field of
telecommunications.

First Islamic credit card in region launched by Arab-Malaysian Bank

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 26

THE Southeast Asian region's first Islamic credit card launched by Arab-
Malaysian Bank Bhd on Friday is designed to help Muslims conduct only
halal transactions, said managing director Azlan Zainol.
  Payments for haram transactions - as for liquor, gambling activities or
pornographic materials - will be automatically barred, following Visa
International Inc's agreement to block such payments worldwide.
  "This AMBank Al-Taslif Visa card is designed to help Muslims live the
Islamic way of life," said Azlan, adding that only about 15 types of
products and services out of Visa International's 2,000-odd categories
would be affected.
  He also said the card, designed in accordance with Islamic principles,
is not a credit card by conventional definitions.
  Other Islamic cards have been issued by Pakistan and some Middle East
nations, he said, but their adherence to Islamic principles is not as
comprehensive as the Al-Taslif card.
  For one, the credit limit for the AMBank card is determined by how much
the subscriber has placed as a fixed deposit in the Al-Mudharabah account,
and is as such different from convetional credit cards which require no
collateral.
  Further, the management fees or effective interest rate applied to
outstanding balances is capped at 12 per cent per annum.
  When the return on investment or interest earned on the fixed deposit is
also factored in, the net interest rate applied to outstanding balances
for card users works out to about only six per cent annually.
  "There is no other additional penalty charge on outstanding balances,"
Azlan said after the card was launched at Restoran Seri Melayu in Kuala
Lumpur by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
  Conventional credit cards usually charge an additional five per cent
interest on late payments.
  However, the Al-Taslif card user will still have to pay a minimum of 15
per cent of his outstanding balance at the end of each month in compliance
with Bank Negara's ruling.
  Another feature of the card is that no cash advance can be obtained; it
can be used only for transaction payments.
  "We may allow this in the future if advice from the Syariah Council is
that such a service is within Islamic principles," said Aslan, adding that
the card can also be used to make zakat payments.
  Further, a RM1 rebate will be given to the subscriber for every RM100
spent on payments using the card. Part of this annual total of rebates
will be given out to charity on behalf of the cardholder.
  "This is how Islamic principles should be applied. When doing business,
be prepared to also give to charity," Anwar said at the launch.

Talking point: Don't fall into credit card trap with wild spending

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 26

By K. H. Lim

CREDIT cards. Are they a boon or a bane? Depending on whom you talk to,
they can be either or both. We have heard of high income-earning
executives being hauled to court by card issuers for failing to pay their
debts. On the other hand, there are thousands of satisfied cardholders who
feel the card is as good as cash.
  Which brings us to the point: the card IS as good as cash. Therefore,
manage it like you manage your cash. Don't spend more than you can afford.
Of course, this is easier said than done. Which is why hundreds (maybe
thousands) of people have ended up on the wrong side of the law.
  In a timely move Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim last Friday
directed Bank Negara to study how regulations could be further tightened
to protect card users.
  I suppose he had in mind the questionable practices of certain issuers.
These may range from being Shylock-ish in their unending search for
interest charges or their incessant barrage of unsolicited mail.
  But then again, why do banks have such an image problem when it comes to
credit cards? Is it because they need the revenue from penalties on late
payments or are they incurring high costs in their card operations.
  Other than charging penalties for late payments or direct interest on
rollover balances, banks also get revenue from card acceptors, ie outlets
which have signed contracts with the various card companies to accept
their cards.
  Certain issuers charge as much as two per cent of the value charged as
their commission while others go as low as 0.5 per cent. Market forces
have determined that these rates cannot be arbitrarily increased just to
ensure card-issuing banks meet operational costs.
  One will then have to look at the cost of their card operations.
Although costing profile and work culture may differ from bank to bank, I
cannot help but notice that at least two banks are very aggressive in
their marketing campaigns to attract cardholders.
  Besides enticing customers with various gifts (which means more costs),
these banks hire card sales executives on fairly high salaries and then
impose high targets for them to achieve.
  It's no wonder that these banks record the highest turnover of staff in
card sales operations. One must bear in mind that all these costs will
ultimately have to be borne by customers, in this case, cardholders.
  The pressure on these young and ambitious salespeople is so great that
they have, to their credit (pardon the pun), managed to sell their
products to people already holding cards belonging to other issuers.
  I know of people who not only carry different cards, but have two or
more Mastercards or Visa cards from different banks.
  Bank Negara statistics show that there were 1.8 million credit cards in
use as of end-June 1996 compared to 1.6 million a year earlier. I don't
think there were 200,000 new cardholders in the intervening 12 months.
This means among them were people who already had cards and were reeled in
by the "pressure-selling" tactics of these card sales executives who had
to meet quotas, failing which they would lose their jobs.
  Is it a wonder then, that the default rate has increased? One must bear
in mind that there are annual charges to pay besides the interest on
rollover balance.
  Here again, consumers must be aware of the various costs of owning
cards. Credit cards are no longer a status symbol; they have become a
necessity unless one relishes the idea of carrying large amounts of money,
or using ATMs every other day.
  Consumers must demand that card issuers do not charge annual fees, not
only for the first year, but also for subsequent years. After all, they
should run their card operations based on revenue from outlets and not
cardholders' penalties.
  To be fair, cardholders must charge a minimum of, say RM5,000 a year, so
that issuers can recoup costs. The minimum could be two or three tiered
depending on the "colour" of the card.
  Cardholders must always remember never to under-estimate what a monster
interest can turn out to be. Its cousin, called compound interest, is even
worse. I have personally known of people who surrendered their cards to
the issuers and gradually paid back what they owed over the next few
years. All due to an impulsive spending spree and a gross under-rating of
interest.
  Talking Point: The word credit card is a misnomer. It is the
convenience, not credit, that you need. Use it like a charge card. Make
use of the 20-day to 50-day interest-free period to pay. And pay in full.
Spend only what you can afford to pay in those 20-50 days. Otherwise,
don't.
  This way, both you and the bank will be happy.

Restructing to put TRI ahead in telecoms

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 25

By Elaine Jeyakumar

TECHNOLOGY Resources Industries Bhd is rearranging its corporate structure
under a five-year plan to further spearhead the group towards realising
its vision of becoming the premier telecommunications company in Malaysia.
  In an exercise known as Focus II, TRI is dividing its various
telecommunication activities into seven core areas:
  * mobile services,
  * international services,
  * value-added/content/multimedia
  * transmission
  * fixed network
  * data group and other products
  * international ventures.
  Focus II is a continuation of TRI's "Project Focus" implemented in April
1993 which outlined the group's focus and emphasis in the
telecommunications industry.
  Chairman and chief executive Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli said the group's
business had grown such that there was a need to streamline its activities
into these core areas.
  "This will give us a better platform to expand each of the sectors and
move forward in the industry," he told a Press conference in Kuala Lumpur
on Saturday.
  Each of the seven units will be headed by a president who will oversee
and manage the activities of each sector, which will eventually be
separate business entities relying on their own strengths.
  Effectively, the group's activities will fall under seven main companies
under the TRI umbrella.
  Under the original structure, all of TRI's telecommunication activities
fell under the umbrella of its 100 per cent-owned subsidiary Cellular
Communications Network (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.
  Celcom's subsidiaries include Celcom Transmission (M) Sdn Bhd which
handles the group's transmission projects such as fibre-optics and
microwaves and Celcom Technology (M) Sdn Bhd which manages the value-added
and multimedia services.
  Under the restructured organisation of TRI, some of these companies will
be brought out from under Celcom and recognised as independent units in
their various sectors.
  "We will reposition them and possibly change the names of the companies
to better reflect their importance," said Tajudin.
  Meanwhile, Celcom will only concentrate on the cellular business and
handle the group's ART 900 and Celcom GSM services, trunk radio and paging
activities.
  Tajudin added that new companies would be set up for three business
units, namely the fixed network, data group and international venture
sectors.
  He said the group was also working towards product branding in a bid to
associate both the company and the products as one.
  "TRI is widely-known mainly as a cellular service provider because of
the Celcom mobile phone service network which is managed by Celcom.
  "What many do not realise is that we have a complete range of licences
to conduct a host of other telecommunication-related activities, some of
which have already been implemented."
  This includes one for the group's fixed network activities, which have
yet to make an impact on the industry. Nevertheless, TRI already has deals
with 25 companies to provide fixed services which are in various stages of
planning and implementation.
  Tajudin said in time, the cellular division, which now contributes 65
per cent towards the group's earnings, would become one of the smaller
contributors.
  The reduced contribution to about one-third of the group's earnings, is
expected in the light of the more rapid growth anticipated for the other
sectors.
  Tajudin said the ART 900 network was maturing and there was not much
room for further growth in that area. However, the Celcom GSM network has
potential for expansion.
  He said a number of the group's operations, such as international
services, transmission activities and value-added services, had already
started turning in a profit.
  Certain overseas joint ventures are also profitable. In addition, the
group has recently received the licence to conduct cellular operations in
Bangladesh.
  The restructuring of TRI is similar to the exercise undertaken by
Malaysia Airlines, which is also in Tajudin's stable of companies.
  Tajudin said the TRI restructuring exercise was expected to take between
12 and 18 months, encompassing the legal aspects as well as the
contractual agreements between the companies within the group.

Petronas set to issue third Yankee bond

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 25

PETRONAS has confirmed that it will issue a third Yankee bond soon to
raise funds to finance both ongoing and new projects in the downstream
sector.
  The national oil corporation's president, Datuk Mohd Hassan Marican,
said the bond, to be issued end of this month, or early next month,
followed two previous successful issues in 1993 and last year.
  Mohd Hassan said Petronas had appointed two American financial
institutions, CS First Boston and Solomon Brothers, as joint lead manager
for the issue.
  "But the size of the bond would be determined later ... if the price and
the response from the market is good, we will take as much as we can," he
said on Saturday after launching the new image for Petronas service
stations.
  The service station at Taman Sri Hartamas in Kuala Lumpur is the first
to adopt the new concept which includes the "Mesra" convenience stores,
mini post offices and automated teller machines.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: Paloh "to be back on fast lane when S46 members join
Umno"

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 10

IT takes a lot to survive as the wife of a politician husband and this
could not be truer than in the case of the wife of Norzula Mat Diah,
Assemblyman for Paloh.
  Norzula's wife, a nurse, was transferred from Gua Musang to Kota Baru
last year in a move perceived to be connected to the fact that her husband
was an Opposition strongman. It seemed that the local Wanita Umno wing
thought she was campaigning among the patients.
  Since Norzula could not possibly move to Kota Baru, the couple made the
difficult decision that she resign from the service. And she did,
reluctantly and not without a great deal of resentment.
  The family also had to move out of the government quarters into a
makeshift home in the annex of the Semangat '46 service centre.
  Thus, it is high irony that barely a year later, her husband is now
preparing to return to Umno.
  "That's politics, I suppose," he said with a shrug.
  His long-suffering wife, he claimed, had been sabar sangat over the
latest development, or so he thinks.
  Norzula's constituency is virtually one huge land resettlement tract
variously under Kesedar or Felda. About the only big areas not under some
land scheme or other are the Orang Asli settlement in Pasir Linggi and a
traditional village in Limau Kasturi.
  Limau Kasturi is Paloh's current and sole claim to fame. The village was
the inspiration behind the award-winning TV drama of the same name, its
storyline woven around a teacher's dedication to his pupil in the face of
daunting Islamic fundamentalism.
  Fortunately, the problems faced by Norzula are far less unnerving.
  The population here is still very much tied to the land and subjected to
the caprices of nature. Thus, the off-fruit season often finds him
reaching deep into his pocket to meet requests from settlers for money for
their children's examination fees, uniforms or books. Requests for bigger
sums are forwarded to the Yayasan Kelantan Darulnaim or Kelantan Religious
Affairs and Malay Customs Council.
  A large chunk of his wakil rakyat allocation goes to constructing fish
ponds.
  Paloh, he said, will be back on the fast lane once Semangat '46 members
join Umno.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: The prince has big plans for placid Gua Musang

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 10

All reports on "My Wakil Rakyat and I" by Joceline Tan; Badrul Hisham
Mahzan

TENGKU Razaleigh Hamzah's association with Gua Musang began in 1969. Thus,
it seemed best not to be argumentative when he claimed to know almost
every nook and cranny of the constituency.
  Back then, getting to Gua Musang town - if it could be called a town -
meant a journey of a day and a half. The prince would motor from Kota Baru
to Kuala Krai where he would put up the night.
  The next morning he would be up at the crack of dawn, down some coffee
and head off to the train station to wait, hopefully, for the 6.15am,
southbound train. If all went well, meaning there was no derailment or
other delays, he and his entourage would arrive at Gua Musang before 11pm.
  Otherwise, he would still be waiting when the sun was overhead.
  The river was an alternative. But it was accessible only during the
rainy season which could be dangerous and less than accessible during the
dry season when it was safe.
  To his credit, the Kelantan prince endured the hardship and now, looking
back, even claimed that he found it beneficial.
  "It was a challenge. This is the best constituency for me to learn about
my state and my people," said, involuntarily slipping into the royal "my".
  Tengku Razaleigh is in Gua Musang at least once a month.
  There seems little doubt that he intends to roost over the constituency
for awhile to come judging by the house he has built as well as the annex
of facilities for meetings and gatherings nearby.
  It is here that even the humblest of constituents will come to see him.
  "Mostly they want a land title to their name," he said in what was to
become  a ringing refrain among the other wakil rakyat here.
  Being the benevolent host that he is, he ensures that they are fed and
rested before they depart. Those who have come long distances, as most of
them are apt to, often receive some reimbursement for the journey home.
  But Tengku Razaleigh's long-term intentions are perhaps most revealing
in his plans for the constituency. For several years now, he has been
talking about elevating Gua Musang into the State capital while Kota Baru
will enjoy the status as a royal town.
  The rationale is that Gua Musang is far more central a location than
Kota Baru in the peninsular context.
  And it is, geographically speaking. Gua Musang is certainly nearer Kuala
Lumpur, and all other major towns in the peninsula than Kota Baru.
  Unfortunately, only his supporters and those living in Gua Musang seem
to find this idea exciting.
  Shifting the capital calls for a great deal of political clout and until
such time that Tengku Razaleigh manages to rally such clout, then Gua
Musang town will remain a placid and sequestered dell.
  He also has grand plans for the town centre which he was unable to
develop further after breaking away from Umno.
  But now that he is breaking away from Pas, he intends to revive those
plans or as he put it: "I want to re-do the town centre once Nik Aziz (the
Tok Guru) retires."
  Then, more seriously, he said: "They (people here) have been left
behind."
  He believes some of the more immediate solutions to the people's
problems can be solved with better infrastructure (especially more feeder
roads linking remote villages to main route), residential schools and, of
course, jobs.
  Among the ordinary people, especially the Malays who make up 90 per cent
of the 100,000 population here, there is, after all these years, a certain
awe that a privileged personality like Tengku Razaleigh would choose to
spend time, money and effort on their behalf.
  Although much of his accomplishments came during the 1970s and 1980s,
the projects he pushed forth were right on target on the Malay pulse. He
quenched their thirst for land and he basically opened up what was till
then a god forsaken terrain.
  The Orang Asli support for him has also not been for nothing. He stands
among a handful of politicians who have treated the Orang Asli with the
respect and dignity they deserve and not only when he wants their votes.
  All this, explains to a large extent the bedrock of support that he
continues to command in spite of his political vacillation.
  Given the Malaysian propensity for titles, it would not come as a
surprise if he is lauded as the "Father of modern Gua Musang" one of these
days.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: Requests for land titles will test rep's abilities

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 10

OMAR Muhamad favours the jubah and with his flowing beard and white
turban, he looks more like a Pas man than a Semangat '46 assemblyman.
  He also did not look well. The effects of a serious road accident
several years ago seem to have affected his train of thought and his
opinions came in hesitant spurts.
  Omar presides over the largest of the three State constituencies with
Orang Asli form a substantial segment of the electorate.
  His is perhaps the only constituency where special campaign strategies
and tactics are employed on the parts of both the ruling and opposition
parties to win over the Orang Asli.
  During the by-election, the BN air-dropped thousands of posters and
pamphlets from helicopters. The paper campaign may not have been very
useful then, given the less than desirable literacy rate, but the posters
were probably put to good use by the Orang Asli to cover up cracks and
gaps on the walls in their houses.
  Although many Orang Asli have been moved to more permanent settlements,
a large number still prefer to stick to their traditional sites that can
only be reached by river or on foot in a journey that sometimes takes up
to two days.
  And according to Omar, the best form of persuasion with these gentle
people is not through "air-mail" but face-to-face contact.
  "Everybody wants land titles ... Malays, Orang Asli, squatters," he said
in a resgned manner.
  The legendary Malay attachment to the land could not be more stark than
here in the Kelantan heartland.
  In fact, there are some 1,000 squatters clamouring for land titles in
his constituency, a task that will surely put him to the test in the next
few years.

RM150,000 grab from goldsmith shop

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

SEREMBAN, Sun. - Four masked men, three with pistols and another with a
knife, escaped with jewellery worth RM150,000 during a robbery at a
goldsmith shop in Jalan Datuk Bandar Tunggal yesterday.
  The robbers who struck just before the shop closed for business at
6.30pm escaped in a car which was later found abandoned near a shopping
complex about 200 metres away.
  A district police spokesman said the robbers had warned several workers
and its owner to surrender jewellery placed in several trays inside a
glass showcase.
  He said the robbers scooped the jewellery into several bags. However,
during the heist an alarm in the shop was triggered and the robbers fled
with the loot in a car driven by another accomplice, which was parked
outside the shop.
  Police later found a white Proton Saga car, believed to have been
abandoned by the robbers, at the basement of a shopping complex in Jalan
Tuanku Munawir, about 200m from the goldsmith shop at 9am today.
  Those with any information on the robbery are urged to contact the
district police station at 06-7635522.

Bahasa: An appeal to private sector

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

By Hanizah Hashim

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Private sector leaders should show their commitment
towards Government's efforts to increase the use of Bahasa Malaysia by
holding discussions through open forums.
  Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka`s director-general Abdul Aziz Deraman said the
participation of the private sector in forums to be held in the 1996-98
Private Sector National Language Movement was essential.
  He said these forums would provide a platform for discussions and give a
clearer picture on the problems faced by the private sector in
implementing the use of the national language.
  Abdul Aziz was opening the forum "Enhancing the Economic Value of the
National Language" organised by the DBP and Malaysian Linguistics
Association yesterday.
  The panelists were Permodalan Nasional Bhd's group chief executive Datuk
Mohd Helmi Mohd Taib, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd's managing director Datuk
Ahmad Tajuddin Abdul Rahman and Universiti Sains Malaysia lecturer
Professor Abdullah Hassan.
  Abdul Aziz said open forums would provide the best arena for the
exchange of ideas and opinions on ways to achieve the movement's objective
with the support and co-operation of the private sector.
  During the panel discussion, chaired by former DBP director-general
Datuk Hassan Ahmad, Mohd Helmi said it was important to find ways to
encourage the use of Bahasa Malaysia in the private sector.
  However, he said, in the financial sector, clearer directives were
needed from Bank Negara for the increased use of the national language in
official transactions.
  "The current reality of the job market in the private sector is that
graduates with a good command of the English language was preferred as
this is the language used for business communication.
  "We have to find ways to increase the use of Bahasa Malaysia in the
private sector or else graduates from local universities would not be
accepted as their lower proficiency in English could be viewed as a
weakness," he said.
  Ahmad Tajuddin said extra effort from all sectors and closer co-
operation between the public and private sectors would be needed to make
Bahasa Malaysia a respected language in the business community.
  He said the profit motive was an important factor in the private sector,
thus it would seem unnecessary to translate a document into Bahasa
Malaysia if the English version was more commonly used.
  Economic strength was vital, he said, citing the "language pride" of the
Japanese as an example which made it necessary for those interested in
doing business with them to learn the Japaneses language for easier
communication.
  "If we are economically successful, more people will want to know how we
succeed and will learn our language and culture."

60 unwed pregnant women find shelter in Negri

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

SEREMBAN, Sun. - Sixty unwed pregnant women have been placed under the
care of the State Welfare Department and a non-governmental organisation
in Negri Sembilan.
  Of the total, 56 have been placed in welfare institutions under the
department throughout the State while the remaining are under the care of
the State Malaysian Islamic Welfare Organisation branch.
  State Unity and Community Development Committee chairman Goh Siow Huat
said today most of them were students of private learning institutions and
factory workers aged between 16 and 19 years.
  He said some of them had sought the assistance of the department
voluntarily while the others were either sent by their families or ordered
by the courts to be placed under the department's care.
  "Most of them became pregnant after indulging in sexual relationship
with their male companions who later abandoned them," he said, adding that
these women came from all over the country.
  He said the four women under the care of Perkim were from outside the
State who became pregnant while working here.
  Goh said the department would take care of the pregnant women including
delivering their babies who would be returned to the mothers or their
families or placed under its adoption scheme.
  "We are really serious in wanting to help unwed pregnant mothers. So we
hope they will not be shy or afraid to come forward."
  The department's move was not to encourage pregnancies outside marriage
but to provide a place for these women to deliver their babies in efforts
to curb cases of abandoned babies, he said.
  Goh urged parents to instil discipline among their children especially
through values and religious knowledge to prevent them from indulging in
unhealthy activities.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: Rozali Isohak: A genuinely nice chap in politics

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

IT was hard to believe that the voice roaring through the loud speaker
belonged to Datuk Rozali Isohak.
  The first and last time I met him, had been in his office. Then, he had
struck me as a gentle soul, soft-spoken and muted in his views.
  And here he was, under the blazing mid-afternoon sun, lambasting Pas in
a fashion almost comparable to the king of political oratory, Datuk Seri
Anwar Ibrahim.
  Later, he said a little sheepishly: "This is Kelantan. You have to talk
like that to get their attention."
  Actually, as the Kelantan media clique will tell you, Rozali is a
genuinely "nice chap", so much so, that one wonders what he is doing in a
business like politics. Then again, niceness is not exactly the most
effective of political tools.
  He is one of Tengku Razaleigh's most trusted party comrades which
perhaps explains his appointment as Deputy Menteri Besar II. The party had
to settle for the "II" after failing to get their hands on the "I", and it
was incidents like this which eroded the early camaraderie of Semangat '46
and Pas.
  His constituency, Dabong, is one of the most remote and underdeveloped
in Kelantan. Here, roads are more the exception than the norm and many
villages are accessible only by river.
  The country may have been catapulted along at eight per cent growth and
skyscrapers in KL may be making headlines worldwide, but life has changed
minimally for Malays here.
  The everyday act of going to school continues to be a physical challenge
while a simple illness may lead to death. Amenities and services urbanites
take for granted are still the stuff of dreams or as they say here, mimpi
saja.
  According to Rozali, projects scheduled under the Sixth Malaysia Plan
were not implemented. This included a road linking Dabong and Gua Musang
and a bridge over Sungai Galas.
  The rural economy does not generate new employment and Dabong has seen a
steady migration of its young people.
  The biggest employer is the Komplex Perkayuan Kelantan, a subsidiary of
the Kelantan Economic Development Corporation with a payroll of 200; the
Majlis Daerah Kuala Krai Selatan comes a close second with 100 employees.
  "Dabong needs at least 1,000 more jobs," Rozali said.
  Like most politicians, Rozali thinks his constituency has tourism
potential. The Stong Hill Resort, boasting the longest waterfall in South
East Asia, has attracted more than 10,000 visitors, mainly foreigners.
  The Assemblyman returns weekly. As is typical of the way politics and
religion tend to merge in Kelantan, Rozali arrives in Dabong in time for
Friday prayers and then stays back at the mosque to meet his constituents.
  He has a service centre run by five volunteers but some constituents
still travel all the way to Kota Baru to see him.
  Rozali is confident the Dabong electorate will go where Tengku Razaleigh
goes. And although his party's pending merger withUmno has captured the
national imagination, life in Dabong is unlikely to change radically.

Squash.: Ong to skip Hong Kong doubles tour

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By A. Devaraj

PROFESSIONAL player Ong Beng Hee, who has set his sights on winning the
Milo-Dunlop PJ Open title early next month, intends to skip the doubles
playing tour of Hong Kong on Sept 27-29.
  Beng Hee's father, K.H. Ong, said yesterday that the playing tour is too
close to the PJ Open, which is scheduled for Oct 2-5 at the Astaka courts.
  Said Ong: "Quite frankly Beng Hee is not very keen on playing doubles.
He'd rather concentrate on singles and for this year's PJ Open. I think he
has a very good chance of winning it."
  Ong has requested the SRA of Malaysia to reconsider sending his son for
the Hong Kong trip.
  SRAM executive director Lt Kol (R) Wong Ah Jit said yesterday they were
looking into Ong's request. "If Beng Hee is not really keen on playing
doubles in Hong Kong, there's no point in sending him. However, we will
make a decision soon."
  National director of coaching Mej (R) S. Maniam is currently in India on
a coaching course and SRAM are likely to wait for him to return before
making a decision.
  Beng Hee is supposed to partner Kenneth Low in Hong Kong. The other
players named for the Hong Kong trip include Yap Kok Four, Ng Tian Sin,
Tan Tian Huat, Ricky Lee and Allan Soyza.
  For the PJ Open, Beng Hee is seeded second behind Low and the duo are
expected to meet in the final.
  Said Ong: "If Beng Hee is excused from the Hong Kong trip, he will be
fresh for the PJ Open and that is another reason why I would prefer him
not to go.

Squash.: SRAM prepare players for England stint

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By A. Devaraj

THE SRA of Malaysia will concentrate on improving the fitness of Kenneth
Low, Ong Beng Hee, Yap Kok Four and Kuan Choy Lin before they leave for a
four-month stint in England on Nov 1.
  SRAM executive director Lt Kol (R) Wong Ah Jit said this is to ensure
that they will be ready for the tough training and playing stints in
England.
  Said Wong: "We don't want them to waste time on their fitness there when
we can do it here. That is why they are doing a lot of runs and gym work
and will be ready, fitness wise, for the England stint."
  Low and Yap will be attached to John Milton, who runs Proace Management
in Broxbourne, outside London.
  Ong and Choy Lin will be attached to national coach Jamie Hickox. But
all of them will be staying together, only the training programmes will be
separate.
  "In the case of Ong, he will be playing matches with professionals in
London and also Wales while the others will be basically staying in
Broxbourne.
  "Proace, who manage several top profession`ls, will come up with a
training programme for Low and Yap while Hickox will prepare a schedule
for Choy Lin and Ong.
  "However, we have insisted that the players be involved in the League
where they will be able to play against some of the top names in the
world. The English League is a very tough one and most of the top players
in the world are involved in the League in November and December.
  "However I'm not sure whether there is a League for women where Choy Lin
can compete."
  Wong said that in the latest fitness tests conducted on the players
early this month at the National Sports Council sports and medicine unit,
Low was the fittest.
  "Low's results were impressive. He only has a fat level of five per cent
and this is very good. Top American athletes have a fat level of three per
cent.
  "Ong's results were also good but Yap is overweight and needs to lose
some weight and will have to undergo a special diet.
  "Choy Lin is also carrying excess weight and she too will have to diet.
  "However, we are still awaiting the final overall results of all the
players. Once we get that, those who are not fit will have to undergo
extra fitness training before they leave for England."

ACC qualifier 1996.: Cricket.: Bangladesh outclass UAE

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By C. Navaratnam

BANGLADESH gave a classic all-round display to outclass the United Arab
Emirates by 108 runs in the final of the Pepsi-Asian Cricket Council
qualifying round competition at the Kilat Club padang yesterday.
  With this convincing win, Bangladesh have qualified for the Asian Cup
four-nation tournament in Sri Lanka next year. They will play against the
Test playing giants Pakistan, India and hosts Sri Lanka.
  Bangladesh were certainly a cut above UAE in all aspects of the game.
UAE, who fielded five players who took part in the World Cup competition
earlier this year, batted badly and went down meekly.
  Bangladesh, electing to bat, knocked up 212 runs in 49.3 overs. They
were given a flying start by their openers, Shariar Hoss`in and Harun-Ur
Rashid, who put on 66 runs by the 16th over.
  Shariar, in particular, was quick to punish the loose balls and went on
to make a majestic 58 which included seven fours off 95 balls, while Harun
hit a well-grafted 21.
  In-form Aminul Islam coming in No 4, kept up the tempo by belting 46
runs in only 44 balls.
  After his dismissal, wickets began to fall at regular intervals and they
were trotting at 180 for 9 but their last pair, Saiful Islam (15 n.o.) and
Sheikh Salauddin (8), batted well for a valuable 32-run partnership.
  Off-spinner Saleem Raza was easily the pick of the bowlers capturing
three for 31.
  Set a target of making just slightly more than four runs an over for
victory, UAE opening bat, Saleem Raza took off in blistering style
smashing 11 runs in the opening over off left arm medium pacer Anisur
Rahman.
  However, Saleem failed to last long and went out to a superb diving
catch by Mohamed Rafiq at deep midwicket off Khaled Mahmud for 20 runs off
17 balls.
  They then lost three quick wickets and were precariously placed at four
for 49 but a fifth wicket stand of 39 runs by Qais Farook (14) and Arshad
Laiq (31 n.o.) saw the score move up to 88.
  With the Bangladesh spinners bowling intelligently and backed by tight
fielding, the UAE batting crumbled and they were all out for 104 in 36.5
overs.
  Medium pacer Khaled Mahmud, who came in as a late replacement after
their regular opening bowler Hasibul Hossain was hurt during a training
session on the eve of the competition on Aug 5, was adjudged man-of-the-
match by match referee K. Srikanth, former Indian Test opening bat.
  "He fully deserves it. He broke the back of the UAE batting by taking
the three vital wickets to put his side on the road to victory," said
Srikanth.
  Off spinner Sheikh Salauddin bowled effectively to pick up three wickets
for 13 runs in six overs while left arm leg spinner Mohamed Rafiq bagged
two for 10 to trouble the batsmen.
  UAE, however, gained some consolation when Syed Azhar Saeed was named the
player-of-the-series.  FINAL - Bangladesh 212 (Shariar Hossain 58, Aminul
Islam 46, Harun-Ur Rashid 21, Saiful Islam 15 n.o.; Saleem Raza 3-31, Akbar
Rana 2-26, Arshad Laiq 2-35, Azhar Saeed 2-45).  UAE 104 (Arshad Laiq 31 n.o.,
Ali Akbar Rana 21, Saleem Raza 20, Quas Farook 14; Sheikh Saluddin 3-13,
Khaled Mahmud 3- 26, Mohamed Rafiq 2-10).

Hockey.: Yayasan see red despite victory

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

YAYASAN Negri Sembilan assistant manager Satwant Singh was an angry man
after his side's 2-0 win over Bank Bumiputra in a Malaysian Hockey League
match at the Tun Razak Stadium yesterday.
  Satwant's anger was not aimed at his players, who surprisingly struggled
to find the net in a match they dominated from start, but at umpire Surjit
Singh of Tenaga Nasional Berhad.
  The match ended on a controversial note when Mukesh Kumar was sent off
in the 67th minute after apparently hitting BBMB's Masrukin Kadiman on his
head with his (Mukesh) hockey stick.
  Mukesh and his teammates claimed it was an accident as Masrukin was
stretchered off with his head bleeding and were livid when Surjit thought
otherwise and flashed the red card.
  Satwant and several of his players could hardly contain their anger
after the match and stated what they thought of the umpiring.
  "I am aware that I can be hauled up for speaking my mind but this was
poor umpiring. What happened was not on purpose and I don't understand how
the umpire could have sent Mukesh off," said Satwant.
  YNS, who face Tenaga in a top-of-the-table clash next, will miss Mukesh
and also Maninderjit Singh and Satwant was furious.
  "I don't know what the umpire was trying to do. I leave it to others to
interpret it but something has to be done about the umpiring," said
Satwant.
  The red card constitutes an automatic one-match suspension. Maninderjit,
who received a yellow card in yesterday's match, misses the Tenaga clash
as well as it is his second.
  "I risk getting suspended by the Technical Committee but I have to speak
out as today's incident was daylight robbery," said Satwant.
  The controversial sending-off aside, the finishing of his players must
have also worried both Satwant and coach Stephen Van Huizen.
  Besides the two field goals through R. Shankar in the 13th minute and
Mukesh in the 50th minute, YNS missed one penalty stroke and 11 penalty
corners.
  In another match, star-studded Petaling Jaya Municipal Council (MPPJ)
returned to their winning ways when they edged Bank Simpanan Nasional 2-1
at the Petaling Jaya Stadium.
  MPPJ, who suffered a 3-2 defeat to defending League champions Maybank on
Saturday, looked lethargic throughout the match and needed a goal in each
half to subdue BSN.
  Forward Atul Kumar was the toast of the MPPJ team when he scored both
the goals in the 13th and 67th minutes.
  BSN, who did well despite losing 3-1 to favourites Yayasan Negri
Sembilan on Saturday, were again full of life yesterday.
  But for all their hard work, they only had a Sarjit Singh goal in the
59th minute to show for.
  BSN coach C. Paramalingam was obviously unhappy with the result.
  "But we are a young side. We will improve as the tournament goes on."
  In Ipoh, National player Kerpal Singh scored twice as pacesetters Tenaga
Nasional Berhad destroyed Armed Forces Electrical, Mechanical Engineering
Corps (JLJ) 4-1 to stretch their unbeaten run to three matches at the
Azlan Shah Stadium yesterday.
  It took Tenaga 30 minutes to breach the JLJ defence off a penalty
corner. The ball hit an onrushing JLJ defender and Kerpal was at the right
place to slot it home.
  Hardly three minutes after the break Tenaga increased their lead to 2-0
when ex-national player S. Sivabalan scored off a penalty stroke.
  Two minutes later, they were three up. Mahinder Singh scored off a move
initiated by Nor Basni Abas.
  Kerpal struck again in the 47th minute to stretch their lead to 4-0.
  However, JLJ never gave up and were rewarded with a consolation goal in
the 69th minute through former National player Zainal Hussain.
  In Kuantan, DeTas needed an Azman Ariffin goal in the 50th minute to
beat Segambut Hockey Club 1-0 at the Kuantan Hockey Stadium yesterday.
  DeTas controlled the game but could not capitalise on their chances.
They had 11 penalty corners, compared to one for Segambut, but failed to
convert any.
  Segambut's defence put up a brilliant performance and their goalkeeper
Jasvinder Singh was in top form.STANDINGS

Women's soccer.: Sabah favourite for title

Climbathon.: Salagan's hat-trick

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

DEFENDING champion Guainus Salagan coasted to an easy win in the men's
category of the 10th Malaysia Airlines-Mount Kinabalu international
climbathon, to notch a hat-trick of the title in Kota Kinabalu yesterday.
  With the exception of Indonesian Yoseph Lawa Yohanes, who finished
second, the top 10 finishers in the event - which attracted 164 entries
including 17 foreign competitors - were Malaysian runners.
  The climbathon is a race up and down Mt Kinabalu, Southeast Asia's
highest peak at 4,101 metres, with the event covering a distance of
21.4km. It is jointly organised by the Sabah Tourism Promotion Corporation
and the Sabah Parks with Malaysia Airlines as the main sponsor.
  The 29-year-old Guianus posted a time of 2 hours 52 minutes and 51
seconds to emulate his elder sister Hasny who yesterday extended her
winning streak in the women's category for three years in-a-row.
  First runners-up Yoseph recorded a time of 2:56:19 while self-employed
Rodimin Sodundu finished third with a time of 2:56:57.
  Guianus, who finished 82nd from a field of 160 international runners in
the recent World Mountain Race in Austria, received US$4,500 (RM11,250)
and a return air-ticket to London.
  The father of a three-year-old son also received a bonus of US$1,000 for
being the first to reach the summit.

Badminton.: Fancied Roslin too good for off-form Lo

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By J. Naidu

TOP SEED Roslin Hashim had no trouble winning the men's singles crown in
the Proton-EON Kedah Open badminton championships at the ASRC Hall in Alor
Star last night.
  He beat an off-form Lo Ah Heng, the 1995 All-England semifinalist, 15-5,
15-11.
  The small crowd which turned out last night were totally disappointed
with the token resistance provided by Lo and Roslin was in full control
from start to finish.
  In the first game, he took four straight points in one service. After
that, it was one-way traffic with Roslin collecting his points with
pinpoint smashes and drop-shots to wrap up the game in just 16 minutes.
  Lo checked himself and led 6-2 in the second game but Roslin caught up
at 6-6 and romped home an easy winner in 26 minutes.
  This is his fourth win in the circuit. Roslin was champion in the Sabah,
Perlis and Johor Opens.
  The men's doubles final between the top seeds Lee Wan Wah and Choong Tan
Fook against second seeds Rosman Razak and Chew Choon Eng proved to be the
best tie of the night.
  After 72 gruelling minutes, Lee-Choong triumphed 8-15, 15-8, 18-14.
  In the women's singles final, second seed Norashikin Amin played a cool
and calculated game to upset top seed Geevien Saha 11-6, 11-3 in 23
minutes.
  The women's doubles final also saw topseeds Kuak Seiok Choon and
Norashikin Amin upset by second seeds Lim Pek Siah and Chor Hooi Yee. Pek
Siah and Hooi Yee gave a sterling performance to beat their opponents 15-
10, 15-4.  
RESULTS (all finals) - MEN - Singles: Roslin Hashim (Kel) bt Lo Ah Heng
(Mal) 15-5, 15-11.
  Doubles: Lee Wan Wah-Choong Tan Fook (Pk-Joh) bt Rosman Razak-Chew Choon
Eng (NS-Pg) 8-15, 15-8, 18-14.
  BOYS - Singles: James Chua (Sar) bt Yeoh Kay Bin (Pk) 15-4, 15-11.
  Doubles: Yap Wee Meng-Tang Soo Sen (KL-Pah) bt James Chua-Chan Chong
Ming (Sar-Sel) 15-10, 15-7.
  WOMEN - Singles: Norashikin Amin (KL) bt Geevien Saha (Sel) 11-6, 11-3.
  Doubles: Lim Pek Siah-Chor Hooi Yee (Pk-Ked) bt Kuak Seiok Choon-
Norashikin Amin (Pg-KL) 15-10, 15-4.
  GIRLS - Singles: Ng Mee Fen (KL) bt Law Pei Pei (Kel) 2-11, 12-9, 11-2.
  MIXED DOUBLES: Tan Kim Her-Angeline (Pg) bt Pang Cheh Chiang-Kuak Seiok
Choon (Mal-Pg) 15-9, 9-15, 15-8.

Soccer.: Chow tells youngsters to prove their worth

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 48

By Vijesh Rai

DESTINED to miss the Malaysia Cup for the fourth consecutive time, Kuala
Lumpur aim to prove that their season has not been a total waste when
Premier League action resumes on Saturday.
  So far it has been a season where the bad things have far outweighed the
good things, starting with the failure to land three Indonesian players,
the poor performance of players on whom KL had placed much hope on, right
to the sacking of Azrul Amri Burhan and Wong Kah Loon.
  But in coach Chow Kwai Lam, KL have a fighter who will not allow his
boys to surrender until the final whistle is blown on Oct 19 - KL's last
match of the season against Terengganu.
  "I know that we are almost out of the running as we have dropped too
many points and are far adrift of the others," said Chow.
  Far is the right word as KL, above only Kelantan in the standings, have
collected a meagre 13 points from the 20 matches they have played.
  Mathematically, they are still in with a chance but Chow knows that
their fate doesn't only depend on how they do in the remaining matches as
the performances of several other teams too will decide whether KL make
the Malaysia Cup.
  "The boys know that we are looking at missing the Malaysia Cup again but
I have told them that we have to continue fighting," said Chow.
  What Chow wants them to do in the remaining matches is to prove that
they are worthy of being called professional footballers.
  "They must go out and show that they are capable of making the grade and
that KL can again be a team to be reckoned with," said Chow.
  But for that to happen, there must be more commitment as this is
something which has been lacking in several players.
  "I have been stressing to them that good performances will not only
benefit the team but individually as well," said Chow.
  Indications are that several KL-bred players, who left the team for
greener pastures, might return next year and this is bound to create a
rivalry for places.
  And for those who are still keen on playing for the city side again next
season, good and committed performances in the remaining matches will help
them when their contracts come up for renewal.
  "All I want from them is a fighting performance that will show that KL
may be down this season but in time, we will rise again," said Chow.

Letter from Moscow: Enthralled by the change in seasons and fortunes

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 12

By Vadim Potapov

TO tell you the truth, all the shopping for our family is usually done by
my wife. Actually, it's not a difficult task, as Moscow shops are nowadays
full of whatever you may want, even such exotic items as shark's fins,
giant lobsters and abalone. Prices bite, as we say, but that's another
issue.
  Yesterday, however, quite unexpectedly for myself, I made a small
contribution towards the family's shopping: I bought five packs of
detergent for cleaning irons ... I must confess that I've never before
even heard about such a thing.
  It so happened that while leaving the metro, I noticed an elderly well-
dressed man. He was a retail trader and was selling all kinds of stuff.
  His appearance was so unusual for a tradesman that I decided to talk to
the man.
  His name was Nikolai Ivanovich, he was retired, and before that he had
been a scholar in the field of mathematics. He became involved in retail
trade because his pension was too small.
  I felt sorry for him, and that's how I found myself an owner of five
packs of the detergent.
  By the way, the sum I paid for the purchase was equal to one US dollar,
and I can't even imagine how many such packs it would be necessary to sell
in order to earn one's living.
  Today, in Russia, it is believed that the market has put everything in
proper perspective.
  This is true to a certain extent, but there are many people who failed
to find their places in this new life.
  The government is trying to render assistance to poor and old, but its
reserves are hardly considerable for the given purpose. Its main goal now
is to collect as many taxes as possible.
  For the first two weeks of this month, this issue was widely discussed
by top government officials.
  Trying to increase critically small budget revenues, the government
prepared a presidential decree allowing tax authorities to levy taxes on
all payments into individual bank accounts.
  The step could lead to double taxation for simply shifting money from
one account to another, and that's why the news immediately caused a wave
of public indignation.
  The decree was adopted mainly because of Alexandr Livshits, the new
Minister of Finance and a former chief economic adviser to Boris Yeltsin.
  Livshits became a well-known personality in Russia for his revenue-
rising measures and frequent appearances on TV screen.
  Earlier this year, he revealed and made public that directors of big
state enterprises - instead of paying wages to workers - deposited the
money to commercial banks, gaining high interests.
  Then Livshit's revelations caused no negative reaction with the public,
while in the last case, the protest were obvious.
  "My salary is hardly that of a royal family member, and I am definitely
against the government's intention to collect taxes two or even three
times, and that's exactly what the implementation of this decree might
lead to", said Irina, a salesgirl in a large Moscow supermarket.
  Many ordinary people shared Irina's sentiments, and responding to that
tornado of public resentment, the new tax decree was cancelled.
  The promptness of that decision surprised the public just as much as the
absurdity of the decree.
  Early this month, President Yeltsin continue to surprise the Russians.
  This time he announced on TV that he had a heart problem, and would
undergo an operation at the end of the month.
  People were astonished as they were not usd to the president speaking
about his health himself, but many of them sighed with relief, as finally
the uncertainty was over and done with.
  Those, who just the day before scolded Yeltsin for his two-month absence
before the public, felt compassion for the man after his annoucement.
  "I do hope the president will return to the Kremlin in good physical
condition, even if it takes a long time. I really wish him complete
recovery," Olga, 26, a school teacher, said.
  Against the background of Yeltsin's lengthy absence, Kremlin security
chief General Alexander Lebed continues to strengthen his authority.
  He is a frequent guest on TV screens, and media comments on his every
word.
  The euphoria he causes today eclipses many other news, including the
information about the creation of a new political union, "For Truth and
Order".
  It was announced by Lebed's supporters that the new movement would serve
as a kind of supporting force for the general outside the government.
  Its creation belonged to Lebed himself, and its main goal now is to back
his peace initiatives in Chechnya.
  It is expected that Lebed soon will be elected as the leader of this
party.
  It is also reported that the three organisations that comprise this
party have branches in more than 60 of 89 regions in Russia.
  Thus it may serve Lebed as a good base if he is to make a bid for
presidency.
  Summer is over. I thought about it when I saw a man feeding two cute
donkeys with a large red watermelon.
  Piles of the fruit have appeared in Moscow along with the first signs of
autumn.
  Life goes on.

side by side with the Thais. And if we had a little bit of luck last
night, we could have won it.
********
THAVATCHAI SAJAKUL (Thailand coach): It's a relief we are still the
kingpins of Southeast Asia football. I've always said it was going to be
close and tough. But as I said again whoever scored first would have the
advantage. We did tonight and that made the difference. But Malaysia have
proven that they are now a force to be reckoned in Southeast Asia football
also.

Asean Football Federation Championship Cup (September 1-15, 1996 :
Singapore).: Soccer.: End of a fairy tale

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 48

By Dan Guen Chin

MALAYSIA  .......... 0
THAILAND  .......... 1

THE fairy tale had come to an end. A sad end for Malaysia on a night the
Thais were crowned champions of Asean soccer.
  For all their hard work and will to win, the Malaysians knew deep down
in their hearts that Thailand were by far the better team in the final of
the Asean Football Federation championship last night and the winner's
cheque of US$80,000 (about RM200,000) rightly belonged to them.
  Psychologically, Malaysia were affected even before the start. The
experience of Dollah Salleh was not there in the starting lineup to
provide the steadying influence in midfield.
  Dollah's ankle injury and the fear that it could not take the strain was
the reason why.
  And there was no place for Negri Sembilan fullback Faizal Zainal
although he had served his mandatory two-match suspension and was
available last night.
  For the Thais, there was a bonus in the form of skipper Surachai
Jaturapattarapong, who returned to the starting lineup - ankle injury or
no - for that was the tonic they needed.
  Right from the kick-off, the Thais went straight for the jugular and
they kept pressing forward, comfortable in the knowledge that their
attacking flair would pay off.
  And it didn't take them long either.
  Only nine minutes into the match, the Thais were ahead - and deservingly
so too.
  As wave after wave of the blue-shirted Thais charged forward, Kiatisuk
Senamuang - in his roving role - picked up the ball midway in the
Malaysian half.
  Zainal Abidin Hassan hesitated, so did B. Rajnikandh. Kiatisuk saw the
opening and, from 25 metres out, hit a tremendous shot with all the swerve
and power that beat Khairul Azman Mohamed all the way.
  There was no response from the Malaysians after the early setback, and
in all honesty, they could not raise their game to match the Thais.
  The Thais were in no mood to give the Malaysians the space and
opportunity to create their moves.
  Even when Thai skipper Surachai left the field midway in the first half
for Phitaya Santawong to come on, the rhythm of the Thai attack was never
out of sync.
  As Malaysia continued to struggle to find their footing and the form
which had taken them right through to the final, the Thais grew even
stronger and could have punished the Malaysians further in the 25th minute
but Apichard Teelamcharlemdit's attempt from 20 metres smacked the
crossbar.
  Even Zainal, who had hardly put a foot wrong throughout the tournament,
could no longer carry the burden of rallying his men to the team's cause
and neither could K. Sanbagamaran force his way through from midfield in
search of another crucial goal to turn Malaysia's fortune around.
  For the 33,000 fans gathered last night, and there were many Malaysians
among them, they knew deep inside who were the better team.
  It had to be the Thais with their fluent movement and the varied attack,
leaving the Malaysians with little to offer except maybe to wait for the
one silly mistake needed to punish the Thais.
  Even when Zainal abandoned his defensive role to push upfront; even when
Rusdee Sulong was taken off and even when M. Chandran came in Rizal
Sukiman, there was little likelihood that Malaysia could score from open
play.
  But the Thais did look good for another goal. And although it did not
come, there was no denying that the Cup was theirs for the taking.
  Malaysia gained some consolation though when Zainal was named the most
valuable player of the tournament after the final.
  MALAYSIA: Khairul Azman Mohamed, Zami Mohamed Noor, B. Rajnikhand, Azmil
Azali, Zainal Abidin Hassan, Rizal Sukiman (M. Chandran), Nazri Yunos, Yap
Wai Loon, Azman Adnan, Rusdee Sulong (Shamsurin Abdul Rahman), K.
Sanbagamaran (Faizal Zainal).

  Referee: Yoshimi Ogawa (Jpn).
  * IN the third placing playoff earlier, Vietnam came good last night
and, in doing so, made the Indonesians look so ordinary.
  Vietnam were one up in the 10th minute thanks to a cheeky back heel from
Huynh Quoc Cuong after Nguyen Hong Son had split the Indon defence.
  Vietnam went 2-0 up in the 27th minute when Hong Son's cross from the
right saw Indonesian defender Yeyen Tumena deflecting the ball into his
own net.
Indonesia pulled a goal back in the 65th minute from a Kurniawan Yulianto
shot from 15 metres out.
  But the Vietnamese dealt them another blow in the 76th minute after Hong
Son was brought down in the box and skipper Vo Hoang Bu made it 3-1 from
the spot.
  There was a brief fightback from the Indonesians after they reduced the
deficit in the 84th minute, from a wonderful goal put away by Aples
Gidgeon but it came too late.

Editorial: Bosnia votes to make or break

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 12

BOSNIA just made it in time to vote. On Saturday, the last day set by the
Dayton timetable, the international community narrowly managed to shepherd
the warring sides to the ballot box. It was Bosnia's brightest spot since
the Dayton signing last year. But plenty of hard feelings remain. Since
the Dayton implementation, all sides have been gravitating towards their
bastions and strongholds. Returning refugees have not been welcomed,
particularly by their Serb transplanters. Local mixed community elections,
such as in Mostar, have not been harmonious. Similar elections are due for
the rest of the country, with little cause for rejoicing. All parties
strike and parry and take postures - each looking to get what they can out
of the loose ends of the Dayton plan.
  Most of those loose ends could have been tightened by a more resolute
implementation effort. As it happened, Dayton's sponsors took too much for
granted after the accords' signing. They delayed the removal of its
biggest obstacle - renegade Serb leader Radovan Karadzic - and gave the
indicted war criminal enough freedom to push his own and the other sides
deeper into their nationalist corners. It is in the safety of these
corners that they have remained stuck, and where their votes will
eventually count.
  Disagreements about how sternly to treat the rebel Serbs have remained
to divide the Americans and Europeans even after the removal of Karadzic.
The Europeans never acted tough enough to purge the Serb leadership of his
supporters and their persistent calls for a separate Republika Srpska in
contravention of the Dayton formula. The Serbs were made to back down only
about a week before the elections. They have toned down their defiance,
rather cunningly calculating that they have a better chance of holding on
to ethnically cleansed territory (Dayton had handed them 51 per cent of
the country) by fixing ballot majorities than by showing resistance. In
the elections, non-Serbs returning to their former hometowns were
channelled to polling stations through specified routes, where many of
them found their names absent from the rolls. The shadow of ethnic
cleasing and forced eviction clouds the elections in other ways - more
than a fifth of the votes cast were the postal ballots of Bosnians chased
out of their homeland.
  Twenty-five years ago, the West pooled some US$60 million to help out a
Yugoslavia thrown on a limb by Marshal Tito's death. About four years ago,
their hastiness in recognising the independence of the Yugoslav
constituent states left the federation in tatters. The Europeans still
cannot see the difference between ameliorating and aggravating their
"Balkan problem," acting in two minds over the guilt of the Serbs in the
present crisis. Their dithering reinforced the Serbs' closed-in mentality,
justifying their acts of genocide and brutality on the grounds that the
rest of the world were against them. Although the holding of the elections
has been a qualified success, its results are anything but certain.
Bosnia-Herzegovina is too full of bad memories to cure its history in one
day. At best, Dayton will create something much less than a mini-
Yugoslavia - but at least Bosnia will survive, hopefully long enough to
heal its wounds. At worse, the institutional strings forced on by a weak-
willed international community will be pulled to breaking point - by a
Bosnia electing, rather than fighting, to carve itself up.

Letter: Artists as keepers of Malaysian national heritage

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Jane Hughes

DURING a recent visit to Malaysia, I could not help wondering if even the
best Malaysian artist could survive the constant bombardment of cultural
imperialism from the West.
  Television, cinema, advertising push us all towards an international
homogeny that is hard to resist. In the art world, this is particularly
dangerous as a nation's cultural heritage needs to be nurtured in order to
flourish and move forward.
  I have spoken to many Malaysian artists who think deeply about this
threat and grapple with the problem in their work. Most have trained in
the West or been taught by visiting Western artists. Some influence is not
a bad thing as long as it does not become exclusive. Artists must, and do,
strive to take only the best of Western influences while remaining firmly
rooted in traditional cultural ideology.
  So artists realise the danger and take their role as keepers of national
identity seriously but there is an even more insidious threat. This comes
from the patrons and general public to whom art works are offered. If
their tastes are affected by the call to ape Western styles, will they not
demand such art?
  Few artists are privileged enough to be able to ignore such economic
influences.
  There are two main courses of action that would help this problem. The
first is greater government support for the arts in general with more
consistent provision for presenting contemporary art to a wide public.
While some States seem to provide lavishly, official commitment elsewhere
appears to be less enthusiastic. Improved State funding would ease the
economic pressure on artists.
  The second course of action is greater promotion of Malaysian art
overseas.
  Although there has been a few forays by artists to exhibit
internationally, Malaysian art is still almost unknown in the UK and the
US. I feel certain that if westerners had access to more contemporary
Malaysian art, it would be applauded unequivocally. Consequently, as the
Malaysian public see how their culture is valued, it will encourage an
even greater national confidence that is essential to withstand outside
forces.
  Malaysian art is an excellent advertisement for the country and should
be given a more prominent role.
  Politicians should not forget that, ultimately, all societies are
remembered for their culture.

Letter: Desludging of septic tanks: IWK explains

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Mirza Mohamed Tariq

I REFER to two letters that appeared in the New Straits Times recently,
regarding the need to desludge septic tanks and sewerage rates. There
seems to be still many misconceptions about desludging of septic tanks.
  Septic tanks are settlement tanks and need to be desludged according to
their design. The Malaysian Standard (MS 1228) for a septic tank serving a
household of five people is two-metre cubic. These septic tanks are
designed with a settling basin with a retention time of 24 hours and a
sludge storage capacity of up to two years.
  Accordingly, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government's Technical
Committee on Sewerage Services has recommended that septic tanks be
desludged once in two years on an average to ensure that they operate
efficiently and their final effluents do not pollute the environment.
  If not desludged, these septic tanks will cause sludge solids to be
discharged into the waterways. Hence, it is not surprising that the
Department of Environment has identified domestic sewage as one of the
major pollutants of our rivers in every annual report.
  The sewerage rates for a domestic customer varies between RM2 and RM10 a
month and there are no additional charges for scheduled desludging.
Pending the outcome of the Sewerage Review Committee, IWK continues to
provide the scheduled desludging service and appeals to all customers to
co-operate and ensure that their septic tanks are desludged in order to
safeguard their immediate environment.

Letter: JB council's reason for failure to pay its debt is a real joke

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By H. Tan

AS a citizen from the State of Johore, and an old resident of Johor Baru,
I don't know whether to laugh or cry when I read in the New Straits Times
on Sept 6, that the Johor Baru City Council had failed to pay a debt of
RM100,380.67 to a music production house as a result of which the council
was sued and its premises, which has over RM100,000 worth of equipment and
other items inside, sealed.
  Failure to pay the debt, according to the council's secretary, was
"because of a communication breakdown". What will happen if the office
equipment and other items are sold to pay off the debt?
  Presumbly, the council's entire administrative machinery will grind to a
halt and the reason will be "because of a total office equipment
breakdown". What other jokes can the council produce to entertain us?

Letter: Arts or Science: Ringgit and sen is main issue

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By N. Sum

WE have heard calls from politicians and educationists to arrest the
declining interest of students in science and to make the subject more
interesting in class so that students would prefer to take up Science
subjects instead of Arts.
  But that is not the crux of the problem. It is a matter of ringgit and
sen.  At the end of school life and when the person starts to earn a
living, how much more can the former Science student earn compared to the
Arts graduate despite the extra effort put in to study Science subjects?
  The private sector does not call for more Science students as it does
not need scientists to sell a product or a service. So the banking, hotel,
tourism and trading industries, to name a few, do not need scientists.
Only in the Research and Development wing of the pharmaceutical, food,
chemical, heavy and light industries are a few scientists needed.
  In almost every country, it is the Government sector that employs the
largest number of scientists.
  Prior to the implementation of the New Remuneration System in 1992, a
A11 officer (senior timescale) earned about RM250 more than his junior A19
(timescale) officer.
  With the implementation of the NRS, the senior timescale officer is now
downgraded to a timescale officer. Not only that, within the same category
(Kategori IV), there are numerous grades according to the departments they
serve in.
  For example, in the Education Department, it is DG3, in the Agriculture
sector, it is G3, in the Science sector, it is C3, in the Economic sector,
it is E3 and so on and so forth.
  What is so demoralising is that with the implementation of the NRS, the
former A11 senior timescale officer may be earning a few ringgit less than
a former A19 timescale officer in another department. Particularly galling
is that he may have a Master's or a doctorate whereas the former A19
officer may only have a general degree (without Honours).
  Not only that, the system of salary increments to the P2 and P3 scales
from the P1 scale within the same category may see the former A19
timescale officer earning more than the former A11 senior timescale
officer.
  It is already bad enough that very often, junior officers are promoted
to higher posts (Kategori II) over more senior officers because of
favouritism. But to earn less than junior officers may be the last straw.
  Such is the anomaly of the NRS in the Government sector that mediocrity
is prevalent among the scientists; not that the scientists are mediocre,
(after all, they were the creme de la creme of their schools and their
universities), nor did they achieve mediocrity, but they had mediocrity
thrust upon them.
  For some of them, their talent in sales matches their talent in science,
and so they opt for the private sector. But to rub salt into their wounds,
the Government has stopped those in the teaching and medical professions
from opting out, citing their services are critically needed; yet at the
same time, treating them like bad step-children, to be punished and not
rewarded!
  However, for many others, (some have served more than 20 years), they
have no choice but to remain in the civil service until mandatory
retirement, since the private sector does not require that many
scientists.
  So, do not blame the parents, who only have the welfare of their
children at heart, if they advise their children to drop science subjects.
As it is, it has been stated that the country needs 10,000 accountants by
the end of the century, but has anyone said that the country needs 10,000
scientists who will be rewarded according to their work? Since the country
does not respect and reward scientists accordingly, how can scientists
respect themselves?

Outlook: Safety at workplace not for government to shoulder alone

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Lee Lam Thye

DEPUTY Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim launched a month-long
nationwide campaign on occupational safety and health on Sept 3 initiated
by the Ministry of Human Resources.
  This effort by the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health
of the Human Resources Ministry is being carried out with the objective of
increasing awareness among employers and employees on the importance of
occupational safety and health as well as to make OSH practices part of
our culture.
  Deputy Human Resources Minister Datuk Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir has
revealed that since the introduction of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act 1994, the number of workplace accidents has declined.
  He said the accident rate last year was 15 per 1,000 workers (117,231
accidents) compared with 17 per 1,000 workers (125,535 accidents) in 1994.
  But fatalities rose from 787 in 1994 to 1,167 last year.
  Now that the campaign has started, our industries need to re-assess
their safety and health practices, to see how far they fulfil present
requirements.
  In the final analysis, it is not only the awareness that we should seek
to promote but the palpable will to achieve the targets set for an
accident-free workplace.
  Employees and unions have a special stake in this life and death issue
and must assert their right for a high safety standard at the workplace.
  There is also a necessity for people to change to meet the demands of
industrial development.
  The most important change is that of attitude towards safety and health
practices at worksites.
  There is a need to remove the notion that safety and health at work are
the responsibility of the Government alone.
  It is not. It is a collective responsibility.
  In this respect the top-level management must prove their commitment and
adopt a pro-active approach.
  They should employ safety engineers, industrial hygienists and
occupational physicians and conduct occupational safety and health
programmes.
  Industrial accidents, including occupational diseases constitute a
serious problem. Apart from loss of life, injuries and personal suffering
to the victims and their dependants, industrial accidents also cause much
economic loss.
  Unlike accidents, occupational diseases are difficult to detect becuase
the signs take a longer time to manifest. The cumulative cost is
tremendous.
  Everybody loses - the employer, employee, Government and the nation.
Losses to property are quantifiable but human suffering is not.

Jitters over control by consortium

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 14

By Harris Iskandar Taib; Shareem Amry

PRIVATE waste contractors fear abuse of power, favouritism and
victimisation at the hands of the consortium that won the contract for the
nationwide privatisation of garbage collection.
  Klang Valley Solid Waste Contractors' Association president Francis Lai
said there was also no guarantee their services would not be wrongfully
terminated in favour of other contractors lobbying to take over their
existing contracts.
  "We are not against privatisation. What we are asking from the
consortium is that it liaise with us and let us know what the entire plan
will be like. At the moment it holds our future in its hands."
  The consortium, led by Hicom Holdings Bhd, and also comprising Malaysian
Mining Corporation, Konsortium K.K. Industries and Konsortium Consec Gali,
is set to take over the nation's waste collection on Jan 1 next year.
  It has set up a company called Eminent Flora Sdn Bhd to undertake the
project, and to date, has already taken over the dumpsite at Taman
Beringin.
  The consortium recently submitted a draft proposal of a new law
governing garbage collection to the Economic Planning Unit.
  New legislation is necessary not only to set national standards of
garbage management, standards now under the discretion of the local
councils, but also to award the consortium jurisdiction over all areas of
garbage collection.
  This includes collecting, storing, transporting, processing, treating
and recycling solid wastes, dealing with domestic, commercial, non-toxic
industrial and construction wastes and wastes from road cleaning, drain
and river cleaning.
  Lai said the association could offer some valuable suggestions and ideas
to the consortium if there was only an effort to consult them.
  "We do not want to get shortchanged by the privatisation programme. That
is why it is necessary for the consortiums and the Government to let us in
on their plans.
  "Some of us have invested a lot in machinery and equipment. Contrary to
belief, this is not a very lucrative business.
  "Therefore, if it is wiser for us to fold up now we will do it rather
than lose much more by waiting."
  Private sector waste collectors have been working on contract for all
142 local municipal councils since 1976. In the central and northern
regions alone, their investments add up to an estimated RM240 million and
they directly employ about 2,500 people.
  Alarmed by the privatisation exercise, private contractors formed the
association in December last year to put forward a plea to the Government:
Let us stay in business.
  In a letter to the Housing and Local Government Ministry dated July 16
this year, the association wrote: "We want our stake recognised so that we
are allowed to co-exist with the Government-appointment consortium
 ...Specifically, we would like to continue servicing the trade and
industrial community."
  Their stake can only be assured if legislation, currently being drafted
to make way for the privatisation exercise, states clearly that the
consortium will only handle residential waste and leave industrial garbage
collection to private contractors.
  The consortium is expected to allow private waste contractors already
servicing this industry a grace period before eventually being absorbed as
sub-contractors.
  Lai proposed that the consortium draw up a set of regulations and
principles that would allow the association to supervise and regulate all
sub-contractors on its behalf.
  He said the consortium should also include in the new legislation being
drawn up, a provision requiring all sub-contractors to become members of
the association before being allowed to operate.
  This would make it easier to regulate the operators, rather than the
consortium being left with the task of tackling every sub-contractor
individually.
  Describing the plans to take over every sector of waste treatment as
ambitious, he said the consortium should instead concentrate on opening
and managing new and existing dumpsites, the building of transfer stations
and incinerators.
  Some residents are unenthusiastic about changing the system for fear of
being at the mercy of the consortium.
  Said Bukit Bandaraya's residents association president Tunku Zahiah
Tunku Sulong: "Based on our past experience, we are worried that we would
not be able to address our complaints to the consortium as effectively as
we can to City Hall.
  "At least City Hall has shown that they will respond if we tell them our
problem.
  "When we have complaints about the cutting of grass in our area on the
other hand, which is handled by a private company, it is not so easy."
  "What happens when the contractors fail to collect our rubbish on the
designated time and date?" asked Petaling Jaya resident Ramlan Ismail.
"Does the new legislation allow us the opportunity to seek compensation
and damages?"
  Another houseowner was worried about the method of billing, fearing
there might not be a way to prove if the contractors were overcharging
him.
  "If we are going to be billed by the bin, this means every household
must keep track of how many bins of rubbish they dispose in a month.
  "What happens when our figures do not tally with that of the
contractor?"
  Perhaps the biggest question left unanswered in the project to privatise
the country's waste treatment system is whether the consumer will have a
choice of disposing the rubbish himself and so avoiding having to pay for
privatised services.
  One resident likened the situation to the privatisation of highways: "If
a motorist refuses to pay toll, he can still use the trunk road. Will we
have the same option?"
  Unlike the treatment of sewage, consumers have the capability and
resources to discard rubbish themselves as it involves no sophisticated
equipment and technical expertise.
  The present system makes it compulsory for consumers to pay for the
services as it is part of the assessment charges which also includes the
installation and maintenance of street lighting, drains and the cutting of
grass.
  But when charges for rubbish collection are taken out of the assessment
and the service run by a company instead of the Government, then the
service becomes more of an option.
  The new legislation is expected to address these issues, besides
proposing methods of how to separate charges for the collection of garbage
from the assessment charges.

Hanky-panky in garbage collection jobs

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 14

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Garbage collectors, who make low bids to get their
contracts, are cutting corners to ensure profits by hiring lorry drivers
and owners to do the job part-time but at the expense of the environment.
  The part-timers are dumping garbage indiscriminately as some don't even
know where the dumpsites are, people in the business said this week.
  The contractors' cost-cutting measures also ranged from not picking up
garbage as regularly as the contract specified, to the use of open lorries
instead of compactor trucks.
  "Some who win the contracts don't even own proper garbage compactors.
They haul the rubbish in open lorries, which is a cheaper mode of
transportation but very unsanitary," said Yamin Vong, group general
manager of the Sitamas Group, which also includes Conwaste Disposal
Services Sdn Bhd.
  Other private garbage collectors, who have been complementing local
council services since 1976, said these contractors were able to obtain
contracts from the local councils through low bids.
  "But they are not in the business so they don't even know where the
proper dumpsites are," said Hi-Tech Waste Management Sdn Bhd director
David Zon.
  "What happens is they just discard the garbage indiscriminately."
  With the average Malaysian tossing out between 0.5kg and 0.8kg of
rubbish a day, this has given rise to a number of foul, illegal dumpsites.
  But those in the industry claim that the contractors are not the only
ones to be blamed as the local councils are also partly at fault.
  There are allegations that some councillors who sit on the tender board
award contracts to companies owned by them, relatives or friends by
overriding the Urban Services Department's recommendations by a simple
majority vote.
  There are even accusations of councillors or politicians monopolising
the entire rubbish collection service within one district.
  "We know who they are, but there is no way to prove that these companies
belong to them because the permits are issued in the name of other
individuals," said one contractor.
  "What we know is that they collect a certain percentage at the end of
the month. Some politicians are also involved, lobbying for contracts
either for themselves or for their supporters."
  In some cases, allegations have also tainted the local council senior
officials.
  "Don't be surprised if the health inspectors, the council secretary, one
of the directors or even the council president has an interest in one of
the companies which have been awarded a contract for refuse collection,"
said another private contractor.
  When contacted, local authorities did not deny that their services fall
short of expectations, but said they were not professionally-trained to
handle the job and did not have the resources to compete with private
contractors.
  "This is why we need professionals to do it. Many of the people in local
councils today do not have the expertise to handle waste management,
because the entire rubbish industry is different today than it was 20
years ago," said Petaling Jaya Municipal Council president Mohd Nor Bador.
  "In the past, it was just a matter of collecting the rubbish and
disposing it. Today's urban services development involves recycling and
incineration. We are not trained to do this, and this will involve plenty
of re-evaluation."
  Mohd Nor said it would be unfair to say local councils were completely
inefficient in handling rubbish. Because of the lack of a proper system
and proper resources, he said, it would appear as if the local councils
were incompetent.

Concerted effort vital to maintain clean image of Langkawi island

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 18

By K. Bala

LANGKAWI, Sun. - Depending on the authorities alone to strive for a
constant clean image for the island resort is going to be a difficult
task.
  There must be help and concern from all parties - the business sector,
voluntary bodies, schools, sports bodies, political parties and the
layman.
  The District Council does carry out clean-up campaigns and invites
various parties to join them but these must be prolonged and not on an ad-
hoc basis.
  Hotels, particularly the bigger ones and other tour related businesses
do organise clean-ups in places other than their surroundings. But these
are few and too far in between to be effective. And one tends to get the
feeling that the outside clean-up is for media publicity.
  Sheraton Perdana general manager John O Shea is all for hotels to take
part regularly in such clean-ups by providing the voluntary manpower in
organised clean-ups.
  "A group of hotels and tour organisations can adopt a particular area
near their vicinity on a regular basis," he says.
  The hotel which opened for full business recently did a clean-up of the
Masjid Al-Hana and surrounding areas.
  Langkawi Village Resort manager Feisol Danker and public relations
manager for both Pelangi Beach Resort and Burau Bay resort, David Fong,
are also for the move for more co-ordinated efforts.
  "True, all the bigger hotels clean their surroundings and beaches daily
but if the other areas where our guests go are not as clean, it may negate
our efforts," Feisol says.
  Unlike major towns there are not many voluntary and sports bodies on the
island but the few active ones can play their part.
  For instance, the active Beach Hash House Harriers who have their run
every Sunday can adopt a particular beach to clean on the eve of the run
at least once a month.
  Kelab Puteri Langkawi comprising women in business organises an annual
charity event to raise funds for the needy.
  Its president Khorshida Begum said they are also contemplating getting
their husbands and children to take part in gotong royong activities
regularly.
  Perhaps the political parties particularly the BN component parties
which have large memberships could devote time to non-political activities
like clean-up of beaches and the town.
  The sector that has benefited most from the Langkawi boom are shopping
outlets in town, a few of whom were reported to have recorded a turnover
of more than RM1 million a month each.
  The least they can do is to employ workers if their own employees are
busy helping out in the business to clean up their surroundings of litter
and the clogged drains on a weekly or fortnightly basis instead of merely
complaining about the problems.
  This will sort of repay the island and community for the booming
business they have been enjoying because of the duty-free port status.
  Schools too can play their part in inculcating the clean habit from
young.
  Schools can organise at district level such activities just like they do
for sports and get the children to be involved with parental permission.
  All they have to do is pick up the empty cans, bottles, palm fronds and
driftwood without dirtying their hands too much.

Demand for inquiry into death of workers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 19

IPOH, Sun. - The Perak Information Network and Service Organisation today
called for an inquiry to determine the party responsible for the
electrocution of two factory workers at Sungai Kinta in Jalan Raja Musa
Aziz on Friday night.
  Pinso legal adviser M. Kula Segaran said the Deputy Public Prosecutor's
office should apply for a magistrate to sit as coroner.
  He said the court should also determine whether Tenaga Nasional, Ipoh
City Council or the contractor carrying out the road widening project was
responsible for the incident.
  The bodies of R. Arumugam, 32, of Taman Emas in Chemor and A.
Santhanakumar, 28, of Pokok Assam, Taiping were found at the river bank by
a member of the public who called the police about 10.30pm.
  Tenaga Nasional staff removed a live electric wire near a bridge which
was also being widened.
  Preliminary investigations revealed that Santhanakumar touched the wire
while Arumugam was also electrocuted when he went to his friend's aid.

A higher standard of cleanliness is needed

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 19

LANGKAWI, Sun. - Village elder Aziz Musa,77, told his teacher son, Kamal,
32, that the big porch in his recently built house on a piece of land he
had presented would be just another tempat ayam berak (a spot for chicken
droppings).
  Both father and son laughed, for the remark made in humour, is a common
happening in kampungs on this enchanting island where chicken roam freely
just like the cows and buffaloes do in the green fields and at times stray
on to the roads.
  With wooden homes giving way to brick buildings as the island awoke from
its slumber under seven generations of curse by as the legend of Mahsuri
had it some eight years ago, the chickens tend to wander into the cement
flooring and make their droppings freely.
  But the specks of chicken droppings can be easily washed away. Just a
little water and a broom, the droppings disappear only to reappear a day
or two later.
  Of course a fencing around the homes can keep the hens, cockerels and
the chicks at bay.
  But these days city folk rarely get to see live chicken in their posh
housing estates except for dressed chicken in the supermarkets.
  Anyway the kampung chicken is much tastier than those from the
commercialised farms what with worry over use of nitrofuran in chicken
feed.
  This chicken episode bears importance when one discusses the cleanliness
of beaches and the blue waters of unique and scenic Langkawi comprising
104 islands.
  Generally, the beaches and waters are clean except for some litter and
occasional temporary spots of dark patches in the blue waters or on land.
  Elsewhere there are muddy or dusty roads depending on whether it wet or
dry season caused by the airport runway extension works and the marina
project on reclaimed coastal land in Kuala Muda and the island-wide
digging to lay a modern sewerage system.
  When these works are completed in a year or two, there will be bigger
runways to accommodate jumbo jets, a marina resembling the Mediterranean
and a comprehensive sewerage system.
  The only problem with this price for development is that most foreigners
plan their vacations well ahead.
  As they drive or ride a motorcycle along the pothole-ridden stretches,
they do not know that all these works are part of the development plan for
the island and that they will turn the muddy beaches of Kuala Muda into a
paradise.
  There is therefore a need to minimise the discomfort unless we want them
to return home with wrong impressions. Anyway the authorities have set
some guidelines of late and there seems to be some improvement.
  For an international resort which attracted some 1.83 million tourists
last year, there should be a higher standard of cleanliness, not
withstanding the more than a dozen big signboards along the main roads
exhorting the people to "Keep Langkawi clean".
  Just as the porch of Aziz's home will be soiled after a period of time
if the chicken droppings are left uncleaned, the image of the island may
suffer the same fate.
  The chicken can get away at most with a shoo or by having a slipper
hurled at it but the island requires the authorities, the residents,
visitors and those involved in development works to act more responsibly.
  Talk at coffeshops and pubs - the latter being an attraction among
Caucasians who have managed to make the island their second home - tend to
centre on the rapid pace of development and the accompanying problems it
may face including mantaining the serenity and cleanliness.
  Their fears of over-development at the expense of environment appear to
have little basis given the repeated assurances by Government leaders and
planners that the tranquillity of the resort island would not be
sacrificed.
  That means the hills, forests, sandy beaches and clear waters which make
the island unique will always be there for these have made Langkawi
popular since it opened its doors in 1987.
  "Rest assured that we are not going to kill the goose that lays the
golden egg," said Datuk Abdul Halil Mutalib, the general manager of
Langkawi Development Authority recently.
  But the fears expressed at the coffeeshops and pubs should not be
dismissed totally. For what it is worth, there is need for vigilance to
prevent the island from following the less cleaner ways of Penang or Port
Dickson.
  At present, the island's beaches and waters can be considered clean.
  The District Council which is responsible for mantaining the island
clean can do better particularly in Kuah town where rubbish and clogged
drains are a common sight.
  With impending nationwide privatisation of garbage collection, the
council should ensure that the company responsible does a better job than
what it has been doing.
  Most of the white sandy beaches along Pantai Cenang, Pantai Tengah,
Tanjung Rhu, Datai and Burau Bay are without doubt clean simply because
they are fronts for many of the classier hotels.
  Just like the family which has to wash the chicken droppings, these
hotels diligently keep their surroundings including the beaches (which
belong to the Government) clean by deploying workers to pick up litter and
other debris washed ashore daily. They are more interested in getting
their guests to return.
  The problem is with the budget chalets fronting the sea. Their
managements are more worried about filling their rooms rather than to
spare a worker or two to clean the surroundings including the beaches.
  There is also a problem with the public beaches like certain stretches
of Pantai Cenang, Pantai Tengah, Pantai Kok, Pantai Pasir Hitam and Pasir
Tengkorak.
  There has been an ongoing debate as to who the culprits behind the
littering are.
  The argument by the council that it is the work of visitors seems to
hold water.
  For generally, the Malays from the kampungs have always taken pride of
their home and surroundings, however poor they may be.
  Of course, Malaysians have yet to learn to take pride in their
surroundings in their their own backyards let alone when they are out of
town.
  Surprisingly, visitors from Asian countries also acquire the Malaysian
habit. Perhaps they want to express their freedom after being subject to
stringent anti-litter laws back home.
  We too have anti-litter laws. There are signboards in various parts of
the island which read: Warning. Please do not litter. Fine RM2,000.
  If enforcement is lax then we should not put up such signboards as they
are a waste of money. Fine them irrespective of whether they are
Malaysians or foreigners and word will get around just like the jail term
for drink-driving which was first enforced here.
  The unique Pantai Pasir Hitam (Black Sand Beach) is among the tourist
attractions which draws a large number of visitors. At times one has
difficulty seeing the sand as they are covered with plastic and driftwood.
  After the clean-up by council workers it looks better but worsens until
the next spruce-up.
  A group of traders operates from stalls built by the Government beside
this beach. A little gotong royong spirit can ensure cleanliness of the
short stretch which is their bread and butter.
  But then they would rather be counting the till selling samples of the
black sand and other souvenir items to the tourists. They are thinking of
getting rich with little investment while the Government and private
sector spend billions to make the island a popular international resort.
  Another scenic public spot is the short stretch at Pasir Tengkorak along
the way to Datai. Several wooden huts have been built amidst trees for use
by visitors who enjoy the clear cool waters of the Andaman sea.
  There are at least six large litter bins in the area yet garbage is
strewn all over.
  Perhaps more garbage bins should be put up. But frankly the beaches and
towns could do with more and bigger bins to prevent over-flow.
  But there is hope yet to change the littering habit among Malaysians
judging from the cleanliness along the Pantai Kok during a recent visit.
  It is a popular spot among the young expecially schoolchildren from
outstation who come to camp at the site. It was refreshing to see the
beach clean though many schoolchildren had camped there during the recent
school holidays.
  Perhaps the observations of two foreign tourists best sum up the
situation in Langkawi.
  Petite Miharu Nishima, 24, and her sister Yasue from Osaka who spent
three days on their first visit to the island found the beaches generally
clean though they had some reservations about the situation in Kuah town
where they went shopping.
  "You have such a beautiful island. Please ensure that it remains this
way, beautiful and more clean," says Miharu.
  Educationist Terry Swanson from New Zealand was at Pasir Tengkorak where
he had taken his wife Gillian and three children for a dip in the Andaman
waters in a 4WD hired from the five-star hotel where he was staying.
  He decided to spend a week in Langkawi - of which he heard so much -
after the New Zealand Education Fair in Kuala Lumpur.
  Asked for his frank opinion about the state of cleanliness in Langkawi,
Swanson, who is Dean of the Faculty of Commerce at Nelson Polytechnic
said:
  "You have beautiful white sand beaches, warm waters that are not
polluted and an enchanting island. You have a valuable asset which needs
to be protected and nurtured.
  "The island is not at all dirty but (the situation) could be better."
  The island could be cleaner just like the porch after Aziz and his wife
wash away the chicken droppings. Langkawi can be a shining example to
others with concerted efforts on the land and sea blessed by nature.
                       

Pix: Swanson ... could be better.

Top Asian athletes among 3,000 for Terengganu run

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA TERENGGANU, Sun. - The Sept 22 Terengganu Bridge Run is expected to
attract some 3,000 participants.
  State Tourism Development, Arts, Culture and Sports Committee chairman
Datuk Aziz Awang said well-known Asian athletes were also expected to
participate.
  "Compared to the previous competitions, this year's response is
overwhelming," he said at a briefing for 700 tournament officials
yesterday.
  Among the international runners invited for the run are Myanmar's Thura
and Thinor, Chheng Piseh (Cambodia), Roy O Vence (the Philippines), Wong
Sai Wing (Singapore) and Mujini Ronala (Thailand).
  Indonesia will be sending its 15-year-old woman runner, Endang
Rahauingsih.
  India is sending its international woman runner, Sunita Godara.
  Singapore and Thailand will be sending the most number of participants,
with 250 runners each.
  So far more than RM225,000 has been collected for the run.
  Aziz said beginning this year the State Government had decided to turn
the 21.1km run into an annual event. Previously it was held biennially.
  He said each of the invited runners had a track record of less than 75
and 85 minutes respectively for the men's and women's categories.
  The run is jointly organised by the State Government, the Terengganu
Amateur Athletics Association, the State Youth and Sports Department and
AAC Sports Fitness and Recreation Sdn Bhd.

Police launch city-wide campaign to fight crime

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Prevention is better than cure... With this in mind,
police today launched a city-wide crime prevention campaign and urged
cityfolk to fight crime.
  Police hope the campaign would help reduce the number of break-ins
reported at homes and business premises.
  "Since 1994, we have received 7,613 reports of break-ins at homes and
business establishments," city police chief Datuk Ismail Che Rus said.
  There were 2,910 reported cases in 1994, 2,922 cases last year and until
last month, police have received 1,781 reports.
  Police investigations revealed in most instances the burglars gained
entry into the premises through doors and windows.
  "Of the 7,613 cases reported since 1994, this method of entry was noted
in 5,636 cases," Ismail said.
  Besides this, 770 cases showed the burglars had gained entry through the
roof while 247 cases were pulled off with the use of duplicate keys.
  Ismail was speaking at the launch of the Crime Prevention campaign at
the Sri Sabah flats in Cheras.
  The campaign was jointly organised by city police and the Kuala Lumpur
Housing Developers Association.
   Also present were city Criminal Investigation Department chief Senior
Assistant Commissioner (II) Zakaria Mohamad, Sentul and Brickfields police
chiefs Assistant Commissioners J.R.J. Raj and John Chong respectively;
Cheras deputy police chief Superintendent Asmaon Alias and KLHDA president
Mustaza Mohamad.
  Ismail said despite premises being fitted with window and door grilles,
burglars still gained entry using basic house break-in tools like
screwdrivers and crow-bars.
  "Very often, these grilles are of low quality material and can be easily
removed using these tools, he explained.
  He also advised property owners to ensure that locks are changed or
added when they receive the keys to their new homes.
  "Anyone, from the labourer to the developer, who handled the keys prior
to the owners, could easily make duplicates," Ismail said, adding that
police have identified the Cheras district as having the highest crime
rate.
  In view of this, police have intensified their efforts in Jalan Peel,
Jalan Menteri, Jalan Bendahara, Taman Kobena, Taman Maluri, Taman Shamelin
Perkasa, Taman Miharja and the Sri Sabah flat.
  At a similar function in Brickfields, Chong said police have identified
the Happy Garden, Taman Bukit Aman and Brem Park housing estates to focus
their efforts as these areas have the highest crime rate in the district.

Fire razes factory, two houses

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Fire destroyed a furniture factory and two squatter
houses in Kampung Michael Chen, off Km13 Jalan Puchong today.
  Factory owner, Chin Chong Yau, 40, said the fire, which broke out about
4.30pm, destroyed finished products worth about RM900,000.
  A Fire Services Department spokesman said the fire was believed to have
started at one of the squatter houses.
  "We have ruled out a short circuit as the houses do not have electricity
supply," the spokesman said.

Fire Services Department to get new name, responsibilities

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Fire Services Department will be known as the
Fire and Rescue Services Department by the end of the year, under the
Government's plan to widen the scope of its duties.
  Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh said his
ministry was preparing a working paper on the change of name and would be
presenting it to the Cabinet soon.
  Ting said this was the first time the department would be changing its
name since its formation.
  "The ministry plans to enhance the emergency and rescue services of the
department. It must be multi-disciplined and multi-skilled to keep abreast
with the rapid pace of development.
  "In fact, the department already carries out rescue work, in instances
when a building collapses, when there are landslides, flash floods and
road accidents. The Pos Dipang incident was a good example where fire-
fighters also carried out search and rescue operations.
  "The department also does work which has absolutely nothing to do with
fighting fires like helping detain mentally ill persons and catching
snakes."
  The Minister was speaking after opening a two-day International
Convention of Chung Shan Associations at the Concorde Hotel today.
  There were about 600 participants at the convention, which brought
together people who originated from the Chung Shan province in Kwangtung,
China.
  Participants came from over 20 countries to the convention, held for the
first time to discuss investment opportunities in Malaysia and to renew
old ties.
  Ting said between 20 and 40 per cent of the duties carried out by the
Fire Services Department had nothing to do with fighting fires. Fire-
fighters accepted the duties out of a sense of humanity, he said.
  On training for fire-fighters, Ting said the curriculum would be
revamped in line with the name change.
  "To my knowledge, however, their present training already encompasses
things other than fire fighting."
  Ting said a change in uniform for fire-fighters was also being
considered. He added: "We are looking at a design which is smarter and
more functional."
  Ting also appealed to the younger generation to join the department. He
said it was a risky job with very few takers.
  "There are also very few Chinese and Indians who want to join the
department as the economic boom has given rise to a lot of other job
opportunities."

Call for more biographies to be written on past leaders

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

KOTA KINABALU, Sun. - Chief Minister Datuk Yong Teck Lee said more books
should be written about past leaders so that their contribution to the
State and nation could be remembered.
  He said such books would particularly help the younger generation
appreciate the role played by these leaders in developing the State and
promoting unity.
  "The struggle of our past leaders ought to be remembered and appreciated
by the people," he said when launching an autobiography of Yang di-Pertua
Negeri Tun Sakaran Dandai at the Shangri-La's Tanjung Aru Resort
yesterday.
  Yong said books on other Yang di-Pertua Negeri such as Tun Datu Mustapha
Datu Harun, Tun Pengiran Ahmad Raffae, Tun Fuad Stephens and Tun Hamdan
Abdullah should also be written.
  The autobiography, compiled by former Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka director
Ismail Abbas and DBP staff Nadin Salleh and Japar Ungki, will be launched
on Monday to coincide with Sakaran's 66th birthday.

Spectacular dance contest

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 18

By Loo Kian Boon

AMATEUR and professional dancers of both the Latin and modern dance
disciplines came together to put up a spectacular dance gala when they
competed with one another for honours and glory at the second Malaysian
International Dancesport Grand Prix 1996 at the Mahkota Ballroom of Hotel
Istana Kuala Lumpur recently.
  The competition saw 74 pairs of dancers from seven different countries
in the Asia Pacific region competing in 10 categories.
  It was organised by the William and Luisa Danceworld, a dance school
opened by the husband and wife team of six-time Southeast Asia amateur
Latin champion and current Malaysian Professional Latin champion William
and Luisa Lor.
  The competitors, who came from Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia, were split into the Latin and modern
sections which both included the novice, pre-amateur, senior, amateur
Closed and amateur Open categories.
  Sixteen adjudicators from the seven competing countries were invited as
judges during the finals.
  The adjudicators, who were either former or current ballroom dancing
champions, were led by 14-time Australian professional Latin champion
Anthony Gauci and Tania McGuinness.
  Before the competition commenced, guests as well as the contestants had
the opportunity to purchase from an array of ballroom dancing shoes for
both males and females outside the dining hall.
  The competition then began with the senior modern section in which eight
pairs took to the floor in their smart tail jackets and elegant ballroom
dresses.
  After six finals had been completed, the dance floor was cleared for the
arrival of the guests-of-honour Tunku Dara Naquiah Tuanku Ja'afar and her
husband Tunku Mudzaffar Tunku Mustapha.
  The competition was then formally declared open by chief organisers
William and Luisa Lor, followed by the parade of the contestants according
to their countries.
  In his welcoming speech, Lor thanked all the supporters and sponsors who
had contributed tremendously to the success of the dance competition.
  "It is hoped that by hosting this championship, we would be able to
further raise the level of ballroom dancers in Asia and particularly in
Malaysia," he said.
  "This championship will feature some of the top professional dancers
from the Asia Pacific region, who will highlight this event with their
special performances."
  Prizes were then presented to the winners of the first six finals by the
organising committee patron Datin May Lee Leong.
  Among the winners were John Lim and Joanne Leong in the senior modern
section, Sharizal Zainal and Lynette Ow in the novice modern section, and
Ng Le-On with his partner Cheah Su-Ann in the novice Latin section.
  Talking about the victory in the novice Latin category, Cheah expressed
her joy of winning her first dancing title.
  She then admitted about being a little confused when she was announced
as the winner along with her partner Ng.
  "This win was never expected especially when the competition from our
rivals was so strong. It was difficult for us to anticipate victory."
  The win was especially sweet for Cheah because she almost didn't make it
to the final when she sprained her ankle two weeks earlier.
  "Let's just say God answered my prayers," she added.
  Ng, who was also the amateur Latin champion at the Kuala Lumpur
international ballroom dancing championships last year with Andrea Quah,
gave full credit to his partner who struck up a good understanding with
him despite dancing together with her for only three months before the
competition.
  As the dinner commenced, the competition continued with the amateur
Latin Closed and amateur Latin Open finals.
  Unlike the modern dance finals, the Latin sections saw a much a younger
set of dancers.
  Dresses worn by the female partners are more vibrant and sexy.
  Even their male counterparts discarded the jackets and instead went for
plain long-sleeve shirts.
  The tempo of the music was also switched from the tango, cha-cha and the
waltz to the hippier tune of jive, samba, ramba (the dance of the bull
fighter) and the romantic love dance.
  In between competition, guests were also treated to some rare
demonstrations of Latin and modern dance by some of the established
dancers in the region.
  Incidentally, most of them have been invited as judges in the
championships and they sportingly obliged by taking the dance floor with
their partners to give competitors a tip or two.
  Among them were undefeated Indonesian professional modern champions and
grand finalists in all Southeast Asia professional championships Soenarko
Josodihardjo and Jenny Indrawati, 12-time Taiwanese modern champions and
professional modern and Latin champions John and Jennifer Shih, and seven-
time undefeated Southeast Asia professional ballroom champions Melvin and
Nancy Low.
  The highlight of the night was the amateur Latin Open and amateur modern
Open, which saw international participation.
  The star attraction was the sole Australian pair of Adam Reeve and
Rebecca Allen, who amazed the judges with lightning quick movements and
synchronised routines.
  There was no doubt they were the true champions when they were announced
as the winners of both the Open categories.

MAS wins bid to stage road race

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

MALAYSIA Airlines won the bid to host the World Airlines Road Race or Warr
97 in Kuala Lumpur next year.
  Although Malaysia Airlines has been participating since 1990, it was
only last year that it won the bid against five other airlines at the
Durban WARR.
  WARR is the largest and the most popular airline sporting event in terms
of participants.
  Hosting the event is a honour for Malaysia as it is the first time WARR
will be held in an Asian country since its inauguration in San Francisco
in 1982.
  It is anticipated that about 100 airlines with an estimated 4,000
participants will converge in Kuala Lumpur.
  However, Malaysia Airlines will be working hard to create history with
the highest number of participants, about 4,500.
  Last Saturday, a team of 15 Malaysia Airlines athletes left for Atlanta
for the WARR five and 10km races.

New committee to hold meeting

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

THE Petaling District FA, under a new management council, will hold its
first meeting on Thursday.
  The meeting will be held at association (PDFA) president Megat Firdouz
Megat Junid's office in Kelana Jaya.
  Megat Firdouz, who at 27 became the youngest PDFA president, will chair
the meeting which is expected to discuss matters pertaining to the
adminstration of the association.
  But one man who is seen as livewire of PDFA is council member K.
Mukunthan, better known as Dass, who was largely responsible for Megat
Firdouz being at helm at the last biennial annual meeting.
  Mukunthan, a former FA of Selangor (FAS) staff and Selangor team
caretaker, is the link between the association and Megat Firdouz.
  He will be mainly responsible for the daily running of the association
with secretary S. Selearajan, a Fifa referee, and assistant secretary M.
Namasivayam.
  The meeting will see the appointment of the various sub-committee
chairmen.
  Megat Firdouz is expected to head the finance committee. Either Megat
Firdouz or vice-president K. Rajendran will take care of youth development
and rules, vice-president P. Mohan (competitions), vice-president Habibul
Rahman Kadir Shah (disciplinary) and senior council member Ismail Yaacob
(referees board).
  The PDFA is RM30,000 in the red and Megat Firdouz, who is also a Majlis
Daerah Petaling councillor, will shoulder the daunting task of putting the
association in the black in the next two years.
  The competitions committee will have to look into the three-division
league which has been poorly organised by the previous committee.
  It has to complete the league and start the FA Cup, which will involve
all 38 teams competing in the Super, Div One and Two Leagues.
  Besides this, the committee will also have to look at ways to raise
prize money for FA Cup champion and runner-up.
  Winners in tha PDFA League and FA Cup have not got their prize money in
the past but with the new council earlier promising to change that, the
association will have to start off with the current FA Cup.
  There has not been much development programmes for youths either. Though
PDFA has a team playing in the FAS Div Three, the team is in a shambles.
  It is time PDFA officials form a management committee for the handling
of the PDFA soccer team and participation in the FAS League.

Police urged to act fast against petrol bombers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

By R. Sittamparam

JOHOR BARU, Sun. - The Information Ministry has urged police to urgently
apprehend those responsible for hurling petrol bombs at the Royal Museum
and the State's RTM complex to avert repeat attacks.
  Its Deputy Minister Datuk Suleiman Mohamed said the incident should be
interpreted as an attack against the Goverment and that it was a very
serious matter.
  In the incident last Thursday, a youth on a motorcycle hurled two petrol
bombs at the Istana Besar, which houses the Royal Museum at Jalan Tun Dr
Ismail at 4.15pm.
  The youth, who was followed by two others in a car, proceeded to the RTM
complex and threw a petrol bomb at a guard house at the Jalan Tasek Utara
entrance about 45 minutes later. None of the petrol bombs exploded.
  The three then made their way to another guard house in Jalan Kolam Air
and smashed the glass panes of the guard house.
  It is believed that an RTM staff had received an obscene telephone call
during one of their live phone-in programmes on Friday, prompting RTM to
cancel all live telephone programmes.
  Speaking to reporters after officiating at the Malaysian Ex-Policemen's
Association's 24th annual delegates meeting in Skudai today, Suleiman
said:
  "The culprits should be nabbed as soon as possible as there is always
the fear that they will repeat the attacks.
  "The Ministry has received an initial report on the incident and we are
liaising closely with the police to keep in touch with the progress in
investigations."
  Suleiman dismissed the idea that the attack was linked to RTM's pro-
Government stand and selective programming.
  "Those who are dissatisfied with RTM programmes or its allegiance to the
Government can use the proper channels such as writing in with their
views.
  "RTM is not purely a profit making organisation, rather it also has a
social responsibility to fulfil, hence it cannot function like other
private stations."
  Meanwhile, district police chief S. Divakaran said police were
intensifying the investigation into the arson attack and were considering
several possible motives.
  Asked about grafitti on RTM's signboard at the junction of Jalan Kolam
Air and Jalan Tasek Utara, he said it was probably not related to the
incident.
  The word "Ria" was spray painted on the signboard. Ria is believed to
refer to the Radio Corporation of Singapore's Malay station "Ria 89.7".
  "We have not managed to uncover any clues so far but we hope to get some
leads from the findings of the Chemistry Department.
  "The department is presently analysing the fragments of the petrol bomb
and its components."
  Meanwhile, the Johor Security Working Committee conducted a thorough
investigation of Thursday's incident at the RTM complex today.
  RTM southern region broadcasting director Norzihan Mohd Salleh said the
probe was to ensure the premises would not be subject to a similar attack.

Three JB council officers told to explain

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

JOHOR BARU, Sun. - Three Johor Baru City Council senior officers have been
given show-cause letters pertaining to the council's delay in settling a
debt with a production company.
  Datuk Bandar Datuk Hashim Yahaya said the three had been asked to
explain why action should not be taken against them for the delay of
payment, resulting in the sealing of the council's office on Sept 3.
  Speaking to reporters after closing a property exposition here, he said
the officers were from its legal, administrative and treasury departments.
  On Sept 3, Jojos Production Sdn Bhd obtained a court order to seal the
council's office following the council's failure to settle a debt of
RM100,000.
  The amount was part of the RM200,000 payment due for services rendered
by Jojos Production for an entertainment show organised by the council at
the Dataran Bandaraya here on Jan 3, 1994.
  "Show-cause letters were given to the officers concerned on Sept 12.
They have one week to reply.
  "The disciplinary board will then decide what form of action to be taken
against them," he said.

Rakan Muda `promotes a healthy lifestyle'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Youths in the country should be involved in
activities like Rakan Muda as it promotes a balanced and healthy
lifestyle, 4B Kampung Selayang Lama branch chief Mohamad Ali Mohamad Odin
said today.
  He said youths were the future of the country since they would determine
the direction of the country's development.
  "The Rakan Muda programme launched today is aimed at ensuring that
youths do not fall prey to social ills.
  "They must realise that they are the country's treasure and that they
have roles and responsibilities," he said.
  Mohamad Ali was speaking at the opening of the Kepong Parliamentary
division's Rakan Muda Day by Youth and Sport Ministry's Parliamentary
Secretary Shahrizat Abdul Jalil at Sekolah Menengah Raja Abdullah.
  He also urged government agencies and the private sector to co-operate
with Youth and Sports Department in the various Rakan Muda programmes that
would be organised.
  He said this would help to prevent youths from being involved in
negative activities such as drug abuse and playing truant.
  Mohamad Ali said the Youth and Sports Department had identified a few
shopping complexes where Rakan Muda programmes would be carried out.
  Shahrizat, who was also the patron for today's function, expressed her
hope that the Kampung Selayang Lama community would take the opportunity
to ensure closer rapport among themselves.
  She said the programme was not only meant to prevent youths from being
involved in negative activities but also for the families to get
acquainted.
  Earlier, Shahrizat joined several residents in a 20-minutes aerobics
workout which was part of today's Rakan Muda activities.

Getting students to study nature at park

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

SHAH ALAM, Sun. - A joint educational programme between the Malaysian
Agriculture Park and schools should be established to help students learn
to appreciate nature, Agriculture Minister Datuk Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud
said today.
  He said such programmes would be beneficial to students at all levels as
the park was not confined to the study of agriculture.
  "There are a number of other fields that can be explored, ranging from
ecology, topography, biology and agronomy," he said at a gotong-royong at
the park organised by Esso Production Malaysia Inc employees.
  He added these programmes could also be extended to institutes of higher
learning for research and development purposes.
  Sulaiman said this would not only make the park more popular but was
also in line with the Government's efforts to instil environmental-
consciousness at all levels of society.
  Situated at Bukit Cahaya Seri Alam, the 1,258ha park is the world's
first Agro-Forestry park.
  As part of the gotong-royong project, about 70 Esso employees and the
park's workers helped replace broken planks along the jungle pathways and
clean up the surrounding areas.
  Esso also donated five safety convex mirrors for placement at strategic
points to warn road-users of on-coming traffic and 10 cement-ferrous
permanent garbage bins.
  In his speech, Esso Exploration Manager David H. Lehman said the project
was part of their community support programme with safety as this year's
theme.
  He hoped Esso's contribution would help make the park safer for
visitors.

Pahang to woo more tourists

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

PETALING JAYA, Sun. - The Pahang Government will implement a "development
strategy" for several potential tourist destinations which are situated
along the proposed East-West expressway, Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohamad
Khalil Yaacob said today.
  "There are three main corridors which can be further developed and
provided with infrastructure and other facilities, to attract more
tourists to the State.
  "They are situated in the centre of the proposed East-West expressway
which will soon link Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Terengganu via Kuantan in
Pahang," he said in his speech, read by the State's cultural and tourism
committee chairman Datuk Law Kee Long, at the launch of Pahang Arts and
Cultural Festival here.
  The three corridors are:
  * Highlands Corridor which comprises Cameron Highlands, Bukit Fraser and
Genting Highlands;
  * Middle Corridor which includes eco-tourism and agro-tourism
destinations like Taman Negara, Endau-Rompin, limestone caves, lakes and
other natural attractions;
  * Coastal Corridor which covers the entire 208 kilometre stretch from
Cheating to Rompin; plus
  * Railway Corridor which includes its stopovers at Mentakab and Kuala
Lipis towns.
  Khalil said the first three corridors would be developed along the road
networks while development activities for the fourth corridor would be
conducted along the tracks between the railway stations.
  "This Three-plus-One Tourism Corridor package will enable the State
government to increase its number of tourist destinations.
  "It will also provide socio-economic opportunities for the local
residents especially in the services and tourism-related sectors," he
said.
  Besides its legendary attractions, Khalil said the State also retained
such natural resources like its mountainous terrains, tropical
rainforests, flora and fauna, 208 kilometre-long coastline and tropical
islands, as its other tourist attractions.
  "Pahang is popularly known as Peninsular Malaysia's State of
superlatives. It can offer you a cultural experience and a chance to
explore the State's natural wonders and marine life.
  "With over 60 per cent of the State still covered with forests, Pahang
is proud to be in the forefront of making Malaysia greener," he said.
  Khalil said the State government was also in the process of gazetting
the Endau-Rompin forest reserve as a State Park, as another addition to
the State's list of tourist destinations.

Knockout tournament set to kick off Sunday

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

THE 5th Milo Unity Cup Under-18 soccer knockout competition at Jalan Timur
ground, Petaling Jaya on Sunday is expected to draw a good response.
  Organising chairman Mohamed Ariffin Hamzah said they were happy with the
response for the competition so far.
  "The response for the competition is good and we hope the teams will
show up early for the competition."
  Mohamed Ariffin said more than 30 teams have made preliminary enquiries
and are expected to participate in the one-day competition.
  "The last four competitions have been successful and we will leave
nothing to chance in our effort to make this year's competition better
than the previous years'."
  The annual series offers RM300 to the champion, RM150 to the runnerup
and RM100 to third and fourth finishers.
  The best players in goalkeeping, defending, midfield, topscorer and man-
of-the-match in the final will receive special awards.
  Besides, there will also be tins of Milo, Milo T-shirts and free drinks
for the top four teams, all sponsored by Nestle.
  Mohamed Ariffin said they were thankful to Milo for giving its full
support in promoting the game among youths in the Klang Valley.
  "The youngsters have not much action as there is no league competition
for their age-group. Thus, this kind of competition will be much welcomed
by the youngsters and parents."
  Mohamed Ariffin said that the FA of Selangor (FAS) could also use the
competition to shortlist players for youth programmes.
  Besides, Kelab Sukan Sri Indah is also identifying players to start its
own youth development programme together with Majlis Perbandaran Petaling
Jaya (MPPJ).
  The entrance fees for a team is RM50. For details call Rosnani Wahid at
03-2226960 or Sree at 018-8203185.

Team's dismal performance

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

THE national women's participation in the Kuala Lumpur Hockey Association
Div Three League is drawing a big blank.
  After three outings, they are right at the bottom of the standings with
no points, having lost all three matches.
  Despite the disastrous performance, the team is also taking a break from
the league for training stints and test matches overseas.
  In the previous three matches, it lost 3-2 to Royal Selangor Club, 3-1
to Bangsar Residents and 6-2 to Stamford College.
  And now, it has been reported the national squad will leave for Germany
on Sept 26 for training and test matches.
  A KLHA official said the performance and calibre of the national squad
was in question.
  "If the players cannot put up a decent performance against the Div Three
opponents, I don't see how they can be prepared to play test matches
overseas," said the official.

RM100m request to buy `naltrexone'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

KUANTAN, Sun. - The Health Ministry is seeking more than RM100 million
from the Federal Government so that it could implement the use of
addiction control pill "naltrexone" at the country's 28 dadah
rehabilitation centres.
  There are now 17,934 addicts being treated at the centres.
  Deputy Health Minister Datuk Dr Siti Zaharah Sulaiman said today:
"Curbing this social problem will top the ministry's main agenda until the
year 2000. We have to seek this allocation to reduce the number of
addicts."
  Siti Zaharah added that the allocation would be used in part to buy the
tablets. The rest would be for management expenses, she said after closing
the Paya Besar Innovative Day at a multi-purpose hall.
  From January to May, there were 1,022 cases of new addicts below the age
of 19. To date, 15,000 addicts had been tested positive for HIV and 40 per
cent of prisoners were found to be dadah abusers.
  The Government had to spend some RM517 million last year to curb the
abuse of dadah among youths and finance dadah rehabilitation programmes.
  Naltrexone is a narcotic antagonist, keeping heroin or other opiate
addicts off dadah. It works by blocking the opiate receptor sites on the
cell membranes, where the dadah takes effect. If a person on naltrexone
later takes in an opiate, it will have no addictive effect.
  Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said recently that the ministry had
conducted a one-year study on the use of the medicine on 176 addicts.
  The study, run by the Kuala Lumpur Hospital and Universiti Sains
Malaysia in Penang, showed encouraging results.
  Among others, addicts were able to stop their habit after a year of
treatment, he said.

Driving licence: Minimum age stays

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

LUMUT, Sun. - The Government has no immediate plans to raise the minimum
age of Malaysians to apply for driving licences as it is not an effective
solution to reduce road accidents, Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling
Liong Sik said.
  Raising the age limit will only pose problems for working youths.
  "Some youths enter the job market when they are only 16 and it will be
unfair to them if we raise the age limit," Dr Ling said.
  The present minimum age to hold motorcycle licences is 16, 17 for cars
and 21 for heavy vehicles.
  He said an amendment to the Road Transport Act approved by Parliament
last month made it compulsory for all new drivers to undergo a probation
period.

Ling: Spend quality time with the family

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

By Vijayan Menon

RAWANG, Sun. - MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik today urged
party members to spend "quality time" with their families.
  Dr Ling, who is Transport Minister, said the family was the basic unit
of the nation and called on MCA leaders to spend more time with their
families despite their demanding schedules.
  "When people are involved in demanding careers and have to work long
hours, they should endeavour to spend quality time with their families."
  He said it was not the quantity but the quality of time that people
spent with their families that mattered.
  "Don't just spend time sleeping while with the family but engage in
wholesome discussions, sharing experiences and relating to one another,"
he said when opening the MCA national-level Family Day Carnival at Sekolah
Rendah Kebangsaan Sinaran Budi, Kuala Garing.
  The family day was organised by the party's Selayang division.
  He quoted a Chinese proverb "If the family is united even 10,000
problems can be solved," to illustrate the importance of nurturing strong
family ties.
  Dr Ling said the family was not only the basic unit of the nation but
also the fundamental unit of society and "it is also the fundamental unit
of the MCA".
  Later when asked how family units could be strengthened especially when
there were more cases of single parents and career-minded people delaying
marriages, he said this was not serious.
  "It involves only a tiny proportion of society. In general, people are
dating young and marrying early. I think only about five per cent of the
population are marrying late or do not believe in the institution."

     16 Sep 1996, page 21

SELANGOR edged Singapore 2-1 in a veterans' friendly soccer match at
Yayasan FAS ground in Kelana Jaya recently.
  Selangor was represented by FAS officials and former State players while
Singapore was led by the Majid Arif XI team.
  The visitors' line-up included former Singapore players Syed Ahmad,
Majid Arif, S. Rajagopal, Hasli Ibrahim, Nasir Jalil, Razali Alias and
former Malaysian internationals Ali Bakar and Zulkifli Norbit.
  Selangor was led by FAS president Datuk Mohd Aini Taib, deputy president
Tengku Ahmad Shah, vice-president Hamdan Abdul Rahman and council members.
  Former Selangor players include M. Chandran, Syed Harun Syed Jaafar,
Mohd Shah Norbit, Rashid Hassan, Reduan Abdullah and K. Rajagopal.
  FAS secretary Kudus Abdul Karim, 60, was the oldest player on the pitch
when he played in the second half as a leftback.
  Selangor went ahead in the 12th minute through Mohamed Ariffin Hamzah's
header while Harun Abdul Rahman's half-volley gave them a 2-0 halftime
lead.
  Midfielder Baharuddin Manan reduced the deficit for the Majid Arif side
when his grounder from just inside the box beat Rashid.
  Aini gave away prizes to both sides. The prizes and dinner were
sponsored by Mohd Ariffin Hamzah.

`Study wage disparity between expatriates and Malaysians'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

RAWANG, Sun. - The Finance Ministry and the International Trade and
Industry Ministry should study the huge disparity in the wages earned by
expatriate profesionals and managers and Malaysians doing the same jobs,
Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek said today.
  Lim said some of the jobs currently done by expatriates could be handled
by Malaysians who he said were equally efficient.
  He said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had once
expressed concern over the disparity in the wages paid to expatriates and
Malaysians.
  "On my part I feel there are certain jobs currently held by expatriates
which can be handled by Malaysians. I personally know cases where jobs
held by expatriates can easily be filled by Malaysians.
  "Locals are equally efficient and capable," he told reporters at the MCA
Family Day Carnival.

Buddhist temple holds food fair

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 22

TO raise funds for its various ongoing community service projects, the Sri
Lanka Buddhist Temple in Sentul Pasar, Kuala Lumpur held a food fair at
the temple premises recently.
  As there was a sea of visitors, there was brisk business for all the 40
stalls set up by temple devotees and well-wishers.
  The fair, which was earlier launched by Bukit Bintang Member for
Parliament Dr Lee Chong Meng with a donation RM1,000, is expected to raise
about RM50,000 for projects like the Siri Jayanti free clinic, tuition for
poor children, annual food distribution to the poor, and visits to wards
and welfare centres with gifts.
  Lim Cheng Ean, president of the Siri Jayanti Welfare Organisation, said
the temple would use some of the money from the food fair to buy a kidney
dialysis machine and donate it to an institution.

Certain KL roads to have gazetted bus lanes

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 23

KUALA Lumpur City Hall is in the process of gazetting a few roads in the
city to have special lanes for buses.
  City Hall Urban Transport Department director Mahfix Omar said the
Federal Government had given its approval to the suggestion but City Hall
had yet to make the relevant changes to the infrastructure on the proposed
roads.
  The allocation of bus lanes will affect the current location of bus
stops, taxi stands, road signs and available space for road dividers.
  He said this after the 27th City Hall Directorate Day celebration at
Taman Tasik Titiwangsa on Saturday.
  As a trial, Mahfix said three roads would be gazetted to have bus lanes.
They are Jalan Raja Laut, Jalan Tun Razak and Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman.
  He said under the bus lane concept to be introduced, buses are not
allowed to go out of the designated lanes.
  "This is different from the concept used in other countries which allow
buses to go out of their lanes but not allowing other vehicles to go into
the bus lanes," he said.
  He said the concept was aimed at giving priority to buses to move faster
and also to discipline bus drivers.
  "The designated bus lanes are for the convenience of the buses to move
and also to discipline bus drivers from switching lanes or weaving in and
out of traffic as they like," he said.
  To avoid congestion in the designated bus lane, Mahfix said City Hall
planned to allocate one-and-a-half lanes for the buses.
  "It should be sufficient for the buses to overtake the buses that stop
to pick up or drop passengers."
  Mahfix said City Hall has received support from bus companies operating
in the city about the plan.
  Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif was reported as saying the
public would be invited to comment on the bus lane proposal.
  The proposal for designated bus lanes in the city was proposed for the
first time in 1980 but was later scraped as the authorities found it
difficult to implement the system.
  There was a move by City Hall to revive the 1980 plan in 1994 but the
result has yet to be seen.

Low cost homes for villagers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 23

THE Selangor Government, together with Bank Negara, will construct low
cost houses at Kampung Damansara Dalam in Petaling Jaya under the Projek
Perumahan Rakyat Termiskin scheme.
  State Executive Councillor Datuk Mohd Aini Taib said PPRT, a subsidiary
of Bank Negara, would acquire the land soon.
  He said the project would take off after minor details had been
finalised.
  "We are in the midst of finalising the terms and agreement of the joint
project. It is not easy as it involves villagers, the landowner and State
Government as well as PPRT," Mohd Aini said after launching the Petaling
Jaya Municipal Council's Bersih dan Indah campaign at the village
yesterday.
  He said the 10ha site housed more than 1,100 families, of whom a small
number were squatters.
  On the gotong-royong exercise, Mohd Aini said residents in the State
needed to play their part in ensuring their neighbourhood was clean and
beautiful.
  "Residents should work together to make gotong-royong a success. We want
to be aggressive in our effort to clean up areas, especially those which
are infested with illegal dumps."
  Mohd Aini said to further improve the rubbish collection system in
Petaling Jaya, it would have lorries collecting domestic waste and garden
refuse such as cut trees, twigs and plants.
  He said the council would provide the service which was chargable on a
fortnightly basis for residents.
  On the illegal video arcades, he said shopping complexes would also be
affected by the new ruling.
  "Our piority at the moment is to close down all illegal video arcades in
the State and concentrate on the legal arcades."
  He said the Government expected to shut down illegal arcades in the
State by the end of this month.

Video game machines seized in raid

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 23

By Angela Rao

THE Petaling Jaya Municipal Council confiscated more than 30 video game
machines from an illegal video arcade in Section 5, Petaling Jaya.
  The operation was the first to be held by the council after the Selangor
Government gazetted the Entertainment Enactment 1995 on Sept 1.
  The joint operation between the Petaling Jaya police department and the
council's enforcement unit hit a snag after three of the nine illegal
video centres visited were closed at 11am on Saturday.
  Initially, it was presumed that the operators adhered to the one-week
notice which ended on Friday to wind up their business but it was
confirmed later that many of the centres opened later in the evening.
  However, there was a two-hour delay during which undercover officers
from the council's enforcement unit monitored the activities of the areas
where there were illegal video games operators.
  The operation, led by MPPJ health department director Dr Abdul Rahim
Ahmad, caught the owner of a centre at Jalan 5/59 at Section 5 by
surprise.
  The 30 video game machines were then loaded into the waiting MPPJ
enforcement truck.
  Abdul Rahim said the operator, Rapi Permai Sdn Bhd had, applied for a
licence last August but the council rejected his application.
  "We will call the owner to our headquarters for further discussion and
let our legal department take over for further action," he said.
  Abdul Rahim said the operator who owned another licensed outlet in
Subang Permai, USJ, will be charged under the newly gazeted by-law which
provided for unlicensed video operators to be fined up to RM20,000 or
jailed for a maximum of five years or both.
  The operator will be the first video arcade owner in Petaling Jaya to be
charged under the enactment.
  The by-law covers all forms of entertainment including plays,
demonstrations and public performances.
  Licensed video arcades found to be operating illegal gambling machines
in their premises or failing to comply with regulations can be fined up tp
RM10,000 or jailed a maximum of three years or both.
  The council has given five illegal video operators in Petaling Jaya
Selatan 1, 2, 10 and 11, two in SS2 and one in Section 5 a week's grace to
cease operations.
  The notice expired last Friday.
  Abdul Rahim, who was assisted by the deputy superintendent of health
Ahmad Jaffar, is also temporarily heading the newly set up Entertainment
Licensing Unit.
  Health inspector Ong Poo Soong, public relations officer Norhayati
Sulaiman and her assistant Norshalizawati Baharudin were also present.
  The operation will continue for two months or until all illegal video
arcades are shut down.
  Confisticated items will be placed in storage at Kelana Jaya.
  Enforcement will be carried out phase by phase at legal and illegal
video and karaoke outlets in the township.
  Enforcement officers will be visiting karaoke centres for regular
inspections to see that the new rules are being adhered to.
  Under the new regulations, guest relations officers are banned from
working in the centres while tinted glasses will have to be removed.
  The council plans to call karaoke and pub operators for a meeting soon
to brief them on the new rules.
  With the gazetting of the by-law, MPPJ has taken over the licensing of
entertainment centres such as karaoke centres, pubs and discotheques from
the district office from Sept 1.

Fines reflect indifference to City Hall regulations

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 23

By Rosnazura Idrus

THE huge number of fines and compounds issued by City Hall for various
offences for the first half of this year show that the public is still
indifferent towards the rules and regulations set by the authority, Kuala
Lumpur Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif said.
  Referring to the increase in the total of notices issued and collection
of compounds from January to July 1995 and 1996, he said awareness of the
rules and regulations among city dwellers was still low.
  The increase in the collection of compound was not a good sign though it
meant an increase in City Hall's revenue.
  "Our intention is not to collect as much money as we can but more
importantly, for the public to be aware of the rules and regulations and
abide by them," he said.
  From January to July this year, City Hall collected about RM6 million
from a total of 228,042 notices issued compared to RM5.6 million from
251,346 notices issued last year.
  Kamaruzzaman was speaking to reporters after the 27th City Hall
Directorate Day celebration at Taman Tasik Titiwangsa on Saturday.
  According to the statistics, compounds issued under the Road Transport
Ordinance (Metered Car Parks) Federal Territory 1984 recorded the highest
increase compared to last year.
  For the same period last year, City Hall collected about RM2.32 million
compared to RM2.79 million this year.
  The offences under this ordinance include indiscriminate parking,
parking outside the gazetted areas and causing road obstruction.
  "The figure shows the public's attitude of flouting the law," he
remarked.
  The second highest in collection this year was from offences under the
Street, Drainage and Building 1974 - RM1.26 million.
  But this showed a decrease from last year's RM1.58 million.
  The Earthworks by-law 1988 which was enforced in April this year
recorded a total of RM229,730 in collection for 1,479 compounds issued.
  Offences committed under this by-law cover dirtying of roads by lorries
carrying earth from construction site, carrying uncovered earth on lorries
and overloading.
  Kamaruzzaman said to date the Enforcement Directorate only has 1,200
enforcement officers.
  "We are still short of 400 enforcement officers and we plan to recruit
more.
  "But even with this number, we are still able to be effective in our
enforcement," he said.
  During the celebration last Saturday, a total of 82 officers were
awarded medals and certificates for various recommendations.
  The highest medals Pingat Khidmat Terpilih-Kelas 1 were given to two of
the horse unit advisers, Datuk A. Rahim Omar and Dr Bashir Fateh Mohamed.

Silently Yours reigns again

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 43

By Go-Ram

SILENTLY Yours proved beyond doubt that she is the champion among the
mares and fillies in the Malayan Racing Association circuit when she gave
a repeat performance to score a back-to-back victory in the S$150,000 NSF
Breeders' Vase over 1200m (Race 5) at Bukit Timah yesterday.
  Partnered by Saimee Jumaat, the five-year-old New Zealand-bred by Clay
Hero jumped smartly and positioned herself in third spot early behind
Golden Eagle II and My Sweet Partner.
  Once the field swung for home, Silently Yours quickly headed off Golden
Eagle and pulled away from her rivals to win by 5 1/2 lengths from Fancy
Lady (Chavez). Third was Princess Fury (Lisa) third with Andy's Polly
(Yin) fourth.
  Prepared by Donald Baertschiger for Silent Stable, she returned S$12 and
S$5 (RM14 and RM6) for her fourth success.
  Yesterday's event was the seventh occasion that Perkhidmatan Usaha Tegas
Sendirian Berhad sponsored a race at Bukit Timah.
  PUT is a Malaysian-based company with a successful track record in
providing telecommunications and broadcasting services.
  Imperial Gold II, the likely favourite for the S$650,000 Singapore Gold
Cup on Sunday, gave a stunning performance to win his warm-up race for
Class 1 sprinters over 1200m in Race 9.
  Ridden by Oscar Chavez, the four-year-old French-bred by Funambule last
early made his move at the turn for home where he swept past his rivals to
win by a head.
  Imperial Gold, trained by Mohamed Yusof, paid S$73 and S$16 (RM70 and
RM22).
  The day's races started with a shock when Caro Lad upset all
calculations to clinch the Class 3, Div 2 event over 1600m.
  Prepared by Mohamed Ismail and ridden by Azhar Ismail, Caro Lad paid
thumping dividends of S$467 and S$67 (RM280 and RM45).
  Apprentices Lee Soo Hin and Brethem Tai were involved in a fall in Race
8 yesterday.
  Lee escape injuries while Tai has been sent to hospital for X-rays and
observation.
  The going was good for the first two races, changed to yielding for Race
3 and soft for the remaining seven races.

Betting on confidence in the New Year

Harnessing the energy he used on the campaign trail, the French
president seeks to reopen a dialogue with the people. He hopes
his confidence will be contagious.
In his New Year's message on 31 December 1995, President Jacques
Chirac promised the French a moratorium on tax hikes, a dialogue
on employment and a Europe more focused on social issues.
After emphasizing that "Europe is now more necessary to us than
ever," Chirac declared that he would push the European Union to
make jobs a priority, to be more attentive to daily concerns and
to do more to "meet the social aspirations" of the French.
Chirac admitted that the year-end turmoil could have caused some
to lose the hopes they had held upon his election. The president,
who was voted into office on 7 May 1995, said he would see to it
that such hopes were not dashed. At the same time, he paid
tribute to the "courageous action" of Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
In doing so, he bolstered the position of Juppe, whose reform of
the social security system--an institution dear to the French but
in near-bankruptcy--sparked the wave of strikes in key public
sectors, particularly the railways.
In late October, Chirac, a Gaullist who made the battle against
"social divisions" one of his campaign themes, chose to achieve
this goal by reforming government spending. Chirac aims to
decrease France's government deficit from 5 to 3 percent of the
gross domestic product by 1997--a necessary move for French
finances and a condition set in the Maastricht Treaty on European
Union for moving to a single currency by 1999.
In the televised message from his office at the Elysee Palace,
the French leader also promised to hold off on tax increases and
to intensify the battle against unemployment. In addition, he
resolved to lower obligatory withholding taxes, noting that he
had asked the government "to stop resorting to new tax hikes and
social expenditures and to lower these as soon as possible."
Juppe had already announced such a future moratorium.
A new tax, the RDS, or reimbursement of social debt, will be
instituted on February 1 to progressively bring down the $40
billion Social Security deficit.
Chirac also expressed his hope that 1996 will "bring a collective
commitment to adjust and reduce working hours, to encourage
employment and help young people get jobs." Unemployment affects
3 million people in France, 11.5 percent of the work force.
The president ended his speech with the wish that France "embark
upon the future with confidence, because it has chosen progress
and solidarity."

Financing peace

Following the signing in Washington of the interim agreement on
28 September 1995, representatives of the foreign aid community,
Israel and the Palestinian Authority met in Paris on 9 January
1996. The total to be made available to the Palestinian people by
the foreign aid contributors in 1996 is more than $1.365 billion.
Ministers pledged to give a new boost to the aid effort for the
Palestinian people and provide additional support for the peace
and reconciliation process under way in the region.
The participants expressed their firm intention to contribute to
the success of the peace process. According to the French
government, during the ministerial conference, "we have made
commitments. They must be translated into deeds." That is why the
contributors emphasized the importance they attach to the
elections due to take place in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on 20
January 1996.
The conference participants emphasized the importance of
improving the economic and social conditions of the Palestinian
people by creating jobs, improving infrastructures and laying the
foundations for sustained economic development.
In April 1995, the Palestinian Authority,  Israeli government and
the international community adopted a three-pronged plan of
action, designed to reduce the Palestinian budget deficit and
stimulate economic development. The participants welcomed the
signing of a new version of this agreement which takes into
account recent economic and political developments. The Israeli
government will support and facilitate Palestinian economic
development, while the international community has agreed to
contribute to the development of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The Palestinian Authority also emphasized the importance of the
basic investment program, adopted unanimously by the Palestinian
cabinet and presented by the Palestinian Authority at the meeting
of the World Bank's consultative group on 18-19 October 1995.
This program, which stresses economic development and job
creation, involves investments totaling 500 million dollars.
Investment projects include roads, wells, schools, hospitals and
water- and infrastructure-related projects.
The aid contributors demonstrated their support for the basic
$550 million investment program and other priority projects
presented by the Palestinian Authority, including the
establishment of industrial zones, the ongoing aid program and
financing of the current $75 million account deficit.
The total to be made available by the foreign aid community in
1996 is more than $1.365 billion. Furthermore, a number of
contributing countries will continue to provide an appreciable
level of aid in kind.

Cult alert

France was warned last week that more tragedies like December's
murder-suicide of 16 members of the Order of the Solar Temple are
possible, and the government was urged to keep closer watch on
cults. A parliamentary commission has urged the government to set
up a special body to monitor such groups.
The commission said cults had the potential to grow rapidly in
France. "In the light of the evidence, the state cannot allow
what many believe to be a veritable tidal wave to develop within
its core,'' the panel said in its report, released in Paris.
The report estimated that there are about 173 cult groups in
France plus another 800 smaller affiliated entities, and
estimated their total membership in France at about 160,000
people. It said a new watchdog body should be set up under the
auspices of the prime minister's office with doctors, legal
experts and sociologists among its members. Its role should be to
monitor cults in cooperation with the various ministries, inform
the prime minister of any developing problems and propose
strategies for handling potentially dangerous activities.
"To remain passive would not only be irresponsible with regard to
those who are affected (by cults) or open to their influence, but
a threat to the democratic principles on which our republic is
founded. It is thus necessary to act.''
The report appeared less than three weeks after the discovery in
a remote Alpine area in southeastern France of 16 bodies
belonging to the Order of the Solar Temple, a cult based in
Switzerland.

The Pope in France in September

Pope John Paul II will visit France in September of this year,
for the 1,500th anniversary of Roman Catholicism as France's
principal religion. The Pope will be in the country from
September 19 to 22, for his sixth visit to France. He will visit
the Loire valley, Brittany and  Reims. In 496, King Clovis
converted to Christianity and was the first ruler to submit
himself to the authority of the Church, giving France the
traditional name of the "oldest daughter of the Church."
The fifth underground nuclear test took place on December 27. The
energy released was less than 30 kilotons.

l'Evenement en bref

Last issue
The low-cost, full-color daily InfoMatin published its last issue
January 8, two years after its launching. Despite a strong start
with sales above 200,000 copies in January 1994, circulation
quickly dropped to 70,000 copies. It needed to sell 130,000 to
break even. One week later the major conservative French daily Le
Figaro celebrated its 170th anniversary.
Botton affair
The appeals court of Lyon handed down stiffer sentences than the
original court's ruling to the three principal defendants in the
Botton political corruption affair. Pierre Botton had been
charged with misappropriating $5 million from firms he controlled
and with making payments to former Lyon mayor Michel Noir and
current Cannes mayor Michel Mouillot to gain influence and public
contracts. The court gave the two mayors suspended 18-month jail
terms, and sentenced Botton to three and a half years in prison.
Popularity
President Chirac and Prime Minister Juppe enjoyed a higher
approval rate to begin 1996, according to the Louis Harris
polling institute. Jacques Chirac's job performance is considered
positive by 41 percent (up 13 percent) of the French while Alain
Juppe received a job performance rate of 34 percent (up 7
percent). Despite this improvement, 59 percent of the French
believe that the government is going in the wrong direction.

Popular and solemn

Former President Francois Mitterrand, who died peacefully in his
apartment at the age of 79 only eight months after leaving
office, preferred an intimate burial to a state funeral. A
military band played Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," the anthem of the
European Union that Mitterrand worked so hard to build during his
14 years in office, as the flag-draped oak coffin carried by
military pallbearers set out through the narrow streets of
Jarnac, his birthplace. Two hundred fifty miles away in the
nation's capital, world leaders bade farewell to the Socialist
leader at a requiem mass, with 1,300 French and foreign
dignitaries present in Notre Dame Cathedral led by Cardinal
Jean-Marie Lustiger.
German chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mitterrand's partner in more than
a decade of energetic European integration, wept openly in Notre
Dame and Cuban president Fidel Castro, one of 65 heads of state
and government present, also cried. Kohl, the head of state who
had met with Mitterrand the most, mourned "a good friend," adding
that  "Europe [had] lost a great statesman."
President Clinton said "the entire world benefited from his
strong and principled leadership,'' calling him a "man of
vision'' (see next page).
Before the Paris services, Mitterrand's Gaullist successor
Jacques Chirac met Russian president Boris Yeltsin and American
vice president Al Gore at the Elysee Palace.
British Prime Minister John Major and U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali were among the foreign mourners. "President
Mitterrand was a very big figure in European history. It will be
recognized in due course by history," said Major. Margaret
Thatcher, despite political differences, "liked and respected"
Mitterrand, adding that he "had become for the rest of the world
a symbol of the essence of France."
From the Middle East, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli
prime minister Shimon Peres and Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak
sat close to each other in the cathedral.
Peres, a fellow Socialist and old friend, said Mitterrand's
message was universal and reached far beyond France's borders.
Calling the late president "an unusual combination of culture and
justice,'' Peres said: "We shall miss him very much.''
In Jarnac, the town of 5,000 in southwestern France where
Mitterrand was born in 1916, a private mass was held in Saint
Pierre Church before Mitterrand was buried in the family tomb.
His widow Danielle, sons Gilbert and Jean-Christophe, Mazarine,
his daughter born out of wedlock, her mother Anne Pingeot and
former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas attended the ceremony.
"Adieu" was the most frequently used word in French newspapers,
many of which published photos of a huge public tribute at Paris'
Place de la Bastille held the day before, beneath a giant poster
of Mitterrand waving goodbye. Tens of thousands of supporters
laid red roses, the symbol of the Socialist Party, at the square
and outside the floodlit residence near the Eiffel Tower where he
died. Many wept in the square, a rallying point for the French
Left since the 1789 French Revolution, especially when American
soprano Barbara Hendricks sang "Le Temps des Cerises," anthem of
the 1871 Paris Commune rebels.
According to a poll conducted at the request of state-owned
television station France 2 and the weekly Le Point, Francois
Mitterrand was considered a "great statesman" by an overwhelming
93 percent of French citizens.
As the famous Edith Piaf song goes and as those paying hommage at
the Bastille cried, "Non, rien de rien, je ne regrette rien."

Death of Francois Mitterrand

Excerpts from a speech by President Jacques Chirac
Paris, 8 January 1996
"My dear compatriots,
President Francois Mitterrand died this morning. The French
people learned with shock of the passing of the man who guided
them over 14 years.
I would like not only to salute the memory of the statesman, but
also to pay tribute to the man, with his rich and complex
character.
Francois Mitterrand--his works. A great reader and lover of fine
books, writing for him was as natural as breathing. (...)
Francois Mitterrand--his resolve. The resolve to serve certain
ideals. Solidarity and social justice. The humanist message of
which our country is the bearer and which is rooted in the very
heart of our traditions. Europe, one in which France, reconciled
with Germany and working with it, would occupy a leading place.
But also a way of living our democracy. A modern, now calm
democracy, thanks in particular to the smooth changeover of
political power. (...)
In politics, Francois Mitterrand had first of all a profound
respect for the individual, and that is why he decided to abolish
the death penalty. A respect too for human rights:  he
continually stepped in wherever they were flouted. (...)
But it is, I believe, Francois Mitterrand's life which is
paramount. (...) He espoused his century. Over 50 years spent in
the center of the political arena, at the heart of things in the
process of being achieved. The war. The Resistance. The elected
offices. (...)
But Francois Mitterrand cannot be reduced to his career. He lived
his life more than to the full because he had a passion for life,
one which nurtured and allowed his dialogue with death. Life in
all its forms. Life in its dark and its glorious moments. The
life of the land, of our countryside, of that rural France he
loved so much, almost carnally (...).
Because he had a passion for friendship, loyalty to friends was
for him an article of faith, which prevailed over all others. He
aroused in return deep loyalties, through the years and trials.
My situation is a singular one, since I was President Francois
Mitterrand's adversary. But I was also his prime minister and am
today his successor. All this creates a special tie, which
includes respect for the statesman and admiration for the private
man who fought illness with remarkable courage, in a sense,
eyeing it with disdain, and constantly winning victories over it.
From these contrasting, but longstanding relations, I have
learned the strength of courage when it is backed up by
willpower, the need to put the human being at the center of any
project and the importance of experience.
In this evening of mourning in our country, I extend my feelings
of respect and sympathy to Madame Mitterrand and her family. As
Francois Mitterrand becomes part of history, I should like us to
ponder his message."

A dependable, yet independent ally

Mitterrand embodied the traditional mixture of solid fraternity
in critical situations and small irritants that characterizes the
friendship between France and the United States.
During his 14 years as French president, Francois Mitterrand
proved to be a dependable and yet independent ally to three
American presidents, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton.
The solid bond of longstanding friendship uniting France and the
United States was in no way compromised by political differences
between the Socialist French President and Ronald Reagan.
Mitterrand stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States
during the Soviet challenges of the early 1980s, the Gulf War and
the peaceful revolutions that ended East-West divisions, as
President Clinton recalled on January 9, two days before Vice
President Al Gore headed the U.S. delegation to the former
leader's funeral.
French support at the end of the Cold War proved to be essential,
as evidenced by Francois Mitterrand's key speech before the
German Bundestag in 1983 stating that "pacifism is in the West
and euromissiles are in the East" at a time when German public
opinion was opposed to the deployment of Pershing 2s. This
endorsment of American policy in Europe coming from the leader of
Germany's closest friend, a country long known for putting great
store in its independence toward the superpowers, had tremendous
impact.
President Clinton paid tribute to Francois Mitterrand, calling
him "a man of vision'' whose stalwart leadership helped end the
Cold War and unify Europe. "Not only France but the United States
and the entire world benefited from his strong and principled
leadership,'' Clinton said.
"I consulted frequently with President Mitterrand, as did my
predecessors, and greatly valued his insights, advice and wisdom.
He was a man of vision whose strength helped bring Europe and the
West through a period of tough confrontation to the peaceful,
undivided Europe we are building today.''
These sentiments were echoed by former President George Bush who
worked closely with Mitterrand during the 1991 Gulf War.
''Francois Mitterrand was a great friend and steadfast ally for
the United States. He was a man of his word, and I had great
respect for his intellect and his innate sense of decency. To be
sure, he was one of the great leaders of our time,'' said Bush.
"He laid aside the historic Iraq-French relationship to make a
point that aggression should not stand, that a bully cannot take
over another country, that one member of the United Nations must
not subjugate and wipe out the sovereignty of another,'' Bush
told France-3 television from his Texas home,  referring to the
Gulf War.

"We are the Mitterrand Generation"

It started 10 May 1981. That day, the election of France's first
Socialist president of the Fifth Republic marked the birth of
what would be dubbed seven years later in a reelection slogan the
"Mitterrand generation"--an age group too young to take a serious
interest in Valery Giscard d'Estaing's presidency and which
would, from 1981 to 1995, know one sole occupant of the Elysee
Palace--Francois Mitterrand.
For many, that May 10 was a cause for major celebration, but
others feared the Red Army itself would march down the Champs
Elysees. In 1981, its shadow still loomed large and the Eastern
bloc and the Iron Curtain were realities. This fear was, of
course, unfounded, but came from a generation which had grown up
with the Cold War.
The Mitterrand generation, however, over the course of time had
to reevaluate a large part of what they had been obligated to
learn to earn their baccalaureats: the Berlin wall fell, borders
changed, atlases become obsolete, the Soviet bloc fell apart and
the European Union continued to grow, despite it all.
These same young people witnessed major changes on the
technological front as well. The high-speed train (TGV) became a
reality in 1981, and Great Britain would no longer be considered
the "isolated kingdom" thanks to the Eurotunnel built beneath the
English Channel. The Mitterrand generation learned to use the
Minitel and, later, PCs, laptops and the Internet. Computers,
which made a limited appearance in lycees at the end of the
1970s, were suddenly accessible to everybody.
The Mitterrand generation contributed to the emergence of new
social and humanitarian causes. They gave money to finance air
shipments of rice and medicine to the starving in Somalia,
attended concerts by their favorite singers to raise money for
Armenian earthquake victims and rallied around the comedian
Coluche and his "Restos du Coeur" (see NFF 95-20, p.6) for the
poor and homeless.
  They witnessed the emergence of the suburbs as an entity that
felt the need to express itself--often violently. The children of
immigrants (mostly from North Africa) constituted an important
part of the Mitterrand generation, and SOS-Racisme leader Harlem
Desir became the spokesman for an integration movement that would
see the wearing of the Islamic scarf in the classroom become a
major issue throughout the country.
   In the arts world, the Mitterrand generation even had its own
Minister of Culture in Jack Lang. Rap music, which took root in
the surburbs, found its place on the official list of
"beaux-arts" thanks to Lang, whom they considered "incredibly
hip."
What lessons did the Mitterrand generation learn from its 14
years with the President? Maybe the acceptance of all sorts of
"cohabitation": pleasure and morality, show business and
humanitarian crusades, a Gaullist prime minister and a Socialist
president.
Toward the end of his second presidential term, Francois
Mitterrand stated in his own self-effacing manner," Just think
that for as long as young people aged 15 to 20 have been
politically aware, they have known only me. If I were in their
shoes, I'd be a little tired."

A lifetime serving France

Francois Mitterrand was born on 26 October 1916 in Jarnac
(Charente). His father was then employed by the Paris-Orleans
Railway Company.
After studying law, arts and political science at the University
of Paris, Francois Mitterrand was drafted into the army in 1939.
Wounded, taken prisoner and transferred to a camp in the middle
of Germany during the Second World War, he escaped successfully
at his third attempt in 1942. On his return to France, he
immediately joined the Resistance. Sent on missions to London and
Algiers-- where he was received by General de Gaulle -- he was
keen to return to Occupied France to continue the fight there,
which he did on 26 February 1944. In the underground movement, de
Gaulle appointed Mitterrand Secretary-General for Prisoners of
War, Deportees and Refugees. In this capacity, he took part in
the first Council meeting of the French Republic's Provisional
Government in liberated Paris on 27 August 1944.
In 1944, he married Danielle Gouze, whom he met in the
Resistance. She was awarded the Croix de Guerre at the age of 18.
They went on to have two sons, Jean-Christophe and Gilbert.
In 1945, Mitterrand joined the Union Democratique et Socialiste
de la Resistance (UDSR), formed out of various Resistance
movements. In 1946, he was elected Deputy for Nievre. He remained
a member of Parliament for this department until May 1981, except
for four months in 1958. He represented Nievre in the Senate from
1959 to 1962. During those 35 years, he held numerous local
elective posts, including those of mayor of Chateau-Chinon,
general councillor of Montsauche, president of the Association of
Mayors and president of the Nievre General Council.
During the 12 years of the Fourth Republic (from 1946 to 1958)
Mitterrand held office in several governments. In 1947, at the
age of 30, he was the youngest minister in a century. His
ministerial career was marked by a number of initiatives
heralding, starting in 1950, the decolonization of Black Africa.
In May 1958, Francois Mitterrand became one of the main
opposition leaders.
In the 1965 presidential election, he was the sole candidate of
the Left. He won 32 percent of the votes cast in the first ballot
and in the second, on 19 December 1965, when General de Gaulle
was re-elected, 45 percent of the electors voted for Francois
Mitterrand.
On 16 June 1971, at the Epinay Congress, Mitterrand was elected
first secretary of the Socialist party, an office he held until
1981. In June 1972, on behalf of the Socialists, he concluded an
agreement with the French Communist party and left-wing radicals:
the Common Government Program of the Parties of the Left.
In the 1974 presidential election, Mitterrand was again the
Left's sole candidate. In the second ballot, he won 49.19 percent
of the votes. Valery Giscard d'Estaing obtained 50.81 percent and
was thus elected.
On 10 May 1981, Francois Mitterrand won 51.75 percent of the
votes cast and became president of the French Republic. On 8 May
1988, he obtained 54.02 percent of the vote and was reelected
president of the French Republic. This second term ended on 17
May 1995.

Summary of articles previously published by News from France

"France is our homeland, Europe, our future"
Francois Mitterrand's steadfast commitment to a united Europe was
one unwavering point in his diplomatic policy. The president of
the Republic referred to the eventual unification of Europe as
the  the most important undertaking of our generation. This
unflinching will to serve Europe earned him the nickname
"Mitterrand the European."
--NFF05/12/95--
From the Cold War to a New World Order
During his long tenure as president of the Republic, Francois
Mitterrand had shown himself to be a loyal ally of Western
nations. However, his achievements in foreign policy are not
limited to the confines of the Continent. President Mitterrand
had never wavered in his convictions concerning the Arab-Israeli
conflict, declaring himself to be both a friend of Israel and a
proponent of Palestinian self-determination. The French praise
Mitterrand for the prestige that he brought to their nation on
the international stage.
-NFF04/28/95-
Fourteen years of domestic policy
Elected president on 10 May 1981, Mitterrand quickly left his
mark on French domestic policy through the abolition of the death
penalty in October  1981. During Mitterrand's first months in
office, important laws to protect workers were enacted. On the
economic front, the priority was lowering the inflation rate and
building a strong franc. When Mitterrand was re-elected in May
1988, he stressed political reconciliation and unity. In November
1988, the "minimum income for integration" (RMI) was created as a
safety net for those individuals who were not eligible for
unemployment benefits.

Fifty years in politics
Francois Mitterrand had a rich political experience before
serving two terms as president of the Republic. He was the first

president in French history. With the parliamentary victory of
the Right in 1986, then-Prime Minister Laurent Fabius stepped
down and a period of  "cohabitation" began with Prime Minister
Jacques Chirac. In 1988 Mitterrand became the first president to
be elected twice through universal suffrage.

Cultural advocate
Under Mitterrand's presidencies, education was accorded top
priority. In 1991, it was allotted for the first time in the
history of France, the largest portion of the budget, exceeding
military expenses. Speaking on the importance of education and
the transfer of knowledge, Francois Mitterrand said, "They must
be the permanent underlying fundamental preoccupation of all
political leaders."

Where did all the farmers go?

The farming workforce is six times smaller than 50 years ago,
according to a study published by the National Statistics
Institute.
The report emphasizes the dramatic change in farming with the
normalization of French agriculture which moved closer to western
standards through concentration, mechanization and education.
Ten million people were dependent on agriculture for their
livelihood in 1945. Farming households accounted for 2.5 million
in 1993. Young people and women in particular have left the farm.
Hence the farming population has become older and more male.
Thirty percent of the farmers aged 30 to 34 were bachelors in
1993 compared with 18 percent in 1978.
This decline in marriage is not offset by couples living
together, a situation that barely exists in the farming
population. In the early 1960s, almost every spouse was working
on the farm; 40 percent now work outside.
Concentration is the other major trend of the last 40 years, with
the average farming surface increasing from 34,500 acres to
87,000 acres. This was made possible by mechanization. The number
of tractors increased from 100,000 in 1948 to 1.4 million in
1993. Progress in productivity  also explains the fact that the
amount of working hours have decreased three fold, compared with
30 years ago.
Half of farms are specialized in livestock farming, 18 percent in
general agriculture and 12 percent in viticulture. The
modernization of agriculture and the generalization of modern
farm machinery have made it necessary to restructure by
regrouping parcels of land under cultivation, and mechanization
has resulted in greatly increased productivity.
The decline in the agricultural population has been encouraged by
the lowering of the farmers' retirement age to 60 in 1986,
resulted in the rejuvenation of the sector. Older farmers used to
work with their sons, who would subsequently take over from them.
This is no longer the case as retired farmers tend to leave the
land. Less than a third of retiring farmers are
replaced--generally by their sons--compared with half in the
1960s. Meanwhile farmers have become more skilled and educated,
as farming is now being considered a profession like any other.
   French agricultural production represents approximately 23
percent of E.U. production as a whole, making France Europe's
number-one farm country. Agriculture accounted for 2.5 percent of
the commercial GDP in 1993 and the added value of the
food-processing industry for 3.4 percent. The trade account in
the food-processing sector (raw materials and manufactured
products) hit 56.9 billion francs ($10.3 billion) in 1993,
exceeding by 3.3 billion francs ($0.6 billion) its 1992 record.
In addition, the trade surplus in food products reached 24.7
billion francs ($4 billion) in 1993, 4.8 billion ($0.8 billion)
more than in 1992. In value, France is the world's second biggest
exporter of processed foods after the United States.

Corsican dialogue

Prime Minister Alain Juppe set up last tuesday a new ministerial
group to work out social and economic plans for the French
Mediterranean island of Corsica but ruled out bowing to
nationalist demands for autonomy.
Juppe met parliamentarians from the island, rocked by 44 bomb
attacks so far in 1996 after 602 in 1995, and asserted that Paris
would reassert the rule of law in Corsica. The inter-ministerial
working group will submit proposals on Corsica's economic and
social problems. The prime minister indicated that "a
modification of the institutions of the island was not on the
agenda."
A few days beforehand, Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre paved
the way for dialogue between the state and Corsican nationalists
during a two day visit to the island. Preceding the visit, the
hardline "historic wing'' of the outlawed Corsican National
Liberation Front (FLNC) called a three-month truce in bombings at
a secretive news conference, with a show of force by about 600
hooded and heavily-armed men.
Following several meetings with elected officials of the island,
Debre stated "the moment has come to move on to a positive
dialogue." A dialogue should help "solve the three great chapters
of the Corsican problem ...The state will remain in Corsica just
as Corsica will remain in France," he reminded his audience.

Societe en bref

Vigipirate scaled down
From the implementation of the security plan "Vigipirate" on
September 7, to December 18, 70,500 people were taken in for
questioning where an eventual 21,540 people were charged with
crimes or misdemeanors, and some 2,324 were deported. In
addition, increased border controls led to 19,972 people being
denied entrance into France. The anti-terrorism plan "Vigipirate"
was scaled down earlier this week.
Ariane launches U.S. satellite
Western Europe's 82nd Ariane rocket blasted off into space from
French Guiana last Friday, putting a U.S. and a Malaysian
communications satellite into orbit. The launch capacity of their
new Ariane-5 rocket will be increased by more than a ton in the
next five years, enabling it to put two heavy satellites into
space simultaneously and meet booming demand for commercial
launches.
Babies
The birth rate continues to drop in metropolitan France, but
city-dwelling women (except those in Paris) have more children
than their counterparts living in the country, according to the
National Statitics Institute (INSEE). In rural areas, women are
having fewer children--a recent evolution, since in 1975 the
birth rate in the country was five to ten percent above the
national average.
Urban activism
Just before the announcement of the prime minister's plan to aid
the suburbs, SOS-Racisme and the National Federation of Youth
Centers (Maison des Potes) announced that a Conference on
Neighborhoods will take place on February 3 and 4. More than 300
urban activists will get together to try to find answers to the
problems confronting urban youths--juvenile delinquency, drug
abuse, housing and unemployment.

From Minitel to Internet

France Telecom announced last Friday its policy concerning the
Internet and the evolution of the Minitel.
France Telecom, which founded the world's first on-line service
with the Minitel, is confronting the stagnation of this service
and the arrival of the Internet which is rapidly becoming the
standard on-line service worldwide.
The company announced that all French citizens will now have
access to the Internet at a local billing rate (8 to 25 centimes
per minute) starting March 15 via their Transpac network. The
provider will pay to have access to Transpac (13,200 francs per
month per 400 subscribers) and will then charge its subscribers
the nominal fee of 25 francs per month, according to France
Telecom. Subscribers currently pay between 60 and 200 francs on
average per month, plus communication costs.
The service will offer e-mail, access to newsgroups, a navigation
guide in French, Internet access to Minitel services, and a
cyberspace shopping site, Wanadoo. The company's decision to
provide its own Internet service follows in the footsteps of
Lagardere, Europe on Line, and already well-established services
like the American firm CompuServe, which currently has 35,000
subscribers in France.
France Telecom's strategy is two-pronged--first, investing in the
Internet, and second, improving available services on the
Minitel, which has been a longtime fixture in many French
households. There are currently 6.5 million Minitel terminals and
14 million users. Aiming at this market, France Telecom has
introduced a new terminal, dubbed the Magis Club, which is eight
times faster than current machines and permits credit card
payments from home.
Francois Beneviste, president of the provider Calvacom and the
French Association of Internet Professionals, praised France
Telecom's decision saying, "It's an excellent measure that will
completely open up the market and make France unique in the
world."
The public operator took to heart the wish expressed by
telecommunications minister Francois Fillon last October to see
French citizens have easy Internet access that would be billed at
local rates. "We must make sure that new developments in
technology do not lead to a two-speed France and that our country
is not behind in the world development of the Internet," Fillon
stated. He praised France Telecom's steps to make the information
superhighway more accessible to all French citizens.

Coup d'Oeil

The French government has enacted a new law to give French
recording artists a chance against more heavily marketed U.S. and
British songs. The law requires that 40 percent of songs played
between 6:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. be of French origin.
Broadcasters risk fines or suspension from the air if they defy
the quotas, which are to be supervised by the government's
broadcasting watchdog. The law has drawn much criticism. French
singer Charles Aznavour defended the quotas saying, "I think it's
sad that we've come to this, but it's something that's become
inevitable, a question of cultural survival."
Archeologists said this past Tuesday they have discovered signs
of human civilization dating back 50,000 years in a cave in
southwestern France, making it the earliest evidence of
cave-dwelling humans. French government archeologists worked
secretly on the site in the town of Bruniquel for the last five
years. "Carbon-14 dating allowed us to scientifically establish
that a bone fragment dates back at least 47,000 years," stated
archeologist Francois Rouzaud. The cave is in the same corner of
France as the world-famous Lascaux caves, which house paintings
and engravings dating back to about 15,000 B.C.

REGION: SUMMIT ON REGIONAL SECURITY
SKIRTS DEMILITARIZATION ISSUE

     The Central American presidential summit held in San
Pedro Sula, Honduras, Dec. 13-15, 1995, ended with serious
disagreement among the six nations represented.  Costa Rica
and Panama blocked or modified almost all proposals having to
do with the military in the Treaty on Central American
Democratic Security--the major agreement to come out of the
summit.
     The signatories agreed on the principle of military
subordination to civilian control, free elections, and respect
for human rights by the military, among other things.  But
demilitarization of the region received scant attention.
     Since 1986, Central American presidents have attended 16
regional summits on such issues as economic integration,
sustainable development, tourism, social spending, and
campaigns against crime, illiteracy, and drug trafficking.
     The San Pedro Sula meeting was perhaps the most
contentious, in part because there is a wider range of
national policies on military matters than on social and
economic problems.  The military aspects of the treaty were
perhaps doomed to failure because neither Costa Rica nor
Panama have military forces, while Guatemala, with the largest
army in Central America, is still involved in a civil war.
     The theme of the summit was regional security, which
included a regional approach to such problems as public safety
and collective security from aggressors.  However, objections
from Costa Rica and Panama forced the elimination of some
provisions and considerable revision of others.
     Both the Panamanian and Costa Rican delegates arrived at
San Pedro Sula to press for armed forces reduction, but
resistance from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and
Nicaragua to anything more than a nonbinding commitment to
future reductions irrevocably split the delegations into two
camps.  Costa Rica and Panama objected to 11 of the treaties
78 articles and signed the treaty with reservations.
     Panama's objections were similar to those of Costa Rica
but with an additional concern that the treaty could
compromise its efforts to sign an agreement with the US
permitting US troops to remain in that country after the
Panama Canal reverts to Panamanian control in the year 2000
(see NotiSur, 12/08/95).  The draft treaty contained a
prohibition against signatory countries permitting foreign
troops on their soil, but this was struck from the final
version.
     Instead of force reductions and the gradual elimination
of armed forces, the treaty as signed only calls for a
"reasonable balance" among the military forces of the region
and a promise to work toward arms limitations and a "proper
correlation" between force size and national budgets.
     Costa Rican sources said that Foreign Minister Fernando
Naranjo objected to an article that calls for the creation of
a mutual defense mechanism to combat aggression within the
region.  The concern, said the sources, was that in making
claims to sovereignty over Belize, Guatemala could define that
country as a possible aggressor.
     "Costa Rica wants to be sure that the [treaty] content is
not...conditioned upon special issues that affect only some
countries," said Costa Rica's roving ambassador to Central
America, Luis Solis.
     Other objections were to articles that urged each nation
to take its constitution into account when setting budget
levels for the military, and to issue a report on the size,
budget, and expenditures of its armed forces.  Observers at
the summit explained that Panama and Costa Rica raised general
objections to these and other military articles because they
did not go far enough in requiring all nations in the region
to reduce the role of the military in national affairs.
     What Costa Rica wanted instead, said Solis, was a treaty
that emphasized nonmilitary aspects of Central American
security--such as public safety--rather than national defense.
Armed forces, he said, should be made smaller and police
forces given more training and a higher priority than the
military.
     Commenting on the lack of interest in demilitarization on
the part of his Central American colleagues, Naranjo said,
"They would not accept [our proposal] and we were not able to
endorse anything that had to do with military matters, unless
they dealt with reductions."
     Both sides on the force-reduction issue attempted to end
the summit on a note of harmony.  Costa Rican President Jose
Maria Figueres promised to continue pushing for force
reductions, "but we will do it in a respectful manner without
trying to impose our opinions and models on anyone," he said.
     For his part, Honduran Foreign Minister Delmer Urbizo
said that the contentious military aspects of the treaty could
be signed on another occasion without harming the San Pedro
Sula summit, which he said focused on the broader definition
of security as a response to social problems.
     "If the theme of military security is an obstacle to
having a successful summit, we will simply cut it from the
agenda and sign it later," he said.
     However, the differences in policy views highlighted at
the summit suggest that the signing of a comprehensive
military accord may be a long way off.  Though Costa Rica's
chief proposal was for the gradual reduction in the size of
armies, a more fundamental aspect of the clash of policies
lies in the differing concepts of the military's role in the
post-Cold War era.
     Col. Francisco Bustillo of the Honduran armed forces
general staff pointed out the changed historical
circumstances.
     "The role played by our countries was the one assigned by
foreign interests, based on a political-military thesis," said
Bustillo.  Now, "geoeconomics has been substituted for
geopolitics, and the political map is no longer drawn along
ideological lines."  Bustillo added that the present dangers
are not military but social and economic.
     Bustillo was expressing the conceptual foundation for the
argument that the military must be called upon to respond to
threats in the social and economic spheres.  By extending the
definition of national and regional security beyond
traditional notions of national defense to include social
well-being, military forces will continue to merit high
priority in national budgetary considerations.
     Echoing Bustillo, Nicaragua's Foreign Minister Ernesto
Leal argued that in this model for security, armies may be
deployed to fight against drugs, to support environmental
protection efforts, to construct schools and clinics, and to
respond to natural disasters.
     "The most important thing," said Leal, "is that the
treaty confirms the subordination of military power to
civilian power."
     Nevertheless, Costa Rican delegates were skeptical that
this confirmation will guarantee effective control of the
military precisely because the treaty "leaves the door open
for the armies to assume new roles."
     The delegates had less difficulty agreeing to an accord
providing for common action against auto theft and mechanisms
for the return of stolen autos recovered outside their country
of origin.  They also announced that they had signed an
agreement with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for
assistance in building a regional electric-power grid.
     But these accomplishments were not enough to head off
severe criticism of the summit.  The auxiliary bishop of San
Salvador, Gregorio Rosa Chavez, said, "The summit gave short
shrift to issues vital for true democratic security in Central
America," and he faulted the presidents for a "lack of
audacity."
     Other critics of the summit pointed to the demonstrations
that took place on Dec. 13 during the inauguration of the
summit as an example of heads of state turning a deaf ear to
social issues.  Seven demonstrators were shot, one fatally, by
unknown assailants.  The demonstration was organized to demand
an investigation into the shooting deaths by the police of
three campesinos taking part in a previous demonstration.
     The advisory committee on Central American integration
(Comite Consultivo del Sistema de Integracion Centroamericano
(CC-SICA) faulted the summit for not including representative
social participation in the formulation of the treaty.
     The president of the Center for Social Training (Centro
de Capacitacion Social) in Panama, Celia Sanjur, said that
"the lack of participatory democracy and the inability of
governments to satisfy the needs of the population" directly
affect regional security.  [Sources: Associated Press,

HAITI: RENE PREVAL WINS PRESIDENCY, NOW FACES
SERIOUS DOMESTIC & INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES (Part 1)

     In the Dec. 17 Haitian presidential elections,
Organisation Politique Lavalas (OPL) candidate Rene Preval won
a sweeping victory, taking 89% of the vote, according to
official results from the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
While voting was carried out without incident, turnout was
very low, at just under 28%.
     Although fourteen candidates participated in the election
to succeed President Jean Bertrand Aristide, the outcome was
never in doubt.  From Nov. 15, when Lavalas announced that
Preval would be its candidate, his victory was practically
assured, since an estimated 80% of the population are Lavalas
loyalists.  However, winning the election will likely prove
much easier for the president-elect than resolving Haiti's
social and economic problems.
     An agronomist who completed his higher education in
Belgium, the 52-year-old Preval served as prime minister in
Aristide's first cabinet from February 1991 to September 1991,
when Aristide was toppled ie been extended to make up for
the three years that he was forced to spend in exile.  Even
many among the Haitian elite and business community said the
nation's stability would have been better served by Aristide's
continuation in office.
     A wave of violence in the weeks preceding the elections
had raised questions about whether voting would actually take
place on schedule.  In an emotional speech Nov. 11, following
the execution-style killing of his cousin and newly elected
deputy Jean-Hubert Feuille, Aristide blasted the US and UN for
not disarming the country and urged the public to help do so.
     "If those who have weapons, those who have big armored
tanks, those who have much power, wanted to help us, the
disarmament would have been done," Aristide said.
     The president called on the public to collaborate with
police by leading them to suspected arms caches.  During the
following week, at least seven people were killed in
demonstrations and protests as people responded to Aristide's
call for public action.
     It was the first time since Aristide returned that he
veered from his message of reconciliation.  However, many of
his backers contend that, in practice, reconciliation has
allowed the supporters of the coup to participate in public
life and, in many cases, to remain armed.  Aristide's message
of reconciliation never had the support of the poor who
suffered the repression of the military and who saw
reconciliation as a synonym for impunity and continued
injustice.
     When Preval assumes office, he, like Aristide, will find
himself in the difficult position of trying to balance the
demands of his supporters with those of the Haitian elite and
the international community, particularly the US.
     "It is a great dilemma," said Harry Numa of the National
Popular Assembly.  "When Aristide tries to please the people,
the bourgeoisie and the US pressure him.  When he wants to
placate the bourgeoisie and Washington, the people tell him
no."
     The Clinton administration pushed hard for Aristide to
fulfill his commitment to step down at the end of his term,
since its portrayal of Haiti as a US foreign policy success
was riding on a smooth transfer of power.  (Cont.)

HAITI: RENE PREVAL WINS PRESIDENCY, NOW FACES
SERIOUS DOMESTIC & INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES (Part 2)

     However, US policy toward Haiti has been ambivalent at
best.  Although the September 1994 US-led invasion allowed
Aristide to return to power, congressional Republicans have
openly opposed the Haitian leader and Preval may face similar
difficulties because of his closeness to his predecessor.
     In November, the US Congress cut off US$4.5 million in
economic aid to Haiti because the government had not moved
forward with economic reforms, including several controversial
privatizations (see NotiSur, 11/10/95).  The World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) have not disbursed another
US$45 million for the same reason.  Even if Preval starts
negotiations immediately after his inauguration, funds will
still not flow again before summer.
     Sen. Jesse Helms, powerful head of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, freed up previously blocked funds for the
Haitian election only because it paved the way for the
turnover to a new leader and the withdrawal of US troops,
which make up a large part of the UN peacekeeping force.
     However, according to an article in the Washington Post
in mid-November, the US is considering staying in Haiti beyond
its scheduled departure date, citing the "inexperience" of the
newly formed civilian police.  On Nov. 30, Adrain Rameau, head
of the Haitian National Police, was fired following several
shootings that critics claim demonstrate the country's new
officers pull their guns too quickly.
     Another issue that will likely carry over after Preval
assumes office centers on the return of more than 150,000
pages of documents that were confiscated from the Front for
the Advancement and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH), a paramilitary
organization.  US troops seized the documents after the
invasion and then took them to the US.
     Haitian officials said that until now the US refused to
hand over the papers because it feared the information would
embarrass US intelligence agencies.  Washington does not want
to see leaders of paramilitary groups go on trial in Haiti and
"have it emerge that they were paid and supported by American
intelligence," explained one ves arrested by US soldiers.
     The Nation article also contends that weapons were
shipped to FRAPH starting in June 1993 despite the US arms
embargo.  The article says that US diplomats have used the
alleged power of FRAPH to help pressure Aristide's government
on broader political issues.
     Meanwhile, Constant plans to sue the US for US$50 million
for holding him in custody since April 1995.  Constant's
attorneys said he was seeking damages from the government for
"wrongful incarceration."  (Sources: New York Times, 11/28/95;

GUATEMALA: GAP BETWEEN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
CLOSES SUBSTANTIALLY AS RUNOFF ELECTION NEARS

     The latest opinion polls indicate that Guatemala's two
runoff presidential candidates will fight a close battle to
win the second round of elections, scheduled for Jan. 7.  Most
local officials and politicians, however, predict that
abstention in the second round will climb to about 70% of the
registered electorate.
     In late November, Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal
(Tribunal Supremo Electoral, TSE) released the final results
for the Nov. 12 general elections (see NotiSur, 11/10/95 and
11/17/95).  As indicated in the preliminary results reported
in mid-November, Alvaro Arzu--presidential candidate for the
Partido de Avanzada Nacional (PAN)--took first place with
nearly 37% of the votes (see table).  The Frente Republicano
Guatemalteco (FRG) candidate, Alfonso Portillo, took second
place with 22% of the votes.
     The Alianza Nacional--which grouped the Democracia
Cristiana Guatemalteca (DCG), the Union del Centro Nacional
(UCN), and the Partido Social Democrata (PSD) in a tripartite
coalition--took third place with nearly 13%.  The leftist
Frente Democratico Nacional Guatemalteco (FDNG) took fourth
place with nearly 8% of the votes.
     Of the remaining 17 parties that participated in the
elections, only the Partido Libertador Popular (PLP) won more
than 4% of the votes, which is the minimum a party must obtain
to retain its legal status after the elections.  The
Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN) and the Union
Democratica (UD) managed to retain their legal status because
they each won a seat in the National Congress.  But the
remaining 14 parties will now be officially dissolved,
reducing to nine Guatemala's recognized political parties.
     PAN also swept the congressional elections, taking 43 of
the unicameral legislature's 80 seats.  The FRG will form the
second largest bloc in Congress with 21 seats.
     Despite the Alianza Nacional's third place position in
absolute votes won in the elections, the coalition was
dissolved after the elections and the seven congressional
seats won by the Alianza were then divided between the DCG and
the UCN.  Thus, even though the FDNG took fourth place in
total votes, that party is now the third strongest political
force in the legislature, with six congressional seats.
     Finally, PAN won eight of the 20 seats contested in the
elections for the Central American Parliament (Parlacen).  The
FRG took five seats, and the remaining seven seats will be
fairly evenly divided among the Alianza parties, the FDNG, the
PLP, and the UD.

 into a referendum on the general.
     Indeed, Rios Montt has accompanied Portillo throughout
the campaign.  At most campaign rallies since November,
Portillo has limited his speeches to just a few minutes,
allowing the general to dominate the show.
     Apparently, a wave of common and political violence that
has gripped the country since early December is contributing
to Portillo's rise in the polls, since most voters who support
Rios Montt approve of the general's hard-line approach to
crime.  In fact, speculation reigns in Guatemala that the
sharp rise in violence since early December is a deliberate
tactic by extreme-right groups that hope to sway votes in
favor of the FRG, which promises to crack down on crime and
"restore order" to the country.
     Indeed, Francisco Reyes--an FRG congressional deputy who
helped found the party and is one of the organization's
principal leaders--stated in mid-December that if the FRG wins
the elections, Rios Montt will be given control over national
security.
     "The decision has already been taken," said Reyes.  "Gen.
Rios Montt will be made state secretary for national
security."
      Meanwhile, regardless of the closeness of the
presidential race, most local observers expect abstention will
grow dramatically in the runoff election.  In the first round
of voting, only 46% of the registered 3.7 million voters went
to the polls.  The 53% abstention rate in the November
elections was significantly higher than that registered in the
last two presidential elections.  In the first round in 1985,
only 31% of voters abstained from going to the polls, and in
the first round in the 1990 presidential elections, abstention
only reached 44%.
     In the second round on Jan. 7, spokespersons from the
Civil Registry have predicted that at least 65% of registered
voters will abstain.  Independent estimates place the
abstention rate as high as 75%.  [Sources: Prensa Libre

COLOMBIA: CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION OF PRESIDENT
ERNESTO SAMPER SHELVED FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE

     On Dec. 14 the legislative commission examining links
between the Cali drug cartel and the 1994 election campaign of
President Ernesto Samper ruled there was insufficient evidence
to launch a full-scale investigation of the president.
Nevertheless, the scandal continues to cast a shadow on the
Samper administration and its relationship with the US.
     The Accusations Commission announced that it had voted
14-to-1 to shelve a preliminary probe into charges that Samper
personally authorized the receipt of US$6 million in Cali
cartel drug money to win the election in 1994.  Eleven of the
committee's 15 members belong to Samper's Partido Liberal.
     Under Colombian law, the commission had three options:
it could have definitely closed the case, meaning that Samper
could not have been investigated on the same charges again; it
could rule--as it did--that there was insufficient evidence to
charge the president, which allows the investigation to be
reopened in the future; or it could have recommended that the
Senate begin impeachment proceedings against the president.
     Charges that drug money found its way into Samper's
campaign first erupted two days after Samper's election in
June 1994.  The investigation by the Accusations Commission
began last August (see NotiSur, 06/24/95, 04/04/95, and
08/25/95).
     The campaign finance scandal, which led to the arrests of
several of Samper's closest political associates--including
former defense minister Fernando Botero and Santiago Medina,
treasurer of Samper's campaign--has soured ties with
Washington and intensified long-standing suspicions about
Colombia's underlying commitment to the anti-drug fight.  The
commission's decision is unlikely to calm the troubled waters.
     US Ambassador Myles Frechette has warned that the US may
remove Colombia's certification as a partner in the fight
against drugs next year, withdrawing key aid and trade
preferences.  Conditional cer a growing number
of Colombians believed that not only Samper but his
conservative rival Andres Pastrana accepted drug money
campaign contributions.  However, a poll published Nov. 19 by
the daily El Tiempo indicated that while 58.3% of Colombians
believed that the drug cartels contributed to Samper's
campaign, 61% said he should not resign.
     After Samper's television appearance following the
commission's decision, his public approval ratings rose.  A
poll take by El Tiempo immediately after the program aired
indicated that the president had convinced 65% of the audience
of his innocence, while 35% continued to believe him guilty.
     In his public address, Samper insisted he would not
resign, saying it would be an act of "cowardice" to abandon
his office in the midst of a crisis.  (Sources: Reuter,
12/13/95, 12/14/95; Agence France-Presse, 12/15/95, 12/20/95;

NATIONAL'S CHALLENGES DON'T THREATEN REFORMS

     Prime Minister Jim Bolger and his National Party will have to
overcome serious obstacles in order to remain in power over the next
five years.  A new proportional voting system, which will give
smaller parties a larger number of seats in Parliament, and disarray
within the National Party may result in a coalition government led by
either Labour or the Alliance Party, which is an amalgamation of
politicians who have left the two major parties.  Tensions over
immigrants and the rights of the Maori, members of the indigenous
population, could result in limited violence and also a voter
backlash against the party in power.  Despite the expected steady
growth and low inflation, high unemployment will remain a problem and
little improvement in living standards will be achieved.  A coalition
government led by Labour or Alliance would carry out more fiscal
expansion than would a National government, but unless the most
extreme members of the Alliance dominated policy, would not reverse
most of the market reforms that have been implemented since 1985.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  NEW ZEALAND

June 28, 1995     A new political party, United New Zealand (UNZ),
                  was formed under the leadership of Clive
                  Matthewson.

July 17, 1995     The governor of the New Zealand Reserve Bank, Don
                  Brash, was forced to warn the financial markets
                  again of the dire consequences if they continued
                  to challenge his anti-inflation campaign.

July 20, 1995     The question of whether New Zealand needs a tough
                  code to control corporate takeover activity caused
                  serious dissension in the Cabinet and the business
                  community.

October 2, 1995   The new Zealand government announced plans to
                  privatize one of the state~s last big assets, a
                  large area of North Island State forests.

PRESIDENT FACES TOUGH ECONOMIC DECISIONS

President Ion Iliescu is favored to win the September 1996
presidential elections, but his supporters are unlikely to win a
majority in Parliament.  Despite growing opposition from all sides,
Iliescu will dominate the government as he tries to move the economy
toward integration with the EU.  The privatization program under way
will have limited success.  Budget cutting and market reforms will be
implemented enough to qualify for assistance from the IMF and the EU
but not enough to greatly improve the business climate.  However, the
economy is expected to grow over the next five years, and inflation
will be brought into more tolerable ranges.

STABILITY, BUT LIMITED OPPORTUNITY

The stable federal structure is buttressed by the support of the two
dominant component emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  The federal
government will continue to be led by President Zayed bin Sultan al-
Nahyan of Abu Dhabi; the prime ministership will be held by Sheik
Maktum bin Rashid al-Maktum, the current ruler of Dubai.  If either
leader leaves office for reasons of health, he will be replaced by a
younger member of the respective family.  The pressure for democratic
reform is weak.  Islamic fundamentalism will not seriously threaten
the government.  The economy will remain heavily dependent on oil,
despite attempts at diversification.  As a result, growth will be
modest, at best, and inflation will show some upward movement.
Opportunities for foreign business are expected to be limited,
despite some modest attempts to attract foreign investment through
liberalization.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

January 8, 1995     Sheik Mohammad bin Rashad al-Maktum was named
                    crown prince of Dubai to ensure a smooth
                    succession in the event of his father's death, a
                    move that was welcomed by international business.

January 31, 1995    In a keynote speech, Sheik Mohammad called for
                    rehabilitation of Iraq by the Arab Gulf states.

June 1995           UAE recognized Sheik Hamad as the new ruler of
                    Qatar.  Hamad overthrew his father in a bloodless
                    coup.

June 1995           Business survey rated Dubai the world's largest
                    container port.

Mid-July, 1995      The Iranian government affirmed its claim to the
                    Abu Musa and Tunb islands, saying the islands
                    belong to Iran "eternally."  The UAE persisted
                    with its efforts to refer the dispute to the
                    International Court at The Hague.

Mid-July, 1995      Sheik Abdel Munim al-Ali was arrested for
                    "preaching subversion" and sentenced to
                    deportation.

October 1995        A Filipina maid's death sentence for murdering
                    her employer was changed to 100 lashes and
                    deportation by an Abu Dhabi court after the
                    victim's family agreed to accept blood money.

NO END TO DIVIDED GOVERNMENT

The struggle between President Bill Clinton and the Republic-
controlled Congress over almost all issues will probably not produce
much budgetary reform.  The 1996 presidential and congressional
elections are also not likely to lead to changes in policy direction,
even if the Republican challenger, probably Robert Dole wins the
presidential election.  The most likely result of the elections will
be a slim victory for Clinton and Republican control of both houses.
Protectionist sentiment will increase at the grass roots level, but
it is not likely to be translated into policy.  The economy will
drift while the politicians argue over spending and tax cuts.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  United States

April 19, 1995      A huge car bomb devastated a federal building in
                    Oklahoma City, killing at least 167 people.
                    Timothy Mc Veigh and Terry Nichols were later
                    charged with the bombing.

June 2, 1995        Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady's F-16 was shot
                    down over Bosnia, and he narrowly escaped Serb
                    forces after fleeing his crippled plane.  He was
                    rescued by the Marines six days later.

June 29, 1995       The US Space shuttle Atlantis successfully docked
                    with the Russian station Mir.

November 5, 1995    In national elections, Republicans took control
                    of both houses of Congress for the first time in
                    40 years.

December 1995       A Budget Impasse caused 260,000 federal employees
                    to be temporarily out of work.

December 1995       US troops were sent to Bosnia as part of a NATO
                    mission.

MOUNTING TENSIONS

The centrist government of President Sanchez de Lozada will face
significant cross-pressures for the reminder of its term.  The
successor after the June 1997 elections is likely to be another
centrist regime led by someone from Sanchez de Lozada's National
Revolutionary Movement (MNR), but a victory by a right wing populist
is far from remote.  The commitment to free market policies that
calls for partial privatization of major state-owned industries, and
the reduction of the budget deficit will continue.  However,
pressures from labor and peasants will force more social spending.
In addition, the large role played by coca leaf growers and dealers
in the economy will prevent the strong action against the drug trade
encouraged by the US, which in turn could jeopardize aid and
financial support from the international community.  A right-wing
populist regime led by Carlos Palenque, a radio talk show host who
has significant support among the poor, would raise concerns among
investors about increased spending and a reversal of market reforms.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  BOLIVIA

April 12, 1995      Hundreds of striking teachers and miners, some
                    setting off dynamite and throwing rocks, fought
                    police in La Paz, continuing protests that had
                    left at least 30 people injured.  The strikers
                    have been demanding higher wages and protesting
                    educational and economic reforms.

 June 1995          Half-shares of Ende, the Bolivian state electric
                    company, were sold to foreign investors as a
                    first step in Sanchez de Lozadaas innovative
                    capitalization plan for modernizing state
                    enterprises and creating a pension fund for
                    Bolivians.

September-
October 1995        Sanchez de Lozadaas capitalization plan continued
                    as half-shares of LAB, the state airline, were
                    sold to foreign investors.

October 1995        State of siege resulting from spring strikes is
                    lifted.

December 1995       Max Fernandez dies in plane crash.

CONTE AND HIS REFORMS LOOK SECURE

     Allowing opposition parties and a partially free press,
President Lansana Conte has engineered both his own presidential
election in 1993 and a Parliament controlled by his party in June
1995.  Despite the widespread opposition he has stimulated, none of
the forces arrayed against him control enough resources to topple
him.  The most serious threats to his continuing in office are poor
health or assassination.  In case of unexpected economic decline or
if the opposition is able to put aside its differences and unite, a
national conference could emerge that leads to a civilian regime.
Despite past military involvement in politics, a coup is unlikely.
Conte will continue to support limited austerity and liberalization
measures and the economy is expected to improve as a result of more
raw material exports, especially an improvement in the current
account.  A national conference regime would spend more but would
liberalize the economy.  A military government would limit
liberalization.

CHRONOLOGY:  GUINEA

March 31, 1995      The Interior Ministry announced that the long-
                    delayed parliamentary elections would take place
                    on June 11.

May 16, 1995        A monthly shipping service opened between Conakry
                    and Lagos, Nigeria.

June 2, 1995        Soldiers arrested approximately 100 members of
                    Alpha Conde's RPG party.  The arrests took place
                    in the north, near Mandiana, as RPG supporters
                    headed to a rally.

June 11, 1995       The ruling Party for Unity and Progress captured
                    71 seats in legislative elections, while
                    opposition parties won 38 seats.

June 21, 1995       Employees of six private banks launched a strike
                    for higher wages, training, and better working
                    conditions.

August 9, 1995      Five armed robbers were sentenced to death
                    following a trial of more than 70 people
                    broadcast on national television and radio.

August 28, 1995     President Conte, during a broadcast in his native
                    Soussou language, said there would be no
                    extraparliamentary dialogue with the CODEM
                    alliance of opposition parties.

August 30, 1995     Opposition deputies of the CODEM alliance, formed
                    in July, participated in the installation of the
                    new National Assembly despite a boycott threat.
                    Alpha Conde, however, was absent.

September 15, 1995  Seven Guinea soldiers were killed in Sierra Leone
                    by Sierra Leone rebels.  The deaths were the
                    first in the Guinean deployment.

==============================================================================
BOLIVIA
Tensions are Mounting

The centrist government of President Sanchez de Lozada will face significant
cross-pressures for the remainder of its term.  The successor after the June
1997 elections is likely to be another centrist regime led by someone from
Sanchez de Lozada's National Revolutionary Movement (MNR), but a victory by a
right-wing populist remains a serious risk.  The commitment will continue to
free market policies that call for partial privatization of major state-owned
industries and the reduction of the budget deficit.  However, pressures from
labor and peasants will result in more social spending.  In addition, the large
economic role played by coca leaf dealers will inhibit the strong action
against the drug trade encouraged by the US.  This, in turn, could jeopardize
aid and financial support from the international community.  A right-wing
populist regime led by Carlos Palenque, a radio talk show host who attracts
significant support among the poor, is far from a remote possibility.  It would
raise concerns among investors about increased spending and a reversal of
market reforms.

NEW ZEALAND
National's Challenges Don't Threaten Reform

Prime Minister Jim Bolger and his National Party will have to overcome serious
obstacles in order to remain in power over the next five years.  A new
proportional voting system, which will give smaller parties a larger number of
seats in Parliament, and disarray within the National Party may result in a
coalition government led by either Labour or the Alliance Party, which is an
amalgamation of politicians who have left the two major parties.  Tensions over
immigrants and the rights of the Maori, members of the indigenous population,
could result in limited violence and also a voter backlash against the party in
power.  Despite the expected steady growth and low inflation high unemployment
will remain a problem and little improvement in living standards will be
achieved.  A coalition government led by Labour or Alliance would carry out
more fiscal expansion than would a National government, but unless the most
extreme members of the Alliance dominated policy, would not reverse most of the
market reforms that have been implemented since 1985.

ROMANIA
President Faces Tough Economic Decisions

President Ion Iliescu is favored to win the September 1996 presidential
elections, but his supporters are unlikely to win a majority in Parliament.
Despite growing opposition from all sides, Iliescu will dominate the government
as he tries to move the economy toward integration with the EU.  The
privatization program under way will have limited success.  Budget cutting and
market reforms will be implemented enough to qualify for assistance from the
IMF and the EU but not enough to greatly improve the business climate.
However, the economy is expected to grow over the next five years, and
inflation will be brought into more tolerable ranges.

SINGAPORE
Goh to Continue

Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong is building support for his leadership of the
ruling People's Action Party (PAP), although former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
remains in a strong position.  Elections that need to be held by August 1996
are likely to result in nothing more than a slight decline in electoral support
for PAP.   The government will manage the economy and will permit some trade
liberalization.  The biggest source of political uncertainty is the successor
to Prime Minister Goh.  The front-runner, Lee Hsien Loong, who is Lee Kuan
Yew's son, suffers from serious health problems.  If he were to become
incapacitated, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan Keng Yam would replace Goh if
there were a transition. The biggest challenge to international business will
continue to be the shortage of labor and the strong position of the Singapore
currency.  Nevertheless, inflation will remain under 4%.

SPAIN
New Government Won't Improve the Economy

Elections in March 1996 are likely to result in a center-right government
headed by Jose Maria Aznar and his Popular Party (PP), depending on support of
one or both of the major regional parties, the Catalonian Convergence and Union
(CiU) and the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV).  It is possible, but not likely,
that the Socialists could gain the support of these two parties and retain
enough electoral support to head a coalition government.  This likelihood would
increase if someone other than Prime Minister Gonzalez were to lead the party,
and in the process create a united effort.  However, the Socialist Workers
Party (PSOE), which suffers from its long period of rule and several scandals,
is split.  Economic policies are not likely to differ under either government,
as Spain continues to be guided by EU regulations that require liberalization.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
Stability, but Limited Opportunity

The stable federal structure is buttressed by the support of the two dominant
component emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  The federal government will continue
to be led by President Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi; the prime
ministership will be held by Sheik Maktum bin Rashid al-Maktum, the current
ruler of Dubai.  If either leader leaves office for reasons of health, he will
be replaced by a younger member of the respective family.  The pressure for
democratic reform is weak.  Islamic fundamentalism will not seriously threaten
the government.  The economy will remain heavily dependent on oil, despite
attempts at diversification.  As a result, growth will be modest, at best, and
inflation will show some upward movement.  Opportunities for foreign business
are expected to be limited, despite some modest attempts to attract foreign
investment through liberalization.

UNITED STATES
No End to Divided Government

The struggle between President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled
Congress will almost certainly thwart significant budgetary reform, leading to
economic drift.  The November 1996 presidential and congressional elections are
not likely to affect policy direction, even if the Republican challenger,
probably Sen. Robert Dole, wins the presidency.  The most likely result of the
elections will be a slim victory for Clinton, and Republican control of
Congress.  Popular sentiment for protectionist measures will increase, but is
not likely to be translated into policy.

VENEZUELA
No Improvement in Sight

Sluggish economic growth, high inflation, political vacillation, and outbreaks
of turmoil will assure a bleak climate for international business at least
until the presidential election of 1998.  Even then, the climate will suffer
from underlying structural problems, notably an overdependence on oil exports
and a lack of fiscal discipline.  Poor conditions are aggravated by the
populist stance of President Rafael Caldera Rodriguez.  Caldera will implement
limited austerity measures, but only under pressure from the IMF.  In addition
to his own ideologically-based distaste for such measures, he will be hampered
by opposition in Congress.  He faces an increased risk of political violence or
even a military coup if he accepts the IMF conditions.  Support for leftist
parties, especially Causa R (whose candidate for president, Andres Velasquez,
finished second in 1993), could produce a center-left government in 1998.
Despite its leftist orientation, such a government could implement more
systematic economic reforms than Caldera.  No matter who becomes president,
however, all businesses will suffer from the lack of government legitimacy and
the persistent conflict between the president and Congress.

BRIEF UPDATES TO COUNTRY FORECASTS


BURMA
Glacier-Like Reform

Despite an announced privatization policy and a constitutional convention that
started at the end of November 1995, the military junta is inclined to permit
only the most limited reform.  The military leaders have made it clear that the
constitution must give the military a major role in the new government.  In
response, the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) has threatened to
walk out of the convention.  The NLD is not likely to back down.  More than 80%
of the delegates are appointed by the government, and whatever legislative body
is called for by the constitution will have a large number of delegates
appointed by the military.  Although the government has indicated that it plans
to privatize 51 state-owned companies, only six have been sold.  The government
has put further privatization on hold until a stock exchange is established.
Some of the privatization may include sale of stock to the public, but the
government will maintain control over management.  As a result, investors face
political tension over democratic reforms coming from the US and a government
that will not give up significant control over economic decisions.

CHINA
Business Climate Threatened

Against the background of uncertainty regarding the role of leaders as Deng
Xiaoping's death nears, concern over the future business climate grows.  Jiang
Zemin is consolidating his grip on power but he may actually be merely the
puppet of a small group of top leaders.  There is a clear commitment to foreign
investment and some forms of private enterprise.  However, the struggle between
the regions and the central government is heightened by the weakness in the
center.  State enterprises may be in retreat but they are not likely to close
down because the leadership is worried about the social consequences of
unemployment.  Some discussion has begun within government circles of removing
tax on breaks given to foreign investors to compensate in part for a reduction
in tariffs required for membership in the WTO. This has caused concern within
international business.  Another worry arises from the growing importance and
aggressiveness of the Chinese military, especially in the South China Sea.  In
addition, tensions with Taiwan may increase.  Pressure from the US government
over human rights issues, the status of Taiwan and Hong Kong, and trade policy
have already set off a nationalistic response that eventually could threaten
businesses operating in China, including the withdrawal of MFN status by the
US.  As a result, the strong international payments balance may suffer a
decline.

ECUADOR
Investors Worry for Good Reason

Political and economic uncertainties will likely deter investors over the next
year.  President Sixto Duran Ballen is growing increasingly unpopular, because
of a scandal and because of a sluggish economy.  He also faces a badly divided
and hostile congress.  There is little prospect that enough economic reforms
will be implemented to stimulate the economy.  Consequently, the elections in
May 1996 are not likely to result in a regime any more capable of improving the
economy than the current government.  The economy is at risk, because of
increased violence and the threat of a military coup.

EGYPT
Mubarak Consolidates

President Hosni Mubarak has assured his control over the next five years.  He
has cracked down on fundamentalists and in November 1995 engineered a
parliamentary election that increased support for his government. His
willingness to use force, mixed with occasional and limited political
liberalization, has kept the opposition off balance.  He is assured of US
financial help by his support of the Arab-Israeli peace process, although he
manages to postpone implementing the structural economic reforms called for by
the international financial community.  Some progress has been made in reducing
the foreign debt, controlling inflation, and stimulating economic growth.
However, the systematic privatizations that are essemtial to improving
prospects over the long term has yet to develop.  Because of fear that layoffs,
resulting from privatization, could substantially increase social unrest, the
prospects are not good for genuine reform.

IRAN
Weakening Economy

Lacking any consensus on the need for market reforms, and little chance of a
substantial increase in the price of oil, the economy shows no signs of
improving, and inflation continues to be a danger.  President Akbar Hasemi
Rafsanjani has tried to add his supporters to the government, but the more
radical fundamentalists continue to block both market reforms and accommodation
with non-Islamic foreign interests.  At the same time, the US government shows
no signs whatsoever of normalizing economic relations.

OMAN
Dealing With Lower Oil Revenues

Although in firm control, Sultan Qaboos faces serious obstacles in reducing the
country's debt.  The key problem is that the economy depends on oil revenues
which are flat.  The need to develop non-oil exports has been met in part but
not enough to make a palpable difference.  Remittances by foreign workers in
Oman is also a problem that the government will try, probably unsuccessfully,
to address by replacing these workers with Omani nationals.  Qaboos has given
the Consultative Council more visibility, but will resist sharing of power.
Some steps have been promised to increase foreign investment but they have yet
to have much of an impact.

PERU
Fujimori in Firm Control

Despite the defeat of many of the candidates he backed in mid-November 1995
local elections, President Alberto Fujimori shows no signs of losing control.
He stands high in public opinion polls and is not backing down from his
authoritarian rule.  The economy is relatively healthy by South American
standards and significant progress has been made in reducing the huge
international debt that existed when Fujimori first came to power.  Since
Fujimori will be in control until mid-2000, the biggest source of long-term
uncertainty remains the lack of a successor if he were to be assassinated or
leave office for reasons of health.

RUSSIA
Parliamentary Elections Confirm Tensions

The December 1995 parliamentary elections affirmed the chaotic condition of the
political system.  Although the Communist Party received twice as many votes as
the Liberal Democratic party of nationalist extremist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, its
victory was more a result of superior political organization than a yearning
for a return to the Communist system.  Moderates and those in favor of reform
held their own.  Because of the weakness of the Duma in relation to the
presidency, the results will have little direct impact on policy before the
presidential election in June 1996.  The results also suggest that Yeltsin may
have trouble being re-elected if the Communists can unify behind their leader,
Gennadi Zyuganov.  Over the long run, there is little prospect that a
government will emerge that will make significant reforms in the large
state-controlled industries, but most of the market reforms will not be
reversed.  The two biggest sources of risk to the business climate are the lack
of a strong legal framework supporting business operations limiting arbitrary
interventions by the various government bodies and the emergence of a
nationalistic foreign policy that would threaten help from the international
financial community.

SAUDI ARABIA
Isolated Incident no Cause for Concern

The November 1995 bombing of a building in Riyadh used by Americans to train
the Saudi military appears to have been an isolated incident directed more at
the US than at the Saudi government. However, tension remains over both the
presence of US forces in the kingdom and erosion of traditional Muslim values.
There are, nevertheless, no signs that the current government is seriously
threatened.  While the economy remains heavily influenced by oil prices and
levels of production, there has been some diversification.  There has also been
some belt-tightening which has yet to generate significant dissatisfaction with
the government.

TAIWAN
Elections Weaken Ruling Party

Although the ruling Nationalist party won 85 out of 164 seats in the
parliament, it received 45% of the vote, the lowest percentage since 1945.
This resulted in the loss of seven seats.  The biggest winner was the New Party
which gained 21 seats.  Running on a platform of accommodation with China, the
New Party consists primarily of former Nationalist Party (KMT) officials who
left, in part, because of disagreement over the government's apparent move to
an independence position with respect to China.  However, New Party voters were
nearly all mainlanders which, if continued, will limit the party's future vote.
President Lee Teng-hui will encounter more difficulty in implementing new
policy initiatives.  Because the economy is showing the effects of high labor
costs and the tendency of the Taiwanese to invest in China and elsewhere, the
government will be faced with growing electoral dissatisfaction.  President
Lee, however, still enjoys approval ratings in the 70% range.  This makes him a
favorite in the March 1996 presidential election.  If he wins a clear mandate,
he may promote constitutional changes to increase Taiwanese influence in the
government.

ZAMBIA
Chiluba Becomes More Authoritarian

After benefiting from pressures to democratize the political system, President
Frederick Chiluba has chosen his own political survival over democratic
processes.  Because elections are scheduled for October 1996, and because of
the growing political strength of former President Kenneth Kaunda, Chiluba has
tried to eliminate Kaunda over legal technicalities concerning whether or not
the former president is in fact a citizen of Zambia.  Kaunda was arrested twice
in 1995 for failing to receive proper authorization for public speeches.
Chiluba's political problems stem from his inability to revive the economy
despite initial market reforms.  A Kaunda government would likely halt or even
reverse the reforms.

The Anglo-Saxon model for Russia

Foreign direct investment is increasingly taking over from bank 
leverage, as in Germany, or state  influence, as in France and Japan, 
as the desirable means to overhaul an ailing economy or industrial 
sector.  Industries losing out in world competition, such as the UK 
and US car sectors fifteen years ago, are either taken over entirely, 
as in the UK, or respond to the prospect by  restructuring 
themselves, as in the US.  Either way a country finds itself with a 
new modern industry.
The US and the UK, indeed, are not only the world's largest exporters 
of direct capital (with Japan), but by far its largest hosts to such 
investment, accumulating US$400bn in the US and US$200bn in the UK by 
1993.  They have also had the most dynamic economies in the 
capitalist world of late.
The key point is that foreign firms can bring not just capital, but 
fresh management and new ideas of how to produce and market goods and 
what to produce.  Business executives switching jobs around the world 
are better able to discern new global marketing and technical 
opporunities than even the best trained bankers and bureaucrats can 
at home, as Germany and France are finding to their cost. 
The Russians and other FSU economies are peculiarly suitable to host 
multinational enterprise of the sort that began to develop the US and 
Canada (whose railroads and canals were largely built by British 
capital and engineers)  over a century ago.  For they possess scant 
populations, yet abundant raw materials and energy, whose efficient 
exploitation by multinationals has made primary-producing countries, 
such as Australia and Canada, amongst the richest in the world.
The Baltic states and Kazakhstan have already set up fiscal and legal 
regimes highly favourable to foreign investment as well as open stock 
exchanges.  While the former are becoming entrepot port beneficiaries 
of the trade from a resource-rich hinterland, the Kazakhs are in its 
heart, with some 60 per cent of the FSU's mineral reserves, 
attractive to foreign investors.  Japan Chromium Corp., for instance, 
has taken over three Kazakh chrome firms, boosting the sales of two 
of them by 140 per cent over the previous year and profits by 182 per 
cent.  One of them has raised monthly output by 2,000 per cent and 
began selling for hard currency (see page 18). Kazakhstan has 
attracted some US$4bn of the US$100m committed by foreign investors 
in the entire former Soviet zone, including Central Europe.  
Sandwiched between Russia and China, Kazakhstan has geopolitical as 
well as economic reasons to raise its international profile.  But 
Russia itself could only benefit, as already has China, from 
encouraging an inflow of foreign investment to renovate its ossified 
industries.
The cash-strapped military firms striving to convert to civilian 
production and the hard-pressed Russian Space Agency (see Inside 
Track) are doing their utmost to attract foreign capital and custom.  
But the still profitable oil and gas sector, which accounts for over 
US$25bn in hard currency export revenues per annum,is convinced that 
it can overcome its problems on its own.  Its Soviet-trained 
bureaucrats are almost certainly wrong about this, ignorant of the 
extent to which say even the UK; despite BP and Shell, would have 
been unable to develop its sector of the North Sea without the help 
of US firms experienced in Alaska.
Russian Premier, Chernomyrdin, ex-head of Gazprom, has learnt a great 
deal from mixing with his Western counterparts and is pushing for 
foreigners to have a better share in the oil industry, whose present 
managers he, along with many gas managers, holds in low esteem; 
Gazprom, unlike the oil industry, has by and large sustained levels 
of production.  Under his advice, Yeltsin signed a long-awaited law 
on 1st January, allowing foreign oil and gas firms to enter into 
production-sharing agreements with the government.  But the law, 
which allows the government to change tax rates at will and 
unilaterally to re-negotiate a foreign production-sharing agreement, 
does not go far enough to allay the fears of Western energy companies 
and to unlock the multibillion dollar deals that have been on hold 
for years.  The law needs to be amended before they will take the 
plunge.
Behind the reluctance of the oil men in Russia to open up to their 
foreign equivalents is a lingering suspicion that their investment is 
the engine of Western imperialism, as Lenin declared in Imperialism; 
the Last Stage of Capitalism.  They, along with the Duma politicians 
should be sent back to study the history of the US, Canada and 
Australia, resource-rich giants, comparable to Russia, where foreign 
investment was the presiding genius of the first stage of advanced 
capitalism and a chief reason for their pre-eminence today.

ASIAN LINKS: Japan remains Maritime Territory's biggest trading partner

Japan, already by far the biggest trading partner of Russia's Far 
Eastern Maritime Territory, is set to increase its share in the 
Territory's foreign trade turnover even further this year, the 
Russian news agency, ITAR-TASS, reported on 2nd December from 
Vladivostok, quoting the head of the Far Eastern office of Japan's 
Sumitomo Corporation.
The businessman said that in 1994 Japan accounted for 57.2 per cent 
of Maritime Territory's exports and 25.6 per cent of its imports.  
Japan was followed by China with 13.6 per cent of exports and 15.4 
per cent of imports and South Korea with 13 and 16 per cent 
respectively.
Sumitomo Corporation, which co-operates with local companies in the 
Russian Far East in such diverse fields as the timber and coal 
industries, delivery of building equipment, trucks and cars, and the 
laying of telecommunication lines, accounts for over 10 per cent of 
the entire trade turnover between Maritime Territory and Japan.
Korea Tcould open northern Asia to Russian natural gasU
South Korea could play a critical role in opening northern Asian 
energy markets to Russian natural gas exports, according to a new 
study.
A report by ING Barings Bank suggests that Korea, rather than Japan, 
could play the pivotal role in unlocking Russian gas reserves in 
Eastern Siberia.  It says Korea, which is currently seen as one of 
the main targets for liquefied natural gas exports from South-East 
Asian and Middle.  Eastern gas producers, is keen to diversify its 
sources of gas supply.
Any deal involving Korean purchases of Russian gas would have a 
strong regional political dimension, says Mr Alex Stewart, the 
report's author.  Seoul has been keen to improve relations with both 
Russia and China, and a natural gas pipeline to Korea via the latter 
would be a potent political symbol of regional co-operation.
The study says Japan's hopes to tap gas from fields of the Russian 
island of Sakhalin remain frustrated because of continuing 
uncertainly over the fate of production-sharing legislation in 
Moscow.  It says the 'lingering territorial dispute with Russia over 
the Kurile islands' is an added impediment.
Mr Stewart said Korean companies had undertaken detailed studies to 
determine the viability of projects based on gas from Eastern Russia.  
But any announcement of further progress might be affected by the 
political scandals that have recently embroiled the Seoul government.

AVIATION - Russia sets up air market protection commission

The Russian government is to set up a special commission to look at 
ways of protecting Russia's traditional markets in aircraft 
construction and air transport, Interfax news agency reported on 5th 
December.  The commission is to be headed by the chairman of the CIS 
(Commonwealth of Independent States) Interstate Aviation Committee, 
Tatyana Anodina.
Interfax quoted the head of the Russian Transport Ministry's Air 
Transport Department, Vadim Zamotin, as saying that lack of airline 
purchasing power has led to a situation where domestic manufacturers 
of aircraft and spares are at a standstill or are cutting back 
production.  He said the domestic market had a requirement of 1,250 
aeroplanes and helicopters by the year 2000, by which time passenger 
air movements will have doubled to 51m a year.
There are currently 418 air companies operating in Russia, but 37 per 
cent of them account for 80 per cent of all air movements.
Moscow airports to meet international standards by year 2000
The Russian Transport Ministry and the Moscow city government have 
drawn up a comprehensive reconstruction programme designed to turn 
the Russian capital's airports into a major world transport centre by 
the year 2000, Moscow 2x2 TV has reported.
At the first stage of the programme, which is to be carried out over 
the next two years at an estimated cost of at least R1,176bn, 
runways, freight and passenger terminals and technical equipment at 
Moscow's four airports are to be brought up to international 
standards.  At the next stage, a convenient system for getting air 
passengers quickly to and from the city and between airports is to be 
introduced, 2x2 said.
The television station quoted Vadim Zamotin, director of the Russian 
Transport Ministry's Air Transport Department, as saying that at 
present Moscow's airports did not meet either international or 
domestic standards on a number of counts, including safety 
provisions.

ENERGY -First 11 months see shift to West in oil and gas exports

Russia exported more than 112.9m tonnes of oil worth around US$11.2bn 
in the first 11 months of last year, Interfax news agency reported, 
quoting State Statistics Committee figures, on 15th December.
The amount sold fell by 3.3 per cent by comparison with the same 
period in 1994 but the price per tonne of oil rose 12 per cent to 
average US$99.80.  Of the 11-month oil-export total, 87.8m tonnes 
went to countries outside the former Soviet Union, an increase of 2.6 
per cent on 1994.  During the same period, exports to members to the 
CIS and to the Baltic States were 19.5 per cent down on last year, at 
25m tonnes.
In November alone, Russia exported 7.2m tonnes of oil to countries 
outside the former Soviet Union and 3.9m tonnes of oil to the former 
union republics.
Exports of natural gas rose 2.5 per cent year on year during the 
period under review, with Russia exporting 173bn cubic metres, worth 
a total of US$12.1bn.  Countries outside the former Soviet Union 
received 109.9bn cubic metres of gas, a 10.5 per cent rise in 
January-November 1994.  The CIS and Baltic States received 63bn cubic 
metres, down 9.1 per cent on last year.  In November, Europe received 
11.1bn cubic metres of Russian gas and the CIS and Baltic states 
8.6bn cubic metres.
Russia's exports of petroleum products amounted to 43.9m tonnes in 
January-November, about the same as last year.  Of that total, 
countries outside the former Soviet Union received 40.6m tonnes, 11.8 
per cent up on last year's figure, and the CIS and Baltics received 
3.2m tonnes, less than half the figure for 1994.

(GIMA) have joined forces to organise Premier Collections Moscow, the 
European fashion exhibition for Russia, the CIS and the Baltic 
states, 28th February to 2nd March 1996.  They expect 150 to 200 
companies from all over the world, of which approximately 10 per cent 
are going to be from the US, will participate in the show.
ITE, the largest and most successful exhibition organiser in Russia 
and the CIS, has a complete Russian database of fashion buyers, 
maintains personal contacts in many of the principal trading 
companies, and has ready access to all Russian trade associations.

92,000 visitors), Moscow International Motor Show (300 exhibitors, 
500,000 visitors), Moscow International Sport & Leisure Show (225 
exhibitors, 15,000 visitors), and Moscow International Healthcare 
Exhibition (200 exhibitors,40,000 visitors).  
Bleinheim is a leading exhibition company in Europe, with 250 trade 
shows worldwide.  It is the organiser of premier collections in the

Moscow, offering excellent entertainment and sightseeing, providing 
easy access to visitors.  
Manezh international exhibition hall is the perfect location for a 
fashion exhibition located close to Moscow fashion boutiques, 
clothing shops and department stores.  Novy Arbat and Tverskaya

companies will be able to establish direct links and  an 
infrastructure that will lead to effective sales throughout Russia.
Russian apparel manufacturing has declined by 55 per cent since 1992, 
causing significant shortages of clothing.  Although much of this 
demand has been filled by US$2bn of imports annually, there is still 
unfulfilled demand for Western styles and medium to high quality 
products.

PRECIOUS METALS - Russia plans jewels exchange

Russian authorities will launch an exchange in January for uncut and 
polished diamonds, according to the head of the Russian association 
of diamond producers, the Interfax news agency reported.
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. is under consideration as a possible 
co-founder, Ararat Evoyan said, with other likely co-founders being 
the Finance Ministry and the State Committee on Precious Metals.
De Beers and the Russian diamond factory adjourned talks without 
agreement.  The discussions will resume in early January, De Beers 
said in a statement released in London.
The company said the parties had agreed to extend the five-year sales 
agreement between Russia and De Beers until 1st February.  Buoyed by 
the comments from both sides, analysts expressed optimism that De 
Beers and Russia would reach a marketing agreement, but many said 
negotiations would probably drag on past 1st February.
James Allen of the stock brokerage concern, Anderson Wilson, said 
that the extension was positive, demonstrating that neither side 
wanted to walk away from a deal.
"I would personally expect the contract to be extended again before 
they reach a final agreement," he said.
Under the current deal, Russia sells 95 per cent of its rough gems 
through De Beers's Central Selling Organisation.
Russia has argued that it should be allowed to sell more stones 
independently.

Yeltsin lifts export duties on petroleum and timber products

Aleksandr Livshits, economic aide to President Yeltsin, confirmed 
that from 1st December export duties levied on most petroleum and 
timber products would be lifted and numerous other duties halved, 
Interfax news agency reported on 20th November.
Speaking at a briefing in the Kremlin on 30th November, Livshits said 
that the president had signed a decree to that effect.
The decree also imposes a ceiling on the prices of products sold by 
"natural monopolists" during the first six months of 1996.  The price 
rise will not exceed the monthly inflation rate, which is 
continuously falling, Livshits said, adding that the president had 
also issued an order for a programme of state support for exporters 
to be drawn up before 15th December.  The president was said to be 
concerned over non-raw material exports from Russia.  Livshits said 
he expected the structures of exports to change as a result of the 
decree.

Russia to usher in trading in precious metals and stones

The Russian government has adopted a resolution which takes the 
country nearer to a deregulated market in precious metals and stones, 
Interfax news agency reported on 1st December, quoting the Union of 
Russian Prospectors.
The Committee for Precious Metals and Stones and the Central Bank 
will have priority access to government-determined quotas of precious 
metals and stones, and prospectors will sell the remainder to 
authorised banks.  Under the government resolution, private 
individuals may then purchase and trade gold, silver and plutonium 
ingots and gemstones, mainly through exchange dealings.
The rules governing exchange dealings are to be submitted by the 
Finance Ministry, Committee for Precious Metals and Stones and 
Central Bank within a month, with a view to trading starting up in 
the first quarter of 1996.
In addition, the Committee for Precious Metals and Stones is to issue 
certified ingots of gold, silver and plutonium, weighing between one 
and 500g.
In a further move, the government has also permitted authorised banks 
to take gold and silver ingots abroad for security operations to 
attract foreign loans.

Dalzavod, described as the biggest shipyard in the Russian Far East, 
will continue ship-building operations given that it has a new modern 
loading facility allowing it to compete with other ports in the area.
Servicing foreign ships could erase Dalzabvod's acute financial 
problems which have been caused by the Russian government's failure 
to pay for orders placed with the shipyard.

TRANSPORT - St Petersburg port goes ahead with upgrade plans

The St Petersburg Seaport is to press ahead with plans for expansion 
despite financial losses this year of between R20bn and R25bn, 
Interfax news agency reported on 10th December, quoting the general 
director of the port, Anatoliy Bilichenko.
Bilichenko attributed this year's losses to poor tax, customs and 
privatisation laws and said expansion would be carried out without 
government help.  Interfax said that the port had still to receive 
tax  concessions promised by St Petersburg mayor, Anatoliy Sobchak.
Bilichenko said that in 1996 the port would use its own money and 
investment from partners to continue the construction of a terminal 
with a final capacity of 150,000 containers a year.  It is also 
designing a terminal to handle 1m tonnes of sugar a year.  Bilichenko 
put the cost of the entire complex at between US$50m and US$55m.  He 
said that capacity at the port was expected to increase by 2m tonnes 
to 11m tonnes in 1996.

BATLIC STATES - Estonia signs up to join EU

Estonia, which was part of the Soviet Union only four years ago, 
could qualify to join the single European currency in two year's 
time.  The Estonian government, which formally applied to join the 
European Union in Brussels on 4th December, has told EU countries 
that it has gone a long way to meeting the stringent single-currency 
conditions set out in the Maastricht Treaty.
Speaking to a news conference in Brussels, the foreign minister, Siim 
Kallas, said his country was unusual in the Baltic region in having 
achieved a balanced budget and having its currency, the kroon, tied 
by law to the value of the Deutschmark.  "Estonia has no budget 
deficit, we have achieved a remarkably rapid growth and our inflation 
is falling very rapidly indeed," he said.  "On present trends we 
could meet all the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty for joining 
the single currency in two years' time."
Estonia is the fifth former Eastern bloc country to apply for EU 
membership, joining Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Latvia.  
Applications from the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia and the 
Czech Republic are expected in the next few weeks.  Both are judged 
by the EU as economically successful and possible candidates for the 
single currency.
Negotiations to enlarge the EU will not begin until the conclusion of 
the conference to review the Maastricht Treaty, which begins next 
year.  Although it may not end until 1997, there is growing pressure 
in the EU for accession negotiations to start by the beginning of 
1998, which would make it possible for some countries to join by the 
year 2000.
EU governments are worried about Russia's reaction to their accepting 
the Baltic states into full membership. But although Moscow has 
warned of a crisis if Nato accepted the Baltic states, it has made no 
such threat about EU enlargement.
"Our policy on security is very clear: Estonia wants to join Nato and 
our other security commitments in Europe will follow on that 
development," Mr Kallas said.  Estonian officials insist that Russian 
fears about their integration in Western Europe are exaggerated.
EU leaders have to decide when to begin negotiations on enlargement, 
how quickly they can be concluded and at what cost.  The likely 
outcome is an agreement to start talks no later than six months after 
the conclusion of the Maastricht Treaty review conference.  
Negotiations will be held with about 10 countries from central and 
eastern Europe.
Estonian parliament fails to approve central bank's annual report
The Riigikogu parliament on 7th December failed to endorse the Bank 
of Estonia's 1994 financial report.  Instead, it suspended the draft 
resolution's passage because of the loss of 170m kroons (US$13) on 
the bank's books.  Finance Commission chairman, Olev Raju, said that 
the Riigikogu cannot endorse the central bank's report as it stands 
because this would be in conflict with the laws.  
Under a law regulating the Bank of Estonia, the Riigikogu must 
endorse the bank's annual report every year, including its balance 
sheet and revenue and expense accounts.  The balance must also show 
any losses as well as the method of making up for them and sources 
for this.

BATLIC STATES - Lithuania approves privatisation programme

The Lithuanian cabinet has endorsed the country's privatisation 
strategy for the next five years, Lithuanian Radio reported on 6th 
December.
Under the second stage of privatisation, set to begin in early 1996, 
shares will be available for cash only, not vouchers.  The value of 
unsold state capital after the first stage of privatisation stands at 
about 7.5-8bn litas (US$1.9-2bn) and property worth 2bn litas could 
be disposed of by the year 2000, with priority being given to 
enterprises already earmarked for privatisation under the first phase 
of sell-offs.
"The government pledges not to sell property hastily or give it out.  
The main criteria will be economic and social results.  The Cabinet 
of Ministers will aspire to legalise privatisation of land not for 
agricultural use. Corporate bodies would be able to purchase the land 
together with other property," the radio station said.
The government has also pledged not to sell off strategic 
installations whose privatisation parliament has opposed.  These are 
mainly power engineering, transport and communications facilities.  
The government is also to take steps to encourage share dealing on 
the stock exchange.

GEORGIA - Georgia gets German loan to develop power engineering, agriculture

The German government has granted Georgia a long-term loan of DM50m 
(US$36m), the Russian news agency, ITAR-TASS reported from Tbilisi on 
27th November, quoting sources at the German embassy.
Of this amount, DM40m is earmarked for the development of the 
country's power engineering sector and 10m for agriculture.  The loan 
is for 40 years, with the first 10 years interest-free.  Georgia is 
to start repaying the loan in 10 years.
Georgia to extract gas from newly-found deposit in Tbilisi
Georgia is to start commercial exploitation of a natural gas deposit 
found in Tbilisi by a team of Georgian and Swiss geologists, the 
Russian news agency, ITAR-TASS, reported from the Georgian capital on 
2nd December.
Gas extraction from the deposit in Tbilisi's Varketili district is to 
begin in January 1996 and initial yield is expected to be 300 cu.m. a 
day, adding that this amount would provide enough natural gas for 
Tbilisi's industrial enterprises during the winter period.  From May 
1996, when extraction is expected to increase, some gas will also be 
supplied to household consumers in Tbilisi.
Georgia currently buys natural gas from Turkmenistan, Russia and 
other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, adding 
that in the past two years household and industrial consumers in 
Georgia had experienced great shortages in gas supplies.

RUSSIA - Moscow pledges tough line on economy

Russia's economics ministry has pledged it would continue to pursue a 
harsh monetary policy designed to stabilise the economy and cut the 
monthly rate of inflation to below 2 per cent, despite the strong 
anti-government protest vote in last month's parliamentary elections.
However, the ministry's tough stance, continued in an annual economic 
forecast, was seemingly at odds with the softer rhetoric employed by 
President Boris Yeltsin in his address to the nation on New Year's 
Eve.
"The main task for 1996 is that those in Russia who are poor should 
begin to live better," he said, promising the government would 
rectify the problem of delayed wage and pension payments which has 
caused great social distress.
Mr Yeltsin also lashed out at the corruption in finanical circles 
which was responsible for diverting money intended for social 
spending.
Mr Yeltsin criticised the economics ministry, employing rhetoric 
reminiscent of the Stalinist era to denounce "saboteurs" who were 
responsible for undermining the reform programme.
He promised to increase payments to pensioners by compensating them 
for savings eroded by the hyper-inflation of the early reform years.
Mr Yeltsin's pledges have led some economists to fear that the 
government may consider loosening its monetary policy pushing up 
inflation early this year.  The government may come under intense 
pressure to increase spending on social protection to curry electoral 
favour before the presidential election in June.
But ministers have repeatedly argued that there is no contradication 
between tight monetary policies and a rise in the standard of living.
Russia confirmed that it had missed the New Year deadline for 
destroying thousands of tanks and other military hardware beyond the 
Ural Mountains and said Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan had 
also failed to meet the treaty commitment, Reuter reports from  
Moscow.
General Dmitry Kharchenko said Moscow wanted to push the 31st 
December 1995 deadline pledged by the Soviet Union in 1991 back to 
the end of 1998.  The pledge had cleared the way for ratification of 
the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.

Economy at year-end

In comparison with the same period last year, Russia's Gross Domestic 
Product has declined by 3 per cent and industrial performance by 2 
per cent.  As before, agriculture is still in dire straits: the 
decline in gross farming output was 12 per cent, or 3 per cent 
higher.  Inflation, which was 18 per cent in January, subsided to 4.9 
per cent by early November, which might be viewed as a success but 
for the fact that it was artificially held back.  Specifically, 
inflation dynamics have been affected by international compression of 
the money supply - wage defaults and belated inflationary 
compensations; payment defaults by the state and by enterprises for 
work performed, orders filled and products supplied.  No growth in 
production as the basis for financial stabilsiation was observed, 
although certain sectors, such as steel and chemical production, are 
showing signs of recovery, reports ECONews.
The social situation is such that real incomes of the population have 
slipped by another 12 per cent.  Debts in the payment of wages by the 
state and enterprises now total over 8 trillion roubles (US$1.8bn), 
or 12 per cent more than last year.  The decreasing standard of 
living of the population, the slump in the caloric value and 
nutritiional balance of the Russians' diet and other factors have led 
to the present lower birth and higher mortality rates.  The size of 
the country's population may fall by over 1 million this year.  
Unemployment has risen sizeably: according to the International 
Labour Organisation, it is 7.8 per cent of the employable population 
(approximately 5.7m people); the Federal Employment Service has 
officially registered 2.8 million jobless on the dole.  The 
superfluous manpower potential is estimated to rise to 10 per cent or 
more (9 to 10 million people) in the near future.

RUSSIA - Coke aims to double Russian investment

Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drinks producer, is planning to 
double its investment in Russia to US$500m by the end of 1997.  The 
US group is seeking to wrest market leadership in Russia from 
PepsiCo, its rival which established a strong presence in the former 
Soviet Union through a series of barter deals during the communist 
era.
Coca-Cola began to invest heavily in central and Eastern Europe 
following the collapse of communism and, along with its bottling 
partners, is planning to spend about US$2bn in the region by the end 
of 1997.
Mr Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola president and chief operating officer, 
said the group was rapidly closing the gap on PepsiCo in Russia.  
Coca-Cola sales almost tripled in Moscow last year and overall in 
Russia had doubled in 1994.  It had quadrupled its sales volume in 
the country since it began to invest in 1991.  The group was being 
out-sold by PepsiCo by a margin of 4 to 1 in Russia two years ago, 
but the gap had fallen this year to less than 2 to 1, and Mr Ivester 
said that the "margin is now near parity."
Coca-Cola has opened a US$40m plant in St Petersburg to serve a 
market of more than 9m people in North-Western Russia.  On 1st 
December, it opened the extension of its US$65m plant in Moscow, 
where it has more than doubled capacity since it opened in April last 
year.
The US$500m investment in Russia is being made by Coca-Cola, along 
with some of its international bottling partners including Inchcape, 
the UK trading group, the Anadolu group of Turkey, and Leventis, 
which already has Coca-Cola bottling plants elsewhere, including 
Greece, Nigeria, Ireland, Bulgaria and Romania.  
In late November, Coca-Cola opened a regional office in Istanbul, as 
a springboard for expansion into Central Asia, where it is planning 
to invest more than US$100m in the next two years.  Anadolu, Turkey's 
largest brewer, has the Coca-Cola bottling rights for Turkmenistan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and parts of Southern Russia.
Inchape announced in September that it was doubling its investment in 
Coca-Cola bottling plants in Russia to US$80m by the end of 1997.
The Coca-Cola system now has a workforce of more than 3,000 in 
Russia, and the US group claims that it supports a further 30,000 
jobs indirectly in local suppliers and services.  It sources locally 
around 70 per cent of the supplies and services needed for the 
production and marketing of its products in Russia.
Having trailed PepsiCo in Eastern Europe during the communist era, 
Coca-Cola claims that it now outsells its rival by 2 to 1 throughout 
the region.

RUSSIA - Daily bread

Today in Russia a loaf of bread costs twice as much as it did a year 
before.  Tomorrow it may cost even more, certain experts forecast, 
reports ECONews.
Their predictions are based on this year's extremely low harvest of 
grain, primarily wheat.  Twenty three per cent less of it has been 
harvested in hopper weight.  The explanations for the lean harvest 
include unfavourable weather, the general farming crisis and 
inadequate financial support from the state.
Public pronouncements that Russia will not import grain any more are 
now being corrected.  Grains (primarily food) will have to be 
imported because, in addition to crop failure, the main Russian 
producers - Kuban and the Stavropol Territory - have gathered in 
disease-stricken wheat which is unfit for baking good bread.  
For this reason Russia's bread-basket, the Don region, has to buy 
wheat abroad, particularly from Hungary, with which it has signed an 
agreement.  In all, 50,000 tonnes of American wheat will be supplied 
to the Voronezh Region, which has also signed a wheat agreement. 
To carry over till next harvest Russia needs at least 10 to 12 
million tonnes of imported grains, mostly food.  Owing to the 
unfavourable situation on the world grain market, the price of grain 
is fluctuating between US$200 and 400 per tonne.

RUSSIA - Problems of comparatively prosperous sectors

One of the most well-off sectors of Russia's economy, the oil 
industry, has of late been facing the same problems as other sectors 
- production fall, default, lack of resources for settlements with 
the budget and wage settlements.  Over nine months the production of 
oil has declined by 4 per cent due to a 6 per cent drop in 
development drilling; the installation of new wells has decreased by 
11 per cent, reports ECONews.
Experts from the Oil and Gas Industrialists' Union are of the same 
mind, though they look deeper into the situation:  "The lack of a 
nominal pricing policy in general, and particularly regarding fuel 
and energy resources; the failure of debtors to pay for fuel 
supplies, including those to CIS countries; the default crisis and 
the tough tax pressures - all this leads, and has already led, to the 
fall of oil production in Russia.  Today tax repayments take more 
than 70 per cent of the profits of oilmen and up to 75 per cent of 
those of gas producers.  Over one-third of the nation's oil wells are 
currently idle, and more than half of all hardware components have 
substantially deteriorated."
Looking into possible sources of financing for the 1996 budget 
deficit, oil and gas industrialists note that much weight has been 
given to receipts from monetary privatisation, above all the 
auctioning of state-held controlling blocks of shares of enterprises 
which are still afloat, including some in the oil and gas complexes.
It is intriguing that the fall in the production of oil and the 
general crisis in the sector are taking place against the background 
of increasing exports of crude oil and products of oil refining.  So 
far, specialists cannot say what the abolition of export taxes and 
quotas of oil and oil products will mean for Russia.  Additional 
billions of dollars for exporters are involved and no-one knows where 
they will end up.

RUSSIA - Sakhalin oilmen lay 7-km underwater pipeline and boost oil extraction

A 7-km underwater oil pipeline has been laid linking Sakhalin Island 
to mainland Russia, Russian Public TV has reported. 
The pipeline, under the Tatarskiy Proliv strait, is the third stage 
of a link between the oil town of Okha, in northern Sakhalin, and the 
town of Komsomolsk-na-Amure on the far Eastern mainland.  The 
underwater section was laid by a team from the 
Sakhalinmorneftemontazh, or Sakhalin offshore oil assembly, company 
and a floating crane from the far Eastern port of Nakhodka.
Oil and gas extraction on Sakhalin are up 13 per cent on last year's 
figures, despite a devastating earthquake in May which damaged over 
500km of main pipeline, power transmission lines, roads, railways and 
dozens of oil and gas wells, to a total cost of R652bn.  Following 
the earthquake, Sakhalin oil companies were permitted to sell 500,000 
tonnes of crude oil abroad free of export duty in order to finance 
reconstruction.

RUSSIA - Many Russian oilfields have high water conten

Experts of the Infotek financial company have concluded that 
currently Russia's recovered oil deposits are flooded by 71.54 per 
cent on average, having analysed data on producing oil fields 
presented by 30 of the largest oil companies in Russia.
The water content in the recovered liquid is the most important 
characteristic of the recovered deposit.  At the beginning of the 
development, oil is almost pure.  As the oil content decreases with 
further extraction, the water content increases both during the use 
of correct and incorrect technology.  As a rule, when the water 
content exceeds 90 per cent, the deposit becomes unprofitable. This 
signifies the beginning of the deposit's end.
Nizhevartovskneftegaz's (nearly 94 per cent) and Bashneft's (over 92 
per cent) fields have the highest water content.  Another nine of 
Russia's largest oil companies are on the verge with 80 per cent 
water content, such as Kondpetroleum, Meginneftegaz, Sakhalin-
morneftegaz, and Tatneft.

RUSSIA - Kabardino-Balkaria becomes oil republic

Russia's southern constituent republic of Kabardino-Balkaria has 
begun commercial production of oil, ITAR-TASS news agency reported on 
1st December.
Quoting a republican government source, the agency said an oil well 
which it named as Kharbizhenskaya had "excellent" prospects and that 
Kabardino-Balkaria "is becoming an oil producing republic."
Initially oil will be carried by tankers for refining in neighbouring 
Ingushetia.  Later, refining equipment, paid for out of federal 
funds, is to be imported from abroad for assembly in the republic.
Groznyy oil refinery covering most of Chechnya's fuel requirements
The Groznyy oil refinery is currently producing 1,500 tonnes of 
petroleum products a day, oil refinery director, Ramzan Zakayev, told 
Interfax on 11th November.  After the restoration operation is 
completed next year the oil refinery will be capable of annually
producing about 10m tonnes of petroleum products, Zakayev said.
The Groznyy oil refinery nearly fully meets Chechnya's needs in 
kerosene, diesel fuel and fuel oil, he said.  After the restoration 
operation is completed, the oil refinery will also meet Chechnya's 
need in high-octance petrol, Zakayev said.
The Groznyy oil refinery's performance was suspended in December 1994 
after military actions were launched in Chechnya.  The oil refinery 
resumed work several months ago, Zakayev said.  
Oil storages were almost fully destroyed and equipment from pump 
stations was stolen during the military actions, Zakayev told 
Interfax..
Zakayev said 7,500 employees were currently working at the oil 
refinery, or 1,000 people fewer than before the armed conflict.  He 
said about 3,000 employees had to take forced leave because the 
restoration operation had not so far been completed.  
Zakayev said the average wage at the oil refinery was about R500,000, 
reports Interfax.  
With regard to wage arrears, Zakayev said the debt on wages for the 
last year and seven months of 1995 had been paid off with the 
assistance from the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry and the state 
commission for rebuilding the Chechen economy, led by Russian First 
Deputy Prime Minister, Oleg Soskovets.

RUSSIA - Power industry

According to the forecasts made by experts of the industry, the 
aggregate capacity of the Russian power plants will amount to about 
200 gigawatts by the year 2000, a decrease of 12 gigawatts compared 
to the present level, reports ECONews.
The exhaustion of the service life of many thermal power plants, 
which now account for 70 per cent of the total output of electricity, 
and meet nearly half of the country's requirements for heat, is the 
root cause of the expected drop.  To prevent such a decline, it is 
necessary to put annually into operation facilities able to generate 
8-9 gigawatts of electricity, in order to compensate for the closure 
of worn-out ones.  It is noteworthy that, despite the decline, the 
sector remains a major exporter of electricity, supplying up to 
twenty billion kilowatt-hours per annum to Western Europe alone.

RUSSIA - Coal industry

If nothing unforeseen happens, the coal industry should become 
profitable within the next five-seven years.  This forecast was made 
by general director of the Rosugol state company, Yuri Malyshev.  The 
progressive movement in this direction has been achieved through the 
shut-down of the loss-making coal mines - 34 collieries have ceased 
to exist over the past eighteen months, reports ECONews.
The wage-payment arrears, which now total nearly one-trillon roubles, 
are the most pressing problem in the industry at the present time.  
Approximately 70 per cent of them stem from non-payments by coal 
consumers, and 30 per cent from sluggish federal budget financing. 
During the past three months alone, the deficit of the budget 
financing of the coal sector reached 116 trillion roubles.
The government views regional and inter-regional mutual settlements, 
as well as the introduction of a market mechanism for charging 
overdue debts towards debtors' property, as a way to resolve the non-
payments problem.  Such tough sanctions will not affect enterprises 
of the munitions industry and higher education establishments. 
Vladimir Gusev, the chairman of the State Duma committee for 
industry, construction, transport and energy, believes that the "coal 
crisis" can be ended through immediate payment of the federal debts 
to the coal workers.  This can be done by working out and fulfilling 
a state programme of restructuring the industry, with due account 
taken of the specific economic and social features of the country's 
coal fields, and by ensuring the spending of the subsidies from the 
federal budget mainly on the development of production, restructuring 
of enterprises, and material support to miners who lose their jobs as 
a result of the shut-down of coal production units.
Russia expected to produce 122 tonnes of gold in 1995
Russia is expected to extract 122 tonnes of gold by the end of 1995, 
down from 131  last year, Interfax news agency reported on 29th 
November, quoting an unnamed official from the Russian Federation 
Committee for Precious Metals and Stones.
The official said the country's total gold production for 1995, 
including gold obtained from mine tailings and waste, could reach 
129t, compared with 142.6t in 1994.  Up to November, gold-extracting 
enterprises have produced over 100t.
The committee official was also quoted as saying advance payments to 
gold-producing enterprises, which were due to begin in November, had 
to be postponed after the president ordered the government to sell 
part of Russia's gold reserves to pay pensions.  He said, however, 
that the money was coming "in the very near future."  Gold producers 
are expected to receive in prepayments 25 per cent of the value of 
their 130t quota for 1996.  Those operating "in particularly hard 
conditions" could get as much as 50 per cent, compared with 35 per 
cent in 1995.

RUSSIA - Privatisation: Facts and Figures

The share of the private (privatised) sector of the Russian economy 
in the creation of the Gross Domestic Product of the Russian 
Federation has exceeded the share of the state sector, and keeps 
growing steadily.  The income from the privatisation stage of 1992, 
amounted to 56.2bn roubles (14.6bn were transferred to the federal 
budget); in 1993, some 355bn was earned (71.1bn); in 1994, 984bn 
(117.4bn); and in 1995 the total income from the privatisation is 
expected to be around 24 trillion roubles (US$4.8bn), of which 9.3 
per cent are destined for the national treasury.  As of 1st October 
1995, a mere 162bn roubles had been received.  
A sum total of revenues from privatisation, amounting to 11.4 
trillion roubles, has been included in calculations for the draft 
budget for 1996, reports ECONews.
According to the calculations by the Institute for Economic Analysis, 
the nominal income from privatisation, taking the inflation index 
into account, i.e, its real value, has dropped by 34 per cent, and 
the federal budget revenues by 49 per cent as against 1992.  The 
figures were down by 13 and 48 per cent respectively in 1994 
(compared to the previous year), and this trend is expected to 
persist in 1995.  Approximately 20 per cent of all receipts are spent 
on financing the privatisation process itself, and on the maintenance 
of the agencies which carry it out.
Of the enterprises privatised in 1995, 38 per cent were in the 
industrial sector, 18 in construction, 11 in trade, 6.2 in transport, 
and 4.5 per cent in science; 34 per cent of the 279 million shares 
issued in the country of "privatisation-95," were bought by the 
personnel of those enterprises, and 6 per cent were sold to trust and 
holding companies.  
Approximately 84m shares were sold on the free market, and 40m of 
them have not been sold yet.  The controlling blocks of shares, owned 
by the state, comprises 67m shares with a nominal value of 51.3bn 
roubles.

UKRAINE - Social pressures prevent closure of Ukraine's inefficient coal mines

Ukraine's coal production will be down another 11.1 per cent this 
year at 83.9m tonnes, according to the latest government estimate.  
The continuing slide - from 179m tonnes in 1990 - will force the once 
mighty coal producer to raise imports next year to 20m tonnes at an 
estimated cost of US$500m, the Kiev parliament's budget committee 
chairman has announced.  Russia and Poland are to supply the bulk of 
the coal, as in the past two years.
However, Ukraine also plans to export 3m tonnes of coal next year, 
mostly to Western countries, which pay with much-needed hard 
currency.  Imports are usually paid for by barter and domestic prices 
are regulated.  The country imported an estimated 12.3m tonnes in the 
first nine months of this year and exported 1.7m tonnes, worth 
US$51m.
Exhausted pits and antiquated technology are at the root of the 
crisis in the mining sector, which mirrors the broader economic 
downturn in Ukraine.
The government this year cut all support, after propping up 
inefficient producers with monthly US$50m subsidies in 1994.
But the cabinet's decision in May to close 15 pits and a coal mining 
strip by the new year - emergency measures designed to push ahead 
economic reform - was not backed by the necessary political will.  Mr 
Oleksandr Kolosok, spokesman for the coal ministry, has said the 
closure had been indefinitely postponed.  "The main problem is 
people: the mines can't be closed because entire towns completely 
depend on them," he said.  RIf you close the mine, everyone will be 
left without jobs or support.  The young can find other work but what 
about the older pensioners?"
He added that the government lacked funding to close the mines 
properly, and continuing to operate them was cheaper.  The World Bank 
is considering a loan of up to US$80m to cover all closure costs.
All the 257 mines remain open.  But with wages falling and often left 
unpaid, the number of miners this year fell 9.3 per cent to 426,017, 
down from 529,000 in 1992, according to coal ministry statistics.

1989            179.21          n/a
*estimated

The political fear centres around labour unrest and unemployment, 
which could destabilise the government.  In December, Kiev agreed to 
pay US$270m in back pay - a potentially inflation-stoking settlement 
- after a large walkout in the coal-rich eastern Donbass region.  
Most Ukrainians live in the eastern regions, which spent the longest 
time under communism and may be most open to Russian revanchism.
Some miners support closures to concentrate resources in the better 
pits and compete with Russian mines, where many Ukrainians now work.  
But Mr Kolosok argued that Ukraine could not compete with Russia, 
whose mines are mechanised and more efficient.
The mining sector also has been hurt by the government's reluctance 
to liberalise domestic energy prices.  In a recent interview, Mr 
Evhen Marchuk, Ukraine's prime minister, said household tariffs, now 
at 60 per cent cost recovery, will cover 80 per cent next year and 
full cost by 1997.  He added full liberalisation, expected by the new 
year, had to be postponed.  Industrial users are charged the market 
price, but payment discipline among the largely unprofitable state 
sector remains poor.
As the government slows painful restructuring the mines are taking a 
heavy environmental and health toll.  The pits contribute 3 per cent 
of the world's emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas associated with 
global warming.
Gas de France, Charbonnages de France, and Hunosa, a Spanish coal 
mining company, this year started to look at developing coal gas 
methane in a project funded by the European Union.  But the gas is 
not trapped and sold at present.
In December, two miners died in separate accidents in Donetsk, the 
capital of the Donbass region.  By this year, the fatality rate among 
Ukrainian miners rose to five per 1m tonnes of coal produced, the 
highest in the world, according to Mr Kolosok.

UKRAINE - Opportunity knocks for Kiev

Imagine a capital city in Europe where there is such a storage of 
office space that embassies are run from hotels rooms and 
multinational subsidiaries work from suburban houses.  That city is 
Kiev, capital of Ukraine. which is one of the largest countries in 
Europe.
Property consultant, Aldon Ferguson, believes opportunities in Kiev 
are enormous "since there are hardly any quality office buildings and 
only one good hotel: the 25-room Domus, refurbished by an Italian 
company"S
More foreign companies are opening up in the city, joining the 
growing list of blue chip concerns that include Philip Morris, 
Motorola, Siemens and large,  international accountancy practices.  
Ferguson, who pioneered Western property consultancies in Moscow and 
St Petersburg before selling out to DTZ Debenham Zadelhoff, said:  
"Kiev is the capital of a large country and will need to build all 
the facilities that suit that position"S
Canadians are further down the road than most in investing in Kiev 
because of a large expatriate Ukrainian population in their country, 
although Austrian and Dutch banks are also ready to put money into 
the city; but as with anywhere else in the former communist bloc, the 
route to successful investing is strewn with pitfalls, not least by 
the conflicting views of the local authority and national government 
in Kiev.
The result is that although Western companies are desperate for 
accommodation, they are reluctant to own buildings, a difficult 
enough task in any case.  A developer, or occupier, needs a 
refurbishment certificate to obtain a 49-year lease which is 
automatically renewable.
Ferguson calculates that a developer would need to spend US$2,000 a 
square metre on buying an interest and refurbishing it to a high 
standard.
An example of the potential for developers is that refurbishing a 1-
000 square metre for US$25m will bring in an annual rent of 
US$720,000 on a five year lease, with the first five year's rent in 
advance.
While this is an attractive proposition, the difficulty is to 
persuade companies to pre-let a building before construction starts.
Another aspect of the economic situation in Ukraine is that 
successful local entrepreneurs tend to move their money out of the 
country rather than spending it locally.
But, Ferguson believes that, potentially, Ukraine is a rich country.  
For centuries it has been referred to as the breadbasket of Europe 
because of its high grain production.  The Black Sea ports should 
become successful with the expansion of trade with Russia and other 
countries in the region.  And, while it may not be politically 
correct to mention it, Ukrainians are such heavy smokers that the 
large tobacco companies, Philip Morris and BAT, see a sizeable market 
for their products.

AVIATION - Defence Ministry stalls on rocket engine export deal

US and manufacture them there under licence are on hold following 
calls from Russia's Defence Ministry, to examine the economic and 
military implications of the deal, Interfax news agency reported on 
6th December.  The contract was concluded between Aerojet of the US 
and Samara-based Dvigateli NK.
A senior Defence Ministry official explained that although the 
original Lockheed Martin tender to find the best engine for the Atlas 
booster had envisaged only commercial launches "the US side changed 
the competition terms in November 1995S and there are now concerns 
that boosters with Russian engines could be used for military 
purposes.  The Defence Ministry has urged further examination of the 
contract since it has no authority to grant or deny export 
permission, which is the government's prerogative.
In addition, he said that the contractual price of an NK-33 engine, 
estimated at US$1.1m, not only failed to meet production costs but 
was much lower than world prices for analogous products, while US$5m 
for a licence to produce NK-33 engines in the US was simply Rabsurd."  
"Equipment of such a high level costs at least from US$100m to 
US$150m."
The official questioned whether the NK-33 project was the most 
economically-advantageous option.  He claimed that the contract to 
sell NK-33s in the US would bring Russia only US$100m, whereas Pratt 
& Whitney, also of the US, was willing to invest US$150m in the the 
state-run Energomnash company in the initial phase of co-operation, 
with a view to joint production of a new generation engine.  Under 
this alternative scheme, RProduction of RD-180 engines in Russia will 
allow Russia to receive orders worth over US$1bn within 20 years."
In a separate report, Interfax quoted the head of Aerojet's advanced 
research department, Mark Constantine, as telling a news conference 
in Sacramento, California, that he acknowledged Russian concerns but 
did not agree with them.  "Fifty per cent of modernised Atlas, Delta 
and Titan boosters with Russian engines are to be used for commercial 
flights and the remainder, for the sounding and photographing of the 
Earth, launch of cartographic satellites and monitoring the launches 
of ballistic missiles in third countries," he said.
Interfax said that Russia could lose more than US$350m unless 
permission to move the engines out of Russia and the licence for 
their manufacture in the US were forthcoming in the near future.  The 
NK-33, a reusable engine, was developed 25 years ago for the N-1 
booster which was to be used in the Soviet lunar programme.
On 9th December, Interfax said that the Aerojet contract to export 72 
NK-33 engines to the US was worth US$350m.

AVIATION - Russia to repay debt to Finland in surface to air missiles

Russia is to export air defence missile systems to Finland to clear 
part of a debt owed by the former Soviet Union, Russia's ITAR-TASS 
news agency reported on 30th November from Helsinki.
An agreement was reached at the end of a three-day conference of 
Russian and Finnish defence experts to export 1bn Finnish markka 
(US$230m) worth of Buk M1 missiles, known in the West as SA-11, to 
provide air defence around Helsinki.  The terms of the export 
contract have not yet been set, but deliveries are likely to start in 
1996.
The agency quoted Finnish Minister of Defence, Anneli Taina, as 
saying that the agreement was a major step towards resolving the 
issue of Russia's debt to Finland, which has been impeding trade 
between the two countries.  The debt owed by the former Soviet Union 
and taken on by Russia totals 5.5bn Finnish markka (US$1.25bn).
RIA news agency said the new missiles would replace the current 
Pechora (SA-3) air defence system around Helsinki by the year 2000.  
RIA quoted the chief of the Finnish defence forces, Gustav Heglund, 
as saying Finland relied on missile defences and not on aviation to 
ward off air attack, and that Finnish specialists had assessed the 
SA-11 as being best suited to the task.  "The high technical 
characteristics and quality of the system determined our choice," 
Heglund said.

BROADCASTING & TELECOMMUNICATIONS -
Italian group denies Russian telecom deal is off

Stet was still interested in acquiring a 25 per cent stake in Sviazinvest, 
the Russian telephone company due for privatisation, despite an 
official Russian notice that the deal was off.
In a statement issued on 26th December, the Italian group also denied 
that the recent Russian parliamentary elections had contributed to 
the failure to secure a deal planned by 22nd December.
The statement said complex legal considerations and the need for 
adequate guarantees had helped to postpone the purchase, which would 
cost Stet US$640m, with a commitment to invest a further US$770m.
Despite the Italian insistence on pressing ahead with the operation, 
Mr Maxim Boyko, head of the Russian Privatisation Centre, said that 
Stet would no longer be investing in Sviazinvest.  He said:  
"Although it was a difficult decision to reject the final conditions 
offered by Stet it was the right decision and I do not regret it."
Mr Boyko went on to describe Stet's behaviour as "impossible to 
understand" and he expressed confidence that the shares would be sold 
next year on terms considerably more favourable than those offered by 
Stet.
He discounted the political risk in delaying the tender until next 
year:  "I don't think that in the short run the political constraints 
would prevent the tender from happening."
The Russians objected to the recent demand by Stet that an escrow 
account be set up to hold the funds for investment until all the 
conditions sought by the Italians had been met.  Officials argued 
that the request showed an inappropriate distrust of the Russian 
government and unfairly went beyond the terms of the initial tender.
A Russian statement issued on 25th December said:  "Despite the 
desire of the Russian government to find a compromise, Stet insisted 
upon forms of payment that went beyond the conditions of the tender."
But Stet has said that the company had to be prudent and the escrow 
account was intended to demonstrate such prudence.  Stet's shares 
rose 2.2 per cent at  the news on the Milan bourse.  Analysts said 
the markets had regarded the Russian attempt to cancel the deal with 
scepticism, as Stet's offer was some US$200m above the nearest bid.
Stet has set five conditions for the completion of the acquisition.  
The most important of these centres on a clarification of the 
relationship between Sviazinvest and Rostelecom, the main Russian 
telecommunications company.
Sviazinvest is now a holding company for 85 regional telecoms firms 
in a so far ill-defined role.  Stet has not yet been satisfied 
regarding the role of those regional companies or future tariff 
structure.  These are also questions about long distance traffic 
within Russia and the valuable international telecoms business.
Until now Stet has tried and failed to break into large international 
telecoms contracts and business.  In Eastern Europe it has twice been 
passed over despite higher bids in Hungary and the Czech Republic in 
privatisation programmes.
It has been left to pick business in Latin American privatisations, 
being present in Argentina and latterly Bolivia.  Thus, the Russian 
deal was seen as an important opportunity.
From Russia's perspective, the reformist camp in the government has 
been anxious to make the telecoms sector a model for state 
divestment. This was particularly important for Mr Anatoly Chubais, 
the deputy prime minister and architect of Russian reforms, who was 
the main force behind telecoms privatisation.
The bond mass privatisation programme which Mr Chubais launched in 
1992 earned Russia praise for its swift reforms:  But last year, the 
country's privatisation record was marked by the second stage of 
privatisation which many observers have criticised as a secretive 
process, arranged to benefit government insiders.
For the Russian government, the telecoms privatisation was envisioned 
as an important source of budgetary revenue in 1995.  Moscow's urgent 
need to cover the deficit was one reason the government sought to 
push through the deal rapidly.  However, the government may prefer to 
proceed at a more leisurely pace now that the urgency which drove the 
tender has evaporated.

Latvia and Belarus arrange direct fibre-optic telephone link
The Lattelekom company has concluded an agreement with its Belarusian

The connection is expected greatly to improve the quality of 
communications.  The agreement also provides for transition to 
digital networks.  Currently, Latvia and Belarus are connected by 120 
analogue lines, two-thirds of which run through Lithuania, while the 
rest go via Russia.  After the new system is introduced, Latvia and 
Belarus will no longer have to use the services of third countries.
The agreement is effective from 1996, after Lattelekom has an optical 
cable in place up to the country's eastern town of Kraslava.

ENERGY - Tender for 12 oil and gas fields in Udmurtia to be held in 1996

An open international tender for the right to develop 12 oil and gas 
fields in Udmurtia is to be held in 1996 by the government of this 
Russian constituent republic and the Russian Committee on Geology and 
the Use of Mineral Resources, Interfax news agency reported on 19th 
December.
The winner of the tender will have to sign a production-sharing 
agreement with the Russian federal government, the government of 
Udmurtia and a consortium to be set up to implement the project.  The 
consortium will be led by the winner of the tender and include 
Udmurtgeologiya and Udmuttort companies, and possibly some other 
Russian companies.  Each company's share will be set separately for 
each of the 12 fields.
The winner needs to offer effective technical solutions and the most 
lucrative plan for the project, prove its ability to finance it and 
buy a full package of geological data.  Also, it will have to arrange 
a US$250m loan to fund a programme aimed at upgrading Udmutia's 
Izhmash vehicle works.  The government's share of Izhmash's profits 
will serve as security for the loan.

ENERGY -Winners of LUKoil investment tender announced

The Russian investment company, Nikoil, has won an investment auction 
for a 16.07 per cent stake in LUkoil, Russia's biggest oil company, 
Interfax news agency reported on 28th December.
Nikoil won the auction with a pledge to invest R800bn, outbidding the 
only other contender, Yedinstvo-94, which offered R799bn.  Interfax 
quoted LUKoil officials as saying the investment programme for 1996-
1997 aimed to upgrade the company's refineries in Perm in the Urals 
and in Volgorad in Southern Russia, increasing the depth of refining 
there to 86-88 per cent, bringing quality in line with international 
standards and reducing production costs.
ITAR-TASS news agency said Nikoil had pledged to invest R160bn in the 
programme in January 1996, another R291bn before the end of 1996 and 
R349bn in 1997.  The implementation of the programme is expected to 
increase LUKoil's total annual output of oil products by 4m tonnes, 
including petrol output by 2m.
LUKoil incorporates seven oil producers and two oil refineries, 
Interfax recalled, adding that its annual output exceeded 50m tonnes 
of crude.

ENERGY - Russia,Total heading for oil and gas co-operation project

Russia plans to sign an agreement with France's Total to launch a 
joint oil and gas project in northern Russia, Interfax  reports.
The project, recently given the go-ahead by the Russian government,  
needs the approval of the administratation of the Nenets Autonomous 
Area, where the development work is to be launched to extact oil and 
gas condensate from the Kharyaginskoye desposit, which has estimated 
reserves of 160.4m tonnes.  Total is to invest US$1bn in the project.
Interfax quoted sources in the Nenets administration as saying 
approval for the agreements could prove difficult, since its 
opponents believed it did not allow the Russian side to seek greater 
participation in the project.  Meanwhile the Russian government's 
Expert Council said after studying the project that  a high content 
of hydrogen sulphide (up to 4 per cent) and parafinn (up to 20-25 per 
cent) in casing-head gas would necessitate the use of special anti-
corrosion equipment and technologies, which made the participation of 
Russian construction companies in the project doubtful.

ENERGY - Iran rejects Azeri proposal to develop Caspian oil and gas field

Iran has rejected an Azerbaijani offer of a share in the development 
of the Shakhdeniz oil and gas field in Azerbaijan's sector of the 
Caspian Sea, the Russian news agency reported from Tehran on 9th 
December.
The agency quoted an unnamed official at the Iranian Oil Ministry as 
saying that until "the question of the Caspian legal status and 
division of oil and gas field zones between the coastal states" was 
settled, Iranian participation in the development of Azerbaijani and 
other Caspian fields was "problematic."
The official said Iran was interested in joint oil development 
projects with Russia, and added that Tehran had submitted proposals 
to the Russian oil company, LUKoil, on 10 projects in the Gulf with 
costs ranging between US$1bn and US$4.5bn.
French-Norwegian alliance wins tender for operations in Caspian
A French-Norwegian alliance has won a tender to form a joint venture 
for offshore diving and underwater operations in the Caspian Sea, 
Interfax news agency reported on 27th November from the Azerbaijani 
capital, Baku.
The partners that won the tender, launched last July, are the French 
company, Comex, which produces diving equipment and underwater 
structures and develops underwater technologies, and a Norweigan 
company, identified as Stolp Komex Seaways, which constructs, 
inspects and repairs underwater pipelines.
Pyotr Gurtovenko of the Azerbaijani State Oil Company, told Interfax 
that the joint venture would be formed on the basis of the underwater 
and rescue operations department of his company.
He added that the involvement of such a strong alliance would help 
the new venture obtain an international certificate for underwater 
operations and take part in tenders announced by Azerbaijan's 
International Operational Company to co-ordinate the developmetn of 
the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oilfields.

ENERGY - Russia helps build Beijing power station

Russia is to help China construct a heat and power station in the 
east of Beijing, which, when operational, will supply the whole of 
the east of the city with electricity and hot water,  reports the 
ITAR-TASS news agency.
The Huaneng-Beijing heat and power plant will have four power units 
and a total capacity of 654MW.
A spokesman for the Russian company, Energomasheksport, said that 
Russian organisations had completed design work on the plant and 40 
per cent of material and equipment had been delivered to the site.  
Given the "serious lack of demand" in the Russian economy, the 
project was supplying many Russian companies with major orders, the 
spokesman said, noting that more than 120 Russian enterprises were 
involved in the project.  In addition, for the first time in a 
Russian-Chinese projects accounts in the US$127.8m contract would be 
settled in convertible currencywhich was an "excellent opportunity" 
for Russian firms, he said.
Energomasheksport is contracted to carry out assembly work, supervise 
construction and train Chinese specialists.
Russia to resume Iranian nuclear plant construction early next year
Russia is likely to resume the construction of the Bushehr nuclear 
power plant in Southern Iran in January or February 1996, the Russian 
news agency ITAR-TASS  news agency  reports from Tehran, quoting 
Valentin Rumyantsev, head of the Russian trade mission there.  
Rumyantsev said, however, that a lot depended on the timely transfer 
of Iranian payments to the accounts of Russian organisations.  Under 
the terms of the US$800m contract, Iran must transfer to the Rusisan 
side at least 10 per cent of the project's cost, or about US$58m, in 
hard currency.  Other payments are to be made in Iranian currency, 
the rial, and in goods.
The contract to complete the construction of the Bushehr nuclear 
power plant by Russia was signed in Teheran in January 1995 and comes 
into force at the end of the year.  It said a delegation of experts 
from the Russian organisations involved in the project was to arrive 
in Tehran on 24th November to discuss a number of finanical and 
technical issues and to sign documents.

SPACE - Russian and US companies sign contract on space technology

Russian and US companies have signed their first ever contract in 
Russia on the provision of space photographs of the Earth's surface 
taken by Russia's military communications satellites.  Yuriy Milov, 
Deputy Director-General of the Russian Space Agency, said the work 
under the contract would be carried out by  the intersectoral 
association, Sovinformsputnik, in Russia and by the companies, 
Central Trading Systems, Lambda Tech International and Aerial Images, 
in the US.
According to Yuriy Milov, photographs of some areas in the American 
states of Florida, South and North Carolina and Alabama, as well as 
in some countries in the Asian Pacific region will be taken by the 
well-known Kosmos satellite which the machine-building works in 
Samara has been producing for over 15 years.  The task of the US 
companies will be to process and sell the photographs.  Their exact 
price has not yet been fixed but according to Yuriy Milov, it will be 
without consumer research.  
The joint venture will start operating in the middle of 1996.  Both 
the Russian and the American side preferred to keep silent on the 
subject of the contract's overall value.

TRANSPORT - Kraysnoye Sormovo shipyard allowed to sell submarine abroad

The Russian defence Ministry, has allowed the Krasnoye Sormovo 
shipyard in Nizhniy Novgorod to complete the construction of a 
Varshavyanka-class diesel-powered submarine begun in 1992, and sell 
it abroad, Interfax news agency reported on 12th December, from the 
city, quoting a source in the shipyard's management.
The ministry said, however, that it could not provide the plant with 
the necessary funding for the project.  Krasnoye Sormovo is now 
looking for a buyer for the submarine and for a creditor to provide 
funds to complete its construction.
Two Varshavyanka submarines were sold to the Chinese Navy earlier in 
the year for an estimated US$200-250m.  The shipyard has also held 
sales negotiations with Indonesia, India and Malaysia.
The volume of production at Krasnoye Sormovo fell by 27 per cent this 
year, largely because of the lack of solvent demand for its civilian 
output and the state's failure to order submarines.  The plant's only 
profit-yielding project is the production of river-sea cargo vessels.

AUTOMOBILE & AVIATION -
Company formed to modernise Moscow's airports; foreign investors needed

Transport on 28th November, decided to set up a new company, Aero-
Moskva, to gradually modernise the four airports - Sheremetyevo, 
Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Bykovo - that make up the hub of Russia's 
airways.
Vadim Zamotin, director of the Department of Air Transport of the 
Russian Transport Ministry, said the company would be made up of 
federal government shares of 50 per cent in Sheremetyevo, 50 per cent 
in Domodedovo, 25.5 per cent of Bykovo-Avia and 15.5 per cent of 
Vnukovo.  Overall, Moscow plans to borrow US$300m from the World Bank 
to modernise the hub, money that should be supplemented by the 
government, airlines, the airports themselves and foreign and 
domestic investors.  The airports, moreover, will be exempt from 
local and federal taxes.  So will anybody who invests in them.
There has not been any real capital investment in airports for the 
last five years, Zamotin said.  Problems with capacity and flight 
safety could emerge by the end of the century if something is not 
done now, he said.  
Passenger service, he admitted, falls well below international 
standards.  The whole system of flight control needs to be renovated.  
The Ministry of Transport, Zamotin said, has drawn up a US$5bn 
investment programme to take the hub to the year 2025.  Immediate 
problems should be solved by 1997, (when Moscow is due to mark its 
850th anniversary) at a cost of R1,276bn.
The four Moscow airports account for 27 per cent and 17 per cent of 
all domestic passenger and freight turnover and 74 per cent of 
international passenger traffic.  Over 70 airlines are based in the 
city and region of Moscow.

credit agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and

Unibanka will receive US$20m over six years as loan capital for 
various  projects.  The EBRD already has credit lines to Latvia's 
Zemes Banka (Land Bank) and the Vacijas-Latvijas Banka (German-
Latvian Bank).
Bank of Latvia revokes licences of six commercial banks
The Bank of Latvia has revoked the licences of the Latvian Deposit 
Bank (LDB), Central Bank, the Liepaja commercial bank, the Alejas 
commercial bank, Olti-Bank and the Lettika commercial bank, Baltic 
News Service reported from Riga on 6th December, quoting Centre 
Bank's press centre.
The Latvian Commercial Court declared Centre Bank insolvent on 6th 
June, LDB on 12th June, Liepaja commercial bank on 14th June, the 
Alejas commercial bank on 10th July, and the Olti-Bank on 15th 
November.  A decision to liquidate Olti-Bank was taken on 15th 
December.
Explaining the reasons for the revocation of the licences, Baltic 
News Service said that the capital of LDB, Central Bank and the 
Liepaja and Alejas commercial banks was smaller than the minimum 
shareholding capital set out in banking legislation.  LDB, Liepaja 
and Alejas banks had also failed to observe the rules on short-term 
liquidity.  Lettika's licence was revoked because it had not 
undertaken the work required to put it finances in order after Bank 
of Latvia President, Einars Repse had banned it from performing any 
banking transactions with effect from 30th August of last year.

Bulgak said the emphasis would be on attracting major companies, 
which are expected to contribute 41.5 per cent of total investment.  
This year foreign businesses have invested US$520m in Russian 
telecommunications.  According to Bulgak, this shows that they regard 
the section as attractive.
The agency quoted Bulgak as saying foreign investment was 
particularly important now that government support for 
telecommunications had almost ceased.  Other sources of extra funding 
for the sector, the minister said, will include the circulation of 
"telephone bonds," a more effective tariff policy and the 
introduction of charges for local calls in 1996.

CREDIT & DEBIT - EBRD helps Russian-Spanish joint venture

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  (EBRD) will 
provide a US$11m (ECU9.1m) loan to the Russian-Spanish Joint venture 
AO Bashkortostan-Kelme.  The company is located in Meleuz (Repubic of 
Bashkortostan), Russian Federation, approximately 1,200-kilometres 
south-east of Moscow and 200km north of Ufa, reported a recent EBRD 
press release. 
AO Bashkortostan-Kelme will manufacture a large variety of high-
quality sports and leisure shoes, primarily for the Russian domestic 
market.  Given the strong historical tradition of the former Soviet 
Union in the area of athletics, the project sponsors expect the 
domestic market for such shoes to grow substantially over the coming 
years.  The joint venture will also manufacture all necessary 
components for the sports and leisure shoes and will assume the role 
of supplier of such components to the other Kelme joint venture in 
Eastern Europe (in Moldova and Belarus).
The joint venture will be equipped with modern shoe production 
equipment, sourced primarily from Spain, Italy and Japan.  EBRD 
financing will be used to a large extent for the acquisition of such 
equipment as well as for working capital purposes.  In addition to 
the technology transfer benefit associated with the project, over 700 
new skilled jobs will be created in the region of Bashkortostan over 
the next years.  The project is also expected to stimulate local 
suppliers of leather and other materials required for the production 
of shoes.  An additional beneficial effect for the country is the 
substitution of domestic production for hard currency imports. 
The loan has seven  years maturity including a grace period of 1.5 
years, and amounts to US$11 million.  Its spread is LIBOR-based plus 
a credit margin.
The project will be co-financed to the amount of US$11.4m by Banco 
Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and Instituto de Crdito Official (IOC), with 
export credit coverage provided by Companola de Crdito a la Exportacion 
del Desarrollo (COFIDES), a Spanish governmental agency specialised 
in the promotion of Spanish investments abroad that will provide a 
subordinated loan to the joint venture.  For further information,

CREDIT & DEBIT - Spanish-Moldovan footwear joint venture

US$7.3m (ECU 6.0 million) loan will go to the Spanish-Moldovan joint 
venture, Ascom-Kelme S.A., to partially finance equipment and working 
capital needs for a shoe production facility in Orhei, Republic of 
Moldova, reported The European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development  (EBRD) on 31st October.  The creation of a local 
production and distribution capacity for high-quality sports and 
leisure shoes will serve the needs of the markets of Moldova, Russia 
and other countries of the former Soviet Union, and Romania.  Once 
full production capacity is reached, the joint venture will produce 
three million sports and leisure shoes per year.
The investment will create 1,200 jobs in a district with high 
unemployment and is expected to generate significant hard currency 
earnings for Moldova.  The joint venture will benefit from state-of 
the-art Western machinery and will have full technological and 
training support by the Spanish partner.  In addition the project is 
designed to rely primarily on production inputs from the Russian 
Federation and other countries of the former Soviet Union and is 
therefore expected to create significant backward linkages with 
suppliers of the shoes industry of the region, used to finance shoe 
production machinery and working capital needs.
Five years' maturity includes a grace period; interest on the US$7.3 
million loan is LIBOR-based plus a credit margin.  The project will 
be co-financed to the amount of US$7.2m (ECU5.9m) by Banco Bilbao 
Vizcaya and Instituto de Crdito Official, with export coverage 
provided by Compania Espanola de Seguros de Crdito a la Exportacion. For

The board of the International Monetary Fund has approved an extended 
loan to Kyrgyzstan of US$48m within the framework of an agreed three-
year credit programme, the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS reported 
from Washington.  The funds are being allocated to support a 
programme of economic and structural reforms being carried out by the 
Kyrgyz government.The three-year programme for Kyrgyzstan was 
approved by the IMF in May 1994 and originally provided for a total 
of US$105m.  However, taking account of the country's "considerable 
progress" in implanting reforms the Fund decided to increase the loan 
to US$131m.
The aim of the programme is to achieve by the end of 1996 a 2.5 per 
cent growth in GDP, a reduction in the annual rate of inflation to 15 
per cent and a cut in the budget deficit from the current 11.3 per 
cent of GDP to 5.5 per cent.

The loan is granted for 17 years, with no payments due in the first 
five years.
The US$34m programme, designed for the period until the year 2001, is 
aimed at helping Russia join the World Trade Organisation.  Canada 
has pledged to donate US$0.8m, and the remaining US$9.2m are to be 
provided by the Russian government.  The Russian Federation Committee 
for Standardisation, Metrology and Certification has been put in 
charge of implementating the programme.

CURRENCIES -Fixed exchange rate band for Belarus

Belarus could introduce a fixed exchange rate band for its natural 
currency, the Belarusian rouble, in 1996,  Russian newspaper 
'Kommersant Daily' said on the 9th December, citing Tamara Vinnikava, 
chairman of Savings Bank - Belarusbank.
Vinnikava said all the necessary calculations had been completed and 
a draft presidential decree drawn up.  Many economists in the country 
support the introduction of the so-called "hard-currency corridor" as 
an alternative to a rapid devaluation of the Belarusian rouble.
According to Vinnikava, the lower limit of the fixed band is to be 
set initially at the current exchange rate of 11,000 Belarusian 
roubles to the dollar.

ENERGY - LUKoil awarded five per cent of own stock in shares-for-loan sale

The right to manage a 5 per cent package of state-owned shares in 
Russian oil major, LUKoil, has been won by a consortium made up of 
LUKoil itself and Bank Imperial, Interfax news agency reported, 
quoting the chairman of the State Committee for the Management of 
State Property and head of the commission organising the auction, 
Alfred Kokh.
The consortium offered the Russian government a loan of US$35.10m for 
the shares, US$0.1m more than the asking price of US$35m, which was 
offered by rival bidder, the National Reserves Bank. Under the terms 
of the shares-for-loans auction, the winner is to pay off debts of up 
to R500bn run by the LUKoil subsidiaries.
LUKoil extracted 45.1m tonnes of crude oil in 1994 and refined 19.7m 
tonnes.

ENERGY -Yukos postpones sale of 8 per cent stake till next year

Russia's Federal Property Fund has postponed the sale of 7.96 per 
cent of shares in the Yukos oil company to prevent its being 
overshadowed by the shares-for-loans auction and investment tender 
under which a 78 per cent holding in the company which was to be sold 
on 8th December, Interfax news agency reported.
A Yukos spokesman said that the decision had been made at the request 
of the company management, which was worried that shares might be 
undervalued if sold too soon after the larger block.  The cash 
auction is now likely to be held in the first quarter of 1996.
Under plans for privatising Yukos, 45 per cent of company shares are 
to remain state property for three years.  Investment bids will be 
invited for 33 per cent of shares on 8th December, at the same time 
as 78 per cent of state-owned shares are sold in a shares-for loans 
auction.  Of the remaining 22 per cent, 14 per cent are to be 
distributed amongst Yukos staff and management and the remainder will 
now be sold at cash auction next year.
Russian coal industry could get US$500m loan from World Bank
The World Bank is likely to grant Russia a loan of US$500m  to back 
reforms in its coal industry, Interfax news agency reported on 27th 
October, quoting the bank's president, James Wolfensohn.
According to Wolfensohn, reforms to be developed jointly with the 
Russian side in 1996-97 will aim to provide more social guarantees 
for miners, including retraining and employment of redundant workers.  
Before this, however, the Russian government should start a systemic 
transformation of the coal industry, reducing state subsidies, 
ensuring higher profits from coal production under market conditions 
and closing the most inefficient pits.

ENERGY -World Bank prolongs loan terms for oil company

The World Bank has extended the term of its 1993 loan of US$168m to 
Russian oil company, Purneftegaz, to purchase oilfield equipment for 
another 12 months, Interfax news agency reported on 6th December, 
quoting a source within the company management.
The extension has been granted because Purneftegaz has so far 
purchased equipment worth only US$40m, the source said.  Moreover, in 
the summer, the company had to suspend the loan when duty exemptions 
initially envisaged in the agreement between the World Bank and the 
Russian government were abolished by the State Customs Committee.
Purneftegaz, a subsidiary of the Rosneft oil company, is developing 
the Gubinskoye, Severo-Tarasovskoye and Kharampurskoye oilfields in 
the north of Tyumen Region.  The company produced 8.5m tonnes of oil 
in 1994.

ENERGY -Ukraine's gas debt to Russia threatens IMF loan

Ukraine risks promised International Monetary Fund (IMF) funds if it 
fails to pay US$92m of its gas debt to Russia for supplies in 1994, 
Russian Public TV reported on 6th December, quoting Ukrainian Deputy 
Finance Minister, Borys Sobolev.
The credit under threat is the next tranche of a multi-stage IMF 
loan.  The first stages have already been received by Ukraine and 
have been placed in the foreign currency reserves of the Bank of 
Ukraine, leaving the IMF "surprised" at the country's failure to pay 
the gas debt.  Ukraine's total gas debt to Russia now stands at 
US$240m.
The television report said Ukraine cannot pay off its external debt 
before its collects it internal debt.  In November the state gas 
supplier, Ukrgaz, cut off about 400 debtor enterprises, and a further 
300 will soon follow: this has not boosted income, but merely reduced 
expenditure.
Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister, Pavel Lazarenko was quoted as 
saying he hoped Ukraine would clear the debt by the start of the new 
year, repaying a quarter of the US$92m in raw materials and metals.
Failure to do so will result in the withholding of the IMF money.  
"Moreover, it is quite possible that the IMF will demand the result 
of its latest credit, as it was allocated, precisely to pay off the 
foreign debt for gas used in 1994," Lazarenko was quoted as saying.

MINING - Shares in Kazakh ferroalloy monopolist up for sale

The Kazkhrom transnational company, the monopoly producer of 
ferroalloys in Kazakhstan, is to sell 3.2 per cent of its shares at 
the Central Asian Stock Exchange, the Russian news agency, Interfax, 
reported from Alma-Ata on 4th December.
The state-owned shares, valued at 341.92m tenge (about US$3.8m) are 
to be sold in a series of tenders starting on 5th December, 
Kazkhrom's charter capital is 7.56bn tenge, the equivalent of 
US$118.5m, the agency said, adding that according to exchange experts 
foreign investors might be interested in purchasing the shares.
Kazkhrom was formed in June 1995, when three Kazakh chrome 
enterprises - an ore-dressing plant, the Ferrochrome joint-stock 
company in Aktyubinsk Region, and the Yermak ferroalloy plant in 
Pavlodar Region - passed under the control of the Japan Chrome 
Corporation for five years.  Under the terms of the agreement, the 
Japanese receive 2 per cent of  revenues from product sales and hold 
a 25 per cent stake in Kazkhrom.

STOCKS & SHARES - The state short-term bond market

The market for state securities is one of the most powerful non-
inflationary tools for financing the budget deficit, and the state 
pins serious hopes on it.  There are now more than 50 trillion 
roubles worth of state securities in circulation.  They are above all 
state short-term bonds (GKO).  These bonds are highly profitable, 
which is somewhat disquieting since the higher their profitability, 
the lower their reliability and vice versa, according to the laws of 
the securities markets in advanced countries, reports ECONews.
According to the 1996 draft budget, two-thirds of the 3.9 per cent 
deficit of the Gross Domestic Product will be covered by issuing 
domestic loans.  This will call for issuing and placing an even 
larger volume of GKOs, whose annual turnover on the state securities 
market has topped US$200m, or 3 times more than in the beginning of 
the year.
The high profitability of and, hence, the high demand for and high 
turnover of GKO securities has, on the one hand, led to the flow of 
investments and financial resources to the GKO sphere.  On the other 
hand, as the state lacks resources to buy out payment-due GKO bonds 
from previous issues, it has to direct towards these ends practically 
all the receipts from new state security tranches.  This was the case 
in September and October and may be replicated later on.  
Specialists view this way of combating inflation as another financial 
pyramid of the MMM type (MMM is a notorious company which engaged in 
this practice), though done at the initiative and on the scope of the 
state.  The GKO does not resolve the central issue, for which an 
entire mechanism of state securities was put in operation: state 
short-term bonds do not restrain, but instead spur inflation, 
believes Mikhail Delyagin, in charge of the group for economic 
problems of the Analytical Department under the President of the 
Russian Federation.

STOCKS & SHARES - St Petersburg lures the West with bonds

St Petersburg plans to issue bonds aimed at overseas investors for 
the first time since the 1917 Russian Revolution.  But fund managers 
say a combination of high risks and market restrictions will make it 
difficult to attract foreigners, reports The European.
City mayor Anatoly Sobchak said at a presenation in early December in 
London that St Petersburg will issue US$500m worth of bonds, 
denominated in roubles, in 1996.  The city recently received 
permission to issue bonds with a life of more than a year, which 
foreginers could buy.
It has already issued three, six and nine month bonds, worth US$370m, 
but they are only sold domestically because, under Russian law bonds 
with a life of less than a year cannot be converted into a foreign 
currency.
Emerging market fund managers say they would like to buy the short-
term municipal bonds and GKOs (Russian treasury bills), because of 
their very high yeilds, which average more than 100 per cent.
The fund managers went to the presentation hoping the St Petersburg 
short-term bonds would offer a loophole, allowing the repatriation of 
proceeds, one said.  He said the risk of a devaluation of the rouble 
made longer-term bonds unattractive.  "Eighteen months is a long time 
in Russia," he said. Political worries focus on parliamentary 
elections in December, in which  communists did well, and on the 
presidential election next June.
Fund managers will now wait in the hope that the Russian govenrment 
will relax its rules on repatriating funds some time next year, 
allowing foreigners into the short-term GKO and municipal bond 
markets.
St Petersburg needs the municipal bond funds to help with its budget 
deficit and to finance development projects.  Andrew Dobson, a 
consultant on Russian financial projects, said the city wanted to 
gauge Western investors' interest in longer-term bonds.
Leading bank plans big share issue
Shareholders in Gazbank, a leading commercial bank in Turkmenistan, 
have decided to increase its authorised capital from 25m to 100m 
manats by launching a second issue, Turkmen press agency reported on 
9th December.
The new 75m-manat issue is expected to be in the form of ordinary 
shares with a par value of 100,000 manats each.  The dividend 
forecast is for no less than 70 per cent per annum, the agency said, 
adding that applications to purchase over 70 per cent of the new 
shares had already been registered.  The Russian bank, Rossiyskiy 
Kredit, which already holds a 5 per cent stake in Gazbank's 
authorised capital, is among those interested in buying some of the 
new shares.
Gazbank's shareholders intend to increase its authorised capital 
further to 300m manats in 1996.  Foreign investors will be encouraged 
to acquire stakes, but the bank's Turkmen founders are to retain a 
controlling block of shares.
Gazbank issues short and medium-term credits to large private 
commercial structures in Turkmenistan, the agency recalled, adding 
that the proposed increase in the bank's authorised capital would 
enable it to "expand its lending volume significantly."

STOCKS & SHARES - Lithuania makes international debut in dollars

The Republic of Lithuania on 11th December made its international 
bond market debut, issuing US$60m of 10 per cent, two-year bonds via 
Nomura International.
"Our entry into the international capital markets provides valuable 
diversification of Lithuania's funding sources and confirms 
international confidence in the progress of Lithuania's rapid 
economic transformation," said Algimantas Krizinauskas, deputy 
minister for finance.
With the Litas, the national currency, pegged to the US dollar, the 
country's decision to tap the dollar sector seemed a natural one.  
Moreover, "the dollar market will provide them with the best 
opportunity to establish the name of Lithuania among a wide range of 
investors," said one banker.
At the re-offer price of 99.90, the bonds yield 444.8 basis points 
over the corresponding US Treasury note.  The proceeds will be used 
by Lithuania for general financing purposes.
The deal was said to have been heavily pre-marketed ahead of launch, 
and was reported to have met a good response, especially from 
emerging-market fund managers in the US.
LG Semicon, a South Korean semiconductor maker, issued US$100m of 
6.375 per cent five-year bonds yielding 80 basis points over the US 
benchmark at the 99.68 re-offer price.  The deal was also led by 
Nomura, which reported a positive response from fund managers in Asia 
and Europe, especially Germany.
The Republic of Colombia issued Y15bn of 3 per cent five-year bonds 
via Merill Lynch and Kokusai Europe.  Yielding about 100 basis points 
over yen Libor, the bonds were considerably more tightly priced than 
Colombia's recent D-Mark offering priced at around 170 basic points 
over Libor.
However, like other issuers in recent months, Colombia was able to 
exploit Japanese retail investors' hunger for assets that offer a 
significant yield pick-up over domestic products.  "Japanese retail 
investors don't look at comparative value - they just look for higher 
yields," said one dealer.
Crdit Local de France issued FFr5bn of four-year bonds via CDC and 
Socit Gnrale, yielding 20.5 basis points over the corresponding 
French government bond.

AUTOMOBILES & AVIATION - GAZ lorry factory output up, new models planned

GAZ of Nizhniy Novgorod, arguably Russia's best-performing car and 
truck maker, has posted better output for almost all of its models in 
January-October 1995 and is scheduling the launch of a new range of 
Gazelle light truck modifications and negotiating joint manufacturing 
deals with foreign firms.
The company said it made 169,760 automobiles in January-October, 10.2 
per cent more than in the same period of last year, including 100,570 
cars (up 3.1 per cent) and 69,190 trucks (up 22.4 per cent).
GAZ has practially monoplised the Russian market for light urban 
trucks with its nippy Gazelle.  It turned out 48,346 of them in the 
first 10 months of this year, mostly the basic tarpaulin model.  It 
made 14,000 of the trucks from its launch to the end of 1994.  The 
company started making a whole-metal body modification on 15th 
December.  The company, meanwhile, last November struck a deal with 
the rest of Russia's main car and truck makers not to raise prices 
for at least three months.  GAZ has held its prices steady since 
August.
Geenadiy Suvorov, who advises the company's President Nikolay Pugin, 
said the company turned out its 15-millionth automobile on 4th 
December.  It was a six-seat Gazelle developed in conjunction with 
Sokol, a Nizhniy Novgorod fighter aircraft factory, as part of a 
local defence conversion programme, Nizhniy Novgorod Automobiles.
Executives from both Daewoo of South Korea and the Ford Motor Company 
of the US visited the plant in October for talks on possible 
manufacturing ventures.  Vladimir Churagev, GAZ's top manufacturing 
executive, held similar negotiations with BMW in Germany.  However, 
most manufacturers are only offering GAZ the right to make outdated 
models.  Talks, however, have made headway with Zahnrad Fabrik of 
Germany on a joint project to make five-gear transmissions.
GAZ in 1994 made 190,000 units, including 118,000 cars and 72,000 
trucks.
Orenburg defence factory to produce civilian helicopters
The Strela production  assocation, a former defence industry

The helicopter is to be produced in two modifications, for cargo, 
with a maximum payload of 1,000kg, and for passengers, with a pod 
accommodating 6 people.  The company has already  received orders 
from several customers, including the Russian Ministry of Civil 
Defence, Emergencies and Natural Disasters. Israel, Taiwan and the 
Central Asian states have also expressed interest.

ECOLOGY - Pure water emerald

In the West, ecologically-clean products indicate that people care 
for their own health and seek a lifestyle to which food producers 
quickly react.  The latest fad is a litre of drinking water bought 
which costs US$1 at your local food stores.  It costs, doesn't it?  
It is nobody's secret that the quality of water in many Russian 
cities leaves much to be desired.  Foreign and Russian gadgets for 
household and neighbourhood water treatment are costly to use because 
their filters have to be replaced.  This is the explanation for the 
high cost of drinking water, reports Know-How from Russia/95 of RIA - 
Novosti.
The water treatment unit, Emerald, for household use, created by 
specialists at the Moscow-based scientific-technical joint venture 
which bears that name, is unprecedented, a forerunner of a world 
ecological revolution, specialists maintain.  Its operational 
principle is as simple as it is original.  Electrochemical activation 
occurs in a light plastic cylinder.  Anode oxidation destroys 
pathogenic micro-organisms.  Active chlorine compounds are decomposed 
and ions of heavy metals are restored on the cathode to become 
isolated in precipitation. Meanwhile, the water preserves the health 
valuable elements - fluorine, calcium and magnesium salts.  The pot 
in which such water is boiled accumulates no scale whatsoever.
Clinical tests show that Emerald-treated water improves immunity and 
makes people less prone to allergic diseases.  Especially in the case 
of kidney ailments.  its principle of operation can be used for 
disinfecting water in swimming pools and even municipal water 
treatment plants, replacing costly and environmently-hazardous 
chemical forms of treatment.
At the request of livestock breeders, experts from Emerald JV have 
also developed a method for raising calves, using water processed by 
their unit.  The method improves the stock, hence the beef quality.  
Ecologically-speaking, the beef is cleaner.
Most importantly, the new water-treatment method is economical.  No 
expendable materials are needed.  It calls for only electricity, 
though less than that used by an electric bulb, to produce up to 350 
litres of pure water ran hour.  That costs about 20 kopecks, instead 
of a dollar, per litre.

ENERGY - Subsoil nuclear power plant

Russia's Minatom (Ministry for Nuclear Energy), Goskomoboronprom 
(State Committee for the Defence Industry) and Mintopenergo (Ministry 
for Fuel and Energy) have brought their heads together to build the 
country's first Subterranean Atomic Heat and Electricity Station 
(PATES) in the Murmansk Region, reports Know-How from Russia/95 of 
RIA - Novosti.
The idea of building a subterranean nuclear power plant (PATES) was 
put forward in his time by Academician Andrei Sakharov.  Now it is 
implemented by the Academician A Krylov Central Research Institute.  
In a competition of small-capacity units for subsoil power facilities 
the well-reputed KLT-40 reactor used in nuclear-powered iceboats was 
picked out.
The capacity of the subterranean nuclear power plant will be 300 
megawatts (six 50-mWt units).  It is enough to supply heat and 
electricity for a large naval base, which is currently engaged in 
destroying nuclear-powered submarines under treaties on arms 
reduction.  The developers of the Shtokman natural gas field are also 
interested in the building of the station.  Gas will be pumped along 
ferroconcrete pipes, whose manufacture calls for heavy power inputs.
Is it really advantageous to build subterranean nuclear power 
stations?  Hard rocks protect not only against radiation but 
represent an exceptionally reliable envelope which can withstand 
loads by several degrees of ten larger than any ferroconcrete or 
metal structures.  Air-tight locking contraptions will ensure 
protection against possible external effects, including even acts of 
subversion.  Located underground, nuclear reactors call for less 
anti-seismic measures.
Specialists hope that the first step towards safe subsoil technology 
in nuclear electricity generation will be a success.
Nuclear submarine plant begins construction of drilling platform
A nuclear submarine plant in the northern Russian town of 
Severodvinsk has for the first time started the construction of an 
offshore oil drilling platform, ITAR-TASS news agency reported on 4th 
December, from Severodvinsk.
The plant, which builds nuclear-powered submarines for the Russian 
Navy, is expected to take several years to complete the project.  The 
platform, designed by specialists from St Petersburg and 
Severodvinsk, is to be used to develop an oilfield in the Arctic 
shelf of the Barents Sea, 60km from the shore.  The oilfield has 
estimated reserves exceeding 100m tonnes.
Lithuania installs new network of radiation monitoring stations
Danish experts have completed the assembly of an automated station to 
monitor gamma radiation at the Lithuanian Ministry of Environmental 
Protection in Vilnius, the Baltic News Service reported from the 
Lithuanian capital, on 28th November.
The construction of similar stations has began in the towns of 
Turmantas, Visaginas, Rimse and Gaide, all located "a dozen 
kilometres" from Lithuania's Ignalina nuclear power plant.  The 
agency quoted a press spokeman for the Ministry of Environment 
Protection as saying a network incorporating eight such stations was 
to be built in the country with Danish help, under an agreement 
between the Lithuanian ministry and Denmark's Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. Work on the project was started by Sweden and was later 
taken over by the Danes, BNS said.
Although minor accidents occur quite often at the Ignalina plant, 
official sources have always maintained that there have been no 
changes in background radiation around it.  The new network of 
monitoring stations, the agency said, would make it possible to 
observe any changes, discover their cause and issue prompt warnings 
to people in the country, to neighbouring states and to international 
organisations.  The main drawback of the existing radiation 
monitoring facilities, which include a small system inside the 
Ignalina plant, several automated monitoring points within 30km and 
equipment for measuring gamma radiation at various weather stations 
throughout Lithuania, is that information collected there cannot be 
conveyed promptly to any central control station, BNS said.

ENERGY - A warm future

Tartu in Estonia is being fast-forwarded to an environmentally 
friendly future by Western technology- and its residents are getting 
better heating systems for the long, cold winter into the 
bargain.Extensive programmes, to cut heat loss, reduce energy 
consumption and convert boilers from fossil fuel to bio-fuels mean 
the town has a cheaper cleaner, more efficient and more reliable 
heating system than before.
"We feel we have joined the 21st Century," says Enn Pernam, director 
of Tatu's Aardla boiler plant - new fed by wood chips instead of oil 
- after the inefficiencies and waste of the Soviet era.
Aardla is one of more than 40 Baltic regional projects relying on 
financial and technical assistance from Nutek, a Swedish public-
sector organisation promoting technology and energy efficiency.
Nutek's aim is to improve energy efficiency in Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania (and, to a more limited extent, Russia and Poland) by 
working with municipalities and local companies to convert boilers 
and improve heat distribution and building standards.
The idea is to try to bolster environmental protection by 
reconstructing boiler houses to operate wholly on local fuel, and 
reducing energy loss in residential houses and heating systems.
Other Western organisations involved in similar projects include the 
World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Among Swedish companies involved in the work, Energiakonsult has 
provided technical skills, and KMW Energi has supplied equipment.  
Local companies have participated in the reconstruction of the boiler 
houses.
The two sides have contrasting motives.  The Baltic states have an 
obvious financial interest in cheaper fuel after a surge in prices 
since their independence from the Soviet Union (where heating was 
supplied at completely uncommercial rates) four years ago.  An 
average Estonian can spend up to a third of his salary on heating.
The Swedes are more interested in helping the Baltic States cut their 
output of carbon dioxide as part of joint implementation 
arrangements, where one country can gain a credit for lowering the 
CO2 output of another.  Both sides seem to be achieving their 
objectives.  Using wood chips instead of oil has cut the fuel bills 
of some Baltic boiler plants by up to 50 per cent.
Pername says the Aardla conversion is cutting fuel costs by 2.1m Estonian 
crowns a year.  Nutek, meanwhile, says its projects will cut CO2 
production by as much as 250,000 tonnes a year, as well as reducing 
output of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide.
The main idea is to use the savings from lower fuel costs to repay 
the loans advanced by Nutek to finance the improvements. But that 
means that, initially at least, end-users are not generally getting 
lower heating bills.
"This is essentially a commercial operation," says Hans Nilsson, the 
head of Nutek's energy efficiency unit.  Loans are granted by Nutek 
to plant owners at Stockholm Interbank Offered Rates (currently about 
8.65 per cent) and are repayable over 10 years, with a two-year 
period of grace.  As security, Nutek gets guarantees from local 
municipalities and real estate as collateral.  In one case in Latvia, 
the security is a municipal cinema.
Where Nutek believes its concept scores is in the wider benefits it 
offers.  Residents might not be getting lower fuel bills, but they 
are getting better value for money - longer heating seasons, higher 
average room temperatures and hot water during summer.
Benefits also include reduced wastage, better heat regulation and 
heating systems that last longer.
"We are aiming for better all-round quality.  In the past, the way 
people cooled down was simply by opening the window," says Gudrun 
Knutsson, the programme's project leader.
Nutek's priorities are speed, affordability and reliability.  It 
emphasises simple, tried-and-tested technology and cuts through red 
tape by keeping involvement with national governments to a minimum.
It also provides a consultant to assist the local project leader with 
implementation.  Significantly, there is no "buy Swedish" 
requirements attached to the loans, which not only benefits other 
international suppliers but also companies in the Baltic region, 
where costs are lower.  Swedish companies are, nevertheless, winning 
a substantial number of contracts and are linking up with Baltic 
companies to boost business.
Nutek has committed Skr227.5m to its Baltic energy projects and has 
recently been promised a further SKr50m from the Swedish government.  
The idea is that, as loan and interest are repaid, funds are recycled 
to new projects.  However, Nutek does not expect to fully recoup its 
outlays, partly because its anticipates some defaults.
Not  everything has gone smoothly.  Some residents are not paying 
their fuel bills - because they are so high - meaning that plant 
owners are also finding the going tough.  There are also questions to 
access to wood chips and prices.  In Lithuania, for example, the 
state has a strong hand because it owns much of the forest.  Middle 
men have also tried to drive up prices by cornering supplies.  
Finally, there are continuing political and legal uncertainties which 
could undermine the value of the securities and guarantees pledged.
Nutek says its model works particularly well in Baltic states because 
they have already access to wood and a strong desire to be more self-
sufficient in energy and cut costly imports.  It works less well in 
Poland, which is keen to support a substantial domestic coal 
industry.
But the Swedish organisation is not discouraged.  Nilsson says there 
are many more projects needing to be financed.  Indeed, he is trying 
to promote a clearing house system that will bring potential 
financiers together with municipalities and local companies in 
Eastern Europe to drive the process further.

RUSSIA EXPRESS EXECUTIVE BRIEFING via NewsNet
JANUARY 15, 1996

Russia rejoins the Space Race; Intersputnik

In the early 1980s, when the first European satellite 
televisionentrepreneurs wanted to show off the capabilities of their 
big, expensive dishes, as often as not they tuned into signals from a 
Russian Gorizont satellite; here was a technology which could leap 
the Iron Curtain and do no end of good for East-West relations.
Now, 15 years on, the Iron Curtain's gone, the Soviet empire has 
disintegrated, and those same Gorizonts are part of a large - if 
largely ageing - Russian satellite fleet which still plays a big role 
in the international broadcasting industry.  It may not be quite the 
leading role envisaged by those who saw a potentially world-beating 
space industry, liberated from the dead hand of Soviet bureaucracy.  
But the latest signals out of Moscow and St Petersburg suggest that, 
after five years of false dawns and unrealised dreams, a renaissance 
is at last under way.
This might surprise those Western operators whose belief in the 'new' 
Russia has been stretched by recent repeated launch delays and 
unexplained changes of plan, harking back to the worst days of the 
old regime.  Like every other sector in the Russian economy, the 
satellite industry has been hit by economic chaos, which is far from 
resolved; in some sectors, such as the TV industry, the point has 
been reached where some stations can't even pay their electricity 
bills for transmission.  The chief impact on the hybrid state/private 
sector satellite industry has been an inability to keep to its 
replacement (Express) satellite launch schedule - a vital process 
which virtually ground to a halt in early 1995, ostensibly as a 
direct result of the Rimsat debacle (see below).
And so, far from becoming a powerful rival to Western satellite 
operators, Russia has been losing clients to them, even those early 
'breakthrough' clients, CNNI and TV5.  A further blow was former 
Soviet republic Kazakhstan's recent decision to switch all TV 
distribution from Russian satellites to the Intelsats at 57 and 66 
degrees East.  This, according to Intelsat regional director CIS, 
Central and Eastern Europe, Yuli Wexler, was partly due to the ageing 
Russian fleet - "Their schedule for replacement has been falling 
behind," partly to Intelsat technical support services.  For similar 
reasons Intelsat has been picking up significantly more Russian  
business both in telecoms (it has recently set up its first intra-
Russian network with RussTelecom and Teleport TP) and in TV and SNG 
traffic --"TASS, for example, has become a large user of Intelsat 
globally."
Now, as so often in the past five years, the industry is making all 
the right noises about co-operation, openness and technological 
upgrading - but will it happen?
Two recent deals indicate that serious progress has been made in 
parts of the industry already.  SES's decision last year to use the 
Russo-American Lockheed-Krunichev-Energia International consortium to 
launch Astra 1F atop a Russian Proton rocket underlined the West's 
new-found confidence in Russian space technology.  A further boost 
came in July, when Eutelsat decided to order its first made-in-Russia 
spacecraft, SESAT, from manufacturer NPO-PM of Krasnoyarsk, again 
using Proton for its slated early 1998 launch.  The 18-transponder 
payload for this craft will, however, be built by Alcatel-Espace in 
France.  And Intelsat, which has yet to make direct use of Russian 
expertise, is looking closely at Proton:  "We've talked to the 
owners, seen the launches at Baikonur, and it's entirely possible 
that we can use it at some stage; we're not excluding the 
possibility," Wexler says.
But while the launch and construction side of the industry is alive 
and kicking, what of the long-awaited boom in attracting Russian 
satellite capacity?  Ironically, the very success of Proton could be 
affecting progress in this area:  "The elevation of launch costs is 
ripping the heart out of the industry," one foreign ex-client notes:  
"In 1992 a launch was under US$5m, now it's US$70m; it means they can 
no longer be so competitive."
Currently there are 17 geostationary Russian satellites providing 
feeds for broadcasters around the world - though the concentration of 
active orbital positions is in the Far Eastern and Central Asian 
regions contingent on former Soviet territories.  Between them, the 
elderly Gorizont and Radugas and the new Expresses are carrying 
customers as varied as Portugal's RTP Internacional, Business India 
TV and others - on top of their primary function of distributing 
television, radio, telephony and data services across the six times 
zones of the massive former Soviet empire.
In theory, the old Gorizonts are to be replaced by Express 
Satellites, the third of which is due for launch "early in 1996" to 
the popular 80 degrees East slot.  Although still some way behind the 
West in terms of payload (offering 12 transporters, 10 at C-Band and 
two Ku-Band) and longevity (five to seven years as against 10 to 12 
for US designs), Express is a much-needed enhancement of the Gorizont 
design, notably in having full north-south spin stabilisation.  The 
older satellites' notorious tendency to drift by as much as five 
degrees out of their nominal orbital position should become a thing 
of the past.
Unfortunately, as a spokesman for InformcosmosConsult, the legal and 
consulting agency for the Russian Space Agency confirms, the Gorizont 
replacement scheme was largely dependent on revenues from the now 
bankrupt Asia-Pacific satellite venture, Rimsat.  When Rimsat's 
payments stopped in 1994, the RSA provided "emergency funding" to 
complete the first Express, launched in October 1994.  Informcosmos 
says it is "doing its best trying to find funding for the Express 
programme... We hope it will be kept alive and we will have some 
successful launches in the future."
Financial problems have also plagued Russia's first DBS programme: 
the original 'Gelikon' scheme from 1989 proposed up to 10 satellites 
to cover the whole of the former USSR by 1995.  In fact it was not 
until 1994 that the first DBS satellite - Gals 1 - was launched, with 
a second to follow by the end of 1995.  The name 'Gelikon' seems to 
have been dropped: no domestic DBS customers have emerged, and two of 
the three high-power (90W/57dBW EIRP) Ku-Band transporters on Gals 1 
were leased to a Chinese broadcaster.  Gals was even moved 71 degrees 
East to serve this client's needs, but no regular services have been 
detected.  As for Gals 2, even an Intersputnik official responsible 
for marketing the capacity was unable to confirm its eventual orbital 
slot - "This has not yet been decided, it will depend on negotiations 
with users."
He adds that "some requests" had come from European broadcasters: one 
of the DBS slots to which the RSA has rights, 23 degrees East, would 
in theory allow a DTH service to dishes as small as 50cm in most of 
Europe.  Gals could also be used for digital services: the first 
tests using MPEG-2 signals on a Russian satellite were carried out 
successfully by the sixth channel of St Petersburg and the Scientific 
Research Institute for Television, Moscow last summer, using 
Scientific Atlanta encoding.  Should the Gals programme take off, 
more capacious, more powerful advanced Gals R designs are ready and 
waiting; on the other hand, observers of past Russian DBS schemes 
would advise against holding of breath.
At least three similar projects have come and gone within the past 
decade: after Gorizon there was the TRomantis' scheme, a Ku-Band 
joint Russian-German joint venture; this, like a C-Band co-operative 
venture with Canada, SovCanstar, came to nothing.  Then in 1993 there 
was GIS Globostar with its scheme to launch up to five 'Coupon' 
satellites offering massive datacoms capacity for Russian banks, and 
steerable, highly flexible Ku-F and spot-beams for any interested 
broadcasters across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.  This, which 
would have been Russia's first privately-owned satellite system, was 
backed by banks which have since pulled back; and though the company 
still exists, the Coupons remain 'paper satellites' only.

The inside agent

For broadcasters outside the Russian Federation, the gateway to low-
cost capacity on Russian satellites is provided by Intersputnik, the 
Moscow based 22-nation satellite communications organisation which 
has handled the transition from state agency to outward-looking 
commercial operators more successfully than some.
Intersputnik - which its marketing manager, Hernedo Rodriguez, 
emphasises "is not a Russian organisation, but an international 
intergovernmental organisation" - goes to lengths to make the process 
as painless as possible for its customers, who are, of course, useful 
sources of hard currency.
According to Rodriguez, Intersputnik now handles five times the voice 
traffic it did in 1990, with a 30 per cent year-on-year growth during 
1995.  Television traffic, accounting for 80 per cent of 
Intersputnik's business, fared better still, with an 80 per cent 
growth in 1995.  Overall revenues were 40 per cent up this year as a 
result, he adds:  "We have more than 100 state and private companies 
as users, among them companies from the US, UK, Japan, Canada, 
France, Portugal, China, India, etc."
He cites Intersputnik's "democratic entry procedure and terms and 
conditions of operation, rather low tariffs, a simple and efficient 
system of mutual settlements," and "a sufficiently high percentage of 
the annual guaranteed profit share" as factors which have attracted 
many PTTs and broadcasters to join the group as either full members 
or users.
According to one former Western customer, Intersputnik can even be 
easier to deal with than some of its Western counterparts:  "It was 
pleasantly straightforward,"  says Jim Hodgetts of the Francophobe 
international broadcaster, TV5, which leased a transponder on the 
Statsionar 12 Gorizont in 1992 to reach the former French territories 
of southeast Asia.  "Each year we'd get their typed bill for 
US$1.25m, and so long as we kept paying, any problems we had we could 
put directly to their engineers - it was not at all politically 
secretive."
The give-away here, of course, is the price: as another Gorizont user 
puts it. "You get an awful lot of coverage for your money."  A berth 
on an Express or Gorizont at the most popular positions, 11/14 
degrees West and those around 80 degrees East, can take your signal 
to virtually the whole of the Third World and most of the First and 
Second World too, as Bombay/London-based Asian channel, Apna TV, has 
discovered to its advantage.  Apna is also breaking ground by taking 
the single Ku-Band transponder on the 11 degrees West Gorizont 26, 
giving it enough signal strength to market Apna and its add-on 
Sunrise TV as a DTH service to Asian viewers in the UK and northwest 
Europe, though viewers will need 1.2 metre dishes.One of 
Intersputnik's star European clients is RTP Interna ional, whose 
transponder on Express 2 at 14 degrees West gives it remarkably good 
coverage of territories in Africa and Latin America in one swoop:  
"It's a question of coverage," says Jos Banha Nunes of Marconi SA, 
Lisbon, lessee of space segment for the state broadcaster's 
international service, "but also a matter of price and power.  Using 
the global beam gives them coverage of all of Africa, as well as 
South America and East Coast USA markets.  Downlinks can use TVROs of 
2.5 metres in the islands off the African coast, and 3/4 metres 
elsewhere."
And, as Alexandre Fernandes, RTPi's international operations manager, 
adds, "This price is good - about half the price of the equivalent 
coverage by any other satellite, and the quality is good."  RTPi's 
Express signal is particularly in demand in the former Portuguese 
African colonies, with terrestrial relays, for example, in 
Mozambique, So Tom and the Cape Verde Islands.
No complaints, either, about drifting satellites - but as Hodgetts 
maintains, the Gorizonts' reputation for unreliability had been 
overplayed in the past, perhaps due to anti-Russian prejudice.  
"They're as good as anyone's, they might look primitive, but once 
they're up and made to work, they're very, very solid."
So why, after three years, did TV5 jump from Gorizont to Intelsat 
702?  "We were obliged to move because the new Express would not have 
covered the same area," Hodgetts says: and here he puts his finger on 
the real reason for Westerners' disinclination to use what for the 
most part are hugely cost-effective services:  "The satellites are 
operated to Russian criteria, for the benefit of Russian 
broadcasters."
Intersputnik, in fact, has at its disposal only a small, if 
strategically-important, part of the Russian fleet.  Currently, it 
controls 29 transponders on eight Gorizont and Express satellites in 
Indian and Atlantic Ocean slots, plus the Gals DBS capacity.  
Tariffs, Rodriguez says, are "lower than those offered by similar 
organisations," based on "world average prices," but also on occupied 
capacity rather than number of channels, with discounts for long 
leases. and "preferential tarrifs" for new services.
Back in 1993, Intersputnik's board voted to develop its own 
satellite, Intersputnik VIII, a 24-C-Band, 16-Ku-Band transponder 
craft which it intends to have in operation "1997-98."  With C-Band 
EIRPs of 37-40dBW, and Ku-Band powers of 48-53dBW, the new craft will 
allow use of much smaller dishes for both Earth station and DTH 
reception.  New Intersputnik orbital positions have also been 
notified to the ITU for co-ordination: 97, 83, 32, 23, 16, six and 
three degrees West; and 17, 27, 59, 64, 67, 75, 114 and 153 degrees 
East.
As Rodriguez points out, these "could be of interest for developing 
regional and global projects on a joint stake basis."

STATISTICS

November's inflation rate dropped to 4.5%, after rising to 4.7% in October.
Preliminary data show that December's rate may be as low as
3%.

The ruble lost 1.4% of its value against the dollar.  It opened at 4,580 to
$1 on 12/1 and closed at 4,645 on 12/29.  It is likely that the ruble will
decline sharply in early January as new ruble corridor trading limits go
into effect.

The RINACO Plus RESI index of Russian stocks fell during the month by
several percent.  (Technical difficulties prevent inclusion of
full data for the month.)

1995 AT FIRST GLANCE

Although the results of the Duma elections on December 17 showed widespread
dissatisfaction with the government's economic policies, (see "Duma Election
Results,") there can be little doubt that they produced substantive changes
in economic performance in 1995.

Preliminary data indicates that in many respects the economy improved
markedly over 1994;  in other respects, the rate of overall decline has
slowed considerably.

In the opinion of many economists, the country stands on edge of an up-turn
in 1996: 
                            1994      1995
GDP (%change)                -15%     -4%
Industrial output            -21%     -3%
Inflation                    226%     140%
Deficit (%of GDP)            10%      4%
Unemployment                 6%       8%

STRIKES WIDEN

Strikes began to hit widespread sectors of the economy, prompted primarily
by the enormous backlog of unpaid wages and rising unemployment.

The Federation of Independent Trade Unions (FNPR) called for a nationwide
"Day of Action" on November 30, which brought out thousands of workers.
Demonstrations were held in some cities, but not Moscow, St. Petersburg or
Novgorod.

The FNPR has claimed that workers are owed a total of 13.6 trillion rubles
(about $2.9 bln).  In addition, although by ILO criteria the country's
unemployment rate is 8%, organized labor has charged that the actual rate,
including "hidden unemployment," is 15%.

Trains between St. Petersburg and Moscow, one of the primary freight and
passenger rail corridors in the country, were halted on December 7 when the
Oktyabrskaya Railway said it had no money to pay two months' salaries.

Coal miners, who continue to hold labor actions, have demanded another Rb
500 bln in arrears.  Although the government had just allocated Rb 500 bln
for this purpose, union leaders said the amount was insufficient and wanted
it doubled, to a total of Rb 1 trillion.

Oil workers in Komi and miners in Tula were staging hunger strikes to
protest working conditions as well as unpaid wages.   

As the month progressed, school teachers nationwide went out on strike as
well as air traffic controllers in some areas.  

On many occasions in 1995, President Yeltsin and other government spokesmen
issued calls for wage arrears to be paid, particularly during the run-up to
the Duma elections.  Almost all the back salaries are owed by state
enterprises and agencies.

CBR TO HELP BANKS

The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) may be abandoning credit auctions as a
means of pumping cash into the country's commercial banking system.

A draft document indicates that the CBR is considering allowing banks to use
treasury bills as collateral for repurchase funds.  This is a method widely
used in the West.

The CBR said it would also make special credits available for banks which
are experiencing short-term financial problems.

The number of private banks has declined in the last year, due mainly to
mergers and bankruptcies, and the country's commercial banking system
remains fragile.  With the decline of inflation and the implementation of
the ruble trading corridor, banks have lost the opportunity to earn the
large profits they did in 1992-1994.

PRODUCTION SHARING LAW PASSED

After months of often acrimonious debate, the Federation Council, the upper
house of the parliament, has finally passed a law regulating oil production
sharing agreements with foreign firms.

The law, which was passed by the Duma some time ago, was rejected by the
Council last month, and was heavily amended before final passage.

The revised law requires the Duma to approve each production sharing
agreement reached between foreign and domestic oil companies, limits the
legal recourse of foreign investors to international courts, and gives
Russia a unilateral right of renegotiation should world oil prices change.

A number of pending major deals are awaiting passage of the law, including
Exxon's $10 bln Sakhalin-1 project. Reportedly, tens of billions of dollars
in other investments are also on hold.

Opponents of the Council's version, which was influenced by nationalist
demands, believe that it creates an unfavorable climate for
desperately-needed foreign investments.  There was some speculation that
President Yeltsin would veto it.

Western oil firms declined public comment on the new law, although their
reaction has been reported as being negative.

RUBLE CORRIDOR COULD END

Sergei Alekhashenko, the new first deputy chairman of the CBR, said that the
ruble corridor could end in mid-1996.  Alekhashenko said he was speaking on
his own, and not expressing bank policy.  

Prior to his appointment, he was the head of a think tank associated with
the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.

Alekhashenko's views have been supported by President Yeltsin's top economic
advisor, Aleksandr Livshits.

ECONOMIC NOTES

Agriculture Minister Aleksandr Nazarchuk, said that reforms are necessary to
rescue large, inefficient former collective and state farms. He said that as
many as 40% of these farms are "incapable of working efficiently" and that
urgent action, including land privatization, is required to ease the situation.
+++
At present, 136 foreign banks are operating in Russia.  Of these, 10 are
fully-owned by foreign banks, and 50 have mixed capital.

Russian banks have not been as successful in opening offices in the US.
Promstroibank,Incombank and Credit-Moscow have thus far been unable to
obtain permission from the Treasury Department to open offices in New York.
The only Russian bank with US representation is Vnesheconombank.
+++
A study conducted by the Leontiev Center and the Russian Marketing
Association has shown that the country's private sector is performing
much better than the state sector.

Private enterprises recorded production increases of 2.3% in 1995, compared
to a drop of 10% in the state sector.  In addition, after
being adjusted for inflation, salaries in the private sector rose by an
average of 9.8%, while state salaries fell 6.6%.
+++
In the first 11 months of 1995, Russia's foreign trade increased 21%, to
$113 bln, over the same period in 1994.  The trade surplus was $31 bln.

Exports to non-CIS countries rose 28% while those to the CIS fell by 4%.
+++
A survey compiled by the Corporate Resources Group in Switzerland shows that
Moscow is the world's most expensive city outside Japan.  On a scale in
which New York City is 100 points, Moscow ranked 142, just ahead of Zurich
and Geneva.
+++
Russia will impose quotas on the import of textiles from the European
Community to protect its domestic textile industry.

Data released show that textile imports to Russia exceeded exports by $563 mln.
+++
The Ministry of Economics said that it expected investments to grow by 4% in
1996 and rise to Rb 310 trillion ($67 bln).  It expects Rb 50
trillion of this total to come from Russian banks, a figure the Association
of Russian Banks disputes.  The group noted that commercial banks were able
to raise less than Rb 5 trillion to participate in the last round of stock
auctions.
+++
The agreement by which DeBeers sells 95% of Russia's diamonds through its
Central Selling Organization has been extended until February 1, giving
negotiators a chance to reach agreement on a new deal.  It had been reported
that the talks were at an impasse, and that no new arrangement would be
possible before the December 31 expiration.
+++
Russia, Azerbaijan and an international oil consortium have signed a
agreement to transport Caspian Sea oil through a Russian pipeline to
the port of Novorossisk.

The pipeline, owned by the state-owned monopoly Transneft, will go into
operation in the second half of 1996.
+++
Russian computer companies may be experiencing difficulties owing to
consolidations in the banking sector.  This may result in sales and
production slowdowns for the first time since 1988.  For some time, the
primary markets for Russian-made computers has been the banking
industry and state organizations.
+++
Reaction to the Duma elections and uncertainty about June's presidential
elections sent the value of Russian stocks down in trading on exchanges
across the country.  By the end of the month, shares were trading 30% below
their 1995 highs.

Russian and foreign brokers said that they believed buying opportunities
existed, and that stocks could be bought at bargain prices.

STET DEAL OFF

Russia's single largest privatization deal collapsed when Italy's STET
declined to make an initial payment for the 25% stake in Svyazinvest it had
successfully won at auction.

The auction, held on December 1, was expected to raise $430 mln in cash plus
a commitment for an investment of $400 per share over the next 2 years.
STET's winning bid was $630 mln plus the investment promise.

After some initial confusion, during which the State Property Committee
claimed the deal was off and STET insisted it was on, it was
announced on the 26th that the offer was dead.

The committee issued a statement saying, "In spite of the Russian
government's desire to compromise, STET insisted on a form of payment
which went totally beyond the tender conditions."

There were suggestions, which were discounted by outside observers and the
Russian government, that STET pulled out because of the results of the Duma
elections.  Sources close to STET's board of directors said that the company
had reconsidered its bid because it would be unable to realize a return on
its investment until the year 2000.  

A more likely cause of the collapse was STET's reluctance to make its
initial payment until all the details of the transaction had been clarified
by the Property Committee and until the future of Svyazinvest's
relationships with the 85 regional telephone companies it controls were
completely spelled out.

The government announced that it would reschedule the auction of the 25%
stake in Svyazinvest, perhaps as early as January, and would continue plans
to sell a further 24% share in the telephone company.  At present, it is
impossible to say whether the deal's collapse will affect the overall
privatization effort.

DEBT/EQUITY SWAP PROPOSED

The head of the State Property Committee, Alfred Kokh, said that the agency
was beginning work on a plan which would allow creditors to swap their
Russian debt for shares in Russian companies.

Kokh indicated that state-owned shares would continue to be sold in 1996,
including stakes in a dozen major companies, including the insurance giant,
Rosgosstrakh.

At a minimum, market capitalization would have to be raised 10 times in
1996, to at least $60 bln for Kokh's proposal to work.  Kokh said that his
agency's preliminary goal was to raise market capitalization, currently
about $7 bln, some 15 to 20 times, in 1996, allowing the debt/equity swap to
begin in late 1996 or early 1997.

Russian stock prices, due to political uncertainties and charges that the
privatization process has allowed well-placed companies to buy shares at
rock-bottom prices, are currently depressed, and it remains to be seen
whether the government's ambitious privatization goals for 1996 can be
achieved.  

It was hoped to raise $1.9 bln in 1995, but with the collapse of the STET
offer, this goal will probably not be met.

BANK PRIVATIZATION DELAYED

The State Duma passed a law on December 10 postponing the privatization of
former Soviet foreign and other banks.  Under the terms of existing
legislation, these banks were to have been privatized by January 1, 1996,
but the Duma has pushed the target date back to January 1, 2000.

Among the banks affected are the nationwide savings bank, Sberbank, and
Vnesheconombank, formerly Vneshtorgbank.

OIL STAKES SOLD

Stakes in major oil producing companies were sold in December, mostly to
groups of banks.

Stolichny Bank Sberizhni and the unknown Neftyanaya Finansovaya Kompaniya
successfully acquired 51% of Sibneft for $100.3 mln.  The banks' bid was
guaranteed by Bank Menatep, which is a major participant in the acquisition
of 78% of the YUKOS oil group.

NIKoil, a financial consulting firm, bought 16% of the oil giant,  LUKoil.
NIKoil was already acting as a broker for LUKoil, adding to charges that the
auctions were controlled by a small group of insiders.

RYBINSK MOTORS SALE DELAYED

An auction for 37% of the aircraft engine manufacturer Rybinsk Motors was
put back until February because of court challenges to the sale.

Company executives have brought suit disputing the authority of the State
Property Committee to hold the sale, to the declaration of the company's
bankruptcy, and to the inclusion in the company's assets of a fund designed
to benefit the workforce.

The auction may be held as early as February.  Gazprom, the producer of
natural gas, has indicated that it will try to acquire the engine manufacturer.

CURRENCY CONTROLS 


A decree establishing currency controls on the import-export trade is being
considered,according to a report in Nezvisimaya Gazeta.

The decree will require that payments to resident importers be made through
their Russian accounts and that importers will have to produce goods and
records to show that the value of payments and goods imported is equivalent.

This is being done as much to curb tax evasion as it is to reduce hard
currency flight.

EXPORT DUTIES CUT

President Yeltsin signed a decree banning export duties on refined oil
products and lumber products as of December 1, 1995.  

Effective January 1, 1996, export duties on crude oil, natural gas and
industrial goods will be reduced by 50%.

Oil exports, one of the country's major sources of export earnings, fell by
5% in the first 10 months of 1995 largely because of high duties.

REGIONAL LAWS

Regional (oblast) authorities in many parts of the country have passed laws
and regulations designed to fill holes in national laws.

At a meeting of regional officials in Volgograd, various measures were
discussed. The Volgograd Oblast Duma Budget Committee head, Aleksandr
Morozov, said that his body had passed laws concerning non-state pension
funds, the activities of credit unions, and the issuance of promissory notes.

Regional officials complained that federal courts and procurators' offices
were unclear on what to do about such legislation and have not
adapted to it.

REPORTING LAW

Under current law, companies are required to pay their employees' salaries
through a single account, registered with local tax boards and
the state pension fund.

Since a large number of companies have been avoiding pension fund and other
non-budgetary fund payments, the CBR has recommended new
regulations.

The proposed law will require banks to report all new accounts opened by
companies to the CBR within 5 days. Included are budget, credit, loan and
hard currency accounts.

GRAIN IMPORTS BEGIN

It has been speculated for months that Russia's poor grain harvests in 1995
would force it to begin importing large quantities of Western
grain, , as much as 6 mln metric tons. Grain prices, which are near 15-year
record high levels, gained on European and American exchanges amid reports
that Russia had obtained $800 mln in credits to buy 2.5 mln tonnes of wheat.
The reports were later found to be untrue.

The Agriculture Ministry reported that a private company, Roskhleboprodukt,
had purchased $300 mln of wheat from Austria,
Hungary and the US.  The company is said to be linked with one of the
country's major banks, Oneksimbank.

Two other leading banks, Menatep and Inkombank,said that they were "talking
about buying a large amount" of grain, but that no specifice
deals had yet been reached.

The Economy Ministry reported that regions in the Far East had made
arrangements to import 400,000 tonnes of grain through commercial
companies.  These deals, according to the Ministry, were made at the
regional level and did not involve the central government.

While current stocks and reserves will be exhausted by June, estimates are
that the 1996 harvest will recover, and could be as high as 80 mln tonnes.
In the meantime, grain prices on Russian exchanges has remained relatively
stable, at about Rb 850,000/tonne.

REFINERIES TO BE REVAMPED

The Fuel and Energy Ministry will implement a program to modernize its
refineries, but said that unprofitable units will not be improved and may
even be allowed to close.

The Ministry said that the program had been developed in conjunction with
the Ministries of Economy and Finance, the State Property Committee and the
Federal Bankruptcy Agency.

Russia's refineries are in poor physical condition and require massive
infusions of technology and money.  Production fell 17% last year, and has
dropped 38% since 1990.  The average refinery is operating at 65% of capacity.

The Ministry did not say how much money would be made available, but did
indicate that it would come from private and state sources.  It also said
that tax breaks and other "privileges" for refineries would be adopted as
part of the plan.

Refineries who wished to participate in the program are expected to produce
business and technical plans for review.

TIMBER EXPORTS SLUMP

Declining world prices for timber, pulp and paper and the ruble trading
corridor have resulting in a substantial decrease in Russian timber exports.  

It has been reported that in some regions, export enterprises are sitting on
millions of dollars worth of product for which buyers can not be found.
Although the government has tried to help the situation by reducing export
duties on wood and wood products, industry spokesmen have said that
successful timber trade needs an exchange rate of Rb 7,000 to $1, well above
the level of Rb 4,500 - 5,000 which has been maintained since June.

THE DUMA ELECTIONS by Josh Zander

Depending the source, the results of last month's Duma elections presumably
show that either nothing or everything has changed with regard to the reform
process in Russia.

Western news media and, to some degree, the business community, have given
the impression that the strong showing of the Communists means that the
reform process has come to a halt.  Other observers, reinforced by the
government, believe that nothing has really changed and that the process
will continue at an accelerated pace.

Who is correct?

THE VOTE
In summary, the Communists were the strong showers, gaining 112 seats in the
new Duma.  However, the extreme left bloc of parties, including the
Communists, Agrarians, Women of Russia and Working Russia, gained only 58
seats, rising from 100 to 178.  Both Women of Russia and the Agrarians lost
heavily.

The far right parties, primarily the Liberal Democrats and  the  Congress of
Russian Communities (KRO), had a net loss of 7 seats.   KRO, under the
leadership of General Lebed, had been expected to do much better in the
polls, and he is expected to run in the presidential campaign in June.

Most disappointing were the results for the democratic, pro-reform parties:
Our Home is Russia, Yabloko and Democratic Choice.  As a whole, they were
able to gain only 8 seats.  Democratic Choice, which had 76 seats in the old
Duma, will have 9 in the new one.

The election results can hardly be said to contain a ringing endorsement of
the government's policies but neither can they be interpreted as being a
wholesale rejection of those policies.

Undoubtedly, there will be much speculation about the political impact of
the results in the months to come, culminating with June's presidential
elections.  Rather than trying to gauge the political impact, what can the
Duma elections tell us about Russia's business climate in at least the first
half of 1996?

POSITIVES...
The single most important factor is that neither of the two blocs most
opposed to the reform process, the Communists and the extreme nationalists,
have a majority in the new Duma.  

Even allied, which they have not thus far been able to do, the two groups
are far short of the 2/3 majority required to overturn presidential vetoes.

A simple majority of the Duma can pass a no-confidence measure or block
appointments by the prime minister.  It is not likely that the extremists
can muster sufficient votes to do the former.  The Duma's refusal to confirm
the head of the Central Bank for 13 months did nothing to hinder the
adoption of effective tight money policies.

The constitutionally weak Duma can be a thorn in the side of the current
government, but it does not appear that it do it any serious harm.

It must be remembered that 1996 has begun with a budget already in place, a
stabilized ruble, and inflation at the lowest levels since 1991. The country
appears to be poised at the beginning of a period of economic growth.

AND NEGATIVES
The fact that the center bloc of parties did not do better at the polls is
the single most negative factor of the elections.  

The vote clearly shows that a substantial portion, perhaps a majority, of
the electorate do not believe they have materially benefitted from the
reform process.  While the totals may be skewed by the elements of the
population who actually voted and may reflect a nostalgia for the "good old
days," the reform process has been dealt a psychological, if not a material,
blow.

Stock market averages are at depressed levels, down some 30% from their 1995
highs.  Investor confidence, shaken by the vote, is further upset by the
failure of the STET-Svyazinvest deal.  Many potential investors are taking a
wait-and-see attitude, pending the outcome of the June elections.

This will make it more difficult to raise sufficient capital to accomplish
the government's privatization goals.  These goals are not only critical for
the budget, but are the primary means of  modernizing Russia's economy. 

Added to this will be pressures brought by Communists and nationalists to
delay or suspend the privatization of "strategic" industries and that high
prices, perhaps unreasonably, are gotten for what enterprises are sold off.

There will be a greater effort to prevent the kind of "sweetheart" deals
which have characterized many of the major privatizations last year, and
there will be more resistance to privatizing, especially with Western
investment, the military-industrial complex.

At the same time, the Communists will probably make an effort to expand the
social safety net.  Friction between the Duma and the government may impede
enaction of  necessary legislation.  It is safe to say that this friction
will preclude any major legislative actions until after June's elections, at
the earliest.

THE NEXT 6 MONTHS...
To some extent, business in Russia will slow until June, especially as far
as major private investments are concerned.  In light of the STET deal's
collapse, there will be much more hesitancy to invest in Russia.

Russian stocks will probably remain at low levels, if only for psychological
reasons.  While they afford some investors long term gains, it will make it
more difficult for companies to raise capital.

Both President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin have stated that the
government's course will not change despite the election results, but the
results themselves will compel the government to, if not slow the pace of
reform, moderate its worst effects.

Increasing pensions and minimum wages, reimbursing investors of failed
enterprises, and similar measures may be popular and may win votes in June,
but could return the country to high inflation rates and destabilization of
the ruble.

Some of the pressures from within the Duma may result in actions positive
from a business point of view.  General Lebed, the KRO leader, has struck a
very popular chord with his attacks on bureaucratic and official corruption. 

The government has not been deaf to this message.   Any substantive
reduction in Russia's endemic problem of corruption can only benefit
business at every level.

Continued reductions in export duties will benefit exporters and the
increasing number of Russian producers engaging in export trade.  The
government will also be compelled to address the issue of unpaid wages.
This is one of the primary causes of mass discontent. Although payment may
bring inflationary pressure and worsen the deficit, the economy, at least
for the short term, will benefit from the payment of workers in rubles
instead of cigarettes, coal, paper or even tampons.

It is likely that the government will release billions of dollars in
payments for various programs in the defense, lawenforcement, agriculture
and social sectors.  It did this in the weeks before the Duma elections.
While this will exacerbate the deficit, it may help stimulate the economy in
the short term, and some industries will benefit.

It is widely expected  that economic growth will begin in the second half of
1996;  statistics indicate that it has already begun in some industries.

The government will do all it can to accelerate this process, so that more
people perceive a tangible benefit prior to the presidential elections.

AND BEYOND 
Do the Duma elections mean that Russia's economic reform process is in
serious trouble or even dead?  At this point, the answer is no.

It is not in the interest of any of the major parties, with the possible
exception of the Liberal Democrats, to drastically slow, let alone, reverse
the general course on which the country has been since 1992.

In the wake of the elections, it will probably be a tendency of the business
community, both Russian and foreign, to do nothing new;  to wait until after
the presidential elections in June.  

The next six months will be a critical period in the course of Russia's
development.  If the economy can be seen to have turned the corner, if
average citizen can see if he or she is beginning to materially benefit from
the reform process, it will continue at an accelerated pace.

Vietnam: One-year-old duty-free goods entitled to re-export

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) All duty-free goods imported into Vietnam will have to be
re-exported if they are not sold within one year, according to a recent
decision of the General Customs Department which is valid as of September 20.

However, if the owner of the goods wishes to sell one-year-old duty-free
commodities in the Vietnamese territory, a permission from the Trade Ministry
will be required, and then all import procedures and import tariffs must be
obliged.

Those duty-free commodities that have perished or are broken will not be
re-exported, but the clearance of those goods must be certified by a council
comprising representatives from the related customs office, the goods owner,
and the related finance agency.

The regulation also states that duty-free goods may be sold only to visitors
upon their entry into or exit out of the country. After purchasing duty-free
goods exit passengers are required to export all their purchased commodities.

Vietnam: Perfect recovery of footballer Hong Son's knee impossible

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HCMC) Following an examination by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
device, Ho Chi Minh City Medical Diagnostic Center (Medic) yesterday said the
injured left knee of footballer Hong Son will never be perfectly recovered.

Doctor Nguyen Thi Anh Hong, in charge of the MRI unit, said that there is a
bruise between the kneecap and the thigh bone and that the vastus medialis
was torn apart.

Son, the hero in the Vietnam-Indonesia match for the bronze at the first
ASEAN Tiger Cup in Singapore, will have to undergo a surgical operation to
have his vastus medialis re-connected, Doctor Hong noted.

She added that he will possibly have surgery on his knee to take out bruised
clotted blood if the bruise is critical.

The date to treat his injured knee has not yet been determined but his broken
vastus medialis will certainly affect his ability to maneuver on the pitch,
Doctor Hong commented.

She noted: "Even if the knee operation is done well, Son's knee will probably
not be completely returned to its previous condition."

If Hong Son cannot recover his health, this will be a big loss for the
Vietnamese football squad in forthcoming tournaments such as the third
Independence Cup in January 1997, Malaysia Open in February 1997 and the
World Cup 1998 qualifying round in March.

Vietnam: VND10 billion in urgent need to save Oceanography Institute

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HCMC) Thousands of documents archived at the Nha Trang Institute for
Oceanography, many of them dated back to the 17th and 18th century, have
deteriorated, and Vietnam needs an urgent sum of VND10 billion to save these
precious materials.

According to a survey team comprising representatives of central agencies,
many of these printed resources have become decayed and perished due to
unsuitable preservation conditions. They include scientific reports published
between the 17th and early 19th centuries, historical reports on
oceanography, and other valuable documents.

The survey team is proposing a project worth some VND10 billion to save these
materials, but measures have yet to be disclosed, according to an official
with the institute.

World briefs, September 25, 1996

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

* MOSCOW - Interfax news agency quoted top cardiologist Michael DeBakey as
saying doctors would meet on Wednesday to decide when and whether to operate
on the 65-year-old Russian president.

* LONDON - Police questioned five Irish Republican Army suspects after dawn
raids netted the biggest seizure of arms ever made in Britain. Detectives,
who believe they swooped just in time to stop the IRA wreaking havoc across
Britain, are trying to identify a sixth suspect shot dead in Monday's raids.

* BEIJING - China urged Japan not to provoked any new incidents in a row over
a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea. Japan must be
"rational...and halt activities that infringe on China's sovereignty" over
the islands - known as the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus in Japanese,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said.

* NEW DELHI - India's sickly Congress party has tapped Sitaram Kesri, a
disciple of Mahatma Gandhi, as a stop-gap chief to replace former prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. But a fierce struggle now looms as the nation's
oldest party looks for a leader to take it into the 21st century.

* COLOMBO - Sri Lankan forces halted a push into the Tamil Tiger rebels'
northern stronghold amid fierce guerrilla resistance on the third day of a
renewed battle, military officials said.

* CANBERRA - Australian Prime Minister John Howard, defying Chinese threats
of trade retaliation, has agreed to meet exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the
Dalai Lama later this week in Sydney, Howard's office said.

* PARIS - Iraq will stick to its decision to cease firing at U.S. and allied
airplanes patrolling no-fly zones in the south of the country "for a
reasonable period", Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz has said.

* BONN - A German court, overturning a precious court ruling, said that Peter
Graf, father of tennis star Steffi Graf, must stay in jail during the course
of his trial for tax evasion, his lawyer said.

Vietnam: Memoir: A visit to the U.S. (Continued from yesterday)

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Late Gen. Tran Van Tra

New York is a big city, with high-rise buildings, wide streets
and busy traffic. Nights there are wonderful, with bright lights flooding the
streets. However, it looks commonplace in daytime and is not so clean. The
city is said to contain both the good and the bad things of the entire United
States of America. On my visit there, I saw a lot of homeless, jobless and
vagabond people. It snowed on some days but sunshine still dominated our
stay. On the streets, in the universities and at conferences I met many men
and women in casual clothes behaving in a sincere manner and devoting
themselves to their work. Even at the conference where we were the only
sponsored guests, the remainder arrived in their own cars and paid all their
expenses themselves. After the conference, people flocked to a nearby
restaurant for a party. When it ended, everybody except us pooled their money
to pay the bill. At all the parties I attended, they often drank fruit juice
rather than beer or spirits. I do not know whether this is the best way to
lead a civilized and economical life. To be honest, I could not find
luxuriousness, snobbishness, and wastefulness of time and money here, at
least not among the intellectuals I met. Is it because of this that they have
become rich? One day, the Veterans' Association for Peace invited us to a
Vietnamese restaurant for a party which was attended by dozens of people. The
chairman gave a warm welcome to the veterans taking part who later reminisced
with each other about battlefields such as Hau Nghia, Tay Ninh, Binh Duong
and the Central Highlands and military units such as Division 25, Airborne
Brigade 173, Airborne Division 101, and so on. Some American veterans
apologized to the Vietnamese for the crimes they had committed during the
war. A number of others cried in the most sincere and moving fashion.

It is regrettable that due to limited time and the strictly-organized
program, I failed to meet a number of Americans and Vietnamese who phoned our
delegation to the United Nations and to Ms. Jayne, the conference organizer.
I left the country as happy as when I arrived there. The scientists and
intellectuals I met in the U.S. impressed me strongly but much of the country
was still unknown to me. Likewise, I felt so small when I stood by the river,
in the shadow of high-rises, admiring the Statue of Liberty far off-shore.
I could not approach the statue. I still remember sincere friends such as
Prof. Jayne of Long Island and Columbia universities, Prof. Kit of Cornell
University, Prof. Gabriel Kolko and his wife, who drove from Canada to Ithaca
City to meet me and gave me a set of data about the South Vietnam National
Liberation Front. It has the front's flag printed on both sides and was
compiled in London in 1968. Then an American from Canada gave it to me and
I, in my turn, took it to Saigon, now called HCMC. This was a small but
meaningful event.

* An exhibition of 30 oil paintings by Nguyen Thi Bich Nguyet will open on
September 26 at the HCMC Art Association, 218 Pasteur Street, District 1.

famous painter Nguyen Thi Tam and began to paint in 1992.

Rural life is always his chief inspiration. After touring the Mekong Delta
and the outskirts of HCMC, he painted around 100 works with simple subjects
such as lotus flowers, Hoa Binh Falls, a country market, and houseboats which
have been displayed at the HCMC Art Association, HCMC Art Museum,
Reunification Palace and the District 5 Cultural House.

Shostakovich's 90th birthday in HCMC

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Dan Vi - HCMC

D.D. Shostakovich, one of the leading "birds" of Soviet music, was a
composer, teacher, pianist, social worker and people's artiste of the former
Soviet Union. From 1947, he was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian
Republic and the former Soviet Union. He was awarded many domestic and
international prizes. He was recognized as a Working Hero of the former USSR
in 1966 and recognized as an artistic academician in Germany (1955), Italy
and the U.K. (1958).

D.D. Shostakovich died on August 9, 1975. He gave the world a precious
musical heritage including  many operas, ballets and compositions of
different genres, the most famous being the opera "The Nose" (based on a
story by Gogol) and Concert No.7 (written at the time the city of Leningrad,
now Petersburg, was under siege).

This year, his birthday was celebrated not only in Moscow, Paris and London,
but in HCMC as well. His life story and a film of his ballet entitled "The
Golden Era" were presented at the Russian Scientific and Cultural House (2bis
Tran Cao Van Street, District 1) on September 22. Tomorrow night, September
25, at HCMC Conservatory, a program of Shostakovich's works will be
performed. This program is co-organized by HCMC and the Russian Scientific
and Cultural House.

Vietnam: New book: "My death begins a new life"

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

Those who died for this country, if there are souls in existence, must be
moved with happiness. They must not feel lonely and sorrowful once they know
that their comrades are still quietly searching the countryside for their
remains. Writer and journalist Nguyen Thi Ngoc Hai reports the stories of
military doctors and nurses and groups of people who have spent decades
looking for their comrades who sacrificed their lives for the good of the
country. People can buy anything with money, except this love, which is
reserved for fellow country people and revolutionary comrades.

The book, entitled "Toi chiet, buat aeiu moat thie giuai soeng" (My Death
Begins a New Life) is evidence of Dr. Tran Van Ban's love for his comrades.
The book tells the story of his long years doing this work and has an
appendix of war martyrs whose remains Dr. Ban has found and returned to the
families.

The book was just published this year by the Tre (Youth) and Haiphong
publishing houses, costing VND12,500.

Vietnam: Company News: Woodprodex in search of investment capital

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Thien Nhan - HCMC

The Wood Products for Export Enterprise (Woodprodex) under the HCMC Service
of Agriculture currently has three production workshops in District 3 and
Binh Thanh District and a showroom at 194 Nguyen Cong Tru St., Dist. 1, HCMC.

Founded in March 1978, Woodprodex specializes in producing high-quality
household wooden products for domestic consumption as well as for export to
Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand. The
European market accounts for 70% of the enterprise's output.

The products of Woodprodex include tables and chairs for outdoor use,
cupboards, wardrobes, carved and plain shelves, etc. They are made from
various kinds of wood such as bung lung, deiu gioa and choa according to
customers' requests.

In 1989 Woodprodex formed a joint venture with a French partner to produce
sophisticated products designed to appeal to the French market. This 20-year
term joint venture has a total investment capital of US$40,000, with
Vietnamese side holding a 20% stake.

A second joint venture was formed in 1992 between Woodprodex and the Scansia
Co. of Malaysia with a total investment capital of US$500,000, with the
foreign side holding a 60% stake. This joint venture focuses on producing
household products. Its duration is 15 years.

These two joint ventures have created 900 jobs for local residents. In 1995
alone, the joint ventures achieved a turnover of US$5 million, 80% of which
came from the second joint venture thanks to its mass production.

In the first eight months of this year, excluding the above two joint
ventures, Woodprodex signed six contracts worth US$430,000 and achieved a
turnover of US$260,000. It is expected that the enterprise's turnover this
year will be double that of last year, and will increase by 50% again next
year.

Director of Woodprodex, Mr. Nguyen Ngoc Tam, said that over the next four
years, in addition to designing new models, the enterprise will pay close
attention to the local market as well as expand its exports to the North
American markets. Woodprodex will also buy some state-of-the-art equipment
and machinery to raise the productivity. At present, to assist it in
developing production, Woodprodex is calling for investment cooperation from
both local and foreign entities.

Foreign direct investment in Hanoi: a sweet fruit with sharp thorns

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Phan Ngoc - Hanoi

"Between now and the end of the year, Hanoi may receive an additional 20
investment licenses with a total registered capital of US$2.4 billion," said
Mr. Nguyen Do Khue, vice director of the Service of Planning and Investment
of Hanoi. These projects, including the US$2.1 billion construction of an
urban area in South Thang Long, have been submitted to the authorized bodies
for approval.

However, they are only prospects for the future as Hanoi is facing
difficulties in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).

When the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment (SCCI) and the State
Planning Committee merged to become the Ministry of Planning and Investment
(MPI), as in other provinces, FDI flow in Hanoi came to a standstill as many
feasibility studies were delayed by the administrative restructuring. In
addition, some recent changes in Vietnamese investment policy have greatly
affected the flow of FDI in the city.

Around the time of the 8th Party Congress, investors seemed hesitant since
they were afraid that there might be many changes in investment policy. This
indirectly contributed to the reduction of FDI flow in Hanoi, especially in
the first six months of 1996.

So far this year, Hanoi has received 20 licensed projects with a total
investment capital of over US$400 million. Meanwhile, in the first six months
of last year, Hanoi received 30 projects worth US$600 million. Statistics
show that FDI capital in the first half of 1996 amounted to only 20% of that
figure.

Despite great efforts to provide better conditions for investors, the
investment environment in Hanoi is still "very bad", an official of Hanoi
People's Committee commented recently. Site clearing is still one of the
major problems of concerned bodies in the capital.

A number of projects, such as a joint venture hotel between SAS Group and
Hanoi Tourist Service Company, have been held up for four years due to
incomplete site clearing. Another project for the construction of an
expressway linking South Thang Long and Hung Vuong in the Cau Giay area in
Hanoi is at a standstill although Hanoi People's Committee offered a
compensation price of VND9 million/sq.m.

In February the Government suggested that the construction of multi-story
buildings in the urban area should be banned so a large number of hotel and
officetel projects are now blocked.

Hanoi is in an unfavorable position as regards foreign investment; however,
we are still trying our best, said Mr. Khue, adding that further cooperation
with other authorized bodies is required. The target of US$2.4 billion FDI
capital this year is an attractive fruit but one which is surrounded by sharp
thorns.

Current situation of Vietnamese roads

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Nguyen Loc - HCMC

According to foreign investors, the bad road system is one of the things
restricting the flow of foreign investment in Vietnam. However, this is also
an element which attracts foreign investors since it can bring benefit for
those who dare to put money into road construction.

Vietnam has 148,000 km of road network including 14,673 km of national
highways and 14,503 km of provincial roads, the remainder being rural roads.
Only 13.1% of the total network is asphalted. Over half of the national
highways are asphalted but they can withstand only 50%-70% of the required
pressure.

Narrow bridges with a maximum load-bearing capacity of 43 tons and temporary
bridges make up 20% of all bridges crossing the national highways.

In general, bad roads account for 40% of the Vietnamese road and one-third
of these are seriously damaged. This is the major difficulty of the
communications and transport sector.

According to the Ministry of Communications and Transport, a sum of VND33
trillion will be required to upgrade existing roads and build new ones
between now and the year 2000.

Priority will be given to upgrading the 2,289-km National Highway No.1 with
capital mainly borrowed from overseas organizations. In addition, the 25-km
road on Hai Van Pass in the central region and the bridges of Song Gianh, My
Thuan, Can Tho and others are now being constructed.

In the North, the 106-km National Road No. 5 linking Hanoi and Haiphong is
being upgraded and widened to four lanes and is expected to be completed in
1999. The construction of the 40-km Lang-Hoa Lac Expressway has been started
and is part of the infrastructure development program of the capital.

In the central region, work on National Highway No. 14 and National Highway
No. 14B linking Danang and the Central Highlands is also under way. In
addition, investors are now interested in the construction of a Trans-Asia
route linking North Thailand and Vietnam via National Highway No. 9.

Meanwhile, in the South, National Highways No. 51 and No. 52 stretching 83
km from Ho Chi Minh City to Vung Tau are being upgraded and will have four
lanes. Moreover, the construction of a road leading to Phnom Penh and Bangkok
via Moc Bai Border Gate, financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is
expected to start in the near future.

Vietnam: Reviewing the works on fire prevention

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

The HCMC Fire Prevention and Fighting Department last Friday held a meeting
at the City Hall for  briefing on the implementation of Instruction 175/CT
dated May 31,1991 issued by Chairman of the Ministerial Board, (currently the
Prime Minister) concerning fire prevention works during the past five years.

That five-year period has witnessed 1,024 fires killing 65, injuring 124 and
causing damages of about VND52 billion. There was a reduction of  24 cases
(2.12%) but an increase of VND29.88 billion in damages (135.15%) in
comparison with the previous five-year period.

Also in that period, the concerned authorities have made great efforts to
strengthen the fire-fighting force including the 3,405 training classes as
well as the investment of over VND88 billion to equip fire-fighting
facilities.

With the above results, the People's Committee of HCMC, People's Police
Bureau, the Prime Minister and the Interior Minister awarded many medals and
letters of commendation to units and individuals that have contribution to
the fire-prevention and fighting work.

On September 20 the Fire Brigade of the HCMC Police organized a preliminary
review of five years of implementation of Government Instruction 175/CP
issued on May 31, 1991 on strengthening fire prevention nationwide.

The Police Department awarded congratulatory certificates to the fire brigade
sector and the HCMC People's Committee awarded congratulatory certificates
to organizations and individuals who have made achievements in the fire
prevention movement.

Participating in the event were Mr. Vo Hung Viet, Vice-Chairman of the HCMC
People's Committee, Mr. Vo Thai Hoa, Deputy Minister of Interior, Mr. Bui
Quoc Huy, Director of HCMC Police and other representatives of the districts
and neighboring provinces.

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Government
of Vietnam are holding the country's first-ever international colloquium on
public administration reform on September 24-26 at the Daewoo Hotel in Hanoi.
The colloquium has brought together 30 Vietnamese senior officials and 22
representatives from 18 different countries to discuss strategies, approaches
and experiences relating to public administration reform in different
socio-political settings, focusing on countries in transition to a market
economy.

The conference will serve as a forum for Vietnam's leaders to discuss with
and learn from other countries about the successes and mistakes in the area
of public administration reform.

This colloquium is an activity of the UNDP-funded Public Administration
Reform Program which has helped the Government to improve its reforms while
in transition to a market economy.

This week, it is expected that the Government will approve a pilot project,
co-funded by UNDP and the government of the Netherlands, to help Quang Binh
Province speed up its public administration reform process.

UNDP and Dutch government to fund administration projects

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

UNDP and the Dutch government will provide more than US$3 million to help the
province strengthen its public administration system to better meet the needs
of the people. The pilot project - a follow-up to the UNDP-funded Public
Administration Reform Program - will directly support the development of the
Government's national public administration reform program in other
provinces.

"Reforms and governments exist to make  life better for the people ," said
Mr. Morey head of UNDP in Vietnam. "Reforms should not only  be efficient but
there also needs to be elements of integrity, justice,fairness and honesty.
Reforms are  not just about changing and standardizing the rules. It's also
important to  change the   behaviors of those in government to better serve
the people. This conference is a positive  sign from the Government that it
is committed to improving the public administration system in Vietnam."

Vietnam: Increasing rice export quota

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has officially decided to increase
this year's rice export quota to 2.2 million tons, revealed a source from the
Ministry of Trade.

This is an opportunity for commercial banks to pump more capital into
circulation as some VND2,000 billion is still stockpiled at commercial banks
in the country.

State commercial banks loaned VND2,395 billion to rice traders to buy paddy
from farmers in the first eight months of this year, raising total loans for
rice trading businesses to VND4,200 billion, said a source from the State
Bank.

The same source noted that commercial banks are authorized to lend money to
those enterprises which are in need of capital to purchase rice for export
without being restricted by credit ceilings.

It is expected that Vietnam will have exported 2.15 million tons of rice by
the end of this month.

Vietnam to exploit one million cubic meters of wood

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) Vietnam plans to exploit some one million cubic meters of wood
next year, of which 650,000 cubic meters come from natural forests and the
remainder from cultivated forests, an official source said.

Mr. Le Dinh Loan, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development, said that the country will also plant an additional 500,000
hectares of forests.

The Forestry Development Division of the ministry, Mr. Loan added, has set
out plans to manage and protect 9.3 million hectares for the period between
now until the year 2000.

Vietnam's total area of forests was 9.3 million hectares by the end of last
year. Of the figure, natural forests were 8.2 million hectares and cultivated
forests 1.04 million hectares.

The total area of natural forests is becoming smaller all the time; Vietnam
had 11 million hectares in 1976, but only 10 million hectares in 1980, 9.3
million hectares in 1985, 8.4 million hectares in 1990 and 8.25 million last
year.

1996, of an investment of US$3 million in Indotel Limited, a company
incorporated in Singapore. BMF is a founder shareholder of Indotel  with AAPC
Asia Pte. Ltd., the Vietnam Investment Fund (Singapore) Limited, Beta Vietnam
Fund Limited and Luculia International Limited, according to a press release.

Indotel has been established to develop, operate and invest in hotels and

Borrowings in respect of the Sofitel Metropole, Novotel Danang and Ibis
Haiphong have been or will be provided by the International Finance
Corporation. Borrowing in respect of the Novotel Haiphong will be provided

(SGT-HCMC) Enhancement of export-oriented industries and other foreign
earners are among major resolutions that Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai
suggested to HCMC after his recent fact-finding tour to this southern city.

In a notice just issued by the Government Office last Saturday, the Deputy
Prime Minister urged HCMC to restructure its economy by strengthening export
industries and foreign-earning service sectors.

To do so, the city should encourage projects to produce goods for export, and
to expand its overseas markets. Production firms should be supported in
seeking export markets for their own products, according to Deputy PM Khai.

Urban management is another vital task for the city, Khai insisted. He called
for the city authority to speed up the development of new urban centers and
new industrial zones to ease the over-populated situation in the inner city.

"Concentrated industrial zones must be built outside of the city in line with
the general master plan of the city ... to attract people into new
residential areas," according to the notice of the Government Office.

Relating to the pollution issue, Deputy PM Khai allowed the city to use money
from selling state-owned houses to remove houses along the Nhieu Loc-Thi Nghe
Canal. He also asked the Ministry of Planning and Investment to earmark money
from official development assistance sources to improve the city's
environment.

Other issues that the city needs to tackle are traffic congestion,
uncontrolled inflow of immigrants, and loose management over land and houses
in the city.

Deputy PM Khai also urged the city to mobilize all resources to accelerate
its economic growth rate. In the first eight months of this year, HCMC has
made good economic growth, but signals of economic recession and stagnation
in production have appeared.

* Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Khanh said here yesterday the Government
encourages all people to contribute capital for acquisition of new medical
equipment and for developing new clinics in the country.

Khanh, speaking during a visit to the HCMC Medical Center (Medic), reiterated
that the Government supports this form of investment to upgrade the country's
health care system. "There needs to be a statute governing the operation of
a public-funded system of clinics where all people can offer their financial
contribution," the Deputy Prime Minister said.

The six-year-old Medic has developed robustly since its establishment thanks
to financial support from workers of the center itself (accounting for 70%
of the assets of the center). Some 30% of the center's stake is owned by
other individuals, said Mr. Phan Thanh Hai, director of Medic.

Hai, addressing the Deputy Prime Minister, said that his clinic is providing
health care services to some 1,000 people per day. With higher demands from
the people, Medic's equipment and facilities are becoming obsolete, and need
to be upgraded. "We want to turn Medic into a people-funded medical center,"
Hai proposed to the Government leader.

Vietnam: Stricter measures for import-export debtors

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) Five measures to deal with evasion of import-export taxes in 1996
and 1997 will be applied in the near future, according to Circular No. 56
TT/LB issued on September 17 by the Ministry of  Finance and General
Department of Customs.

The measure for strengthening the collection of import-export debt will be
implemented under the form of forcing debtors to pledge to pay stagnant debts
before September 30 or asking the Debt Settlement Board to either collect the
debt or erase it for disbanded enterprises.

The measure of collecting unpaid taxes from bank accounts of enterprises will
be imposed on import-export enterprises unwilling to pay taxes as of October
1, 1996.

Import and export goods will be confiscated when the above two measures fail.

The measure of putting assets equivalent to unpaid taxes as collateral will
be imposed on enterprises which have not paid overdue import-export taxes due
to acceptable difficulties.

The measure of suspending import-export operations will be imposed on
enterprises which have long overdue taxes or have ignored all the above
measures.

Vietnam, UNDP join to prevent HIV/AIDS in nationwide project

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HCMC) At present, a two-year UNDP (United Nations Development Program)
project worth US$1 million launched in early 1996 is providing technical
assistance to the Vietnam National AIDS Committee, the National Women's Union
and the Youth Union, provincial AIDS committees and non-governmental
organizations to enhance Vietnam's capacity to mobilize, plan and coordinate
its policies and programs in prevention and care.

According to statistics from the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee, as of
Sept. 7, the number of virus-infected cases reached 4,316 including 80
foreigners and 4,239 locals.

Dr.Roy Morey, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative said
that the conference on HIV/AIDS  organized in Vietnam on Sept. 23 and 24
highlights the need to put a special emphasis on today's youth in and out of
school to protect them from this deadly disease.

Since 1991, the Vietnamese Government has disbursed funding for AIDS
prevention operations every year. In 1991, the budget earmarked about VND300
million and increased to VND45 billion in 1995. It is estimated that from
1996 to 2000, annual disbursement from the Government for the AIDS prevention
programs will reach over VND50 billion.

Today, worldwide, more than 50% of those newly infected by HIV are between
the ages of 15-24, and the number of virus-infected cases every day is 8,500.
In many places, among 15-19 year-olds, two girls are infected with the virus
for every boy.

Vietnam: World Bank pledges more loan commitments

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The World Bank plans to offer Vietnam loans of US$1.5 billion over
the three financial years 1997-1999 in the second capital
supplementation from its agency, the International Development
Association (IDA).

The good news was announced by the director of the Asia-Pacific
Department of the World Bank, Javad Khalilzadeh Shirazi, during his
visit to Vietnam last week to review two years of implementation of
the IDA-funded projects and discuss preparations for the 4th
consulting conference of international donors for Vietnam in Hanoi
late this year. During talks with Deputy PM Phan Van Khai, Shirazi
expressed good impressions of Vietnam's economic reform and
promised that the World Bank will continue to help Vietnam settle
debts through the London Club.

According to the International Relations Department of the State
Bank, the World Bank has announced the list of projects expected to
receive its funding in the financial years 1997-1998-1999 with
respective amounts of US$641 million, US$458 million and US$345
million. The projects are related to rural and urban transport,
tertiary education, power transmission, agriculture, energy, water
resources and other fields.

In financial years 1993-1996, the WB approved loans for 12 projects
totalling US$1,275 million with 11 projects already signed,
excluding a rural transport project worth US$54 million under
negotiation. Since October 1993, it has organized three conferences
of international donors for Vietnam with the total loans committed
amounting to US$1.7-US$2 billion each year. Vietnam is now the
second largest recipient of WB loans after India.

Vietnam: Largest BOT investment in power sector

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The U.S. energy company Oxbow International has been selected as
investor of the Hoanh Bo Thermopower Plant (300MW), Vietnam's first
BOT (build-operate-transfer) project in the power sector.

The project, to be built in Hoanh Bo District, Quang Ninh Province
with an investment captal of US$300 million, will use the world's
most modern technology in thermopower production and all the low
energy coal available in Quang Ninh (about 1.2 million tons/year)
as fuel. It will supply power to factories and industrial zones in
Hanoi, Haiphong and Quang Ninh and possibly to southern provinces
of China.

The project is due to start operation in 1999 and will be
transferred to Vietnam after 20 years.

At present, another BOT project in the power sector is under the
Government's consideration. The project, to be located in Ba
Ria-Vung Tau Province, is a diesel-powered plant with a capacity of
120 MW, which will be invested by the Finnish company Wartsila.
Total investment capital is US$110 million.

Vietnam: A proper dose for beer production

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Deputy PM Phan Van Khai requested the Ministry of Industry and the
Vietnam Beer, Liquor and Beverage Corporation (Vinabeco) to
re-organize the chaos in beer and wine production.

During his recent working session with the corporation, Khai
complained that beer factories have been built in many localities
without proper planning and market study. At present, 46 out of 53
provinces in Vietnam have beer enterprises, many of which,
including joint ventures, suffer losses and become a burden for the
State budget. Khai warned that Vietnamese partners must carefully
select foreign partners to establish beer JVs and increase their
stakes in the JVs. He instructed the Ministry and concerned
authorities to prepare  a plan for the development of beer, liquor
and beverage production and to reorganize existing factories,
adding that small and ineffective companies should be dissolved
before licenses are granted to new businesses.

Vinabeco produced 103 million liters of beer, 10.5 million liters
of beverages and 740,000 liters of liquor in the first half of this
year. Compared with the same period of 1995, the beer production
increased by 17 million liters and beverages by 22.1 million liters
but liquor decreased by 97,000 liters. To increase competiveness,
Vinabeco will establish a trading company to distribute all the
products of its affiliated units. It now has 2,091 sale agents
nation-wide with sales reaching over VND1 trillion in the first
half of this year, accounting for 51% of its yearly target.

Vietnam: Trade review after a decade of doi moi

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

A conference to review trade activities during the ten years of doi
moi and discuss measures to increase the effectiveness of trading
enterprises and set goals and directions for the period 1996-2000
was held in HCMC recently by the Ministry of Trade.

According to reports at the conference, by the end of 1995, there
were 1,900 State enterprises, 6,000 private enterprises, over 2,000
limited liability companies, 35 joint stock companies and one
million households engaged in trade. However, only 30% of the
enterprises operate at a profit; 40% have normal operations but
with little profit and face capital shortage and debts and 30%
suffer losses. On average, 10 enterprises suffered losses annually
in the past five years.

The goals of the trade sector for the 1996-2000 five-year plan are
to increase sales by 2.5 times compared with 1995 with an average
growth rate of 20%/year, export turnover by 28-32%/year to reach
US$18-20 billion by 2000, and import turnover by 24-28%/year to
reach US$22-25 billion by 2000.

Measures to reach these goals include re-organizing State
enterprises with modern business methods, equitizing part or all of
the assets of these enterprises, defining the mechanism,
responsibility and authority of the State ownership for the
enterprise and upgrading the qualification of sales personnel.

In the first eight months of this year, domestic trade developed
well thanks to an abundant supply of goods which could meet 95% of
domestic consumers' demand. Along with this, price fevers due to
shortage of goods did not occur and inflation was curbed at 2.2%.
However, there are signs of a surplus of goods due to over-imports
and increased domestic production while purchasing power rose
slowly. The trade sector expects to reach total sales of VND180
trillion this year.

According to the Ministry of Trade, Vietnam has trading relations
with 105 countries and territories and has signed trade agreements
with over 60 countries. Trading activities attract over two million
people, contribute to 34% of total budget revenues (excluding
revenues from JVs with foreign partners) and account for 14% of the
GDP.

Vietnam: Press Highlights, September 13-20, 1996

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

A weekly review of issues featured in the local press

By TRAN TRONG THUC - HCMC

The first ASEAN Football Cup, Tiger Cup 96, obscured other events
last week as it dominated the front pages of major newspapers.
Readers not only closely read the comments on the Cup by sports
writers but also put football on top of their discussions in
schools and offices, especially the glory and gloom of the
Vietnamese team playing on Singapore grounds.

HCMC-based newspapers, such as Sai Gon Giai Phong (Saigon
Liberation), Tuoi Tre (Youth), Nguoi Lao Dong (Laborer) and Thanh
Nien (Youngsters), seemed to put more emphasis on this sporting
tournament than their centrally run and northern counterparts. The
Tuoi Tre ran the headline "50 Minutes of Collapse, 40 Minutes of
Revival" for its report on the semi-final match in which Vietnam
lost to Thailand 2-4. The Tuoi Tre Sunday featured a cogent
commentary affirming Vietnamese football has attained regional high
ranking status.

The Sai Gon Giai Phong also reported the Vietnamese team's matches
on its front page but printed no comments. Lao Dong's (Labor)
sports section highlighted a long article concluding that the
Vietnamese team showed better performance than it did in the 18th
Sea Games last year. Tiger Cup '96 came to an end on September 15
with Vietnam ranking third after Thailand and Malaysia.

However, the Vietnamese press has made some spontaneous remarks in
a few articles on this sports event. The national team and,
particularly, chief coach Karl Weigang were extolled when winning
but disparaged every time they suffered losses. The Tuoi Tre
published an interview with an indecent query, "Mr. Weigang, when
do you think you will be dismissed?" On that day, the newspaper
received many phone calls from readers in response to the question.
"Weigang has both merits and problems," was the Tuoi Tre answer.
This explanation complies with the contents of a book to be
marketed late this month entitled, "The Unknowns of Vietnamese
Football."

Meanwhile, the lead economic story of the week was an interview
with an official from the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI)
covered by the Nguoi Lao Dong. Headlined "Revised Bill on Foreign
Investment: More Attractive and Reasonable," the interview showed
that Vietnam's law on foreign investment will be amended so that it
will create more favorable conditions for investors. Some examples
of new advantages are: reduced time for investment evaluation,
permission to pool in capital in Vietnamese currency, expansion of
the joint venture form, and elongation of the tax holiday period.

More than one month ago, a Tuoi Tre investigative report on
Vietnam-ese women marrying Taiwanese men aroused public attention.
Last week, the HCMC-based Phu Nu (Women) showed even more of the
bitter reality by publishing an article quoting sources from the
Taiwanese press. This women's newspaper contended that the
Taiwanese story on the service of marrying Vietnamese, and
Taiwanese stipulations on marriages with foreigners are a
humiliation to Vietnamese women. The Phu Nu went as far as
proposing that the law should rule that only foreign men with
adequate health, education and income, and without handicaps are
qualified to marry Vietnamese women. Of course, these are only
proposals for consideration.

Vietnam: Investment Environment Remains Attractive

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Many people have been concerned about the fact that foreign-direct
investment (FDI) has fallen into a decline as the investment
environment has proven problematic while the pressure of
competition from other regional countries has strongly increased.
Deputy Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Nhac talks about
this issue.

Could you talk about the situation of FDI since early this year?

By August 20 this year, the Ministry of Planning and Investment
(MPI) had licensed 186 projects, worth some US$4.35 billion. Of
this sum, the build-operate-transfer project for the international
seaport Sao Mai-Ben Dinh in Vung Tau makes up US$637 million, and
the float glass plant of Japanese Asahi in Song Be Province US$125
million. In the same period last year, total registered capital of
licensed projects was over US$4.57 billion.

So this indicates a slight decline in FDI?

In my opinion, we should first examine whether or not foreign
investors are still interested in seeking business opportunities or
investment projects in the country once the tempo of FDI influx is
mentioned. Between the beginning of the year and August 20, the
ministry received 237 projects, with total registered capital
reaching US$7.25 billion compared with US$4.94 billion in the same
period last year. Currently, many projects have not yet been
licensed as they are big and important; therefore, it takes time to
consider them carefully.

Between now and the end of the year, it is certain that the
government will license a number of large projects such as Dung
Quat Oil Refinery No.1 (US$1.5 billion), Quang Ninh 300 MW
thermo-power plant and a Vietnam-Hyundai ship-building yard. In
addition, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has assigned the relevant
State agencies to map out policies and regulations regarding
several pilot urban development projects with the involvement of
foreign investors such as those in An Khanh, Thu Duc District,
HCMC, and on the outskirts of Hanoi.

I often follow the foreign press and see that some say the tempo of
FDI influx into Vietnam has stayed constant. However, they used
figures of a particular week or month as proof. Several foreign
news agencies have even tried to assert that we plan to reduce the
amount of FDI into the country by inventing statistics which we
have not ever seen before.

Some people are worried that the country's investment environment
is not attractive and is discouraging foreign investors. They refer
to a number of cases including the recent inspection of
foreign-invested projects and the withdrawal of investment
licenses.

It is necessary for functional State agencies to carry out
inspections periodically to find whether foreign-invested
enterprises need any assistance in resolving unexpected problems or
abiding by stipulations in their licenses and Vietnamese laws. This
is ordinary State management work, which foreign businesses are
willing to agree on and cooperate. Foreign newspapers have
mentioned a number of projects whose licenses have been pulled back
before expiry in an attempt to prove that the country's investment
environment has become worse. There is nothing abnormal in
withdrawing licenses from unfeasible and unprofitable projects
prior to expiry. I was very interested in the opinion of an
Australian high trade commissioner in Vietnam; when asked about the
withdrawal of Australian BHP from an oil exploitation project, this
commissioner noted that this is very common everywhere around the
world.

Vietnam's potential rivals from regional countries concern many
people. Could you please analyze the advantages which the country
has in attracting FDI?

Competition has always existed, therefore, we have to accept the
challenges. I think that, at present, the competitive edges which
play the most important role in luring FDI are Vietnam's
development requirements, stability on a macro-scale, and
participation in the ASEAN Free Trade Area. Some foreign
conglomerates, such as Japanese Sanyo and South Korean Daewoo, tend
to set foot in the country as a stepping-stone to expand their
markets to the whole region. They are planning to move their plants
to Vietnam and to export products back to their countries. Vietnam
also has other advantages including low-cost labor and land.

In the future, what measures will the Government adopt to raise the
FDI influx to a higher level?

We are designing policies to attract FDI not only with higher
quantity, but also higher quality. To actualize these policies, the
amended Foreign Investment Law will be presented to the National
Assembly for approval in October this year. This amended law will
contain articles intended to provide preferential treatment for the
State-promoted areas, accelerate administrative reforms, and
improve the investment environment and the efficiency of State
management in FDI activities. In addition, there may be some other
articles stipulating that investors can file complaints and
litigate if Government officials process formalities slowly or
intentionally cause difficulties. I believe that the country's
economic development strategies, legal framework, improved
investment environment, and comparative advantages will certainly
attract the FDI influx into Vietnam.

Vietnam's post & telecom updates

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

* According to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU),
Vietnam ranks second in the world in telecom development with a
growth rate of 70%/year. The statement was made after the ITU
completed a comprehensive study of the telecom development
worldwide.

The ITU also reported that Vietnam is the 60th out of 205 countries
which has one million telephones and uses 95% of digital electronic
exchanges.

* According to Vietnamese experts in the post and telecom sector,
to meet increasing demands in the future, Vietnam must expand
operations by fivefold from the present level. Mai Liem Truc,
general director of Vietnam Post and Telecom Corporation (VNPT),
said that the telecom sector must invest over VND3,000 billion to
reach the goal of 5-6 telephones/100 people by the year 2000.

By late August, VNPT had reached one million telephone subscribers,
a milestone marking the rapid development of the telecom sector.
This has made Vietnam an attractive market for international
telecom companies. At present, over 30 of the world's telecom
giants are operating  in Vietnam and US$750 million in FDI have
been poured into this sector.

* At present, there are over one million telephones in Vietnam or
more than one set/100 people. Post and telecom authorities have
plans to increase the telephone ratio to 5-6 sets/100 people by the
year 2000, raising the number of phone lines to 4.1 million by 2000
(in particular HCMC and Hanoi: 20 sets/100 people). Also, in this
period, the fiber optic cable linking Vietnam, China, Laos,
Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand will be built and satellite
communications will be expanded with the launch of a telecom
satellite expected in 1999.

Vietnam: Boosting Telecom Service Competitiveness

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The Saigon Postel Corp. held a shareholders' meeting to set up the
corporation on August 17, 1996 in accordance with a license granted
by the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee on December 27, 1995.
The corporation's establishment has been given a green light by the
Government, and its regulations on organization and operation have
been approved by the Directorate General of Post &
Telecommunications.

By Minh Trang

The corporation will operate in line with the Company and State
Enterprise Laws, and in the form of a joint-stock company with a
chartered capital of VND50 billion contributed by 11 member units.

Referring to the corporation's trading program in the initial stage
(1996-2000), General Director Trinh Dinh Khuong said that it will
implement post and telecom activities in the first year (1996): The
Co Giang Post Center will be put into operation with such services
as parcel and package delivery and remittance; the corporation will
act as an agent introducing and trading in input-output equipment
(two to three outlets in the city) and as an agent for other postal
services.

The Saigon Postel Corp. will also prepare a design to construct a
telecom-informatics-electronics hi-tech park on a 40-ha area in Thu
Duc District. Later, the corporation will develop two to three
centers with 10-20 branches in cities and provinces nationwide. At
the same time, the corporation will carry out, step by step,
cordless and mobile phone services from Tay Ninh, Dong Nai and Vung
Tau to the Mekong Delta, Hanoi and Haiphong.

In addition, by the year 2000 the corporation will put a joint
venture into operation which will manufacture and assemble
telecommunication equipment with an estimated capacity averaging
200,000-250,000 items per annum, of which 50 percent will be for
export.

The corporation will also take preparatory steps to participate, if
permitted, in the national satellite program and project of
investing in and operating services via satellite.

This is the third entity specializing in the post and telecom area
following the Vietnam Post and Telecom Corp. (VNPT) and the
Military Telecom Co.

Vietnam: Health Care Equality

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The living standards of the people have been increasing constantly
with the improvement of socio-economic conditions, and so has the
demand for medical care. However, can people from different strata
of the population receive equal treatment in health care?

By Phuong Anh

Upgrading medical care

The document "Oriented strategies of medical care and health
protection for the population by the years 2000 and 2020," prepared
by the Health Ministry clearly stated, "To invest in the
population's health is actually to invest in the national
socio-economic development, and we must strive to improve our
people's health to the average level of the nations in the region."

Health Minister Do Nguyen Phuong predicted: In 2000 there will be
419 doctors for every one million people, 700 general hospitals at
provincial level and 10,000 fully equipped dispensaries for
ordinary medical care nationwide, and each person will spend US$8
per year on average for medicine. Meanwhile, the Ministry will
gradually diversify the forms of medical care and treatment with
various types of hospitals: State-run, joint venture and private,
but State-run health care will play the leading role. The creation
of these forms of health care must meet the actual demand of the
population and by no means should health care be commercialized.

At present, there is one private hospital charging low fees in
Quang Nam - Da Nang Province. In the future, there will be more
hospitals of this type to meet the demands of the population. In
the meantime, the Health Ministry is focusing on building two
specialized medical centers in Hanoi and HCM City by decision of
the Prime Minister in July 1995 with the objective to elevate
medical service to the level of hospitals in some countries of the
region.

The specialized medical center in Hanoi, the first to be built,
will be operating late this year. It will receive technical support
from four hospitals and a college; the Bach Mai Hospital for
instance, will assist with laboratory tests, emergency and recovery
and endoscopy.

The specialized medical center in HCM City is also under
construction. At the moment, partner hospitals and colleges are
being selected. Other specialized medical centers will be built
thereafter in Central Vietnam and other economic zones. Yet, the
development of Vietnam's medical system is still inadequate since
it cannot cover every part of the country and big differences in
care and treatment exist between urban and rural areas, the poor
and the rich.

Equality in medical services

Implementing the policy of equality of the Party and Government,
the Ministry of Health maintains three systems of medical coverage:
medical insurance, free of charge, and payable service.

Medical insurance covers only public servants and people working in
some non-State enterprises. Free services are available to certain
groups of people: those having contributed to the national
salvation, and those living in the highlands or certified as having
serious difficulties. Thus, only a limited number of persons can
enjoy State subsidies for medical care and the majority of the
country's 75 million people - most of them are farmers - must pay
doctor's bills. Generally, patients have to pay large fees for
special treatment; for instance, VND 1 million for a liter of blood
transfused during an operation. There are areas reserved for rich
patients in one hospital with good physicians and plenty of
medicines. Poorer patients receive little care at low cost or free
of charge.

From the economic viewpoint, this mode of treatment is fair since,
"the more you pay, the better service you get." This concept,
however, is not fair from a humane point of view so it was decided
to build hospitals for the poor. And the Health Ministry promised
that each hospital will have various forms of treatment but at
least 21% of the patients will be treated free of charge.

Vietnam's medical care must be improved both qualitatively and
quantitatively to meet the increasing demand of the population, the
great majority of which are poor. Since the gap between rich and
poor is widening, small groups of richer people can enjoy more
privileges while the poor especially those in the hinterlands and
the mountains suffer from lack of medical care.

Should medical care be commercialized?

Prof. Nguyen Nguyen Khoi, head of the Artificial Kidney Section,
Bach Mai Hospital remarked: "Medical care must have some economic
characteristics since all modern treatment is expensive and the
patient must pay for the amortization of equipment and materials
consumed. The hospital can recover the capital invested after five
years and the State no longer has to invest in it. However, not all
patients can afford such costly treatment. Therefore, we have to
consider some way to help those who cannot pay. Perhaps, a health
insurance policy is propitious, but it must be suitable to meet the
costs." Therefore, we still have to wait.

Vietnam: PM approves HCMC municipal development fund

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The Prime Minister has approved a proposal to establish a municipal
development fund for HCMC submitted by the Ministry of Finance.

The fund is a State-owned financial entity with chartered capital
of VND500 billion, which will be mobilized from revenues from the
sales of State-owned houses, lotteries and land use, electricity
and water surcharges, telephone charges, local budget and
contributions and loans from local and foreign individuals.

The fund will make investments in socio-economic infrastructure
development projects in HCMC and engage in other operations such as
investment consulting services, equitization of State-owned
enterprises and stock exchange. Its lending rates will be set by
the HCMC People's Committee but they must not exceed the lending
rates for medium and long term loans stipulated by the State Bank.

The fund will enjoy tax reduction and exemption in accordance with
the law.

This year, HCMC expects to mobilize VND17,000-18,000 billion, up by
33.7-41% from 1995 and accounting for 36% of the local GDP. The
amount, to come from different sources, including the local budget,
land fund, bond sales, lottery revenues, foreign investment, loans
and foreign aid, will be used for socio-economic development,
especially infrastructure development, which is estimated at
VND3,500 billion. Key infrastructure projects include the Bac Nha
Be-Nam Binh Chanh Road, Nguyen Tri Phuong Bridge and Road, the road
from Ong Lanh Bridge to Hiep Phuoc Industrial Park, the belt
highway over Saigon River to Bac Nha Be-Nam Binh Chanh Road, the
north-south artery, Ton Duc Thang Road and Bridge, and industrial
parks such as Tan Thoi Hiep, Cu Chi and others.

Vietnam: Gov't takes strong measures against tax debtors

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The Prime Minister has issued an instructive allowing concerned
authorities to take strong measures to settle the import-export tax
arrears, which has seriously affected collections for the State
budget.

Instructive 575/TTg dated Aug.24 has assigned the General
Department of Customs and the Ministry of Finance to consider tax
exemption or reduction of fines for late payment of taxes for
businesses which have paid the taxes due before Sept.30, 1996.
Regarding tax debt incurred before April 1, 1992 which businesses
are unable to pay (due to dissolution, bankruptcy or losses), the
two authorities must investigate the situation and recommend to the
Government to cancel the debts.

Beginning October 1, 1996, the General Department of Customs will
coordinate with the Finance Ministry and the State Bank to deduct
the balance in the bank account of import-export businesses that
fail to pay overdue import-export taxes after Sept.30 or to seize
their goods for auctions to recover the overdue taxes.

In addition, long debtors of import-export taxes may be subject to
suspension of business licenses, and depending on the seriousness
of violations, may be fined or prosecuted for criminal
responsibility.

When Will Vietnam Have a Well-Built Generation?

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Investment in improving the health of school-age children is a big
concern of every country, with a view to bettering its people's
physical fitness, as well as to having stable human resources to
serve the country's development process. Here are excerpts from an
interview with Nguyen Vo Ky Anh, chief of the Physical Education
Department (the Ministry of Education and Training) concerning this
problem.

Compared with other regional countries, Vietnamese people are much
smaller, shorter and lighter. Could you tell us what will be the
physical fitness standard of Vietnamese in the future, specifically
to the year 2020?

As far as we are concerned, by the year 2000, Vietnamese should try
to reach the average height of 1.65m (for males) and 1.60 (for
females). During past years, the physical growth of Vietnamese has
been strongly affected by the results of a number of consecutive
wars and the country's underdeveloped economy, and thus physical
training has not been a concern. Another reason for the limited
physical development of the people has been low educational
standards and lifestyle; the people lack fundamental knowledge
about the preservation and improvement of their physical condition.
The current physical growth rate of the people has not improved
much in comparison with the year 1943.

In your opinion, in order to reach the above-mentioned standard,
what must we do in terms of physical education?

Initially, we have to educate people about nutrition. In elementary
schools, we plan to bring physical fitness education programs into
the teaching curriculum, and at the secondary level, knowledge of
health will be included in subjects such as biology and citizen
education. We will try our utmost to improve the quality of these
programs.

How about the current situation of the facilities of school yards
and exercise rooms, and the amount of time reserved for physical
education?

It is discouraging for the country's physical education that at the
moment, many schools do not have play yards and exercise rooms for
pupils. The present area of school yards has been increasingly
narrowed or a major part of it has been utilized for economic
activities, building restaurants, clubs and dance halls for
example. The Ordinance concerning the construction of schools with
pedagogical standards has not been properly implemented, so many
new schools are not built with school yards. In foreign countries,
schools must have stadiums and exercise facilities to make sure the
pupils' physical training is not interrupted, rain or shine.

Physical education is now compulsory in schools, with at least two
periods a week required for all levels of education. At the
university level, after four years, students must finish five
credits in physical education if they want to take graduation
exams; elementary and secondary pupils are required to complete at
least five credits.

Teachers play an important role in the improvement of the quality
of physical education. Could you tell us whether the staffs are
professionally qualified?

Only a minority of physical education teachers have been trained in
gymnastics and sports schools, the remainder are mostly graduates
of pedagogical colleges. For the time being, the country has two
centrally managed pedagogical schools--one in Hanoi and the other
in Ho Chi Minh City, three faculties for gymnastics training and
sports teachers at Vinh, Hue and Bac Thai pedagogical universities,
and 16 departments specializing in gymnastics and sports at local
colleges, plus a number of students at the Gymnastics and Sports
University. Every year, between 400 and 1,000 teachers graduate,
but this number fails to meet the current demand. On the contrary,
educational administrators still concentrate more on how to provide
pupils and students with adequate cultural knowledge rather than
physical education. As a result students and pupils may not have
good physical fitness and this is not being given proper attention.
At the elementary level, there are no gymnastics teachers available
since teachers have to cover the curriculum and extra-curricular
activities, and directly manage classes as well. So, it is evident
that right in the first years of school, our pupils are not given
systematic physical education. Gymnastics teachers are not only
unqualified but also there are not enough to meet the demand. On
the average, at all levels of education, one teacher has to cover
2,000 pupils; this ratio at the high school level is 1/300, and
1/200 at the tertiary level. We are now lacking 30,000 gymnastics
teachers.

How much is the annual funding the State offers for physical
education?

On the whole, this funding is too low, making up only a few percent
of that reserved for general training and education. In particular,
no funding of this kind is provided for the elementary education
level.

Pupils and students only have good intellect when they are in good
physical condition. We have developed a strategy for upgrading the
quality of physical education in schools at different levels to the
year 2005. We hope the State will consider it a target to be
urgently met, like many other targets and programs of the
educational sector.

Vietnam: Tales of Mollusks

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

By Tran Quang Thinh - HCMC

The meretrix, the oyster, the shell fish, and the corbicula were
perhaps well-known long ago but nowadays, not many people know
about these bivalve mollusks.

A businessman specializing in trading in specialty sea food shared
a thought-provoking story about the oc huong (a kind of winkle).
The oc huong, which can be found along the coast from Thanh Hoa to
Ninh Thuan, Binh Thuan provinces, has a popular reputation,
especially for foreigners since its flesh is delicious and rich in
protein. Unfortunately, this kind of mollusk has been exploited
carelessly and uncontrollably on a large scale since 1992.
Admittedly, the purchase, processing and export of oc huong have
brought about practical economic changes creating more employment
for laborers but unfortunately, fishermen have been hunting the oc
huong excessively. Consequently, natural reserves of oc huong are
running out and there will not be any left in the future.

On a business trip not long ago to central Vietnam, the author had
a chance to hear about a kind of oyster named so long from a
colleague who disclosed that provincial authorities in Binh Thuan
had put a ban on catching this shellfish from now to July 31,1998.
This was an urgent solution to restore and maintain so long beds
along the coast, which were once considered the "richest mines of
so long's" in the entire country. Because of rash exploitation, the
so long has dropped in number and the supply has been exhausted.
The amount caught per year has decreased considerably: 25,000 tons
in 1993, 20,000 in 1994 and then 10,000 in 1995. Most were  young
oysters. Undoubtedly, the so long is still threatened with
extinction. Previously, authorities forbade exploiting a scallop
named diep in 1994 to 1995 to preserve this specialty.

These examples are not special cases. It seems that people are
always "good" at thoughtlessly depleting resources which appear to
be boundless.

Recently, an alarm was raised about a kind of shellfish named oc
gao in Tien Giang. The yield of oc gao caught this year plummeted
dramatically. There may be many causes but the most obvious is
overwhelming exploitation without planning or control. It is said
there might be a temporary prohibition on catching oc gao soon to
protect this breed, which means consumers will not have a chance to
taste oc gao.

"Will there be any chia voi (pipefish) in the future?" It is said
that if visitors come to Nha Be (a suburban district in Ho Chi Minh
City) and do not taste the specialty chia voi, it means that they
still have not set foot in Nha Be. Demand inevitably results in
supply so businesspeople and processors rushed to hunt for "chia
voi" to the extent that these fish now struggle to survive.

Not long ago the press, especially foreign newspapers, praised a
Vietnamese scientist and businessman for breeding seahorses, so now
demand for seahorses is extremely high. According  to a seahorse
trader whom we met on a recent trip to Nha Trang, about 20 million
seahorses are consumed worldwide every year. They are not "common"
fish. There is no fisherman specializing in catching them. We were
on a boat and its owner, a fisherman, told us sincerely: "Nowadays,
seahorses are becoming more scarce, they rarely run into our net.
It turns out they are becoming very valuable. When catching a
seahorse with its eggs, fishermen used to throw it back into the
sea." But now, hardly anyone will do that since the fish fetches an
excellent price on the market. The market, in turn, influences the
existence of seahorses and gradually, they are becoming extinct.
For that reason, the above-mentioned businessman and scientist in
Nha Trang has begun raising seahorses.

As another businessman told us: "Breeding seahorses is really a
profit-making business." Big profits can be gained artificially,
independent of nature and the seas. But if everyone could realize
this and everyone began raising these fish, what would
happen?

Vietnam: Where to Go for Weekends? Hanoi needs more entertainment venues

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

By Song Xanh

Along with economic growth, many visual changes have occurred in
Hanoi and other large cities. New houses and buildings have been
constructed and streets have been widened. Hanoians have adapted
themselves to the market economy but now find that they have
nowhere to go for entertainment on holidays or Sundays.

Parks in the past and in the present

Previously, one of the popular hobbies of Hanoians and visitors was
strolling in the park, especially on Sundays, holidays or during
festive occasions. Children and even adults used to amuse
themselves on seesaws, tumbling-boxes, slides and merry-go-rounds
in Thong Nhat Park, which was renamed Lenin Park. They could also
go to the Botanical Gardens or the Zoo to watch elephants chewing
sugar cane or hear the roar of tigers or lions. Now the
deterioration of the parks and the Zoo has resulted in a decreasing
number of visitors. In Lenin Park, some new game equipment has
replaced the old and the games are no longer free: visitors must
now pay to sit on the slow and obsolete planes going up and down,
in the crashing cars or in the train going around in circles. How
about the Zoo? "The animals look so thin, sick and sluggish.
Perhaps a lot have died because I saw many empty cages," a Zoo
visitor said. The green trees, calm lakes and pure air in the parks
are all strollers can enjoy after long hard working hours.

The Hanoi Park Bureau is in charge of flower gardens, street trees
and 47 parks in the city, including 50-hectare Lenin Park and
10-hectare Bach Thao Park which serve over one million residents.
"We cannot meet the entertainment demands of the people because the
Government pays hardly any attention to the problem," Do Duy Vuong,
vice-director of Hanoi Park Bureau said.

Cinemas turn to dance halls

Nearly half of the ten cinemas managed by Hanoi Film and Tape
Company have been converted into dance halls or restaurants. New
names such as Hollywood Club, Centropell, Metal and Com Vietnam Inn
have replaced Me Linh, Dai Dong, Kinh Do and Dang Dung cinemas. "It
is true that people do not want to go to the movies any more. So
cinemas will be converted into 'cultural centers,' including dance
halls, karaoke and video rooms," Nguyen Thi Lien, vice-director of
Hanoi Film and Tape Company declared. Only a few cinemas are still
operational. Thang Tam, the largest cinema in Hanoi consisting of
1,000 chairs, and Dan Chu Cinema can organize projections just
twice a day. "We sell only between 10 and 50 tickets for every
showing at Thang Tam. The reason is that movie-goers' taste has
changed but projection equipment hasn't," Lien added.

The pioneers in modern techniques are private cinemas, including
Fansland, a familiar venue for the youth in Hanoi, which was opened
only a few years ago. Fansland always offers viewers good films
with high quality at reasonable prices. Following Fansland's
success, Hanoi Film and Tape Company opened New Age, an
air-conditioned 100-seat cinema adjacent to Thang Tam Cinema. New
Age often attracts many viewers on the weekends.

At present a Disneyland for Hanoi may be a far-fetched dream.
However, projects to upgrade cinemas, set up new game equipment in
Lenin Park and construct cultural and sport centers and underwater
palaces are being considered. Hopefully, these projects will be
carried out in the near future so that on weekends or holidays
Hanoians or visitors won't scratch their heads asking each other,
"Where should we go?"

Prices at some entertainment venues in Hanoi

Cinemas:
Thang Tam: VND12,000/ticket
New Age: VND20,000/ticket
Fansland: VND12,000/ticket
Dan Chu: VND6,000 or 8,000/ticket

Dance halls:
Queen Bee (9 Lang Ha St.): US$5/ticket
Royal (Hang Tre St.): US$5/ticket
Hanoi Hotel (Giang Vo St.): US$6/ticket (women free)
VIP (Nguyen Du): US$4.5/ticket

Vietnam: Equity Definition

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

"...First, the general opinion about  "equity" in health care does
not mean "equalization," "being equal," or "equality". Equity means
that those who have more demands are to be given more care, those
who suffer more losses receive more attention; whereas, being equal
or equality means that everybody with more or less the same demands
is to be treated equally. In the first stage of the transitional
period, there cannot be absolute equality but steps must be taken
to realize social equity. Equity also implies that more priority
and consideration must be given to certain classes of people in the
society.

Second, equity must include personal needs for health care when one
suffers diseases or has health problems and the ability to pay.
Although both rich and poor have needs for health care, their
payment ability is quite different. Therefore, equity must
guarantee that everyone's demand for medical examination and
treatment is met. Referring to market economy or services or
purchasing power also means mentioning the ability to pay. At
present, part of the population is unable to pay but still has the
needs, so the public health sector and the Government must take
responsibility to satisfy the mini-mum need of the people for
health care. The general view on equity in diagnosing and curing
diseases mainly has to do with the needs, not the ability to pay.

Third, the poor and those who have made good contributions to the
country  often find it hard to pay. Since they have contributed and
sacrificed a lot on behalf of the nation, the society must
compensate for their losses--that's a return for gratitude, not
charity. For this reason, the Government and the public health
sector must give more consideration to these people to maintain
social equity.

Fourth, the view on equity in health care shows that the normal
citizens, the poor, and those who are good contributors to the
country are completely entitled to medical care, not that they beg
for merciful treatment, pity, compassion or favor. As the Law on
Health Care for the Population says, everybody is entitled to
medical care. The Government and the public health sector must
therefore socialize the activities concerning health care and
protection for the citizens. The conditions required for winning
social equity are that the Government must seriously consider
investment in the public health sector and must be able to
calculate prices of the public health services to give good
services without making a profit. The ability of people to pay for
public health services in the market economy depends upon the
purchasing power of each person and the prices. The Government must
not only know the cost and be able to calculate the prices for
services but must also offer certain kinds of medicine to patients
free of charge. The Government must incur some financial losses in
order to help the common people. Equity must be accompanied by
medical morals, requiring a high sense of responsibility of the
doctors toward their patients and the same treatment for both rich
and poor patients."

Vietnam: Reaching higher

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

A survey of 1,149 students of Hanoi Medical University, aged 17-24
(629 males and 520 females) shows that the height of students still
continues to increase after puberty in both sexes: males reach top
height at the age of 24 (164.29cm), and females at 21 (155.56cm).
There is a distinct increase compared with Vietnamese young people
of 10 years ago, and particularly 20 years ago; today's males'
heights have increased by 4.95cm while females' are taller by
5.46cm. However, surveys conducted in some localities also show
that pupils in municipalities and cities have better health than
those in the countryside, in particular, the number of pupils
feeling exhausted after a day at school makes up a high proportion
(1/3-1/4). In an urban district of HCMC, up to 25% of pupils have
bad health due to malnutrition.

Vietnamese Income Survey

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

By Tran Hung

Vietnam has maintained a high economic growth rate. However, what
is the average per-capita income in Vietnam at present and how does
the country's high economic growth affect workers' incomes?
In the first half of this year, the average monthly income per
capita of State sector workers was VND472,800 and gross domestic
product averaged US$516 per capita, according to statistics from
the Information Center under the Ministry of Planning and
Investment. Nevertheless, there was still a gap in earnings between
the central and local levels - VND616,000 and VND366,800
respectively.

The areas in which State workers were highest paid - over
VND800,000 per month - include electricity-water supply with
VND827,200, and post-communications and finance-banking with
VND814,100.

In the first six months of this year, the income discrepancy
between the central and local levels was broad in the three above
areas: VND900,000 compared with VND542,700 in the electricity-water
supply sector; VND900,000 with VND439,000 in the
post-communications sector, and VND820,000 with VND610,200 in
finance-banking.

Such industries as oil and coal followed with incomes averaging
VND799,300 per capita per month, in which the centrally governed
area attained VND850,000 and the locally governed, VND454,500. This
is paradoxical although oil and coal are Vietnam's key exports.

However, the income of workers at the central level was lower than
that at the local level in two of the 18 areas surveyed, namely
fisheries, VND301,000 compared with VND420,400, and
hotel-restaurant services, VND520,000 with VND616,600. Meanwhile,
the areas in which the monthly per-capita income was equal at both
levels included science (VND362,000) and health (VND350,000).

Alongside the scientific and health sectors, those working in
culture and sports also received a low monthly income, on average
VND347,000. The salary of those who work in the educational sector
were even lower in the 18 surveyed areas in the country, averaging
VND316,000 per capita, in which the income at the central level was
VND399,000 and that at the local level VND310,500.

The above figures are just references as are all statistics
released by the General Department of Statistics and the Ministry
of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs. At present, people
prefer working in such areas as trading, services, restaurants and
hotels.

The incomes of workers in the foreign-invested and private sectors
have not yet been surveyed; therefore, an overview of personal
income throughout the country has not been done. According to the
World Bank and United Nations Development Program, the annual
income in Vietnam is now US$700 per capita; particularly, Ba
Ria-Vung Tau Province has attained an average income of US$1,100,
Ho Chi Minh City US$1,000 and Hanoi US$800.

Vietnam: Gourds Reach Foreign Markets

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Environmentally-friendly luffas, which are often used for cleaning
saucepans by Vietnamese housewives, are now popular on the world
market for their newly-discovered uses.

By Pham Hong Van

It is surprising that Vietnamese luffas have appeared on the
counters of big supermarkets in Western Europe. In addition, they
are used as ornaments in restaurants, as bathing sponges instead of
brushes in hotels, and for physical therapy in hospitals.

The luffa products are produced in An Giang Province by two joint
ventures: An Giang Agro-Product and Foodstuff Import-Export Company
(AFIEX Co.) and International Foodstuff Company (IFC).

At present, farmers in An Giang are financed by AFIEX Co. to grow
gourds for fiber. The seeds are from the Philippines, and can be
harvested after three months with 15,000-20,000 gourds per hectare.
The gourd fruit can reach 0.8-1 meter long each but cultivation is
not simple: Farmers must be experienced in growing local gourds;
frames for the plant to climb must be well built; insecticides must
be applied during the flowering period and gourd plants should be
fertilized at least three times a month.

According to the Filipino agricultural experts who are guiding
farmers in An Giang, this kind of gourd is suited to the soil here.
If well-cultivated, it can be harvested three times a year with the
number of fruits beyond prediction. Over-three-kilo gourds are
soaked in water before their flesh is extracted. Then the luffas
must be dried in the shade (they can be broken if dried in
sunlight) for four days. After that they are brought to factories
to be whitened before processing into various products: ornaments
(luffas are cut into small pieces for artisans to assemble) or
bathing sponges in round, triangle or oval shapes or belt-shaped
for back rubbing or for dish-washing. Finished products are
exported to Western Europe at US$0.8-1.3/item, or higher according
to orders and are most popular with overseas Vietnamese, especially
in the U.S., Canada and Australia.

To date, more and more foreigners tend to use luffas because of the
current trend of using natural products to avoid skin allergies.

Big hotels in Ho Chi Minh City such as New World, Rex and Majestic
are using luffa products to replace brushes. Some Asian markets are
also interested in these products.

Currently, Tri Ton, Chau Phu, Cho Moi and Phu Chau districts of An
Giang Province are cultivating the Philippine gourd supplied by
AFIEX Co. Farmers are provided with seeds and fertilizers; when
harvested, a category one dry luffa with a minimum length of 0.8m
sells for VND3,000; category two at VND2,000 and category three at
VND1,000. Growers can earn VND15 million per hectare on average.

What has been done in An Giang so far is just a trial step. If all
goes well, gourds will be grown in many other provinces and the
value will increase.

Luffa, once used to wash pots and pans or dishes, is now diversely
used and is valuable on the world market. Doing business in the
time of market economy is full of interesting opportunities.

Vietnam: Stone Handicrafts on Show Abroad

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Tourists to the famous Ngu Hanh Mount, Quang Nam-Da Nang Province,
all like to buy Non Nuoc stone handicrafts as souvenirs.

By NGUYEN DINH LAC - HCMC

It was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that a
village specializing in stone devices such as stone pestles,
mortars, and chopping blocks was formed at the foot of Ngu Hanh
Mount. The first copies of Cham statues carved of Non Nuoc stone
were made to meet some French orders. But to the year 1975, the
activities here had not developed with only some small villages
producing simple handicrafts such as stone ashtrays, mortars,
bracelets, and lion statues. However, since 1985, the shift of
local fishermen to this career has brought new beauty and style to
stone products. And since 1990, Non Nuoc handicrafts have found a
position on American, French, Canadian, and Hong Kong markets.
Graduating from an art course in the army in 1988, Nguyen Long Buu
is among the rare trained artists of the young generation in the
stone handicraft-making village. On his return after his military
service, he created many products just for fun until 1993 when his
piece Nguong Vong was bought for a high price by an Australian.

Since that turning point, Buu has shifted to making statues for
home and garden decoration and many of his products have been sold
to foreigners. In the last two years, Buu has been invited to build
monuments in Gia Lai, and Buon Ma Thuot. He is now preparing for an
exhibition in Singapore sponsored by the Happy Wear International
Co.Ltd (Taiwan). This is the first time Non Nuoc stone handicrafts
will appear in an international statue exhibition with 20 carvings
by Nguyen Long Buu; the shortest height is 0.30 meters, and the
highest 1.20 meters.

The long-nurtured dream of Buu now is to make a bust of Uncle Ho in
Pac Bo.

Vietnam: Dong or U.S. dollar?

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

I work for a foreign-invested company in Vung Tau. According to
Vietnamese labor regulations, the wage of an employee must be
specified in the labor contract. Should this wage be expressed in
U.S. dollars or Vietnamese dong? Does the law of Vietnam have any
articles dealing with this issue?

Le Duc Thuan - Vung Tau

According to Article 5 in Decree 197-CP dated December 31, 1994 of
the Government and Circular 11-LDTBXH/TT dated May 3, 1995, the
employer may choose the mode of payment to suit the labor
conditions and production activities of the enterprise, but this
choice must be expressed in the collective labor agreement and
labor contract. Wages paid to Vietnamese employees must be in
Vietnamese dong at the U.S. dollar exchange rate fixed by the State
Bank at the moment of payment.

Vietnam: Compensation for Labor Accidents

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The last sanction  for labor violations says, "Any employer who
fails to meet labor safety measures will be fined VND10 million."
In some cases, however, the violation can cause death for workers.
So is 10 million enough to warn any boss who knows this violation
quite well but ignores it and indirectly causes a casualty?

Truong Quang Hung - Qui Nhon

According to Article 11 in Government Decree 06/CP dated January
20, 1995, the employer must compensate the payment of at least 30
months' wages for employees who lose over 81% of their working
ability or for relatives of those who die of accidents. If
accidents are caused by employees' errors, they are also supported
by the employer with the payment of at least 12 months.

Vietnam: Largest shipbuilding JV licensed

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The first and largest foreign-invested shipbuilding project in
Vietnam received a license from the MPI last week.

The Hyundai-Vinashin Co.Ltd. is a 30/70 JV between Vietnam
Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (Vinashin) and four companies
affiliated with Hyundai Corp. (South Korea) with a duration of 50
years. The first phase of the project, capitalized at US$95.4
million, involves building a shipbuilding factory in Ninh Phuoc
Commune, Ninh Hoa District, 55 km from Nha Trang City, which will
repair 100 ships of up to 120,000 tons and build five new ships of
up to 80,000 tons/year. In the second phase, US$300 million will be
invested in developing the Hyundai-Vietnam Industrial Complex to
produce steel, oil and gas exploitation facilities and diesel
engines.

Vinashin is seeking partners to repair and upgrade its shipyards in
order to increase the total capacity of the national fleet to 1.5
million tons by the year 2000. Established in January this year, it
is one of the largest companies of Vietnam's maritime industry with
22 affiliated units. Between now and 2010, the company will try to
modernize technology and build new ships of 10,000 tons, container
vessels and military ships and develop three shipbuilding centers
in Vietnam.

There are 60 ship repair and building factories in Vietnam but only
two can build ships of up to 15,000 tons, two others can build
ships of up to 3,000 tons and the remaining can repair and build
ships of under 1,000 tons.

According to the development plan for the shipping fleet to 2010,
Vietnam needs over US$500 million to increase the DWT of its
shipping fleet to one million tons by 2000, and US$3 billion to
reach the targets of 3.5 million tons by 2005 and six million tons
by 2010.

Vietnam: Privileges offered to workers in equitized SOEs

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Workers in equitized enterprises can hold stakes equivalent to 25%
of the enterprise's assets, according to a circular on financial
issues, sales of shares and interests of workers in equitized State
enterprises.

Circular 50TC/TCDN issued by the Finance Ministry states that the
equitized State-owned enterprise (SOE) is allowed to offer 10% of
its asset value in shares to workers depending on seniority and
individual performance. The value of the shares for each worker
must not exceed six months' salaries. These shares are ordinary and
State-owned and the worker can enjoy dividends until the end of
his/her life.

The circular also states that the equitized enterprise can sell 15%
of the value of its assets in shares to workers on credit, but the
total value of these shares must not exceed the value of shares
bought in cash by the workers at the enterprise. Workers can enjoy
dividends of the shares bought on credit on a yearly basis, but
each year they must repay at least 20% of the value and 4% of the
interest on these shares. If they fail to pay the loans in two
consecutive years, they must return the shares to the State. Also,
they cannot inherit, sell or mortgage the shares if they have not
paid in full the amount owed.

In all, workers at equitized enterprises can hold shares equivalent
to 25% of the value of the assets of the enterprise. However, only
those who are on the payroll and work for over three years by the
time of equitization and will continue working thereafter can enjoy
these privileges.

The equitized enterprise can only sell shares after competent
authorities have appraised its assets and determined the value of
the assets allowed to be sold or the funds to be mobilized. Also,
it must announce at least three times on the mass media the total
value of assets, the amount of shares to be sold, those allowed to
buy shares, time of issue and profit margin of the three previous
years.

Recently, Minister and Director of the Central Steering Committee
for Equitization Phan Van Tiem signed Decision 01/CPH on the
procedure to turn SOEs into joint stock companies. Accordingly,
there are four steps for SOEs to proceed in turning into joint
stock companies: Preparation for equitization, drafting the
equitization plan, approval and development of the plan, and
inauguration of the joint stock company and business registration.

Equitized SOEs are divided into two categories: Those with capital
of over VND3 billion and those with capital under VND3 billion. The
equitization board of the SOE must publicly announce the financial
standing of the enterprise before proceeding with equitization and
the sales of shares as well as the organization of registration for
share buyers.

In the two years of 1996 and 1997, the Government expects to
equitize 150 State enterprises, of which each ministry, province or
city will have 2-4 enterprises to be equitized, and to sell shares
of State enterprises to foreign buyers on a pilot basis.

Vietnam: The Path of AIDS

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

In December 1990, the intelligentsia in Ho Chi Minh City was
stirred by the first detection of an HIV-positive case in Vietnam.
A Vietnamese girl residing in the city tested positive with the HIV
in her blood when she took a health examination to go abroad with
her fiance.

By Thuc Doan - HCMC

More than five years have passed. People have forgotten the story
but the girl has to work and live day and night haunted by the
virus that causes AIDS.

In 1990 and 1991, only one HIV-infected case was found. The next
year, 1992, twelve cases were detected, but in 1993 the number of
patients soared to 1,000 nationwide. Over the past three years, the
HIV virus has taken the lives of 329 Vietnamese.

A source from the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee indicated that,
as of Sept. 7,1995, the number of virus-infected cases reached
4,316 including 80 foreigners and 4,239 locals. Of them, 508 people
have been diagnosed as AIDS patients.

Meanwhile, to August 30, results from the program on epidemic
control showed that the southern cities and provinces account for
3,516 HIV-infected cases, with 1,741 cases detected in HCM City.

According to Mr. Dang Van Khoat, chief of the Information Center of
the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee, AIDS in Vietnam is
developing more slowly than in other Asian nations. "AIDS has not
yet knocked at every door as seen in some parts of the world,"
Khoat said.

Officials from the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee said that
although the number of HIV-infected cases in the country is not
high compared with other countries in the Asian region, the virus
has became dangerous to Vietnamese people. The available figures do
not reveal exactly the number of HIV-infected people in the
country, according to an AIDS expert. "They are just statistics
from the annual result of the program on epidemic control and test
results from blood-donors," he said.

Dr. Le Hoang Son of the HCMC AIDS Prevention Committee said that
the number of HIV-infected people in HCMC could reach an alarming
20,000 case-mark if comprehensive tests are available to the city's
population. "The infection rate of HIV-virus varies by social
class," Son said. To date, in Southern cities and provinces, 18
pregnant women, four children and 116 normal citizens who do not
belong to the high-risk groups are HIV patients.

At first, the increase of HIV-infected cases was mainly among drug
addicts. However, in recent years, the number of people infected
with the virus due to sexuality has doubled annually. According to
statistics from the HCMC AIDS Prevention Committee, the ratio of
HIV-infected cases of prostitutes was 0.47% in 1993, 0.62% in 1994,
1.07% in 1995 and up to 1.17% in the first six months of 1996. As
of August 30, there were 242 HIV-infected prostitutes in southern
provinces, 6.72% of the total cases.

Experts from the AIDS Prevention Committee said that Vietnam is now
where Thailand was seven years ago. The country is facing on AIDS
threat as the number of AIDS-related deaths grows significantly
although the Government has spent large sums on AIDS prevention
programs implemented since 1990. In HCMC, the local budget earmarks
over VND 3 billion for AIDS prevention operations every year.

HIV-Infected patients' lives

The world's most famous HIV patient, basketball superstar Magic
Johnson, made a comeback after announcing in 1991 that he was
retiring from basketball because he was infected with HIV.
Meanwhile, he isn't waiting for a cure, he's too busy living. In
most cases, Vietnamese HIV patients are not so fortunate as
Johnson. They often live all day long haunted by the HIV without
love from their families. Some patients show resentment against the
virus which "sows" its "dead seedling." Their fights against this
deadly disease are courageous as they understand that Vietnam
cannot afford to import expensive drugs to help AIDS patients live
longer. Overcoming the fear, HIV patients have gathered together to
establish a "friends help friends" group. The group belongs to the
HCMC Health Center and operates with the purpose "building good
relationships among HIV-infected patients who need sympathies from
others."

The "Friends Help Friends" group has 70 volunteers to care for AIDS
patients under treatment at Binh Trieu Hospital. Phung, a member of
the group said, "I help these patients because I need love and
sympathy from society. I wish my remaining days to be
meaningful."

At present, many clubs of HIV-infected patients have been
established in the country as well. AIDS patients come together
because they don't want to be overwhelmed by loneliness.

INTERLINE BAGGAGE TRANSFER ENTERS PAS 103 EQUATION

Bags from other airlines may have been transferred to Pan Am flight
103 at Heathrow, Interpol sources have told CT, thus complicating the

investigation which has previously focussed on baggage originating in
Frankfurt on Pan Am's own system. Interline transfer of "a few bags"
could vastly expand the number of potential entry points for the bomb
since it is now considered possible that the bomb was never in Frankfurt.

Interpol officials expressed surprise at a West German news report
claiming the Irish Republican Army put the bomb aboard the aircraft
as a cooperative operation with a Middle Eastern group. Interpol said
"educated speculation" now indicates a cooperative operation between
Middle Eastern groups, either a Palestinian splinter group out of
Lebanon or Iranian factions.

Further tests of the residues are being made to confirm initial belief
that it was Czech-made Semtex plastic explosive which made up the
bomb. Several national police services are running similar materials
past their detector devices and sniffer dogs to see how they do in
detecting it. FBI bomb and explosives experts are continuing to
examine information to get as complete a picture of the bomb as possible.

STRANGE WARRANT ISSUED IN CITY OF POROS ATTACK

Greece has issued an arrest warrant for a man apparently killed in the
11 July attack on the tourist cruise vessel City of Poros near Piraeus.
The district attorney issuing the warrant gave no explanation for
naming Mohammed Adnan Zozad, 21, as a fugitive despite an earlier
police report saying the Lebanese national had been killed in an
explosion aboard the vessel and part of his leg had been found. Either
the government now believes the police report to be mistaken or the
warrant may serve some legal purpose despite Zozad's death.

Absent from the warrant is any mention of Laurent Vigneron, 23,
whom eight witnesses identified as one of the attackers. He was
reported to be firing a submachine gun at passengers, but when Greece
named him as a terrorist, the French government protested that he
was merely on vacation. Others involved have been named by Greece
and they include ringleader Mohammed Khadar, AKA Hejab Jaballa, a
Libyan passport holder who has been linked to Abu Nidal. He is
believed to have been killed when a car bomb he was delivering
apparently exploded prematurely near a marina shortly before the
cruise ship was to dock.

Greece believes the goal of the attack was to force release of Abdel
Osama Zomar, jailed in Athens awaiting extradition to Italy for his
role in a Rome synagogue attack that killed a child in October 1982.
Zomar was deported by Greece, but not to Italy. He was sent to a
country of his choice last month: Libya.

FAA ISSUES AIRPORT ACCESS REGULATIONS

On 4 January the US Dept of Transportation finally issued its long-
awaited airport access control rule, requiring airports by 8 February
to begin compliance. About 270 airports are required under the rule to
install computerized security systems or equivalents, with larger
airports having 24 months to comply and smaller facilities up to 42
months. A seminar will be held in Washington, DC, in mid-February to
discuss the rule and its application.

AOCI has sharply protested the rule, especially on grounds of its cost.
Deborah Lunn, acting executive director of the Airport Operators
Council Intl, said FAA has drastically underestimated the cost to
airports of installing the systems required. Lunn pointed to an
unobligated $6 Billion aviation trust fund and the FAA's failure to
provide any source of funding for the security improvements,
contrasting these with an industry-estimated pricetag three times
the estimate of FAA. This "will require airports to turn to the local
taxpayer or to divert grant funds that had been planned for other
projects," she said. FAA estimates the requirement will cost about
$119.1 million over a ten-year period and Lunn said it's possible that
price could apply to one or two major airports. The AOCI estimates
range from a low of $161.9 million to $800.5 million.

Industry had proposed a pilot program to determine the most
effective way of addressing the access control problem, but FAA
rejected this approach. In fact, FAA rejected virtually every
suggested change to the rule as it was proposed by the federal agency,
except for minor modifications to deadlines. FAA rejection of the
comments made by industry was explained away by "numerous
commenters ... made incorrect assumptions about the scope of the rule."

AOCI is considering a lawsuit over the rule, insisting that FAA is
blowing a smokescreen when it says the rule is being misconstrued.
The industry group feels its interpretation is accurate and cited four
major concerns in the final rule:

* FAA said to define the term 'secured areas' in the rule would
compromise airport security programs. AOCI says this leaves the
term legally undefined.
* FAA used the word 'immediately' to describe when requiring the
speed at which a dismissed employee's access must be denied. AOCI
says that is not acceptable, although FAA counters that it is meant
merely to convey the sense of urgency involved.
* AOCI says general aviation and other tenants are subject to the
airport's rules and enforcement, not the FAA's, and this leaves a huge
gray area of how to comply with the published access control rule.
* FAA refuses to specify the types of doors to be fitted with
enhanced controls. "To do so," said the agency, "would compromise the
airport security program. FAA does not envision that every door ...
will need the enhanced access controls." AOCI notes this leaves the
airport in a catch 22 situation.

It is unlikely FAA will budge in light of the hearings where 60
aviation organizations testified and had little effect on the agency's
proposed rule. AOCI may well take the matter to court for judicial
relief. Congressional intervention is unlikely because of the
implications any politician would sense in "weakening" security.

PRO-FILE: ETHNIC KURDS SPAN FIVE NATIONS

Strewn over the territory of five nations are the ethnic Kurds, who
have struggled to achieve an independent state for years. They have a
history of armed conflict with various rulers and live in mountainous
portions of eastern Turkey, northeastern Syria, northern Iraq,
northwestern Iran and even parts of south-central Russia. The most
recent upsurge in violence occurred with the 1979 Islamic revolution
in Iran. That event sent many Kurds from northwestern Iran to camps
in Iraq and Turkey.

Kurds were prime suspects in the assassination of Swedish prime
minister Olof Palme, and they have been active in western Europe as
assassins of political enemies.  Various Kurdish groups have bombed
embassies and government offices. It is puzzling, in light of this, that
the just-released Defense Intelligence Agency booklet on terror
groups makes no mention of the Kurds.

August 15, 1984, marked the beginning of a wave of violence by one of
the most militant of Kurdish organizations, the PKK, and the campaign
continues to this day  On that 1984 night, the PKK (Kurdish Workers
Party) launched a coordinated series of attacks on Turkish police
stations in the eastern part of the country. Since then, guerrilla
warfare on a limited scale has existed between Kurds and Turkish
security forces. Ironically, it was Turkey that was originally the
most helpful nation to the Kurds when they became refugees from Iran
and Iraq.

PKK is the largest and most militant of Kurdish organizations. It is an

amorphous group with 2000 to 3000 militant members led by
Abdullah Ocalan. The Partisan Group, headed by Hussein Yildirim, has
about 1000 to 1500 militant members. There are two smaller
movements, each with several hundred followers. The groups function
as political parties in exile, counting thousands of general members.
However, only a limited number of those are military activists who
could be called terrorists or guerrillas. Previously unknown Kurdish
Liberation Army was first heard from in December 1988 when it
assassinated a political activist in Hakkari.

By far the most active and militant group is the PKK. It is an
enigmatic organization with vague socialist-separatist roots, headed
by a council which often changes location around the Turkish-Iraqi
border area. Its organization. Well-established and run somewhat like
the PLO, the PKK has numerous foreign branches, committees and
services. In recent years PKK cells have become well established in
western Europe, particularly in large emigre communities in cities
like Amsterdam, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Zurich. Although it raises
money and conducts gunrunning and retaliatory operations far afield,
PKK keeps its organizational center-of-gravity in the tri-state area
of Turkey-Iran-Iraq that it considers its homeland.

PKK operations in Turkey have been the centerpiece of its activities
since 1984 and represent a clear shift away from Iran and Iraq. The
PKK activity has far surpassed that of the Armenian group, ASALA, in
frequency if not in dramatic impact. One of the most frequent of PKK
operations is the 10-to-20-man ambush against security patrols by
Turkish forces. Weapons are usually Kalashnikovs and grenades
acquired via the Iran-Iraq war. Tactics are primitive, e g, ambush,
sniping, selective assassination of local officials, and only on home
ground of Kurdistan, which is devoid of high-tech infrastructure.
Recently this trend has changed with the suspicion that PKK
sabotaged a Lufthansa Airlines Boeing 737 cargo flight in the spring
of 1988. PKK may also have been behind some advanced explosives
used in several cities in central Turkey in the summer of 1988.

PKK is more terrorist than guerrilla outside the Kurdistan area and
has numerous cells operating throughout western Europe. Its most
recent high-profile event was the kidnap of Mehmet Reyhan, son of a
wealthy newspaperman, in Zurich on 27 December. Swiss police freed
Reyhan a week later, preventing a $5 million ransom payment.
Nonetheless, assassination of political opponents or those refusing to
pay extortion appears an active pursuit, as do gun running and drug
smuggling operations.

Turkey has had a difficult time dealing with the Kurds, who are
concentrated in an inaccessible, high-tension region governed for
years under a state of emergency. Using a carrot-and-stick approach
with the local population, authorities have set up a militia with
generous salary, weapons and rewards. Rewards are $250 for
arresting and $1000 for killing a Kurdish guerrilla. High fees are paid
to scouts. On the other hand, certain groups are outlawed, e g, PKK
TPLP-C and communist parties, and heavy penalties are in effect for
aiding the guerrillas. Repression in some areas is heavy and justice
can be wholly arbitrary.

With Iraq gassing Kurdish villages and Iran reportedly assisting the
PKK, Partisan and TPLP-C movements, the situation is grave. TPLP-C
has an "Urgent Action Group" which bombed the South Korean embassy
in Ankara and the Ministry of Justice office in Istanbul. New police
powers, communications, thermal imaging and sensory equipment are
being employed, as are new sniper rifles and increased military
training for recruits. A new 5000-man military unit has been formed
and specially trained for counter-guerrilla operations.

Controlling the situation is difficult, considering the number of
actors involved. The leader of the Partisans has accused PKK leader
Ocalan of being a CIA agent. Some observers predict an increase in
Kurdish terrorist activity in western Europe. It is believed that
Turkey will be able to contain the domestic problem in the near future
because the trend since 1986 has been toward fewer operations in the
eastern part of the country.

*** Red Army Faction (W Germany).was shopping around southern
Europe for armor-piercing grenades last summer. Italy's Red Brigades
reportedly could not deliver the type RAF wanted, so RAF went to
Spanish contacts and again did not succeed. The effort came to light
through intercepted documents. Speculation is that RAF may have
wanted the grenade for the 22 September assassination attempt
against Hans Tietmeyer, West Germany's State Secretary. He escaped
an attempt with submachine guns and a shotgun.

*** US Defense Dept released a 130-page report on Terrorist Group

*** US Defense Dept released a 130-page report on Terrorist Group
Profiles, apparently compiled by the Defense Intelligence Agency. DOD
said it cost $71,000 for 45,000 copies and "countless hours" of
labor.to complete. It's too bad that with all the Pentagon's resources
they couldn't have done a better job. The report has no index, no list of

initials or acronyms (but it does have introductions by Vice-President
George Bush and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci). It also makes no
significant reference to the Kurds, Anti-Imperialist International
Brigades, One Tirol, Catalan terrorist groups or many others. If one
already knew the full anglicized name of GRAPO, one could find it, but
not otherwise, as is the case with AIIB and other groups. Statements
in the book do not agree with statements made by other US agencies.
While many security intelligence professionals bristle when the
question of freedom fighter versus terrorist arises, there is the
comment by President-elect Bush: "The difference between terrorists
and freedom fighters is sometimes clouded." In short, the book seems
more like a public relations effort than a serious reference work. The
public can look at pictures of wreckage and say Wow!

HOAXES CLOUD U.S. EXTREMISM PICTURE

Two recent incidents of faked death threats call attention to the fact
that perhaps as much as 15% of US alleged "threats" or "incidents" are
merely pranks or hoaxes perpetrated by alleged victims. In two recent
cases, perpetrators of hoaxes stood to gain both enoblement in
acquiring victimhood with attendant celebrity status, and also to
perpetuate the myth that they are an embattled and terrorized
minority. It also becomes much more difficult to criticize the
fanaticism and excesses of any interest group when there have been
acts of violence against it, as hoaxers are often well aware.

An anti-racist legal secretary in White Plains, NY, who voiced support
for a controversial Yonkers, NY, desegration plan was arrested for
having painted the death threats on her own apartment door that she
later insisted were painted by right-wing terrorists. Laurie A Recht
also reported false telephone threats to her home. She had been touted
as an example of moderation and was even awarded an honorary
degree by the College of New Rochelle. Both phenomena angered local
white citizens but the FBI suspected the threats were a hoax.
Surveillance cameras and a telephone tap showed she had painted her
own door and there were no phone threats.

A college student at Northwest Missouri State University was
suspended after admitting he fabricated stories about an assault and
allegedly racially motivated death threats. Quentin L Banks, 18,
admitted the hoax after the Missouri Highway Patrol began to
investigate. The student said he was so "distraught" over "racism"
that he devised a plan "to test university policy." In the wake of the
Banks case, other "racist" incidents reported at NMSU, including
supposed KKK activity, are being re-examined following evidence they
may have been fabricated or greatly exaggerated.

STATUS REPORT: U.S. LEFT-WING GROUPS

Note: Listing here does not imply that these groups are necessarily

"terrorist," but merely that they are "radical" or "extremist" and that
they have been the subject of law enforcement interest in the past..

Communist Party, USA, 239 W 23d St, NY, NY 10011. Noew has about
19,000 members, up from 6000 in the early 1960s when the party
was at its ebb. Membership is concentrated in large industrial areas,
including the New York City area, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia,
San Francisco and Seattle. The official party group for members under
18 is the Young Communist League, formerly the Young Workers
Liberation League and before that the W E B Dubois Clubs. The party
publishes the Peoples Daily World newspaper, Political Affairs, and
numerous pamphlets. The official party publishing house is
International Publishers. The CPUSA is primarily the propaganda arm
of the Soviet Union in the USA. Members are rarely involved in
violence and have avoided espionage since the 1950s. The party has
been heavily infiltrated by the FBI in the past and currently remains
under moderate surveillance.

Socialist Workers Party, 14 Charles St, NY, NY 10013. Small, heavily
minority in membership makeup, formerly Trotskyite, Marxist party
with local groups in about 20 states. Membership is between 2000
and 3000. SWP youth group is the Young Socialist Alliance, PO Box
471, NY, NY 10003, with about 25 local groups, including on major
college campuses. Membership is estimated at 450. The SWP publishes
The Militant, which gained notoriety in 1963 with a photo of Lee
Harvey Oswald clutching the newspaper in one hand and a rifle in the
other. The official SWP publishing house is Pathfinder Press. The YSA
publishes the monthly Young Socialist. The SWP andYSA have generally
avoided violence, although some YSA members have been arrested as
individuals in the past. The SWP recently won a large settlement
against the FBI for illegal surveillance and burglaries at SWP offices
around the country during the 1960s and 1970s.

*** African National Congress (Southern Africa). Announced it will
close its bases in Angola as a gesture of support for the agreement
signed last month involving Cuabn and South African troops. It has
been estimated that ANC has seven bases in norhtern and western
Angola with 2000 ANC members training.
*** Brunswijk Jungle Commando (Suriname). Ronnie Brunswijk says
he will re-arm his troops after losing faith in the peace process of
the government.
*** Egypt's Revolution (Egypt). Dr. Gamal Shawky Abdel Nasser
returned to face trial for attacks on US and Israeli diplomats. He and
20 co-defendants are charged with trying to sabotage the Camp David
accords. He is a nephew of the late Egyptian president  Gamal Abdel
Nasser, whose son, Khaled Nasser, is also among the accused but
remains a fuigitive in Yugoslavia.
*** Fatah Revolutionary Council (Abu Nidal)(Middle East).The New
York Times named a Palestinian figure, Samir Kadar, as a suspect in
the Pan Am 103 bombing. He has risen through the ranks of Abu Nidal's

organization, said the newspaper, and is now commander of a cell in Europe.
*** Fedayeen (Middle East). Four members of the left-wing terrorist
group are on trial for damaging offices of IranAir in London. British
police said the four attacked the airline's computers on 14 December.
*** GRAPO (Spain) is apparently in another resurgence since two
members were arrested in France early in January carrying plans for
attacks on Spanish commercial targets. The documents used code
names for as-yet-unknown GRAPO colleagues.
*** Guardians of the Islamic Revolution (Iran). Claimed credit for
downing Pan Am 103 as revenge for the US Navy downing an Iranian Airbus.
*** Iparretarrak (Spain). Basque separatist group had eight members
arrested in France.
*** Jewish Defense League (USA). Won a court decision to keep its
name out of a trail involving former members accused of fatally
bombing a business competitor. A Los Angeles judge said the trial of
Rochelle Manning and an accomplice cannot hear that Manning and her
husband, Robert, were once JDL members. Robert Manning is now a
fugitive living on the West Bank with other Rabbi Meir Kahane followers.
*** Kurds (Middle East). Turkey says terror attacks by the Kurds
dropped 26% in 1988 as a result of energetic security measures. Ten
missile launchers were captured, along with large amounts of other
arms and equipment. In 1988, 119 Kurds were killed, compared with
41 security personnel and 97 civilians.
*** Montoneros (Argentina). Intelligence sources dismiss reports that
the group is planning to resume large scale operations. An official of
the national intelligence agency did acknowledge, however, that two
men who committed a bank robbery are linked to the Montoneros.
*** Ohio Seven (USA). Trial on sedition charges finally has begun of
the group in Springfield, MA. Various legal developments have reduced
the defendants to three: Patricia Gros Levasseur, 40, her husband,
Raymond Luc Levasseur, 42, and Richard C Williams, 41.
*** One Tirol (Italy). Threatened new attacks against politicians,
journalists, judges and police in continuation of its campaign for
unification with Austria. One Tirol has caused great damage with
bombing of power pylons and railroad installations in South Tirol.
Police take the new threat very seriously.
*** Palestine National Salvation Front (Middle East). Has been
promised $2 million in aid by Libya, according to a Lebanese
newspaper. The aim is to create a rival PLO leadership to challenge
Yassir Arafat.
*** Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso)(Peru). Is now reported to control
more than 20 villages in two provinces, an unusual strategy for a
terror group.
*** United National Front in Occupied Palestine (Middle East). Newly
formed coalition issued a call for a militant organization to replace
Yassir Arafat as leader of the Palestinian struggle. Coalition consists
of Islamic extremists, pro-Syrian radicals, Ahmed Jibril's PFLP-GC
and Abu Moussa's splinter faction of the Fatah Revolutionary Council.

journalist. He was later freed by police.
Navarre/23 December: In one of several attacks claimed by ETA, a
grenade was fired at a Civil Guard post from nearby woods. When a

set off six explosions, seriously wounding one guardsman. In another
attack, a bar owner was assassinated as an informer.
Ankara/22 December: Portugese diplomat Sergio Manuel Pinto Mutinho
was killed near Incel by several attackers with knives. Turkish police
said the second secretary had been stabbed 18 times.

18-stick gelignite bomb was placed by unknown persons for unknown
reasons, police said.
Cairo/20 December: Police killed three members of an Egyptian
fundamentalist group during a raid on an apartment. One of the dead
was wanted for killing a police officer during an early December
shootout. The incident sparked riots among fundamentalists in Egypt
but the government said such acts would be met with force.
Nice/19 December: An explosion killed one resident and injured 12
others at a hotel used by immigrant workers on the French Riviera.
Most residents are Tunisians and a nearby note claimed responsibility
for "The Masada Group." The note was marked with a Star of David.
West Berlin/16 December: Police arrested seven people and charged
them with membership in an unspecified terrorist group after
explosives were found stacked in the basement of a house.

7 disqualified from contesting top posts / Umno

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

Umno cracks down on abuses 

SEVEN candidates, six of them vying for Umno Supreme Council posts, were
disqualified from contesting the elections starting tomorrow for abuse of
power and flouting party rules.

And more are likely to be disqualified, with investigations currently under
way against some candidates for serious breaches of discipline.

At a press conference yesterday evening, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said a case
under investigation involved a contestant for the post of Umno Youth chief who
had asked delegates to swear by the Quran to support him.

Said Datuk Seri Anwar: "We have not got concrete evidence as yet but using the
Quran for this purpose to me is a serious offence."

He identified the six who were disqualified from contesting the Supreme
Council election as Datuk Aini Taib, Selangor state executive councillor;
Datuk Shariff Omar, deputy chief minister of Penang; Datuk Malik Hanapiah,
Perak state executive councillor and former political secretary of Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad; Datuk Salomon Selamat, Member of
Parliament and former political secretary of Datuk Anwar; Mr Latiff Mirasa,
Penang state executive councillor and Datuk Adam Hamid, Johor state executive
councillor.

All were among 61 people contesting for the 25 posts available on the Supreme
Council, the highest decision-making body in the party.

The seventh person disqualified from the elections was Mr Ayob Mat Aris, who
was vying for a position on the Umno Youth executive council.

Datuk Anwar said that the decision to disqualify these members were taken at a
special committee meeting chaired yesterday afternoon by Dr Mahathir. He said
that solid evidence had been obtained by the party, enabling it to take this
action.

The evidence related to money politics, abuse of power and violation of the
no-campaigning rule which was introduced by the party leadership to curb
excessive politicking.

He said that this action should put to rest fears that some people were
receiving favours, noting that Datuk Malik was the former political secretary
of the party chief while Datuk Salomon was his former political secretary.

The disqualification of the seven follows the disciplinary action taken by
Umno against five members of the Jempol division in Negeri Sembilan for being
involved in money politics.

Datuk Seri Anwar said that investigations into money politics and other
illegal practices would continue even after the elections.

Umno has been waging an ongoing battle against money politics which has been
rampant in the party in recent years.

On Sunday, party chief Dr Mahathir noted that money politics seemed to have
become a norm in Umno and the time had come to rid the party of all forms of
corruption and filth.

He said that if the party leadership did not take stern measures to remedy the
situation, it could endanger not only the party but the whole race and nation.

"We have repeatedly talked about money politics and convened a special
assembly in 1994 but the problem still could not be overcome. Instead, it
seems like it has become an institution."

SEVEN NAMED

* Datuk Aini Taib, Selangor state executive councillor * Datuk Shariff Omar,
deputy chief minister of Penang * Datuk Malik Hanapiah, Perak state executive
councillor and former political secretary of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad * Datuk Salomon Selamat, Member of Parliament and former
political secretary of Datuk Anwar * Mr Latiff Mirasa, Penang state executive
councillor * Datuk Adam Hamid, Johor state executive councillor. * Mr Ayob Mat
Aris

Sipadan, Ligitan row to go to World Court: Leaders to explore further
bridge proposal

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

MALAYSIA and Indonesia have decided to refer their claims on the Sipadan and
Ligitan Islands to the International Court of Justice.

This ends a stalemate over the islands, lying off the border between Sabah and
East Kalimantan. The two countries have been trying to resolve the issue since
1991.

The decision was made after a meeting between Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk
Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad and President Suharto of Indonesian here yesterday.

During the 90-minute meeting, a wide range of issues, from economic
cooperation to the agenda for the World Trade Organisation meeting in
Singapore, were discussed.

Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesian Foreign minister, briefed the press on the
discussion. He said that after exhausting legal and technical arguments on the
islands issue, it was decided that the talks should be elevated to the
political stage.

Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and Indonesia's
State Secretary Moerdiono held four rounds of talks and both concluded that
they had strong cases. In view of this deadlock, Mr Alatas said both Dr
Mahathir and President Suharto concluded that the question of Sipadan and
Ligitan islands should be referred to the ICJ.

He told a packed press conference: "We are doing so because both sides are of
the view that the matter should not drag on too long" -as the issue might be
exploited by those not wishing Malaysia and Indonesia to have close relations.

The decision of the ICJ, he said, would be accepted by both countries. The
next step would involve Mr Alatas and his Malaysian counterpart Datuk Abdullah
Badawi working out the procedures to forward the case together.

He stressed that both countries would forward the case together. "We must move
in unison. We believe in doing so, we would resolve the issue amicably and in
a just way."

The Indonesian minister said that this case showed that whenever there was a
dispute between Asean countries, it could be settled peacefully and in the
spirit of Asean.

Indonesia's agreement to agree to refer the claim is a change from its
previous position. Last month, Armed Forces chief Feisal Tanjung was quoted by
Antara national news agency as saying that any move to refer the issue to the
international court would mean involving a third party.

He said that it was not good to let other countries which do not understand
the problem meddle in it. But Indonesia never shut the door on this method of
resolution.

Activists land on Diaoyu islands: Page 14

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lee San Chouy, Taiwan Correspondent

Protesters plant Taiwan and Chinese flags

TAIPEI -Taiwan and Hongkong protesters yesterday broke through a Japanese
maritime cordon to land on the disputed Daioyu islands, where they planted
Taiwanese and Chinese flags to challenge Tokyo's claim to the islands.

Taipei provincial assemblyman Ching Jie-shou and Hongkong legislator Tsang Kin
Shing were among the seven protesters who swam ashore to plant three
blue-and-red Taiwanese flags and one red five-star Chinese flag early
yesterday morning, said a United Evening News report filed from one of the 50
boats, which set off on the third and largest protest voyage on Sunday.

The flags were swiftly removed by Japanese Maritime Safety Agency officials.

Having accomplished its mission, the flotilla returned to the northern
Taiwanese port of Shen Ao, where a heroes' welcome greeted the protesters.

In Hongkong, the people were equally jubilant on hearing news of the
successful landing.

In Tokyo, Japanese officials gave a veiled warning that future protest boats
could be seized if found in Japanese waters.

Mr Ching said in an interview with state radio: "We will continue our efforts
to protect the Diaoyu islands ... We will not quit until we succeed."

According to the United Evening News report, at least 50 Japanese boats and
helicopters were mobilised to stop the protest boats from entering the
12-nautical-mile territorial zone claimed by Japan.

No one was hurt yesterday, although some people had to scramble onto other
protest vessels after their boat was rammed by a Japanese patrol boat amid the
tense stand-off.

Unconfirmed reports said that at least one protester fell overboard and was
then rescued.

The more than 300 activists had set sail in 30 boats from Taiwan's Wanli and
Shen Ao ports on Sunday evening for the Diaoyu islands. Twenty boats carrying
journalists accompanied them.

At 5.35 am yesterday, they arrived within the 12-nautical-mile limit where
Japanese patrol boats began to surround the flotilla.

But the Japanese boats were unable to stop the small boats whose crews had
been practising landings for a week.

Mr Ching was later quoted as saying that some activists had set off on rubber
boats and water scooters to divert the attention of the Japanese boats while
the seven swam ashore.

At 6.20 am, three activists including Mr Ching and Mr Tsang planted a Chinese
flag and a Taiwanese flag near the lighthouse erected by a Japanese right-wing
group in July.

Ten minutes later, they were driven off the island by Japanese maritime
police, who tore the flags down.

Another group of four activists, however, managed to make a landing at 6.35
am. The four, who stayed for a few minutes on the island, planted two
Taiwanese flags.

One of them, Mr Lee Chueh-min, was later quoted as saying: "We were
surrounded. The sea was covered with Japanese ships and the sky was full of
helicopters, but I had only one goal in mind -to land and to place the
Taiwanese flag.

"This is probably the most important moment of my life."

Taipei yesterday praised the landing, but reiterated its position that the
Diaoyu dispute should be resolved only through diplomacy and negotiations.

Government spokesman Su Chi said: "We always admire and recognise acts of
patriotism to protect our land. We also feel very good that ... they are
returning after a rational, peaceful protest."

However, he added: "The sovereignty and territorial disputes should all be
resolved through negotiations."

Taiwan and Japan have conducted two rounds of "unofficial" talks over the
dispute, including the issue of fishing rights near the island group, but
failed to reach an agreement.

The Diaoyu chain, known in Japan as the Senkaku islands, lie about 150 km off
north-eastern Taiwan and are believed to be potentially rich in oil and
natural gas.

Anti-Japanese sentiment in China, Taiwan and Hongkong has been rising since
July.

Two protest voyages took place last month.

The leader of the second trip, Hongkong activist David Chan, drowned after
jumping into the sea near the islands.

Taipei forum to look into cross-strait relations

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Sunny Goh

It will chart path based on public consensus

TAIWAN will hold an inaugural national conference in late December to chart
its position on troubled ties with China "based on public consensus", a
spokesman for the President's Office told The Straits Times yesterday.

The grand forum, which will take in views ranging from opposition parties to
business guilds, will also "brainstorm" changes to the island's Constitution
and the speeding up of its economic development.

Findings and suggestions from the meeting will be compiled into a report to be
submitted to President Lee Teng-hui to help him "set the direction for the
island's future", the spokesman said.

"It is the first ever meeting of its kind, and participation is expected to be
massive in terms of representation and vigorous in debate," he said by
telephone.

The "National Development Conference" will bring together 150 representatives
-50 each for discussions on the constitutional system, economic development
and cross-strait relations -who will be invited from all sectors of society.
These three have been the most problematic issues affecting Taiwan in recent
years, with corruption and triad activities on the rise and Sino-Taiwan ties
at a low ebb.

President Lee appointed Vice-President Lien Chan as the convenor of a
preparatory committee last month to work out the conference details, and
invited each of the three major political parties to assign a deputy convenor.

Mr Tsiang Yien-si, Kuomintang Central Standing Committee member and senior
adviser to the President, is expected to be the KMT's deputy convenor. The
deputy convenors for the Democratic Progressive Party and the New Party have
not yet been made known.

Asked whether the Taipei authorities would abide by the conference
recommendations, the spokesman said that the government would have to take the
suggestions very seriously, otherwise it would defeat the purpose of such a
meeting.

President Lee himself is expected to evaluate the more sensitive proposals as
part of his election pledge in the presidential election in March this year to
seek public consensus on major policy and reform programmes.

But the two opposition parties had already poured cold water on the idea,
although neither had turned down an invitation to take part. "This is just
smoke. It is like giving a candy to cheat a child," said DPP legislative whip
Yen Chin-fu.

Opposition New Party lawmaker Yok Yu-ming, also pessimistic, said the meeting
would not solve any problems.

While the conference is set for end-December, the actual dates and venue have
not been fixed. But the official Free China Journal said the meeting would
last five days, probably from Dec 23, with the Taipei International Convention
Centre and the Chungshan Building on Yangming Mountain as the two most likely
venues.

2 Taiwan officials nabbed for crime

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

TWO Taiwan councillors were detained by police in the continuing crackdown
against organised crime, the China Times reported yesterday.

Chiayi city councillor Wu Jung-an and Changhua county councillor Hsieh
Hung-lung, whose cases are not linked, are being remanded in the eastern
Taiwan prison on Green Island.

Wu, first arrested for alleged drug trafficking in August, was caught
attacking a debtor on Sept 24 together with more than 10 gangsters who were
carrying illegal arms, the Chinese-language daily said.

During investigations, unidentified witnesses told police of Wu's involvement
in several blackmail cases. Two people accused him of threatening them with a
gun and coercing them to buy second-hand cars from him at exorbitant prices.

A third person said Wu had forced him to hand over NT$200,000 (S$10,360) to
buy drugs.

As for Hsieh, he was arrested last Friday for firing a shot at a man earlier
this year.

According to China Times, he admitted shooting the man, who helped him run a
lounge, because of a financial dispute.

Communist Party to endorse Jiang"s authority at plenum

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

THE Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is expected to endorse President Jiang
Zemin's "leadership and authority" at the party's plenum this week, it was
reported yesterday.

Quoting a well-informed source in Beijing, the independent Chinese-language
Ming Pao Daily News said the CCP would give its endorsement at the end of the
annual meeting.

Elaborating on his achievements, the report said that since Mr Jiang, 70,
became party general secretary in 1989, he had been placing equal emphasis on
"material civilisation" and "spiritual civilisation".

Spiritual civilisation -the promotion of communal morality in a society which
has attained economic progress -has been promoted strongly in China's official
media in recent months.

Mr Jiang has also stressed the need to "talk politics" and to place emphasis
on the "righteous spirit" and on learning.

A resolution on spiritual civilisation to be passed at the plenum would make
these theories the official line and the overall will of the party, added the
report.

In his speech to the plenum, which starts today, Mr Jiang is expected to call
for "the enhancement of the power of the party" in leading China into the 21st
century.

His vision for the party's Politburo and Central Committee is for them to "use
political superiority to control the overall situation and central authority
to coordinate the national pace and unify the party's will".

The Ming Pao report also quoted analysts as saying that Mr Jiang's call to
safeguard the party's political authority had been well received within its
ranks and in the military.

They said that the Beijing leader's determination to make political authority
the overall guiding principle showed China would continue to use "a gradually
progressive and moderate approach" towards an in-depth development of the
country's reforms.

By Mary Kwang, China Correspondent

BEIJING -A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday reiterated that the
Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea were an inalienable part of Chinese
territory.

He also said that the Chinese stance on the issue was consistent and clear.

He made these remarks in response to queries from the media on China's
reaction to the early-morning landing yesterday by Hongkong and Taiwanese
protesters on the disputed islands.

The spokesman also said that incidents initiated by the Japanese side had
provoked and angered the Chinese people.

While he did not say what these incidents were, his remarks were apparently
targeted at the construction of a lighthouse on one of the islands in July by
Japanese right-wingers.

The Japanese Coastguard had even allowed the right-wingers to return to the
islands to repair the structure after it was damaged in a typhoon, but they
had turned away boats from Hongkong and Taiwan approaching the islands.

Hongkongers jubilant at news of protest landing: Activists land on Diaoyu
islands

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Wang Hui Ling, Hongkong Correspondent

Event grabs morning and evening headlines

HONGKONGERS greeted with jubilation the landing on the disputed Diaoyu islands
by protesters from Hongkong and Taiwan early yesterday.

News of the successful mission hit the headlines in the morning and was played
up in graphic detail by evening newspapers here.

At least one Cantonese news station devoted a few hours to the news, airing
interviews with analysts and reporters covering the event.

Some radio listeners who called a phone-in programme also referred to the
event, even though the programme dealt with a completely different topic.

A television station devoted 27 minutes of its half-hour evening news bulletin
in Cantonese to coverage of the voyage, with extensive footage of the landing,
the planting of the Chinese flag, the encounters with the Japanese authorities
as well as the return of the protesters to Taiwan's Shen Ao port.

Politicians from two of Hongkong's biggest political parties -the Democratic
Party and the Liberal Party -also welcomed the news, although they were quick
to add that now that the protesters had fulfilled their mission to plant flags
on the disputed islands, the ball was now in Beijing's court to pursue the
matter.

Democratic Party vice-chairman Yeung Sam said: "All we are trying to do is
make a symbolic protest against Japanese occupation of the islands.

"Actually, there is not much the people in the community can do because it is
all related to the foreign policy of the Chinese government.

"If the Chinese government refuses to take tough action against the Japanese
government, it will be very difficult for China to reclaim its sovereignty
over the islands."

Liberal Party vice-chairman Ronald Arculli said that he hoped the move would
give the Chinese government an understanding of the strength of feelings over
the issue and inspire it to open diplomatic channels to settle the dispute.

The New Evening Post and the Sing Tao Evening News splashed the landing on
their front pages.

Calling it a successful breach of Japanese defences, they also accused the
Japanese of crashing into some protesters' boats. One headline screamed:
"Shameless Japanese security forces remove Chinese flags but claim they were
blown away" in an apparent reference to eyewitnesses' claims that Japanese
coast guards had removed the Chinese flags placed by the protesters.

Analysts interviewed on radio said that the successful voyage was a testimony
to the better preparations and strategies adopted by the latest group of
protesters.

Democratic Party legislator Tsang Kin Shing, who was one of those who reached
one of the disputed islands, told reporters that he would not be organising
another trip to the islands to dismantle a lighthouse erected by Japanese
right-wingers. He was reported to have said that such a task should be left to
the Chinese government.

Amid the jubilation, an English-language radio station yesterday ran an
interview with a Caucasian photographer who had accompanied an earlier
ill-fated voyage to the Diaoyu islands, in which protester David Chan drowned.

He said that the attempt to make Chan out as a hero and martyr was
regrettable, as his action was foolish and had endangered lives. It was also
partly the result of frenzy whipped up by the media, he added.

Landing by HK, Taiwan activists regrettable : Japan: Activists land on
Diaoyu islands

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kwan Weng Kin, Japan Correspondent

Trespassing vessels could be seized, it warns

TOKYO -Japanese officials yesterday expressed regret at the early-morning
landing by Hongkong and Taiwan activists on the disputed Diaoyu islands and
hinted that vessels carrying protesters could be seized in future if they were
found trespassing in Japan's territorial seas.

Commenting on the landing, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto stressed the need
for the authorities on all sides to take a level-headed approach.

"Whether this affair will blow up any further will depend on whether the
authorities on both sides will be able to create calm," he told reporters.

Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Teijiro Furukawa, standing in as the
government's chief spokesman, described as "extremely regrettable" the landing
on the Diaoyu group -known as Senkaku islands to the Japanese -and echoed the
Premier's call for calm.

"Relations with neighbouring countries and territories must not deteriorate
because of such incidents. We hope all parties concerned will deal with it
calmly," he said.

Although vessels carrying activists from Hongkong and Taiwan succeeded in
eluding patrol boats belonging to the Maritime Safety Agency -Japan's coast
guard -and got close to the islands yesterday, the agency made no attempt to
seize the trespassers.

"But in future, if they do not comply with our warning to withdraw, we will
take appropriate measures," said Mr Furukawa, raising the possibility that the
agency would in future apprehend the protest boats.

In October 1990, the Japanese authorities succeeded in repelling a fishing
boat carrying Taiwanese athletes that attempted to plant an Olympic torch on
the Diaoyu islands.

Yesterday afternoon, Foreign Ministry Vice-Minister Sadayuki Hayashi announced
that Japan would ask the authorities in Beijing, Hongkong and Taipei formally
to prevent a repeat of yesterday's incident.

"The problem must not affect our relations with neighbouring countries. I
believe China and Taiwan feel the same way," he said.

Japanese officials also expressed the hope that the matter would subside now
that the activists had achieved their objective of reaching the islands and
demonstrating the respective claims of the Chinese and Taiwanese.

On Sept 26, Hongkong protest leader David Chan drowned in a mishap off the
disputed islands after a vessel carrying him and other activists were
prevented from landing by Japanese patrol boats.

Yesterday's landing was displayed prominently on the front pages of the
evening editions of the major Japanese papers although the media here has by
and large given minimal coverage to the territorial dispute with China and
Taiwan.

For example, there have been no stories in the press to explain the historical
basis for Japan's claim to the islands, reflecting in part the fact that most
Japanese have shown little interest in the dispute.

But despite the relatively low-key treatment accorded the issue here, Mr
Hashimoto expressed unhappiness with the Japanese media recently, saying it
was against Japan's national interests for the press to highlight the issue.

Proposed sales-tax hike Japan"s main issue for coming polls

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kwan Weng Kin, Japan Correspondent

TOKYO -The government's proposed hike in the sales tax from next April emerged
clearly yesterday as the main issue dividing Japan's two largest political
parties in the upcoming general election, campaigning for which begins
officially today.

The tax-policy gap between the Liberal Democratic Party led by Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto and the opposition New Frontier Party headed by Mr Ichiro
Ozawa was highlighted in a nationally-televised debate for leaders of Japan's
six largest parties.

Seeking to continue as Premier after the polls, Mr Hashimoto reiterated his
determination to raise the sales tax from the existing three per cent to five
per cent next year to pay for the burgeoning costs of welfare and other public
services.

But he stressed that the hike would be linked to the implementation of
administrative and economic reforms and that pensioners and other low-income
earners likely to be penalised by the higher tax would receive special
consideration.

Criticising Mr Hashimoto's coalition government for failing to push hard
enough for reforms so far, Mr Ozawa opposed an increase in the sales tax and
pledged to reduce taxes by 18 trillion yen (S$228 billion) and to make up for
the loss in revenue by slashing government expenditure and expanding consumer
spending.

The Japan Communist Party was the only other party among the six yesterday
which included the Democratic Party of Japan, the Social Democratic Party and
the Sakigake -that supported a freeze in the sales tax. Apart from this
glaring difference over tax policy between the LDP and NFP, all six parties
were unanimous in their calls for comprehensive reforms to the country's
administrative and economic systems.

LDP's Mr Hashimoto appealed to voters to give his party a mandate to bring
about a "robust economy" through deregulation and reforms and reminded
everyone that he had plans to set up a panel of advisers to work out an action
programme within a year.

Mr Ozawa, saying he would retire from politics if his party should come to
power and fail to carry out its election promises, warned voters they had a
choice between "prosperity through drastic reforms" or "decay by taking no
action".

Yesterday's party leaders' debate laid down the battle lines for the election
campaigning which kicks off today.

But politicians will undoubtedly have difficulty getting their messages across
to their electorate as a survey by the quasi-national NHK network released
yesterday found that only 50 per cent of Japanese voters were interested in
the upcoming polls.

This was 17 percentage points lower than in the July 1993 elections, which
ushered in Japan's first coalition government in decades.

Nevertheless, a record number of over 1,400 candidates are expected to vie for
500 Lower House seats in the Oct 20 election which will be conducted under a
new system of single-seat wards and proportional representation.

Many candidates belonging to the major parties are exploiting a provision in
the election law that allows candidates to stand in both single-seat wards and
proportional representation constituencies, thus increasing their chances of
winning a parliamentary seat.

Indonesia urged to ban distribution and sale of alcohol

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Paul Jacob, Indonesia Correspondent

Religious objections, dangers of drink cited

JAKARTA -Muslim grassroots leaders and youth representatives have called on
the local government here and provincial administrations elsewhere to move
towards imposing a comprehensive ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol
in the country.

About 3,000 representatives, citing religious objections and the dangers that
alcohol and its easy availability posed to Indonesian youths in particular,
made the call in a statement issued after gathering for a sermon on Sunday at
the Matraman Mosque in East Jakarta.

The representatives recognised efforts to tighten the supervision, control and
sale of alcohol through local government regulations but said that the
authorities should go a step further and impose an outright ban.

Their statement said that distributors and consumers were already faced with
the full weight "of sanctions from Allah".

As such, government moves to impose stringent controls and greater supervision
on alcohol -such as by increasing the cost of distribution licence fees and
higher penalties for violating rules -had to be revised.

The authorities should instead "prevent and prohibit every effort to legalise
alcoholic beverages" and should develop policies and action programmes which
would "increase faith and piety" and ensure there could be abstinence from
"that which is known to be forbidden".

The Republika daily yesterday quoted leaders like Haji Nurudin, secretary of
the Madura Ulemas Board, as saying yesterday that "alcohol, or wine and
liquor, according to the Prophet Muhammed, is the source of all evil".

The call on Sunday followed moves by local governments in Jakarta, West
Sumatra and East Java to institute new rules which they believed would help
keep alcohol distribution and consumption under control while not eliminating
it altogether.

Higher annual licence fees -up to 10 million rupiah (S$6,000) from the current
one million rupiah -have been proposed for approval by the Home Affairs
Ministry. These would ultimately increase the cost of alcohol sold at outlets
and thereby prevent youths from being able to afford to drink.

Labels must also be affixed on bottles warning that liquor is harmful and the
minimum content of bottles must be 200 cc -again to ensure that the higher
cost would make alcoholic beverages unaffordable to youths.

The grassroots leaders and youth representatives who met on Sunday were not
alone in their quest to ban the sale and distribution of alcohol.

Representatives of the Muslim-based United Development Party have said
previously that steps being proposed by the local government meant that liquor
could still be sold.

The West Sumatra chapter of the Majelis Ulama Indonesia, the country's highest
council on Islamic affairs, made a similar call for controlling regulations to
be revised so that alcohol would be banned, while Muslim leaders in East Java
also urged a review, citing alcohol's incompatibility with religious
teachings.

There has yet to be any formal central-government reaction although leaders
such as Information Minister Harmoko, who also chairs the ruling Golkar party,
said previously that the party wanted firmer measures in place, including the
imposition of strict maximum limits on the alcohol content of beverages sold
to the public.

Another underlying argument used by opponents of alcohol has been the link
which many see between alcohol consumption and criminal activity, and
alcohol's effects on youths.

Beer brewers here produce a total of 150 million litres annually with total
sales amounting to 500 billion rupiah.

According to the Republika daily, annual domestic production of alcoholic
beverages totals eight million cartons while imports amount to five million
cartons annually.

Two main blocs emerging as Thai parties get set for polls

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Sinfah Tunsarawuth in Bangkok

THAI political parties have virtually re-aligned themselves into two blocs in
the run-up to next month's general election with the Democrat and New
Aspiration parties forming the core of each camp.

The Democrats received a boost over the weekend when prominent banker and
former finance minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda -believed to be groomed by
party leader Chuan Leekpai to succeed him -announced he would contest the
polls on a Democrat ticket.

Mr Tarrin's decision to make his electoral debut in Bangkok is likely to
enhance the prospects of the Democrats winning most of the 37 seats in the
capital.

The Democrats last week forged an understanding with four parties -Chart
Pattana, Palang Dharma, Seritham and Solidarity -to form the next coalition
government if the party won the most seats in the House of Representatives on
Nov 17.

The five parties also agreed to be "friendly" and to avoid attacking each
other during the election campaign.

But their agreement did not preclude any party from joining the other bloc
-led by the New Aspiration Party (NAP) of General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh -if it
should win the election and form the core of the next government.

The NAP has not yet received any open support from other parties, but it is
likely that three parties -Social Action, Prachakorn Thai and Muanchon -will
align themselves with the former army chief. The four parties are currently
partners in the caretaker government of Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa,
whose Chart Thai party was weakened last week when a group led by its
secretary-general, Sanoh Thienthong, defected to the NAP.

Mr Banharn had said he did not expect to become Prime Minister after next
month's polls, but would remain as the leader of Chart Thai.

He has not yet indicated which of the two parties -Democrats and the NAP -his
party will support.

Gen Chavalit was the prime mover in forcing Mr Banharn to announce his
resignation last month in the face of a no-confidence motion in parliament.

Mr Banharn did not honour his pledge and leave office, but instead dissolved
the House and called for fresh elections on Nov 17.

With Mr Tarrin's decision to contest the election, the Democrats will be able
to present a strong economic team which should appeal to the educated
middle-class, an important electoral group in the capital.

Mr Tarrin told a radio interview yesterday that apart from him, former deputy
premier and banker Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi, former minister in charge of
energy affairs Dr Savit Bhotiwihok and Democrat party spokesman Abhisit
Vejjajiva would be in the economic team if the Democrats won the right to form
the next government.

A former top banker before entering politics, Mr Tarrin earned high marks as
finance minister in the Chuan government when he took up the Cabinet post as a
non-MP at the invitation of Mr Chuan.

Jakarta detains 24 Taiwanese and Thai fishing boats

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Paul Jacob, Indonesia Correspondent

JAKARTA -Increased patrols by naval ships and military maritime aircraft have
resulted in the detention of 24 Thai and Taiwanese fishing boats which entered
territorial waters in the eastern part of Indonesia last week, the Media
Indonesia newspaper reported yesterday.

The latest intrusions come in the wake of the seizure of 50 fishing boats from
China in the latter half of last month after they entered Indonesian waters
illegally and were found to have had false documents permitting them to fish
in the area.

Indonesian navy chief Vice-Admiral Arief Kushariadi disclosed the latest
round-up of 24 vessels, but without giving a breakdown. He is due to visit the
naval base in Tual, Maluku, where the vessels and 300 Thai and Taiwanese
fishermen are detained.

He said the increased number of fishing boats detained in recent months was
the result of heightened round-the-clock monitoring of east Indonesian waters
by naval patrols and air-force maritime aircraft.

The Indonesian military disclosed last month that ships from its
Surabaya-based Eastern Fleet and other bases would intensify patrols in the
country's resource-rich eastern waters -as well as in the waters around the
Natuna islands where a multi-million-dollar natural gas project was getting
under way.

Vice-Admiral Arief said the Chinese, Taiwanese and Thai vessels detained had
entered Indonesian waters illegally and were fishing in the area using fake
permits.

Permits must be obtained from local authorities and the fact that false
documents had been issued indicated possible collusion between local
businessmen and local authorities, he said.

The question of prosecutions of those detained so far would be left to the
regional office of the Attorney-General, he added. It was no longer a matter
for the navy as the case now also involved the question of how the vessels had
been able to secure fishing permits.

Late last month, the navy reported detaining seven Chinese boats which were
flying the Indonesian flag in waters off the coast of southeastern Maluku -the
first time such a ploy had been detected.

NSTB executive director and surgeon wife die as car hits tree: "Champion of
R&D, and a good friend", "Surgeon well-loved byfriends and patients" and
"Retired teacher pleasant and respected"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Dorothy Ho

Car crash in Perth 

NATIONAL Science and Technology Board executive director Vijay Mehta and his
wife, Dr Amar Kaur, were among three people who died in a car crash near Perth
on Saturday.

They were in a car which was being driven by retired teacher Jaganathan
Govindsamy, 62, when it went out of control and hit a tree, Perth police
confirmed yesterday.

Mr Mehta, 45, his wife, 41, and Mr Jaganathan's wife, Suppamal, a 60-year-old
retired teacher, died on the spot.

Mr Jaganathan was admitted to hospital, and was discharged yesterday.

The Mehtas, who had no children, were in Australia because Dr Amar, the head
of Toa Payoh Hospital's ear, nose and throat department, had been attending a
medical conference in Cairns, Queensland, from Sept 28 to Oct 3.

After the conference, they went to Perth to visit the Jaganathans, who were
old family friends, and stayed with them in their home there.

The Jaganathans' daughter, Rebekah, 27, a church worker, said in a telephone
interview yesterday that her parents had taken the Mehtas out sightseeing on
Saturday when the tragedy occurred.

"They were on their way back from Margaret River when the accident happened,"
she said.

The accident occurred near Busselton, about 250 km south of Perth, according
to the Major Crash Investigation Section of the Perth police, which is
handling the case.

The Jaganathans' white Mazda 626 sedan had split into two on impact, another
family member said yesterday. The couple also have a 28-year-old son, who is
in university.

News of the three deaths shocked colleagues and friends here. NSTB chairman
Teo Ming Kian was among those who paid tribute to Mr Mehta's abilities as an
engineer at the forefront of Singapore's Research and Development efforts.

"Vijay and his wife, Amar, were personal friends. Apart from the loss to the
board, their unfortunate deaths were also a tragic and personal loss to me and
my family," Mr Teo said in a statement.

He said that he had brought Mr Mehta from the Ministry of Defence to the NSTB
in 1993 at a time when it had been experiencing frequent changes in
leadership.

"He brought stability to NSTB. He was looking forward to leading the board
into the second phase of development," Mr Teo added.

Mr Mehta graduated with first class honours in aeronautical engineering from
the University of Manchester and obtained a master's degree from Stanford
University in California.

His wife, the only woman ENT surgeon in Singapore, studied medicine here and
did her postgraduate work in Edinburgh, Scotland, and at Stanford University.

She was active in the Sikh community and was in the midst of planning a clinic
at the Central Sikh Temple.

Several doctors and staff members at Toa Payoh Hospital were in tears
yesterday when they learnt that she had died and some of were too distraught
to speak.

Meanwhile in Perth, police were waiting to interview Mr Jaganathan, who was
resting at home. He had some stitches near one ear, and suffered bruises and a
sore shoulder.

"He does not remember anything," said his daughter, Rebekah.

Car levy on S"poreans : "Reasons not good enough"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

JOHOR BARU -The Malaysian Chinese Association has urged the Johor Baru City
Council to give more valid reasons to collect a M$3 (S$1.70) levy from
Singapore cars entering the country through the Johor causeway.

The Star quoted Johor Baru MCA division secretary Wee Ka Sion as saying: "The
levy should not be imposed as a retaliatory measure against the Singapore
Government for charging Malaysian cars M$30 if they enter the republic more
than five days in a year.

"There has to be a valid reason ... such as to reduce traffic congestion."

He added the MCA division would support the council's intention to study the
imposition of the levy.

"The funds arising from the levy must also be for a good cause such as road
upgrading instead of merely filling up the council's coffers," he said.

Leaders to explore further bridge proposal: Sipadan, Ligitan row to go to
World Court

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

The Mahathir-Suharto meeting

INDONESIA and Malaysia have agreed to explore further the idea of a bridge
linking Peninsular Malaysia and North Sumatra.

Both countries, however, have made it clear that the private sector ought to
come up with capital for the project, which would enhance travel and
communications between Malaysians and Indonesians.

This proposal was among a range of economic and trade issues discussed by
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad and President Suharto at a
90-minute meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.

The Indonesian leader was on a two-day visit. He was accompanied by Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas and State Secretary Moerdiono.

At a press conference, Mr Alatas said Indonesia thought the idea of a bridge
from Peninsular Malaysia to North Sumatra was a good one.

It was consistent with planned bridges linking Sumatra with Java and other
parts of Indonesia, he said.

The bridge would also go well with Jakarta's policy of allowing tourists from
neighbouring countries to drive and use their cars in the country.

Mr Alatas said President Suharto and Dr Mahathir also discussed.

* Trade between the two countries. Dr Mahathir noted that while investments in
Indonesia had increased, there was still room for expansion.

Indonesia said that it welcomed investments and hoped that investors showed
interest in the eastern part of the the country and in labour intensive
industries.

* The increasing traffic in the Straits of Malacca. Mr Alatas said that to
alleviate the situation in the straits, Indonesia offered an alternative route
for large ships through the Lombok Straits.

* The World Trade Organisation meeting in Singapore. Both leaders agreed that
non-trade related issues such as human rights and labour matters should not be
included. Otherwise, the meeting's agenda would be overloaded.

Mr Alatas was also asked about the reported split among Asean nations on
allowing Myanmar into the grouping.

He said that there was no divergence of opinion on allowing Myanmar in. The
only difference of opinion was when the country should become a member of
Asean.

Indonesia's position was straightforward: if procedures were followed, then it
was prepared to accept Myanmar anytime.

Asked if the human rights record of Myanmar's army junta would be a factor in
determining its membership in Asean, he noted that even the United Nations did
not evaluate the internal situation in a country before allowing it to be a
member.

Action called against sect for "causing families to break up"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

JOHOR BARU -The Malaysian Chinese Association has urged the Home Affairs
Ministry to act against a religious sect for allegedly breaking up families of
its followers.

The Star yesterday quoted the party's Johor Baru division secretary, Mr Wee Ka
Siong, as saying that the group "preaches a lifestyle contrary to local family
values". He did not elaborate.

He said the group had been operating in the state for several years and its
membership was growing.

"We have received several complaints from the Chinese community against the
Taiwan-based group which has brainwashed some people.

"Initial investigations show that many teenagers and wives who joined the sect
have left their homes and cannot be traced.

"There have also been allegations of sect members being told to refrain from
sleeping with non-member spouses," he added.

The sect's leaders also compelled members to coerce their relatives to join
it.

A businessman, Mr Tan Kim Boo, 39, said his 30-year-old wife had been missing
since December last year after joining the sect in 1989. He said she had also
tried to force him to become a member.

"She left saying that she did not want anything to do with me or our
five-year-old son," he said, adding the sect had more than 100 members in Desa
Cemerlang alone.

Retired teacher pleasant and respected: "NSTB executive director and
surgeon wife die as car hits tree" andPage 22

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Julie Kee, Allison Lim and Dorothy Ho

Singaporeans killed in Perth crash

THE retired teacher who died in Saturday's accident in Perth was a pleasant
woman who was respected by her students and colleagues alike.

Mrs Suppamal Jaganathan, 60, became a teacher at her alma mater in 1956 after
she graduated from St Hilda's School in 1955.

"She's a very pleasant woman and a very nice person," said Mrs A. Abraham, 59,
an ex-colleague and friend of Mrs Jaganathan.

"It's so sad that she died."

The principal of St Hilda's Secondary School added: "We were all so shocked,
it was so sudden."

Mrs Jaganathan used to teach English and mathematics at St Hilda's Primary
School and was the school's English and library coordinator before retiring in
1989.

Her retirement came just before she emigrated to Perth with her family in
early 1990.

Mrs Abraham, who has known Mrs Jaganathan since 1969, said the retired teacher
visited Singapore regularly even after she moved to Perth.

She had moved there with her husband, Mr Jaganathan Govindsamy, 62, a retired
teacher from Upper Serangoon Technical School, and two children.

Daughter Rebekah, 27, works in a church in Perth, and her son, 28-year-old
Sri, studies aviation at the Edith Cowan University in Perth.

When contacted, Rebekah was too distraught to talk about her mother.

Mrs Jaganathan's niece, Madam Malini Krishna, 38, a teacher at Hai Sing High
School, said that her aunt was a friendly person who was hardworking and
pleasant.

"When friends heard about the accident, those who lived as far away as Sydney
called up the family to ask what had happened," said Madam Krishna.

She added that Mrs Jaganathan's family had planned to come to Singapore for a
wedding next month.

About eight members of the Jaganathan family are already in Perth, said Mrs
Abraham.

They include Mrs Jaganathan's sisters Mrs Kasturi Shanmugan, who works as a
clerk at St Hilda's Secondary School, and Mrs Amurthavalli Naidu, an
ex-principal of Telok Kurau Secondary.

Other family members, Mr and Mrs A. Nathan, also went to Perth. Mr Nathan is

Surgeon well-loved by friends and patients: "NSTB executive director and
surgeon wife die as car hits tree" andPage 22

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Julie Kee, Allison Lim and Dorothy Ho

Singaporeans killed in Perth crash

NEWS of the death of Dr Amar Kaur, Singapore's only woman ear, nose and throat
surgeon, left the staff of Toa Payoh Hospital's ENT clinic -including clerks,
nurses and other doctors -shocked and red-eyed.

She was well-loved by both her colleagues and patients, for the care and
concern she showed everyone, and the hospital had given her an award for
excellent service.

Its chief executive, Mr Liak Teng Lit, said that all the staff in the ENT
clinic cried when they received news of her death yesterday morning.

A friend, ENT consultant A. B. John of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said: "I've
never seen a patient who has not had good things to say of her."

Dr Amar, 41, graduated from the then University of Singapore in 1979 and later
went to Edinburgh for a training fellowship.

In 1991, she left to spend a year at Stanford University in California for
advanced training in otolaryngology (ENT).

She spent a year at the Singapore General Hospital after that and left in 1993
to head the ENT division at Toa Payoh Hospital.

Her colleagues, including the former head of SGH's otolaryngology department,
Dr Chew Chuan Tieh, knew her as one of the best ENT surgeons here.

He remembered her as a good team player, who worked tirelessly to help build
the hospital's ENT division.

"When she started about three years ago, there was only one other doctor
besides Dr Kaur in the division. Very often she would be called in the middle
of the night to perform emergency procedures.

"I would see her working at 1 or 2 am. She would work without complaining."

She married Mr Vijay Mehta, the executive director of the National Science and
Technology Board, about three years ago and Mr Liak described them as a loving
couple.

Mr Mehta would visit her frequently at the hospital so that they could have
their lunch together.

Dr Amar was also active in social work in the Sikh community. She was a member
of the Punjabi-Sikh Welfare Council and the head of the council's medical
sub-committee. It had been formed to open an outpatient clinic in the Central
Sikh Temple, in Serangoon Road.

Council chairman Sorinder Singh said he was to have met her yesterday.

He said: "So it came as a terrible shock to me when I got the news on Sunday
night, that she had died."

He described Dr Amar as a woman who would bend over backwards to help others
in need. She had been actively involved in the community's welfare work for
more than 10 years.

The couple's deaths were particularly painful for Dr Aw Chong Yin, senior
registrar at Toa Payoh, who had worked with Dr Amar since 1993.

They had grown close and he had become a close family friend. In fact, the two
doctors attended a medical conference in Cairns in Australia the week before
the accident.

His voice breaking, he said: "I can't believe that they are gone, especially
Amar, she was always so lively and energetic."

Champion of R&D, and a good friend: "NSTB executive director and surgeon
wife die as car hits tree" andPage 22

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Julie Kee, Allison Lim and Dorothy Ho

Singaporeans killed in Perth crash

Mr Vijay Mehta described as balanced and mature, approachable and good to
staff

PEOPLE who knew Mr Vijay Mehta remembered him yesterday as an outstanding
engineer who championed research and development, and as a good friend who
always had time for people.

Friends and colleagues were shocked by the news that the executive director of
the National Science and Technology Board had died in a three-death car crash
near Perth last Saturday.

Brigadier-General Wesley D'Aranjo, deputy secretary of technology, Ministry of
Defence (Mindef), who knew Mr Mehta for about 20 years, said: "We were very
close friends.

"He was an excellent engineer and a balanced and mature person who was always
willing to listen and consider the alternatives. He was also very approachable
and good to his staff."

Mr Mehta, 45, had worked under BG D'Aranjo in Mindef's Defence Materiel
Organisation before moving to the NSTB. BG D'Aranjo said: "Very rarely did I
see him get angry. He would get angry only on points of principle.

"The defence technology and research development communities in Singapore are
shocked and saddened by his death, and would like to convey their heartfelt
regrets to Mr Mehta's family."

In a statement, the NSTB paid tribute to Mr Mehta, who was seconded from
Mindef before his appointment as its executive director in August 1993.

It said he led the board successfully in several initiatives such as the
Research Incentive Scheme for Companies and the Technology Development Fund.

Between 1991 and 1995, the board secured $2.7 billion in R&D investments from
the private sector, set up 13 national research centres and institutes and
various schemes to encourage innovation and technology commercialisation, and
expanded its R&D manpower pool. During his term, three new research institutes
and centres were set up -the Environmental Technology Institute, Institute of
Molecular Agrobiology and the Centre for Signal Processing.

The board said he had played a key role in charting Singapore's science and
technology directions. He co-chaired the National Science and Technology Plan
Steering Committee, contributing to the formulation of the five-year $4
billion National Science and Technology Plan.

Overseas, he was instrumental in forging strong science and technology links
with Canada, Germany, Israel, India and the United States, and represented
Singapore on the Asean Committee for Science and Technology and in Apec's
senior officials' meeting for science and technology.

He also served on the boards of Singapore Technologies Electronic and
Engineering Limited, Singapore Science Park and National Biotech Committee,
and was an observer on the Economic Development Board's executive committee.
He was awarded a Public Administration Medal (Silver) in 1991.

Professor Su Guaning, director of the Defence Science Organisation and a close
friend, said: "He was a person who could rally people together and get them to
work towards a common goal. He loved life and was a good friend to many."

Mr Lim Swee Say, director of NTUC's administration and research unit, who
co-chaired the National Science and Technology Plan Steering Committee with Mr
Mehta, said: "He laid a clear vision for the future growth of R&D in Singapore
towards the year 2000. He will be fondly remembered and sadly missed by all."

Restaurants now list prices of "extras": "Check it out" and "Prices listed
after customers" grouses"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Dawn Tan

On the menu: Prices of * Peanuts * Pickles * Wet towels * Chinese tea

IF YOU go out to a Chinese restaurant for dinner tonight, be prepared for some
extra items on the menu.

The prices of peanuts, pickles, wet towels and Chinese tea are now being
printed in some restaurants here.

For years these have been accepted as unlisted items for which diners had to
pay. Sometimes these little extras came to as much as $20 for a table of 10.

The change is a result of the Restaurant Association of Singapore's proposal
for its Chinese restaurant-members to list and price these items to avoid
misunderstandings.

The association has about 100 Chinese eateries as members, half the number of
such restaurants in Singapore.

It said it sent out about 120 letters to these members about two months ago
after such items became an issue among consumers earlier this year.

It did not know how many had adopted the proposal. A Straits Times check found
that 14 restaurants have already done so.

They are Tung Lok Sharksfin's eight restaurants, Sin Leong's two restaurants,
Jumbo Serangoon and Jumbo Seafood, Victoria City and Szechuan Garden.

Another nine contacted -the Lucky Restaurants group's six restaurants, Dragon
Phoenix Restaurant and Yunnan Group's two restaurants -said they will be doing
so when they reprint their menus by the end of the year.

The prices of the items vary slightly at the different restaurants. At Dragon
Phoenix, for example, peanuts, towels and Chinese tea come to $17 for a table
of 10.

The Szechuan Garden spokesman said: "This way, it's clear-cut. There won't be
any misunderstanding between the restaurant and our diners."

Jumbo Serangoon's restaurant manager Bernard Chia said: "Customers who
complain usually go to the association. If we inform diners of the prices,
there will be no communication breakdown."

Traditionally, at Chinese restaurants, diners find out how much the extras
cost only when they get the bill. But some people, including tourists, have
complained that this was unfair.

The association's assistant director, Ms Chua Say Khiang, said: "Nowadays,
customers are more vocal and they will speak up if they are not happy.

"If the restaurants state the prices clearly, then they won't have grounds to
complain."

"As time goes by, more restaurants are likely to do so. No restaurant wants to
leave a bad impression on its diners."

But five others contacted -Teochew Garden, May Garden and Tsui Hang Village's
three restaurants -said they did not see the need for the items to be listed,
as they have never had complaints before.

A May Garden spokesman said the restaurant did not face a problem as waiters
ask the diners if they want the "extras" before serving them.

But Lucky Restaurants' group chairman Edmund Loo said: "We are in the service
industry. We cannot keep asking the customer whether he wants this or that.
It's quite rude in front of his guests.

"Stating the prices clearly is the best thing to do."

Tung Lok Sharksfin's (Scotts) restaurant manager Paul Lo said: "Diners expect
to be served appetisers, wet towels and Chinese tea. It's part and parcel of
fine dining in a Chinese restaurant."

Several diners welcomed the move. Administrator Loretta Yeo, 21, said: "Diners
have the right to know the cost of the "extras" before starting their meal
since they are paying for it."

Housewife Amy Tan, 43, noted: "I'd rather patronise a restaurant that is
upfront with me than one which gives me a nasty surprise after the meal."

Prices listed after customers" grouses: "Check it out" and "Restaurants now
list prices of "extras" "

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

SPARKING A CHANGE

A COMPLAINT to The Straits Times prompted the Restaurant Association of
Singapore to start listing the prices of towels and other extras.

A reader complained in the Forum page on May 30 that she felt cheated after
being charged $8 for two plates of Szechuan pickled vegetables at a Chinese
restaurant.

The Consumers Association of Singapore, in its reply, said that restaurants
ought to ask customers if they wanted such "extra" items.

It added that "the most upfront practice was to include the prices on the
menus so that customers will not be taken by surprise and be embarrassed".

It urged the Restaurant Association of Singapore to take the matter up and
regulate practices in the business.

The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board also said then that between August last
year and May this year, three Western tourists had complained about being
charged for items not on the menu.

In July the restaurant association discussed whether to encourage members to
list the prices of the "extras" on the menu, or to ask them to consult their
guests before serving them.

It then sent about 120 letters to its member Chinese restaurants, proposing
that they list the prices of the "extras".

Grandmother"s outstanding volunteer work rubs off on her

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

FOREIGN student Sandy Chan, 14, a Malaysian, has only been living in Singapore
with her paternal grandmother, Madam Leong Ah Say, 61, a housewife, for two
years.

But already, her grandmother's volunteer work with the elderly has had an
impact on her.

About four or five times a week over the past year, she has been helping her
grandmother deliver meals to needy old folk living nearby.

Sometimes, she would even do their housework for them.

On Sunday, she watched proudly as her grandmother received one of nine
outstanding service awards given to befrienders and befriender coordinators by
the Lions Befriender Service Association.

The awards were given to volunteers who had gone beyond the call of duty to
help the lonely elderly with various needs, such as delivery of meals and
housework.

In Madam Leong's case, she received the award for being a consistent volunteer
for the past five years.

She had not only cooked and delivered meals to several elderly people living
nearby, but she had also done their housework and looked after last rites and
funeral arrangements.

Apart from the nine outstanding service awards which were given for the first
time, the association also gave 68 other volunteers fiveand 10-year
long-service awards.

The association is the single largest group of volunteers in Singapore
providing direct service to the elderly.

Started by the Ministry of Community Development in 1982, it was taken over by
the Lions Clubs of Singapore North, Serangoon Gardens and Stamford last year.

It now has 820 volunteers befriending a total of 1,653 elderly people.

Mr Shiva Banerjee, the association's chairman, said that there were plans to
expand its programme to reach out to more of the 20,000 lonely elderly living
in Singapore.

"The people we are serving now are only the tip of the iceberg," he said.

On Sunday, in front of a crowd of more than 800 volunteers, Lions Club
members, ministry officials and grassroots leaders, Mr Sidek Saniff, Senior
Minister of State for Education and guest of honour at the occasion, praised
the award recipients.

On helping others, Mr Sidek said: "I have always remembered something which my
father told me. When you help people, forget about it. Try to think of what
you have yet to contribute, of people that you have yet to help. But if people
help you, you remember it until your last breath."

If Singaporeans had this kind of value system, then they would become caring,
he said.

Retirees to pay only $18 to keep club membership

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Ahmad Osman

SUCCESSFUL PROTEST

RETIREES in the Civil Service Club will continue to pay an annual fee of only
$18 if they do not want to use its facilities with their families.

Those who opt for free supplementary membership for their spouses and up to
three unmarried children between 12 and 21 years old have to pay more from Jan
1 next year.

The amount is $6 per month or $72 annually for those who used to work in
Divisions One, Two and Three in the public sector.

It will remain at $3 every month or $36 each year for former Division Four
officers.

There is a one-time administrative charge of only $10 for each supplementary
card for a family member under the two-tier ordinary membership scheme
starting next year.

The new option was offered to all 1,846 retirees by the club general manager,
Mr Chan Foon Chee, last Saturday.

He told them last month that they would lose their membership if they did not
join the scheme offering a package "which could not be obtained anywhere".

It was meant to boost the club's membership of 9,895 and attract more members
to use facilities in three clubhouses which were under-utilised on weekdays.

Some retirees protested that the scheme would force those who could not afford
the new fees to leave the club.

They also complained that it was unfair to make them pay more when the annual
fees would be halved to $72 for Division One officers.

The Government Pensioners' Association, Singapore, wrote two letters urging
the club to allow retirees drawing small monthly pensions to continue paying
$18 per year.

They should not be deprived of "the only affordable club available to us",
association secretary Thampoo Panjacharam said.

He noted that the cut in the fees for those in the higher divisional status
showed that the club was concerned about the need to recruit such people as
members.

These officers, he argued, would be able to pay the fees even after they
retired because of their enhanced pensions.

"Many of us who retired prior to Jan 1, 1982, are not that lucky," he wrote to
Mr Chan last week.

"It is this group of pensioners who need succour in such things as social
activities and entertainment," he said.

He said later that the option was welcomed by retirees who did not go to the
club regularly and did not need the family package.

These people, he added, should be allowed to continue paying the $18 annual
fee for themselves.

Two retirees said they would become ordinary members as the fees from next
year were cheap.

"I do not mind paying $6 every month. It is very cheap," said Mr O.Y. Chan, a
retired police superintendent.

Said Mr Wong Keng Pun, a retired senior Customs superintendent: "The
facilities offered by the club are comparable to those in other clubs. My
three children are all above 21 years, but my wife will benefit from the new
scheme."

Polly wants a letter, Polly wants a letter

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Braema Mathi

School's English project lets pupils' voices be heard

FOUR Primary 5 pupils, who wrote to the school newsletter as part of an
English project, ended up improving not just their language skills, but also
the life of a schoolmate.

Their suggestion, that a ramp be built to help a mother who carried her
disabled daughter up some steps to her class every day, was taken up by the
school.

Shuqun Primary also replaced the harsh ringing of the school bell with a
musical chime, acting on a suggestion from another pupil.

The pupils have been dropping these suggestions into a letter-box at the feet
of a cardboard cut-out of a parrot called Chatterbox.

Eight teachers compile the letters, jokes, riddles, essays and poems for a
newsletter called Chat-a-Away, which is distributed throughout the school
every term.

The newsletter is part of the school's English project called Joy-Write. It
was introduced in 1992 to help the school's 1,900 pupils improve their writing
skills.

Principal Wong Chwee Neo said the main aim of the project was to publish
children's work. The idea of having an audience, she said, was an incentive
for the children to write.

Madam Wong presented the English project at the 11th Sharing of Experiences
for primary school principals on Saturday. The session was organised by the
Primary School Professional Committee.

In an interview yesterday, Madam Wong said: "The children can express their
feelings this way and we have come to know them better.

"Chat-a-Way is now seen as being part of the school identity."

The school receives an average of 120 letters a term, or about five per class.

In them, children ask for advice on school matters such as managing their
studies and also on personal issues such as coping with parents who seem to
favour one child over another.

One child wrote to say that the school should look for a mate for the lonely
rabbit in the school's eco-garden, while another asked for help as her father
wanted to throw out five cats.

Miss Bong Mui Yoke, 33, the teacher in charge of the newsletter, said the
teachers edited the grammar but not the content of the children's
contributions. They also wrote the replies and occasionally took on the role
of an agony aunt.

Miss Bong said: "It is a lot of work but it is a great chance for pupils to
speak their minds.

"They will speak up once they know that there is an audience. Even if it is
the teachers who read it when the work doesn't get published."

Besides the newsletter, the pupils' works are published in class magazines,
the school publications and personal files.

After the final-year examinations, about 40 pupils function as an editorial
team to publish their class magazines.

All these efforts, said Madam Wong, have helped to improve the English
results.

At the Primary School Leaving Examinations, the number of A*/A grades has been
climbing, from about 30 per cent in 1993 to 46 per cent in 1995.

Woman living alone found murdered

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Jasbir Singh

A WOMAN was found dead in her Ang Mo Kio flat on Friday night in a case which
the police have classified as murder.

Madam Karamjeet Kaur, 52, was discovered by her 22-year-old daughter, student
nurse Kavita Pal Kaur, lying on the kitchen floor of her three-room flat at
around 11 pm.

She had deep cuts on her forehead and upper lip.

Madam Karamjeet had been living alone after her mother, Madam Harnam Kaur, and
Miss Kavita moved out of the Ang Mo Kio flat two months ago.

According to Madam Karamjeet's brother, Mr Dhillon J., 42, Miss Kavita visited
the flat that day because she felt that something bad had happened to her
mother after receiving a call from her mother's friend.

Said Mr Dhillon yesterday: "Normally, my sister would call her good friend,
who lives in Kembangan, to chit-chat. But that day she did not."

The friend, who wanted to be identified only as Madam J. Kaur, told The
Straits Times: "It was surprising that on Friday she did not call. Even my
maid was surprised. I tried to call her several times that day but nobody
picked up the phone.

"After trying since morning, I finally told her daughter, Kavita, at around 9
pm to check on her mother."

"I was worried that she may have had an asthma attack," added the 47-year-old
housewife.

"Karamjeet used to call frequently ever since she began to live alone over the
last two months," she said.

The two women have been close friends since childhood.

Miss Kavita's uncle, Mr Mehinder S., 44, said: "She told me that when she
arrived at the flat she found the iron gate unlocked. But the main door was
still securely fastened.

"When she entered the flat she found the whole place ransacked.

"The telephone was disconnected and she found her mother's body lying on the
kitchen floor."

Mr Mehinder is another brother of Madam Karamjeet.

Miss Kavita immediately called the ambulance. Her mother was pronounced dead
by the ambulance team around 11.30 pm.

Police are investigating.

Man posed as cop and tried to extort money

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

Column:  In The Courts

A MAN who posed as a police officer was sentenced yesterday to two years' jail
and given four strokes of the cane for attempted extortion.

District Judge F.G. Remedios heard that Mr Rejak, a construction carpenter,
approached Tan Ah Chong, 25, on March 31 and asked for directions. Tan claimed
to be a police officer and told him to go to a nearby void deck.

There he took Mr Rejak's wallet and also demanded money.

He became angry when he found out that Mr Rejak had no money.

He then took his watch.

He also told the construction carpenter to get $200 from his quarters in
exchange for his work permit, which Tan had taken.

When a policeman on patrol duty arrived at the scene, Mr Rejak told him what
had happened.

The policeman arrested Tan after finding Mr Rejak's watch on him.

Tan has five previous convictions for theft, drug consumption, possession of
offensive weapons and fraudulent possession of property.

The maximum punishment for extortion is five years' jail and caning.

86-year-old man sues daughter for return of Tiong Bahru shop

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

Column:  In The Courts

By Elena Chong

AN 86-YEAR-OLD man is suing his daughter for the return of a shop in Kim Tian
Road which she said was a gift to her.

Mr Cheng Buck Qui, a former provision shop owner, said in his statement of
claim that he was influenced by his daughter, Madam Cheng Muay alias Cheng Lee
Weng, 54, a housewife, into signing a letter of instruction to a lawyer to
transfer the property to her in June 1990.

A month later, he also signed another document for the property to be
transfered to her for $420,000.

But it is his case that no money was paid. Neither had he given the shop to
her as a gift.

Opening Mr Cheng's case yesterday, counsel Tay San Lee told Judicial
Commissioner Lim Teong Qwee that when his client signed the documents, he did
not have the benefit of independent legal advice, or knew what he was signing.

Mr Cheng had a severe hearing impairment, and was illiterate.

Mr Tay said it was not disputed that his client and his late wife, Madam Koo
Beng Eng, bought the property in 1962 for $36,000.

It was mortgaged to a bank in 1968 to get overdraft facilities for Mr Cheng.

In January 1990, 2-1/2 years after Madam Koo's death, Madam Cheng paid $20,000
to discharge the mortgage on the property.

In June and July 1990, she and her father went to the office of Messrs Peter
Mowe & Partners to sign the papers relating to the transfer of the Kim Tian
Road property, which is off Tiong Bahru Road.

Mr Cheng is seeking a declaration that the transfer be set aside due to the
undue influence of Madam Cheng, who has denied this.

Madam Cheng's case is that her father had intended to transfer the property to
her as a gift, and that the letter that he signed was based on his
instructions to the lawyer.

Cross-examined by Madam Cheng's lawyer, Mr Chandra Mohan, Mr Cheng's adopted
son, 47-year-old cabby Cheng Liang Choon, denied that he had instigated his
father to bring the action against Madam Cheng.

Mr Chandra Mohan had suggested that Liang Choon had hoped that Madam Cheng
would offer some money to her father who would then hand it over to him.

Asked why his father wanted to mortgage the property to obtain a loan, Liang
Choon said his father had no money and wanted to help him as he was indebted.

He said he had stopped his pork rib soup business since end-1994 to look after
his father.

Liang Choon, who obtained a taxi licence four months ago, admitted that he had
lost more than $1 million betting on horses, and that his father used to pay
his gambling debts.

Asked how much his present gambling debts were, he answered that they were
about $100,000.

The hearing continues.

Being good hosts a decisive factor

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

Tourism awards 

THIS year's annual tourism award winners will be people who provide more than
service with a smile.

The winners of these coveted Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) awards,
to be given on Friday, must be good hosts to tourists too.

The best salesgirl, waiter, tour guide, hotel receptionist and taxi driver
will be judged on product knowledge, attitude and how well they communicate
with customers.

The change in focus meshes with STPB's strategy to give visitors a memorable
experience. This is part of Tourism 21, a blueprint for the industry's
development.

The titles have also been changed to reflect the new concept. So the Retail
Sales Assistant of the Year of previous years will become Tourism Host of the
Year -Retail. There will be Tourism Hosts of the Year for Taxis, Tour Guiding,
Restaurant, Hotel, Travel Agency and Leisure Attraction.

A fine example: At least a third of regular volunteers are 30 or younger /
Children"s Cancer Foundation

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

* MEDICAL officer Tan Hiang Khoon was only 25 years old when, in the course of
his volunteer work with chronically ill children, he heard that parents with
cancer-stricken children had voiced the need for a support group.

Dr Tan, then a houseman, decided to rope in six other young volunteers to help
meet this need. This was five years ago.

Since then, the welfare group they set up -Working in Aid of Leukaemic Kids,
now known as the Children's Cancer Foundation -has grown from strength to
strength.

Dr Tan, now 29 and chairman of the foundation's management committee, said the
foundation served 195 families, compared to only 30 then.

Where previously there were only five volunteer counsellors who worked on an
ad-hoc basis, there are now four full-time social workers and another 15
volunteer counsellors.

Recalling the difficult times then, Dr Tan said: "We had no money, and no
credibility. As a young organisation, it was difficult to convince people to
donate money."

The programmes, he said, were also far from satisfactory.

Counselling services were run completely by volunteers who also had to cope
with their full-time jobs. He said: "The counsellors' main job then was to
offer a listening ear. More serious problems were referred to relevant
agencies."

Now, apart from counselling services and social outings for parents and
children, the foundation also organises parent support groups, workshops and
seminars, and provides financial assistance to families to help bear the costs
of chemotherapy.

Despite his busy work schedule, he still manages to spend an average of five
hours a week working for the foundation.

He said: "Once you get into the system, it becomes a part of your life and a
part of you. I don't feel as if I have to give up other things in my life to
do this work."

At least a third of regular volunteers are 30 or younger: A fine example

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Julie Kee

Is the post-65 generation concerned only with chasing the five Cs? Recently,
Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Law and
Home Affairs, cited the 1990 census report, which found that a higher
proportion of teenagers volunteer for community service than any other age
group. Professor Tommy Koh, Ambassador at Large, also said many were willing
to give up their time to help others. Julie Kee checked the volunteer profile
of seven welfare bodies, and spoke to one young volunteer who helped set up a
charity organisation in his spare time.

Not all young people are materialistic, say welfare groups

NOT all young people are materialistic and concerned only with chasing the
five Cs, said staff members of seven welfare groups The Straits Times
interviewed.

At least one out of three people who volunteer their services regularly at
these welfare bodies are 30 years old or younger -born after 1965.

And in one case, the proportion even goes up to four in five.

This makes them an important manpower resource in a field that is highly
dependent on volunteers, they said.

The post-65 generation forms 47 per cent of Singapore's population, and the
number is estimated at 1.42 million.

The National Council of Social Service, which categorises its volunteers by
their occupations, said that this year, 33.7 per cent of the people who signed
up for its volunteer placement programme were students.

Another 55.1 per cent were working adults and professionals, while housewives
formed 10.7 per cent, and retirees made up 0.5 per cent.

The council found that despite their youth, young volunteers did not restrict
themselves to any particular type of community work.

Ms Theresa Lee, divisional manager of the council's Volunteer Action and
Development Centre, said: "Students generally want to volunteer to work with
children and young people.

"However, we do see a growing interest by students towards working with the
elderly and the disabled."

In the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled in Singapore, (Minds), young
working adults below 30 years old make up half the volunteer pool.

Mr Aaron Ng, executive director of Minds, said that young volunteers were
important because they provided much-needed help in activities which were
labour-intensive.

Their role as volunteers, he said, complemented those in the older age groups
who tended to offer managerial expertise.

In the Singapore Volunteers Overseas Programme run by the Singapore
International Foundation, about one-third of the people who sign up are from
the post-65 generation.

Participants usually take leave of absence or resign from their jobs to serve
as volunteers.

They are paid a living allowance of about $400 a month and sent to developing
countries such as Indonesia, Nepal, Vietnam, Botswana and Ghana to provide
humanitarian and technical assistance.

Miss Low Lih Jeng, the programme's assistant director, said: "The spirit of
altruism comes out very strongly.

"If these young people did not come forward, it would definitely have affected
the success of our programme."

On whether today's youth were materialistic, she said: "I think a lot of young
people want to help but it's a matter of balancing work commitments with
volunteer work."

According to Mrs Geri Lau, secretary-general of the Singapore Red Cross
Society, it was not wrong for young people to put a premium on striving hard
in their careers and being competitive.

"This is necessary for a vibrant society," she said.

Troubled Tories hope much from conference: Senior Tory party member
defects

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Neville Stack in London

THE Conservative Party hopes that its last conference before the general
election will be a jolt of adrenaline.

But even the managers, who usually succeed in keeping the conference running
demurely along party lines, will be hard put to disguise the faults that
sunder the party from the Cabinet down.

Add to that the usual crop of financial-sleaze scandals to set Tory tongues
wagging, in private at any rate, and the scenario looks pretty bleak for the
conference, which begins in earnest today in Bournemouth with the arrival of
the Prime Minister.

There have been dozens of critical resolutions tabled on the leadership's
policy over Europe and monetary union. But few will survive the chairman's
pruning knife, and whatever criticisms voiced will be tentative.

The conference, both on the floor and in the side-show meetings, will be
dominated by the issue of Europe and what to do about it.

It is the perceived loss of sovereignty which would follow the adoption of
economic and monetary union (EMU) that is obsessing Conservatives.

Prime Minister John Major, with the support of most of his Cabinet, is keeping
his powder dry prudently (as is opposition leader Tony Blair) and not making
any decisions until he has to. But that does not suit his rebel faction, now
grown to nearly half his parliamentary and grassroots party.

Whipped on by the xenophobic right-wing press, the Europhobes will demand that
he rule out EMU for the life of the next parliament.

He will not concede.

If he does, his Euro-enthusiast Chancellor (Finance Minister) Kenneth Clarke
will resign and set up his own caucus of the Tory left -and that will split
the party asunder and lose it all chances at the general election.

Mr Clarke, a genial verbal bruiser, has told his friends that he will relish
the chance of a conference confrontation with the party dissidents, one that
his high office precludes in the House of Commons.

The Daily Mail's political columnist Simon Heffer is not alone in the media in
taking a sour view of the whole affair.

"In a sensible party, the last conference before an election is used to set
out the programme on which that conference will be fought," he wrote. "In
their highly successful conference at Blackpool, Labour did just that.

"The party that comes to Bournemouth will be immersed instead in a soup of
introspection, flavoured with dollops of defeatism, despair and recrimination
 ... the ideas-free zone that the party has become will disappoint those who
want a new, powerful message to take to the people."

The sub-text to all this manoeuvring is: What happens after the election? That
is the hidden agenda that will dominate the conference.

The polls continue to predict that Labour will sweep in, but wiser heads
-including Mr Blair's -are not so confident. Tory sheep scurry back to the
fold when they scent the Labour wolf.

But assuming the Tory death-wish comes true and it loses, Cabinet ministers
Michael Portillo and Michael Howard will battle with leadership challenger
John Redwood for the hearts and wallets of the right.

Mr Clarke and deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine will line up on the
left, alongside that doughty octogenarian former premier Sir Edward Heath. But
this disregards, as many unwisely do, the Prime Minister's calibre.

Mr Major will point to the rapid improvement in the economy and the standard
of living, Britain's many competitive advantages and the fall in unemployment.
He will be optimistic about the years ahead. He will be wary of Europe's
machinations but not hostile.

He is no charismatic orator, as Tony Blair is. But in his own dogged, steady
way, he is in tune with the millions of similar people in the mythical
constituency called Middle England.

The writer covers European developments and issues for The Straits Times.

Chris Patten"s last hurrah

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

HONGKONG Governor Chris Patten's valedictory address to the Legislative
Council (Legco) last week was expectedly dramatic. It was his last annual
policy address on Hongkong; it was the last any British Governor would make
there; and the forum was no other than the elected Legco, the main point of
contention between the outgoing colonial authorities and China, to which the
territory will revert next year. Beijing, which says that Mr Patten's
electoral reforms violate the 1984 Sino-British treaty on Hongkong, has vowed
to abolish the Legco, elected last year for a four-year term, and replace it
with a provisional chamber. Mr Patten's opposition to the provisional
legislature, and his impassioned defence of the existing one, was summed up in
his question: "How can you have complete faith in the future of the rule of
law if you worry about the integrity of the institution which makes the laws?"

Now, the belief in the need for the rule of law is eminently justified, of
course; the problem lies in equating it with Legco's continued existence. No
one would deny the need for an independent judiciary, which protects not only
the man on the street but also trade and industry, by enforcing contractual
and other legal obligations without which a highly-developed economy is
impossible to sustain. The rule of law also ensures the probity of government
in what is the world's eighth largest trading community. No one would deny the
need for a meritocratic civil service, which administers Hongkong with quiet,
predictable efficiency. Were that efficiency to be subordinated to
extra-professional considerations, the consequences for the territory's way of
life would be seen ultimately in its economic bottomline as well.

Not only is all this true, but also, Beijing knows it as much as the departing
authorities do. But what China knows, and they continue to refuse to accept,
is that their political blueprint for the colony, made in the teeth of
Beijing's opposition, is not the sole repository of these safeguards. The
point is whether the rule of law prevails; to make it conditional on the
continuance of Legco will get Hongkong nowhere. As a matter of principle,
Beijing is opposed to an institution that rejects the spirit and purpose of
the 1984 joint accord. As a matter of practice, it is idle to believe that
China will not carry out its threat to disband Legco. Indeed, the rule of law
existed in Hongkong before the arrival of the elected council. Why, then,
place so much in the care of an institution that was not guaranteed to come
into existence and which is doomed to fail? What is achieved by saying that a
smooth transition in 1997 is not an end in itself, a successful transition, as
smooth as possible, being what is necessary? Why rub in the point by laying
down benchmarks by which others will apparently judge Hongkong after 1997?

More productive were Mr Patten's reference to the fundamentals of Hongkong's
success -the hard work and skill of its people, its beneficent administration
under the rule of law, its openness to the world -and his pledge of assistance
to his successor, the Chief Executive-designate, who is expected to be chosen
by the end of this year. For Hongkong's enduring qualities to thrive after the
handover, it will need to enjoy economic autonomy. The Chief Executive must
ensure, and must be seen to be ensuring, that it does so. To do his job, he
must have China's confidence, because it is this that will give him the
wherewithal to stand up for Hongkong when necessary. What is good is that this
co-operation is only to be expected. Hongkong's autonomy is in the interests
of both the territory and China and, indeed, these interests will converge
even more closely after 1997. This makes it natural for the mainland to let
the territory do business its own way. Hongkong's well-wishers hope that it
will continue on this natural trajectory without political obstacles coming in
the way. Ultimately, its future lies with China.

S46"s self-dissolution -the final episode in 7-year political adventure

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

ON SUNDAY, the Parti Melayu Semangat 46 (S46) general assembly created
political history in Malaysia when it became the first party to pass a motion
for self-dissolution.

This ended its seven-year adventure in the political landscape and paved the
way for its members to rejoin Umno.

Despite the brave talk of party leaders and delegates at the special general
assembly of disbanding in a position of strength, facts seem to suggest that
it faced only two choices: Either reunite with the stronger and more
widely-accepted Umno or slide into political oblivion.

Consider these facts: In the 1990 general elections, a year after it was
formed, S46's candidates managed to win six Parliamentary seats and 12 state
seats.

Five years later, it performed miserably in all states, save for Kelantan,
where S46 candidates won 11 seats on the state assembly.

Even party president Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, a Kelantan strongman since the
70s, was not spared the swing in votes.

He won his Gua Musang parliamentary seat on a reduced majority of 4,746 votes,
compared to the 8,980 before.

In his speech at the general assembly, deputy president Datuk Rais Yatim
recognised this erosion of support. Speaking to 500 delegates on Sunday, he
noted that S46 had spent the last few years trying to oppose Umno.

But the party's message and struggle were only effective and accepted in
Kelantan and a few places on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia.

He said: "From statistics, the two elections gave Umno nearly three million
votes, 440,000 for PAS and 600,000 for S46."

Umno and PAS (Parti Islam) politicians say that the party was headed for a
heavy and potentially crippling defeat at the next elections.

Said an Umno Youth politician: "The euphoria of starting a new party with a
common enemy was getting weaker. This was evident at branch level where many
members had seemed to have lost the fire and crossed over to Umno."

PAS was even more damning in its assessment of the political survival of its
former ally in the Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah. Kelantan Mentri Besar Datuk Nik
Aziz Nik Mat, scoffing at S46's chances of denting its hold on the state, told
The Straits Times: "S46 will be lucky if it can win a few seats in the next
elections. If its candidates fight head-on with PAS candidates, it will have
less than 10 seats in the state assembly."

An exaggeration perhaps but observers say that the slightly built religious
teacher was not very far off the mark.

They noted that the main problem with the party was that it had lost much of
its relevance. It was born at a time when Malay politics was at its lowest
ebb.

In 1987, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah challenged Umno president and Prime Minister
Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad unsuccessfully for the party president's post.
He then took the matter to court on the ground that some delegates who voted
were ineligible.

A year later, the High Court declared Umno illegal and the main vehicle of
Malay unity was de-registered. Umno Baru was set up by Dr Mahathir while
Tengku Razaleigh formed S46.

Against this backdrop, there were accusations of corruption and money politics
being hurled by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah's camp against Dr Mahathir and his
supporters.

During this time of great disunity, the S46 filled a vacuum for many former
Umno members who felt that the party had lost its way and was not looking
after the interests of the Malays.

There was also a tremendous feeling of sympathy towards S46 after elder Malay
statesmen such as the late Tunku Abdul Rahman and Tun Hussein Onn were
blacklisted and not allowed to join the new Umno.

Two years later, these feelings of anger and frustration turned into protest
votes at the general elections.

In Kelantan, the National Front led by Umno tasted its worst defeat, losing in
all 39 state and 13 parliamentary seats. More importantly, it gave up control
of the east coast state which it had ruled since 1978.

Mr Hassan Harun, an Umno Supreme Council member and a Kelantanese, said: "What
happened in 1990 was a show of anger and protest by the voters. I do not think
that it was because of S46's or PAS' election platform."

Following that election, however, things changed. S46 realised that it was
very much a second-class citizen in the Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah in Kelantan,
which it formed with PAS, Berjasa and Hamim.

The Islamic party was slowly exerting control over all policies in the state,
sometimes with total disregard for its ally.

This alienated some S46 leaders such as Datuk Ibrahim Ali, Datin Paduka
Rahimah Osman, Datuk Harun Idris and Ms Marina Yusof, who left the party.

At the same time, under the leadership of Dr Mahathir, the Malaysian economy
soared.

Double-digit economic growth created jobs and opportunities for everyone. A
new breed of Malay entrepreneurs were created, giving the community immense
pride and a larger share of the economy.

The feel-good factor was evident among Malaysians who spurned even traditional
opposition parties such as the DAP (Democratic Action Party) and returned the
National Front to power with a large majority.

Thorny issues of money politics and corruption within Umno were met head-on by
Dr Mahathir. Some party members were expelled after being found guilty of
using money to buy political patronage.

The battle to curb this disease is still very alive with Dr Mahathir banning
all candidates for the Umno elections this week from campaigning.

On Sunday, he told delegates to pick only clean leaders so that the party
could eradicate money politics.

Bit by bit, the raison d'etre of S46 was being chipped away, a fact
acknowledged by Datuk Rais.

He noted: "Our issues and the focus of our struggles between 1987 and 1990 is
not given much weight by Malays. The two elections have proven this fact.

"The change in the environment, the attitude and economic values have played a
role. Economic change has played the main role in changing the view and
struggle of Malays and Malaysians."

Tengku Razaleigh was even more frank. He said: "The reality that Umno is
strong and accepted by the public has to be accepted."

But factors beyond the party's control were only one dimension of the slide in
the party's fortunes. It also suffered from an image problem.

Many of the party' stalwarts were former Umno members who had held federal
ministers' posts. These included Tengku Razaleigh, Datuk Rais and Datuk Manan
Osman.

They were not in the mould of Mr Lim Kit Siang or Mr Karpal Singh and could
not galvanise the opposition or gain wide acceptance as members of the
opposite bench.

In the end, they were neither seen as a National Front party nor as an
effective opposition.

Its stand on the powers of the Malay rulers also alienated a number of its
supporters and the public. When there was a groundswell of feeling against the
excesses of the sultans and when the federal government moved to pass
legislation removing their legal immunity, S46 did not support the motion.

The party stated that the special role of the Malay rulers was important to
protect the rights of the Malays and Islam. However, there was talk that the
rejection of the legislation had more to do with Tengku Razaleigh's close
links to the Kelantan Palace.

The final nail in the coffin was its poor choice of political allies, ranging
from DAP to PAS.

Neither of these parties shared its political goal: to be in the forefront of
Malay nationalism. In fact, PAS eschews nationalism in any form. It regards it
as assabiyah, a form of racism.

Not surprisingly, S46 fell out with its allies. In Kelantan, it was not
consulted on many issues and made to look incompetent.

This year, the PAS-led government decided that all eating shops should be
barred from opening before 3 pm. This did not go down so well with non-Malay
shopkeepers.

Even decisions to ban wayang kulit, carnival rides and unisex hair salons were
not taken in consultation with S46 leaders.

The unpopularity of some of these decisions cost S46 candidates a huge chunk
of non-Malay votes in the 1995 elections.

Worse still, its threats to leave the Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah were laughed
off by PAS.

Said Mr Wan Ismail Wan Jusoh, press secretary to the Mentri Besar, Datuk Nik
Aziz: "We do not bow to threats. They were a party on the way down, losing
support on the ground every day."

Seeing the writing on the wall, the leaders decided to dissolve the party and
reunite with Umno.

As Tengku Razaleigh noted: "The party is only a tool to serve and achieve a
higher objective, that is to realise the goals of religion, the race and the
nation."

Committee to allay fears: Internet advisory panel to help fine-tune rules /
National Internet Advisory Committee

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

INTERNET PRIVACY

THE legal sub-committee of the National Internet Advisory Committee will
discuss the issue of privacy in cyberspace, said its chairman Lee Seiu Kin of
the Attorney-General's Chambers.

After a recent case in which a man was fined $61,500 for downloading smut off
the Internet, some Internet users here were concerned that they were being
tracked.

This was despite assurances by the Singapore Broadcasting Authority that
individuals' movements on the Internet were not being monitored.

Mr Lee said: "If many people feel this way, then this will not be good for the
development of the Net so we want to look at how we can allay these concerns."

The deputy director of the AG's Chambers civil and international affairs
divisions said he was in the process of forming the team.

He said it was likely that the legal sub-group would include members from
outside the main committee, who would provide a good balance of ideas.

An avid surfer himself, he often combs the World Wide Web for four or five
hours a night, "to get an idea of what is out there". He also makes use of the
Internet, especially e-mail, in his daily legal work.

He made it clear that he saw the need for some amount of Internet regulation.

He revealed that, at its first meeting a week ago, the committee was shown
some of the pornographic web sites which have been blocked under SBA content
guidelines. He said quite simply: "I wouldn't want my children to see that."

Nonetheless, like his fellow committee members, he sees the Internet as a
potent force to be taken advantage of.

Committee to allay fears

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Raoul Le Blond

THE new National Internet Advisory Committee (NIAC) will look into issues such
as privacy in cyberspace and promote the use of Internet services such as
electronic mail.

It will also help to fine-tune Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) rules
for the Internet here.

The NIAC chairman, Associate Professor Bernard Tan, sketched its directions at
a press conference yesterday.

He said the 19-member group, appointed by the Ministry of Information and the
Arts (Mita) recently for a two-year term, had held its first meeting a week
ago.

The body will look at information provided on the Internet, as well as
electronic bulletin boards.

It will advise the SBA on Internet rules, but would not be involved in the
day-to-day policing, he said.

The rules are aimed at keeping out objectionable content, such as pornography
and politically inflammatory material.

The NIAC will look at the ways Internet usage is affected by the rules, and
whether there is a need to fine-tune them.

"The SBA regulations are not cast in stone," he said. But he stressed that his
committee could only make recommendations.

Prof Tan, who is also the dean of the National University of Singapore's
Science faculty, said that three sub-committees had been formed.

These would gather feedback on users' concerns, and come up with ways to
educate the public on the Internet.

The sub-groups are the:

* Legal sub-committee headed by Mr Lee Seiu Kin, senior state counsel and
deputy head (civil division) and (international affairs division),
Attorney-General's Chambers;

* Industry sub-committee headed by Mr Johnny Moo, group managing director of
Computer Systems Advisors Group;

* Public education subcommittee, led by Mr Tan Yap Kwang, director of the
Education Ministry's planning division.

One of the first areas the NIAC will study is the effect that proxy servers
are having on Internet access here.

Proxy servers are devices, installed in computer networks, which speed up
access to often-accessed Web pages.

They are also used here to block sites which the SBA deems objectionable.

Since Sept 15, Internet Access Service Providers here have required public
subscribers to use proxy servers, prompting some users to complain about
slower access.

Another area that the NIAC would study is promoting the wider use of Internet
services.

Prof Tan said: "While a lot of attention has been focused on the use of the
World Wide Web, we want to encourage the use of electronic mail among the
wider population."

He added that the committee would also work to heighten the public's awareness
about the Internet and its potential.

With its members coming from a broad range of professions -the law, government
bodies, schools and industry -the committee was well-placed to gather
feedback, he said.

There are about 100,000 Internet subscribers here. But equally important were
the views of those who do not use the Internet regularly, such as parents of
children who are avid surfers.

He said much of the discussion about the Internet was misinformed, and that
the committee would work to correct this.

SM Lee, Major hold "very friendly" meeting: Singapore model comes as a
package -take it or leave it

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Neville Stack in London

SENIOR Minister Lee Kuan Yew called on British Prime Minister John Major at
Number 10, Downing Street, yesterday.

Mr Major had returned on Saturday from the European Summit in Dublin and was
preparing to leave for the crucial Conservative Party conference in
Bournemouth.

"Mr Major made great efforts to meet Senior Minister Lee," a diplomatic source
said.

The Straits Times understands that Mr Major was working on the keynote speech
that he will deliver at the Tory conference.

"The meeting was very friendly and constructive and it centred on the growth
of opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region," said a Downing Street source.
"They discussed opportunities for Singapore-British trade."

Mr Lee later met the British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, former
president of the Board of Trade.

And he spoke at a private luncheon of the influential Chairmen's Club at the
Berkeley Hotel.

Mr Lee, who is on a private visit to England, invited Mr Tony Blair, leader of
the opposition Labour Party, to dinner last night.

Today, Mr Lee will give a talk at Asia House, a forum for economic, commercial
and cultural activities linking Asia and Europe.

I REFER to the letter "McDonald's should say how food is cooked" (ST, Aug 28).

I was shocked to learn that beef extract is used for french fries and hash
browns. I am surprised that McDonald's has not responded to date.

Do other fast-food outlets also use beef extract in their cooked food? I also
understand that most cheese contains beef.

Consumers who do not eat beef for religious or health reasons are not aware of
this. They should be told what ingredients go into foodstuff.

5-day week won"t be standard practice in Civil Service

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

MS JENNI HO, in her letter "Benefits in shorter work week" (ST, Sept 27),
suggested that Government should take the lead in implementing a five-day week
for civil servants.

The Prime Minister, in response to a question on a five-day week at a forum in
April this year, stated that "... this should be left to the market to decide
and that the Government would not set the tone by allowing the Civil Service a
five-day week and encouraging other employers to do so".

Statistics from the Ministry of Labour show that two-thirds of private-sector
organisations work a 5.5-day week or even longer. The table (right) gives the
1995 work-week figures for clerical, sales, service, production and related
employees.

The Civil Service will not adopt a five-day work-week as a standing practice.

But ministries may adopt flexible work-week arrangements where this will
improve the level of service to the public.

For example, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has extended its
service hours to full-day operation on Saturdays. The roster for the six-day
service is such that counter officers work five days a week, including
alternate Saturdays.

Many supervisors turn up for work every Saturday as their staff are on duty.

Give clear reply on cyclists" behaviour

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

THE reply from the Land Transport Authority (ST, Oct 4) in response to
readers' views on the irresponsible road behaviour of cyclists on our roads is
lame, to say the least.

It ignores the concerns of many road users, who wonder whether cyclists have
to follow traffic regulations or not. Is the number of accidents involving
cyclists not high enough yet for a proper response?

Ignorance of traffic regulations among cyclists is so prevalent that it is not
uncommon to see Neighbourhood Police Post members making their rounds at night
without a lamp on their bicycles or riding two abreast!

As cyclists tend to ride along pedestrian footpaths and pedestrian crossings,
would the LTA please give a clear and unequivocal reply?

Police will take action against reckless cyclists

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

WE WOULD like to thank the writers of the letters "Cyclists here seem to defy
rules and safety" (ST, Sept 27), "Make safe cycling easier" and "Most cycles
are not fitted with bells" (ST, Sept 30) for their feedback.

In our news release on the accident situation for the first half of this year,
we raised our concern over cyclists, particularly cyclists who are reckless
and behave irresponsibly on the roads.

We take a serious view of such conduct and will not hesitate to take action
against them.

The Road Traffic (Bicycles) Rules require, for example, that all bicycles
should have a front lamp and a rear red light or reflector during hours of
darkness.

They also require that bicycles must be ridden in an orderly manner and with
due regard for the safety of others. Action has always been taken against
cyclists who flout these rules.

As for the suggestion to educate cyclists, the Traffic Police have, since
1981, trained primary schoolchildren on safe cycling at the Road Safety Park
at the East Coast Parkway.

Some 10,000 schoolchildren who attend these programmes each year are taught,
among other things, to obey signals and signs to ride safely, and to put on
proper riding attire. The students also play a traffic game simulating road
situations and are given "demerit points" if they fail to comply with the
traffic rules.

Road safety talks are conducted at schools, community clubs and other
grassroots organisations. We will continue to place emphasis on education and
explore new ways to undertake this.

The Traffic Police are monitoring closely the accident rate involving cyclists
and will continue with their enforcement action. In the meantime, we would
like to remind all cyclists to keep to the traffic laws for their own safety,
as well as that of other road-users.

Exempt some donations entirely from estate duty

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

I REFER to your articles (ST, Oct 4) on Mr C.J. Koh's donation of $2 million
to the Universities Endowment Fund.

Although it has been well publicised that the donation is tax-deductible, I
wonder if it is equally well known that such donations would not be exempt
from estate duty if the gift was made during the donor's lifetime unless he
survives for one year after the time of the gift (in the case of a gift to a
public or charitable institution).

Otherwise, the money donated is deemed under the law to still belong to the
donor at the time of his death, and estate duty is chargeable accordingly.

For gifts to non-public or non-charitable institutions, the time frame is five
years.

Under the Estate Duty Act, estate duty is not payable only for gifts of money
to the National Museum; other than that only bequests to five institutions are
exempt from duty. The National University of Singapore is one of the five,
although strangely enough, the Nanyang Technological University is not.

The term "bequest" means that it must be a gift under a will, to be given
after death. Hence gifts during the lifetime of the donor are not exempt.
Therefore, the donor's estate would be liable for estate duty if the donor
dies within the year!

Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), it is
provided that estate duty could be recovered from the recipient of the gift.
In the case of a gift to a charity, it seems to me that it defeats the purpose
of the gift if the recipient is required to pay the estate duty.

This leads me to wonder whether the Estate Duty Act should be amended to
exempt totally from estate duty gifts to any public or charitable institution
regardless of when the gifts were made. A bolder move could be to abolish
estate duty altogether as Malaysia did several years ago.

Perhaps this could spur more donations and help the Universities Endowment
Fund meet its $1 billion target more easily and quickly as the Fund will not
have to wait till the demise of donors before getting the donations.

GRCs : Amendment Bill may be unconstitutional

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

ARTICLE 12 (2) of the Republic of Singapore Constitution provides that "except
as expressly authorised by this Constitution, there shall be no discrimination
against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion, race, descent or
place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment
under a public authority ..."

This provision is in fact qualified by Article 39A which provides that GRCs
may be formed "in order to ensure the representation in Parliament of members
from the Malay, Indian and other minority communities ..."

Another qualification to this is to be found in Article 152(1) which provides
that "it shall be the responsibility of the Government constantly to care for
the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore".

These are all very sound rules to ensure that no one particular majority will
ever come to oppress the minorities in Singapore.

When Mr Lim Boon Heng, Minister without Portfolio, put forward the GRC
proposal in 1987, its objective clearly was to give effect to the Government's
duty to protect minority interests in Singapore.

It was a laudable effort and a sound attempt to maintain the racial and
religious harmony in the country.

However, when the Prime Minister decided recently to introduce an Amendment
Bill (which would become an Act of Parliament or "law" if passed by Parliament
and assented to by the President) to Article 39A, the manifest intention was
to facilitate the institutionalisation of community development councils.

It is this novel rationale that may result in the constitutionality of the
Amendment Bill being suspect.

This issue must be examined carefully prior to the General Election, for it
carries with it serious consequences. Article 4 of our Constitution states
clearly that any "law" which is inconsistent with the Constitution is void.

Prima facie, the GRC concept goes against the equality of race principle
embodied in Article 12(2). The only reason the GRC scheme exists, since its
introduction in 1987, is that the GRC concept seeks to protect the minority
interest (as empowered by Articles 39A and 152(1) respectively). This, as I
pointed out, is of course desirable and legitimate. However, can the same
noble aspirations be ascribed to the recently proposed Amendment Bill?

The Prime Minister's Amendment Bill seeks to decrease the minority
representation in the GRCs from one-quarter to one-sixth. Can this Bill ever
be described sensibly as "to care for the interests of the racial and
religious minorities" under Article 152(1)?

Similarly, since the Prime Minister has already stated openly that the Bill
was introduced to create the necessary critical mass for the CDCs to work, can
this rationale be described sensibly as "in order to ensure the representation
in Parliament of members from the Malay, Indian and other minority
communities" under Article 39A?

If the answers to the above two questions are "no", this Amendment Bill -even
if passed by Parliament -will be struck down by the courts as void for being
unconstitutional. It will certainly be a prima facie contravention of the
"equality of races" principle embodied in Article 12.

It will similarly be outside the scope of either Article 39A or Article
152(1), and will therefore remain void since it does not appear to be an
exceptional case sanctioned by Article 39A or Article 152(1).

The only way to preserve the GRCs' legitimacy is to maintain the present
rationale to protect minority interests without any other extraneous
considerations concerning the CDCs. Consequential to this, the number of MPs
in each GRC should not be increased, otherwise the proportion of minority MPs
would decrease, thus derogating from the original objective of Article 39A.

I may be wrong in my assessment of the legality/constitutionality of this
Bill, but I beg the Prime Minister's indulgence in re-examining it carefully
in order to avoid any unnecessary quagmire. The nation's stability might well
be at stake should Parliament be forced to dissolve as a result.

Bourse fails to rally on back of Wall Street gains: Dow breaches 6,000 for
first time in early trading

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

Column:  Market Report

By Tan Li Eng

THE expected firming of the Singapore bourse on the back of strong Wall Street
gains last Friday failed to materialise, as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index sank 22.2 points to 2,126.66.

Dealers attributed the bearishness to sustained underweighting activity and
poor sentiment.

"The climb in the Dow is not to our advantage because more money will be
poured into the US market rather than the Asian markets, said a dealer with a
foreign brokerage. "Most of the liquidity will be sucked out to the US
market."

Even market newcomer Easyknit International Holdings was not spared the
adverse sentiment, suffering the ignominy of becoming the second offering to
debut below its offer price in a week.

Shares in the Hongkong-based garment manufacturer dropped 5 per cent below its
initial public offer price. It dipped as low as HK$2.60 in intra-day trading,
with 1.74 million shares changing hands, before closing at HK$2.90.

On Friday, Pacific Andes (Holdings) shares fell 6 per cent below its offer
price of 57 US cents. Yesterday, it continued to drift further, ending three
cents down at 50.5 US cents.

Property stocks as a whole also fell, with the SES Properties Index tumbling
12.02 points to 644.59.

News that third quarter private property transactions plunged by 75 per cent
from the previous quarter and comments by Minister for National Development
Lim Hng Kiang that property prices would "adjust downward" over the next six
months further eroded sentiment, said dealers.

City Developments dropped 40 cents to $10.80 on 1.2 million shares traded,
Wing Tai fell two cents to $3.42 on 2.4 million shares, while DBS Land eased
10 cents to $4.52 on 1.3 million shares.

Singapore Telecommunications was down 10 cents to $3.10, its lowest level in
nearly three weeks.

The dismal trading story repeated itself across the causeway, as the benchmark
Kuala Lumpur Composite Index fell 1.68 points to 1,148.5. The Second Board
index fell 12.27 points, or 2.1 per cent, to 558.97.

"The 12-point drop on the Second Board may have caused quite a bit of jitters
on the Malaysian side," said a remisier.

But over-the-counter stocks dominated volumes and gainers here and the UOB-OTC
index closed up 2.89 points at 1,191.82.

MBf Holdings topped the turnover list, rising two cents to 62.5 cents on 3.44
million shares. Technology Resources Industries Bhd was the top gainer,
soaring 32 cents to $4.02.

Volume was 77.6 million shares worth $229.2 million compared to 92.04 million
units worth $216.48 million last Friday. Losers swamped gainers 221 to 93,
with 249 stocks unchanged. -TAN LI ENG.

August manufacturing output dwindles 7.6%

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

SINGAPORE'S manufacturing output shrank 7.6 per cent in August, with the
critical electronics industry recording a 5.1 per cent fall in output from a
year ago.

"The output of chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, petrochemical and
specialty chemicals), transport equipment, plastic products and petroleum
industries also declined," the Economic Development Board (EDB) said
yesterday.

Only industrial chemicals and gases and electrical machinery did not suffer
falls in output during the month, according to the EDB's industrial production
index. The sectors grew 2.7 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively.

Cumulative manufacturing output for the first eight months of this year grew
6.4 per cent year-on-year, the board said, with cumulative electronics output
growth of 12.6 per cent.

The poorest performers were the paints and pharmaceuticals and transport
equipment sectors, whose output fell 24.6 per cent and 18.5 per cent
respectively.

Output of plastic products and fabricated metal products slowed in line with
the decline in the electronics industry, falling 15.5 per cent and 7.2 per
cent respectively.

The petroleum industry's output fell 9.2 per cent "due to lower output by a
major refinery which experienced technical start-up problems after its
shutdown for maintenance in July".

The printing and publishing industry declined 3.7 per cent because of reduced
orders from the commercial print media.

The poor manufacturing output figures had been anticipated after August's
worse-than-expected 6.3 per cent fall in non-oil domestic exports.

Commenting on those numbers two weeks ago, Trade and Industry Minister Yeo
Cheow Tong said the Singapore economy was "on track" to achieve the 7 to 8 per
cent economic growth forecast for this year.

He added that, based on feedback from industry, the Government expected to see
some recovery in the electronics sector in the first six months of next year.

Slower property investment sales in third quarter

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kalpana Rashiwala

But sales so far this year hit record $9b

PROPERTY investment sales in the third quarter slowed 17 per cent from the
preceding three months, due mainly to slower sales of land for residential
development, particularly in the private sector.

Nonetheless, investment sales for the first nine months of this year reached
$9.3 billion -exceeding the record $7.7 billion chalked up for the whole of
last year, according to Jones Lang Wootton (JLW) figures.

Investment sales of property refer to purchases of development sites and en
bloc sales, not single units bought by consumers. They are used as a gauge of
developers' confidence in the mediumto long-term prospects of the property
market.

Total investment sales fell in the July-September period to $2.5 billion -from
$2.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.9 billion in the first quarter.

The third quarter saw lower proceeds from sales of residential development
sites -by both the state and private sector. The combined figure for the third
quarter was $1.2 billion, down 30 per cent from $1.7 billion in the second
quarter and a heftier 43 per cent from $2.1 billion during January to March
this year.

Government sales of housing plots in the third quarter totalled $731 million
-compared with $837 million and $1.6 billion in the second and first quarters
respectively.

Sales of private development sites -which include en bloc or collective sales
of apartments with redevelopment potential -came off even more dramatically in
the third quarter, falling 46 per cent to $470 million from the second
quarter's $881 million. However, the figure was not far off the $488 million
in the first quarter.

"Sales of residential development sites still contributed 49 per cent to
overall investment sales for the quarter," noted JLW executive director Steven
Choo.

However, this was lower than 54.7 per cent and 58.3 per cent for the first and
second quarters respectively.

Analysts had expected the drop in investment sales of residential plots,
particularly in the private sector.

Said UBS Securities senior research analyst Soon Ching Voon: "Since the
mid-May property curbs were introduced, there had been many land tenders,
mostly en bloc sales, for which results have not been announced, including
properties in the Dunearn and Upper Thomson areas.

"It probably means that the owners found the bids below their reserve prices,
or perhaps for some of the sites, no bids may have been received.

"Developers have become cautious." Analysts said the drop in sales of
government residential sites had more to do with the timing of the sales.

They noted that on the whole, the Government had been committed to increasing
residential land supply.

"However, tender prices have come off about 10-15 per cent since the property
curbs," noted Mr Soon.

There was a pick-up in sales of en bloc commercial properties in the third
quarter.

The Promenade along Orchard Road and Cockpit Hotel together with an adjoining
site changed hands last month for nearly $271 million and $380 million
respectively.

Dr Choo noted that several freehold bungalow and condominium sites, such as
City Mansions at Paterson Road, had been put on the market.

"Paradoxically, the current softer sentiment may help to make deals as both
buyers and sellers are more realistic about their expectations," he said.

GE Life sales agents protest against plan to cut commission / Great Eastern
Life

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

THE guild representing Great Eastern Life's sales representatives yesterday
spoke out against proposed cuts in their commissions.

Mr Mohd Amin, president of the GE Life Sales Representatives' Guild, told a
press conference: "It is a short-sighted policy to cut where it is easiest to
cut. It's killing the goose that lays the golden egg."

GE Life decided last month to reduce commissions for its 4,700 agents by an
average of 20 per cent from Jan 1 due to declining investment income.

Set against a competitive marketplace and low interest rates, the options open
to the management were cutting costs and raising returns on investments.

GE Life said in a rebuttal yesterday that the commission changes were
implemented so that its product cost structure will be in line with that of
the industry.

"Given the long-term nature of the life insurance investment, the company
needs to take prudent measures to safeguard the long-term interests of
policy-holders," it said.

The company also needs to ensure that its investment yield will be consistent
with the industry's long-term performance. It is hiring a chief investment
officer to oversee its investments.

Mr Amin said it was no fault of the agents that investment yields had been
below the industry average. Yet, the agents had to bear the brunt of reduced
remuneration. "We hope they will rethink the firm's overall strategy and not
treat us as scapegoats," he added.

Guild member Mervyn Goh pointed out that the company had been able to sustain
commissions for the past five years, when returns on investments were 4-6 per
cent.

He asked why, if GE Life could project a 7 per cent rate of return, it could
not maintain the established commission rates.

The guild claims that the company's proposed changes involved cuts in agents'
remuneration of between 15 and as much as 60 per cent on certain pay packages
-more than the average 15 to 25 per cent range mentioned by the company.

Changes in the agency structure hinder career advancement, it claimed. "Agents
may be demoted, become part-time agents, leave the company or industry
altogether," it warned.

However, the guild had encouraged its 3,565 agents and managers to stay on
with GE Life while it resolves matters with the management.

Guild representatives said they hoped press publicity will help clarify
matters and restore confidence in the company and that the management will
respond by withdrawing the proposed package.

They said their request to discuss the matter with GE Life's newly appointed
chief executive officer Tan Beng Lee had fallen on deaf ears, but GE Life said
there has been open dialogue.

Mr Justin Lee, honorary secretary of the guild, said the company's suggestion
-that agents change their strategy to promote more life policies to cushion
potential losses in earnings -was "improper and uncalled for".

The guild has, therefore, written to the Insurance Commissioner about their
concerns that this suggestion runs contrary to the code of conduct set out in
their agency agreement.

Delifrance issuing 45.16m shares at 78<c> apiece in IPO / Delifrance Asia,
SES, Stock Exchange of Singapore

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Freddie Ng

HOT on the heels of recent initial public offerings, French delicatessen chain
Delifrance Asia yesterday launched its IPO of 45.16 million shares at 78 cents
each for a mainboard listing.

At 78 cents, the offer shares of par value 10 cents each are being issued at a
historical price-earnings (PE) ratio of 17.26 times.

The public offer consists of 29.9 million new shares and 15.26 million vendor
shares, which are stock sold by the company's existing shareholders.
Delifrance will not have a placement tranche.

The public offer, representing 25 per cent of the company's enlarged share
capital, will yield net proceeds of about $21.7 million. Up to 10 per cent of
the offered shares will be reserved for the group's management, staff and
business associates.

According to Delifrance, $10 million of the net proceeds will be used to
upgrade and establish production facilities in Singapore, Philippines,
Australia, Malaysia, Hongkong and China.

Expansion of retail outlets in Singapore, Hongkong, Malaysia and Australia
will take up another $8 million and $3.7 million will be used as working
capital.

Analysts polled by The Straits Times generally agreed that Delifrance's main
strength was its highly visible trade name, which bodes well for its IPO.

They were, however, split on whether the relatively steep PE ratio of 17.26
times was too high.

One analyst from a local research house said the ratio was not high compared
to other food counters like Cerebos, Fraser & Neave and QAF Ltd which were all
currently trading at more than 30 times.

Two other analysts, however, said they had expected the ratio to be closer to
15 times.

Analysts also cited as a potential downside Delifrance's exposure to price
fluctuations of wheat flour and butter, the basic ingredients of its bakery
products.

Delifrance Asia has grown considerably over the past five years. The group
reported net profits of $6.8 million on sales of $98.5 million for the year
ended June. In 1992, it recorded $1.6 million net profit on sales of $37.1
million.

Delifrance, a subsidiary of French flour miller J-L Vilgrain Group, set up
shop here in 1983. It has cafes and takeaway outlets in Asia, which make and
sell French bakery products.

This, said one analyst, was good for the group because it would enjoy lower
business costs resulting from the vertical upstream activities.

The IPO, which is lead managed and underwritten by OCBC Bank, closes on Oct 17
and trading on a "when issued" basis starts on Oct 21.

STIC to begin work on Wuxi park"s third phase by next September / Singapore
Technologies Industrial Corporation, STIC

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Tammy Tan

SINGAPORE Technologies Industrial Corp (STIC) expects to embark on the third
phase of its Wuxi-Singapore Industrial Park (WSIP) project in China by
September next year.

The next stage of development was expected to add another 100 hectares of land
to the China project, STIC executive vice-president Goh Song How said in a
recent interview.

Phase one, covering 100 hectares, was completed in June and work on the 135 ha
second phase is underway and slated for completion by next year. Mr Goh said a
team of WSIP officials had started on the master plan for phase three of the
industrial park.

"As soon as the master planning is ready, our guys can go and start marketing
it. We have already completed the preliminary master plan and will probably
finish it by early next year," he said.

WSIP, which is lead managed by STIC, has incurred a total development cost of
US$120 million (S$169 million) to date. Other stakeholders in the development
include the Wuxi government, JTC International Ltd and KMP China Investments
Pte.

Yesterday, the developers announced that 11 new tenants had been signed on.
They will invest collectively an additional US$115 million, increasing total
funding by park tenants to US$430 million. Ten of the 11 tenants will take up
land plots ranging from one to eight hectares for their plants.

The park has a total of 36 committed tenants. Of these, 17 have begun
operations, including Seagate Technology, Siemens Components and Sumitomo
Electric.

They will employ a total of 6,000 workers by the end of the year and will
account for a total production value of almost US$200 million this year.

According to Mr Goh, occupancy rates for WSIP have been good. Phase one is
almost occupied fully while the second stage is nearly 40 per cent taken up.

He said there were no plans to embark on a fourth phase of development yet,
although the consortium had an option to develop up to 1,000 hectares of land.

"It's all a question of supply and demand. We have to stagger the development
plan to meet the demand," he said.

WSIP, which is one of three overseas industrial park projects STIC is
developing, incurred a small loss in the first half of this year. It is,
however, expected to generate profits by the end of the year.

TRI pays $63m for 15% stake in US satellite firm / Technology Resources
Industries, TRI, Orbcomm Global LP

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

MALAYSIAN-LISTED Technology Resources Industries Bhd (TRI) has invested US$45
million (S$63.4 million) for a 15 per cent stake in US satellite
communications company Orbcomm Global L.P.

It has also been appointed Orbcomm's first service licensee in South-east
Asia, with rights to distribute Orbcomm services in Malaysia, Singapore and
Brunei itself or through resellers.

"Another US$7 million to US$8 million will be invested to build an Orbcomm
Gateway earth station and message processing centre in Malaysia, expected to
be completed in late 1997," TRI vice-president of new ventures Azhar Asmuni
told a news conference here.

The US$330 million Orbcomm system is the world's only operational low-earth
orbit (LEO) satellite system which enables subscribers to send and receive
short messages and identify their positions anywhere on earth at low cost,
said Orbcomm president Alan Parker.

Applications and services supported by the system include person-to-person
emergency communications, remote industrial asset and environmental
monitoring, stolen vehicle recovery, truck tracking and communications, and
two-way e-mail links through personal portable subscriber communicator units.

"Through the earth station in Malaysia, subscribers in Singapore, Malaysia and
Brunei will be able to obtain Orbcomm services in 1998," said Mr Azhar.

The Orbcomm system's two orbiting satellites serve about 350,000 subscribers
in the US with its limited communications capability, said Mr Parker.
"Real-time data communication will be available when 26 additional satellites
are launched and deployed next year."

He estimated the potential global market at 168 million subscribers, of which
one-third are in the Asia-Pacific. "For the most part, this market is unserved
or underserved by any other telecommunications technology."

Orbcomm Global L.P. is a partnership owned by Orbital Sciences Corporation in
the US, Teleglobe Inc of Canada and TRI.

Quokka subsidiary buys Southcorp"s Rheem division / Quokka Investments,
Rheem Concrete Industry Product, Cesco Australia

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Florence Chong in Sydney

A WHOLLY owned subsidiary of Australian-listed Quokka Investments -which is 47
per cent controlled by Singapore-based Zicom Pte Ltd -has acquired Rheem
Concrete Industry Product (Rheem CIP), a division of the diversified
industrial group, Southcorp Holdings Ltd.

Cesco Australia Ltd paid an undisclosed sum for the purchase of the business
in a deal finalised last Wednesday.

Rheem CIP's new owners planned to expand exports into new markets in Asia,
said the company's general manager (commercial), Mr Michael Mee.

Rheem CIP manufactures, markets and distributes transit concrete mixers under
the trade-name "Rheem-Vulcan" and "Vulcan".

More than two-thirds of its production of 900 units a year are exported
through Zicom Pte Ltd, mostly to Singapore, with some products also going to
Thailand, according to a statement by Zicom group managing director and Cesco
Australia managing director Sim Giok Lak.

"We plan to increase our exports into other Asian countries in the next two to
three years," he said.

Mr Mee said the company intended to export its concrete mixers to China early
next year. It would probably export to Malaysia and Indonesia later in the
year.

Rheem CIP plans to double production to 1,800 units a year in three years'
time. The export value of the output would be A$40 million (S$44 million). Its
current turnover is less than A$20 million a year.

Mr Sim also disclosed Zicom's plan to establish a joint venture in Malaysia
next year. The company has tie-ups in China, Thailand and Indonesia. "We plan
to assemble Vulcan transit concrete mixer in all these countries," he said.

Quokka, based in Perth, is a property and investment company with interests in
Australia and Singapore.

Its major shareholder is Zicom, which is also the company's single largest
overseas customer.

Scotts hearing told about new documents / Scotts Holdings, Scotts
Investments (Singapore) Pte Ltd

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

NEW documents have surfaced which might invalidate the transfer of listed
Scotts Holdings shares to the holding company of the controlling Jumabhoy
family, the High Court was told yesterday.

The documents show that the grandson of family patriarch Rajabali Jumabhoy was
a trustee of a settlement he had made in 1957, it was claimed at the start of
a six-week hearing of a suit filed by Mr Rajabali against three relatives and
the family holding company.

The 98-year-old Mr Rajabali is seeking to restore the benefits of his assets
to the entire family.

Mr Rajabali's lawyer Lim Chor Pee told the court that because Mr Asad
Jumabhoy, as trustee, had not executed the transfer form in respect of Scotts
Holdings shares transferred to the family company, Scotts Investments
(Singapore) Pte Ltd (SIS), the transfer was not valid.

Mr Lim said that, in fact, the trustees were not empowered to transfer Scotts
Holdings shares to SIS and their action constituted a breach of the 1957
settlement.

Earlier, lead counsel Mr Harry Wee, told Justice Judith Prakash that Mr
Rajabali was not claiming any money from the plaintiffs but that he was
seeking only to enforce the settlement made in 1957, whereby the benefits of
all his assets would go to all members of the family.

Mr Rajabali filed a suit a year ago along with his sons Yusuf and Mustafa,
daughter Perin, and grandchildren Anwar, Faez and Saleem.

The defendants are his eldest son, Mr Ameerali R. Jumabhoy, who resigned last
month as executive chairman of listed property and hospitality group Scotts
Holdings, grandsons Rafiq and Iqbal, former managing director and executive
director respectively of the company, and SIS, which owns 42.5 per cent of the
listed entity.

Mr Rajabali's main contention is that the family assets have been taken
control of by the Ameerali branch of the family.

In a day-long presentation, Mr Lim said that in 1957, Mr Rajabali made a
settlement of his property, No. 8 Scotts Road, in favour of his four children.

The object was to ensure that the property or its sale proceeds were not
distributed, but rather invested and the income accumulated for the benefit of
the beneficiaries.

The family formed Scotts Holdings Pte Ltd to develop their Scotts Road
property. The company was subsequently listed on the Stock Exchange of
Singapore.

But the Ameerali branch of the family went ahead to pledge Scotts Holdings
shares to banks to finance activities of other companies, contrary to the
intentions of Mr Rajabali, Mr Lim told the court.

At the start of the hearing yesterday, Mr Rajabali was in court along with
most of the other plaintiffs.

It has taken a battery of lawyers from Chor Pee & Company, representing the
plaintiffs; Drew & Napier, representing Ameerali and Iqbal; Allen & Gledhill,
representing Rafiq and Rajah & Tann, acting for SIS, a year to prepare for the
hearing.

Documents relating to the case run into 28 volumes.

The hearing continues today.

Issues, rather than insults, take centre stage in lively debate: "Clinton
parries Dole"s debate offensive", "Round One to Clinton-Careful, contained
and mainly cautious"and "Round One to Clinton-Critiques and the occasional
bit of wit"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lee Siew Hua in Cincinnati, Ohio

IT WAS a night of issues, not insults, as US President Bill Clinton and his
challenger, Mr Bob Dole, faced each other in a debate which was far livelier
than expected and could help tighten the race in the days before the election
next month.

The 90-minute debate brought the defining campaign issues of tax cuts and
stronger, safer families -elements of a gigantic spectrum of plans which will
affect Americans as they step gingerly into the next millennium -intimately
into the living rooms of an estimated 90 million people.

In reality, both candidates were not strikingly different on a number of
positions. Both proposed tax cuts, though in different forms and proportions.

Both emphasised education, with Mr Clinton citing his support for a
progressive array of school programmes and his rival arguing that authority
should now devolve from Washington to parents and schools. Mr Clinton, who has
shifted towards centrist politics during his presidency, has already been
tough on crime and has also sought to downsize government, both traditional
Republican concerns.

But rather than spend time on repeating those central messages, both men
sought to stress the subtle issue of trust.

Each tried to persuade voters that he could be entrusted with the major task
of building a bridge to the 21st century.

Mr Dole also sought to cast doubt on the President's trustworthiness, albeit
in a civil way and with touches of wit.

The challenger said that the President was scaring senior citizens by implying
that he would cut Medicare.

He also noted that Mr Clinton was prone to exaggerating his presidential
successes, accused the incumbent of being a closet liberal and summoned up
briefly the Whitewater spectre.

In many ways, Mr Dole relied on a highly negative strategy in the debate,
though softening this with anecdotes which attempted to show his compassion.

Mr Clinton, quick-thinking and a master of detail, sought to show that he was
a man of character who had kept his word on lifting the economy, reforming
welfare, fighting crime and other successes.

Overall, the debate was close but was more critical for Mr Dole as it had been
regarded widely as his last chance to win over undecided voters and shrink his
opponent's substantial lead, averaging 12-15 per cent since the campaign
began.

Mr Clinton shone. The challenger shone too -but partly because expectations of
him had sunk so low.

Mr Dole did manage to show during the face-off that he would make a plausible
president. But many will question if that is enough to unseat an incumbent
presiding over an economic success story in a non-war situation.

Polls suggest that most Americans have already made up their minds. Still,
swing voters will have another chance to make a side-by-side comparison during
the next debate -in San Diego on Oct 16 -which will use a cosier town-hall
format in which the incumbent excels.

How the two presidential candidates faced up to each other

US President Bill Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole drew sharp
distinctions in their appraisal of current world and national conditions on
Sunday night in the first televised debate of the 1996 campaign, outlining
different visions of the next four years.

Three polls conducted immediately after the 90-minute encounter, held in
Connecticut, showed that Mr Clinton won the debate. Here is a look at how they
performed.

HITS

* He maintained a steady critique of the President from beginning to end,
defining his challenger's posture crisply, snapping out critiques and easing
up to find the occasional bit of humour.

* His opening was more personal, designed to wipe away impressions of him as
negative or harsh, but did not lay out a vision of where he wanted to take the
country.

* He was forceful in criticising Mr Clinton's foreign policy and his record on
the economy.

* He demonstrated a mastery of the details of government that easily matched
Mr Clinton's.

* He scored several times with his humour, teasing the President about his
weight and his cholesterol and himself about his fall from a campaign platform
in California. He showed he is not just a grumpy old man, as some have said.

* Viewers also saw Mr Dole's wit -a trademark of his Senate career but rarely
seen on the 1996 campaign trail.

* He made an effort throughout the debate to portray himself as a caring,
compassionate person, whose war wounds and family poverty had made sensitive
to the needs of people with problems.

MISSES

* Democrats contended that Mr Dole's negative tone, which became more apparent
as the debate wore on, would come back to haunt him.

* He barely mentioned the economic boom that his supply-side running-mate,
Jack Kemp, contends would be set off by the Republicans' 15 per cent tax cut,
and he said little about revolutionary change in the federal tax code.

* He had trouble poking holes in Mr Clinton's economic record.

US President Bill Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole drew sharp
distinctions in their appraisal of current world and national conditions on
Sunday night in the first televised debate of the 1996 campaign, outlining
different visions of the next four years.

Three polls conducted immediately after the 90-minute encounter, held in
Connecticut, showed that Mr Clinton won the debate. Here is a look at how they
performed.

HITS

* His opening statement set the tone for much of the debate. He was upbeat and
future-oriented, claiming the nation had made progress under his leadership
and that he needed four more years to continue the job.

* He made his case calmly and with good humour, stating a credo that reflected
his rediscovered centrism of the last year or so: "I believe the purpose of
politics is to give people the tools to make the best of their own lives."

* So that he would appear more presidential, he avoided engaging his opponent
directly on most issues, preferring to state his own position without
referring directly to Mr Dole's charges.

* He kept his tongue when Mr Dole smilingly compared him to "the great
exaggerator", the senator's dead brother, Kenny. "Kenny was a great talker,
and he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate. So we had a
rule, we divided by six -in your case maybe just two."

* His style emphasised butterfly over bee, a smile over umbrage, as when he
grinned in meeting the expected assertion from Mr Dole that "liberal" is the
only accurate description of the President.

* His performance was much like his campaign has been: careful, contained and
generally cautious.

MISSES

* He had little that was fresh to offer, returning several times to the
metaphor he has ridden hard since the Democratic convention, the now-famous
"bridge to the 21st Century".

* "The President was on the defensive, and that was a strategic mistake, "
said Senator Connie Mack, Republican-Florida, one of Mr Dole's debate
advisers.

CPIB nabs two linked to Amcol"s Mauritius deal / Amcol Holdings, Sando &
Cie

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

TWO men were arrested by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB)
last week in connection with Amcol Holdings' aborted multimillion-dollar
project in Mauritius.

Both men have been released, each on bail of $500,000.

Meanwhile, Amcol, its Mauritian joint-venture partner Sando & Cie, and
Mauritian businessman Roland Maurel have entered recently into a fresh
agreement in which Mr Maurel agreed to buy out Amcol's 40 per cent stake in
the Mauritian venture.

Price Waterhouse had pointed out in its report that the company seemed to have
overpaid US$14 million (S$19.7 million) for its stake.

Over on the Indian Ocean island, the controversial project had caused a public
uproar. This led Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam to order a probe by
a high-powered fact-finding team, chaired by an influential retired Chief
Justice.

In August, Amcol's interim judicial managers had sued former Amcol executive
directors Lloyd Lochra and Ng Chee Kheong for "secret commissions and/or
bribes received in connection with Project Mauritius".

The suit was related to three separate payments of US$300,000 (about
S$423,000) by Sando & Cie, which were mentioned in a report on Amcol by Price
Waterhouse.

The interim judicial managers also obtained a court injunction to freeze the
assets worldwide of Mr Lochra, who is an American.

Easyknit falls short of issue price on market debut / Easyknit
International Holdings Ltd

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

MAINBOARD-LISTED garment exporter Easyknit International Holdings yesterday
became the second initial public offering (IPO) in the past week to close
below its issue price on its trading debut.

It ended its first day of trading at HK$2.90, 15 HK cents below its HK$3.05
issue price.

Easyknit's share price dipped to as low as HK$2.60 in intra-day trading, with
a total of 1.75 million shares changing hands.

Last Friday, another mainboard debutante, frozen seafood producer Pacific
Andes (Holdings), had closed 3.5 US cents below its offer price of 57 US cents
on its first trading day.

A dealer attributed the poor performance of the Hongkong-based garment maker
and exporter to the fact that "Singapore is simply not the choice market at
the moment".

Furthermore, said another dealer, the stock market was averse to foreign
currency-denominated listings, preferring instead to stick to Singapore-dollar
counters.

Besides closing below its issue price, the public tranche of Easyknit's IPO
was 70 per cent undersubscribed at its close last Monday.

However, all 25 million placement shares offered were taken up.

Easyknit's IPO fared worse than the only other undersubscribed offering this
year. Home decor distributor Roly International Holdings' IPO in February was
14 per cent undersubscribed.

A dealer said the subscription rate could be poor because Easyknit's offer
period was too short. The offering, which was launched on Sept 27, closed on
Oct 1.

Dow breaches 6,000 for first time in early trading: "Overseas funds pour
into Hongkong bourse" and "Bourse fails torally on back of Wall Street
gains"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

NEW York stocks surged in early trading yesterday, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average breaking the 6,000-point barrier for the first time.

It reached a high of 6,002.17 within the first hour.

Meanwhile, Asian bourses closed mixed yesterday, following a strong rally on
Wall Street last Friday as fears of higher interest rates subsided.

A surprisingly weak US September jobs report, released last Friday, quelled
concerns of rising interest rates, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average up
60.01 points to a record close of 5,992.86.

The Hongkong stock market was one of the main beneficiaries of the Wall Street
gains.

The Hang Seng Index surged yesterday to record its biggest point gain since
March as new records on Wall Street and strong interest in China counters
spurred active buying.

The market barometer jumped 227.56 points to 12,133.07. It now lies just 68
points short of its record close of 12,201.09, which was reached on Jan 4,
1994.

Australian stocks also climbed, led by media group News Corp and banks, thanks
to Australian bond yields falling to 2-1/2-year lows and the rally in US
stocks.

The benchmark All-Ordinaries Index rose 24.3 points to 2,339.8, a shade below
its all-time closing high of 2,340.6 in February 1994.

Markets elsewhere in Asia, however, fell despite the sharp gains in New York.

In Singapore, poor sentiment coupled with sustained underweighting activity
led the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index to fall 22.2 points to
2,126.66.

Across the Causeway, the benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index shed 1.68
points to 1148.50, while the Second Board index fell 12.27 points, or 2.1 per
cent, to 558.97.

Indonesian stocks also declined, dragged lower by a 6 per cent drop in
cigarette maker PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna on concerns about its US$400
million (S$564 million) borrowings.

The benchmark Jakarta Stock Composite Index slipped 2.03 points to 586.31.

Likewise in Manila, Philippine stocks sank as some foreign funds off-loaded
property counters on concern that the market was becoming saturated.

The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 10.11 points to
3,121.03.

Thai stocks were battered, plunging a sharp 6 per cent at the close of
trading.

Big banks led the decline amid concern that annual economic growth of 8 per
cent was a thing of the past, analysts said.

The Stock Exchange of Thailand Index finished down 60.26 points at 944.63.
This was its lowest level since August 1993.

Property buyers becoming highly price-sensitive : Analysts

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kalpana Rashiwala

Government curbs "effective in pushing speculators out of market'

PROPERTIES launched in recent weeks appear to have enjoyed reasonable success,
particularly those priced competitively, say analysts.

One of the most successful developments is Wing Tai's Sunrise Gardens off Yio
Chu Kang Road. The 99-year project, with 252 condominium units, is about 65
per cent sold three weeks after its launch in mid-September.

Analysts credited its success primarily to its attractive average net price of
$580 psf. Some market watchers had feared earlier that the project's 99-year
leasehold status and its location in an outlying area might impede sales.

One market watcher noted that in contrast, Villa Azura was less than half sold
although it was a freehold property in the prime Bukit Timah belt. Villa
Azura's net average price is $1,150 psf.

"Buyers have become extremely price-sensitive," said UBS Securities senior
research analyst Soon Ching Voon. "In the past, people were more willing to
pay whatever price was asked as long as the project was freehold and had a
good location. This is no longer true."

He said the May 15 property curbs had removed speculators from the market.
"These people did not care about pricing. As long as the location was good and
the project was freehold, they knew there would be buyers, so they could churn
the property. Now the market is left with genuine buyers who know what they
can afford to pay every month."

Other recent launches which have fared well include Pidemco's Hillbrooks
condominium, launched a week ago.

Eighty-four of the 120 units in the 299-unit project offered in the first
phase have been sold. The units are priced at $700 psf -lower than the
$730-750 psf for two earlier projects nearby, The Amston and Merawoods.

Ballota Park is also doing well, with 161 units of the 215 units launched
taken up already. Far East Organization's Sherwood, selling at $800 psf, is
about 75 per cent sold.

Edmund Tie and Co executive director Ong Choon Fah expects developers to
continue pricing their projects "realistically", in view of the "current
market sentiment".

About 1,600 private housing units have been launched since Sept 1, increasing
the total marketed so far this year to about 8,680 units, according to ET & Co
figures.

Mrs Ong said another 4,000 units may be launched before the year is out,
taking the fullyear figure to 12,680 -higher than about 10,000 units marketed
last year.

However, the level of actual supply would depend on a few factors, like
developers securing the necessary approvals to launch the projects, she said.

With most developers, particularly those with larger projects, seeking to sell
their properties in phases, there may be some overflow in the early part of
next year.

With showflats playing an increasingly important role in the marketing of
projects, developers may wait for their showflats to be completed before
launching their projects.

"And if by the time this is done, it is approaching the Christmas season with
many people away, developers may want to hold back the launch," she said.

Projects slated for launch include the 655-unit Guilin View at Bukit Batok,
the 384-unit Trellis Park at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh and the final 110 units at
Ardmore Park.

On the pricing of upcoming launches, Mr Soon said: "Developers will still try
to maintain their original (pre-speculation curbs) asking prices or cut them
by about 10 per cent.

"So far we have not seen developers undercutting each other, although
Pidemco's $700 psf pricing for Hillbrooks raised concern among some
competitors.

"This is clearly a buyer's market. Buyers can afford to do their sums, to see
which projects they can afford ... and with more supply coming on, that's good
news for home buyers."

Doing the sums on Tampines Finance Park  - Will banks be sold on relocating
their operations?

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lynn Seah

The buildings are coming up fast at Singapore's first finance park in
Tampines. The biggest leaseholder, Singapore Land, will have its Tampines
Junction office ready next March, but so far, there have been no takers. LYNN
SEAH checks out the prospects for the finance park, on Page Two.

DOING THE SUMS ON TAMPINES FINANCE PARK

IT IS lunch hour. Briefcase-toting executive types cram the eating places. It
looks like Raffles Place, but wait, why are there so many grandmothers with
toddlers in tow, and children in school uniforms?

But then this is a vision not of Raffles Place, but of Tampines in the future,
when its Finance Park is fully developed.

The park, which was mooted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the
Economic Development Board, is to be a key financial centre outside the
Central Business District. The Government wants to encourage banks and
finance-related businesses to re-locate backroom operations there.

Six parcels of land totalling 1.94 ha in Tampines Regional Centre have been
tendered out by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) in 1994 and last year
for the development of the park. One condition was that developers must house
finance-related operations on at least 70 per cent of the floor space.

Singapore Land's Tampines Junction will be one of the first developments to be
completed next March. The company is negotiating with some financial
institutions, but no tenants have been confirmed yet for the nine-storey
building.

Besides SingLand, which clinched three of the six plots through wholly-owned
Shenton Holdings, the other successful bidders were Tat Lee Bank, Overseas
Union Bank and NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative.

They will not be the first to bring financial institutions into Tampines,
however.

DBS Bank moved some operations to Tampines as far back as 1993. Its
autobanking centre, data centre, as well as administration, audit, human
resource and training functions are now housed in DBS Tampines Centre, an
office and shopping complex.

Standard Chartered has also moved some of its operations, now housed in the
CPF Tampines building.

However, Tampines Junction and the other SingLand developments are unique in
that they will not be owner-occupied. The developers of the other plots are
all finance-related businesses.

To fill the approximately 15,000 sq m of net floor space in Tampines Junction,
SingLand is targeting multinational financial institutions which are heavy
users of space, but do not need much face-to-face interaction with customers.

"We are looking especially at those involved in international and regional
trade financing because most of the transactions are done through computers,"
said Mr Anthony Sim, SingLand's general manager for marketing.

To the smaller users of space who will reap less in terms of rental savings,
SingLand is trying to sell another idea -that of the benefits of having a full
back-up service in a different place.

"There is a trend now for banks to have a back-up office somewhere else, just
in case the computer in the main branch fails to deliver," he said.

So Tampines Junction offers features such as a back-up generator with enough
capacity to power the air-conditioning and computers in the building if there
is a power failure.

In its marketing efforts, SingLand is trying to encourage its potential
tenants to take a long view when deciding whether to re-locate.

"The selling point is actually mid-term savings. For multinatinal banks, who
occupy a number of floors, the saving over five to 10 years is substantial,"
said Mr Sim.

Monetary savings aside, companies have other concerns about moving, in
particular staff resistance.

LAST year, a survey by property consultant Knight Frank and a former National
University of Singapore academic showed that only 3.8 per cent of 158
respondents located in the CBD said they would move out in the immediate
future. Respondents included financial institutions. Of those considering
decentralising, about 60 per cent said they preferred fringe areas such as
Marina Bay.

Concerns about decentralisation centred on the fear of damage to business
contacts due to "inappropriate location" and loss of the prestige attached to
central addresses.

Apart from Tampines Junction, Singland has two eight-storey office buildings,
Tampines Plaza I & II, to be completed in 1998.

Tat Lee Bank's eight-storey TLB Tampines Centre will be completed in mid-1997,
but will be fully owner-occupied. Tat Lee will house backroom operations,
recreational facilites for staff and a banking branch.

NTUC Income plans to use 30 per cent of the space in its nine-storey Tampines
Point for its own operations.

The other leaseholder, OUB, declined to reveal its plans.

Whether or not more sites in Tampines Regional Centre will be offered for
finance-park development has not been decided, says the HDB.

Keppel Bank is actively exploring the possibility of moving to the suburbs,
but the cost has to be right, says a spokesman.

The success of Tampines Finance Park will hinge on rents being attractive
enough. "Rental differentials have to be substantial to make it worthwhile for
a company to locate there," said Ms Angela Tan, executive director with
property consultant Edmund Tie & Company.

Top office rents in the CBD are $9 to $10 per sq ft. Suburban rents are $4 to
$6. SingLand's asking rental is about $6.

SingLand explains that its rentals are high for suburban properties because
the offices are as good as those in the CBD. The cost of Tampines Junction,
including land cost, is more than $100 million.

There is market talk that the developer may think of selling instead of
renting but Life! could not get a comment from SingLand by press time. One
property consultant felt the asking rent was unrealistic. "This is a new
market. You cannot ask what you want. You have to sell the idea," he said.

Consultants also point out that there are ample alternative locations for
financial institutions if rentals in Tampines are unattractive.

There is the fringe, the Marina Bay area where rents of $6.50 to $7.50 per sq
ft compare favourably with those of the suburbs. The upcoming developments in
River Valley -Great World City, UE Square, Valley Point -will also be
competing with Tampines for tenants.

Property consultants generally feel that for the Finance Park to take off, the
gap between the rents there and those in the fringe locations will have to be
widened.

"Perhaps the Government can offer some kind of incentive, like rental
subsidies, to help the landlords attract tenants," said Ms Lynette Leong,
associate director at Jones Lang Wootton.

BUT there is no question that the concept of a finance park is a good one
which banks can benefit from.

Mr Christopher Fossick, Richard Ellis' executive director for commercial
leasing, said: "I think what is going to happen is that a few significant
leases will be concluded, a critical mass will start forming and the idea of
going to Tampines will become more acceptable to banks and their employees."

The pool of potential tenants for the park is also growing as more and more
foreign banks are using Singapore as a base, he adds.

Besides, Tampines has a lot going for it -good transport and a good range of
eating, shopping, entertainment and other service outlets. These count towards
making re-location less painful for staff.

Tampines is being built up as Singapore's eastern hub with facilities such as
offices and shopping complexes which will offer a range of jobs. There are
plans to boost the commercial space at Tampines Regional Centre around the
Tampines MRT Station, now amounting to about 243,000 sq m, by another 79,000
sq m. Some 176,800 people live in Tampines now.

When DBS Bank made its move three years ago, the matter of some staff having
to travel further from home to office was anticipated. It was resolved by
tranferring those who did not mind working in Tampines to the new offices and
redeploying the rest elsewhere. People living around Tampines were also
recruited for the new offices.

Has the move been worthwhile? "The savings in rental far exceeds any
additional expenses," said a spokesman.

Will enough financial institutions feel the same way? There will be quite a
bit of space coming up in the park.

Two men, their friendship and passion for science: Computer science and
biology make good bedfellows

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lea Wee

Childhood buddies Tan Tin Wee and S. Subbiah learnt the importance of science
in school and have now joined forces to run the new Bioinformatics Centre here

TWO old friends are charting new courses in the use of computer science in
biological research and the development of drugs here.

Dr Tan Tin Wee and Dr S. Subbiah -classmates since Primary 2 -played key roles
in setting up the Bioinformatics Centre at the National University of
Singapore, one of the few such centres in the world.

The two are naturally excited about their project, which held its inaugural
symposium last week.

The centre plans to help biologists and drug companies analyse and manage the
huge amount of genetic data which has been churned out at a fantastic rate in
recent years.

Its development grew out of a friendship bound in great part by a deep passion
for science.

Says Dr Tan, 34, the centre's acting director: "One of the things we learnt in
school is the importance of being creative in science, and not to be afraid to
try out new things."

Try out new things they certainly did.

In a science project at Anglo-Chinese Junior College, they joined forces with
two other students to show that human hair can be turned into food products.

Chuckling, Dr Subbiah, 35, the centre's director for research, recalls: "We
went to barber shops, told them we were doing some science project and grabbed
the hair off the floor."

The collected hair was then boiled and stewed for two days in "various nasty
chemicals".

Says Dr Subbiah: "We did not understand exactly how the whole thing worked.
All we knew was that we wanted to boil the strands of hair into its basic
building blocks, which are amino acids."

They showed that boiled hair can be used as plastic, glue, plant fertilisers
and animal feed.

The project, called The Possible Uses And Applications Of Human Hair Keratin,
won them first prize in the pre-university chemistry section for the Science
Fair Project in 1978.

They also produced a science documentary, which won the Best Production award
in the Innovators '79 TV series.

"We had a great time catching on camera how animals such as pigs, chickens and
sea urchins do it," recalls Dr Subbiah with a grin.

After junior college, the two friends went off down separate paths. Dr Tan
served his national service and later read natural sciences at Cambridge
University.

Dr Subbiah went to do mathematical physics in the Imperial College of London.

But they kept in touch and did not forget what they were taught in school.

Dr Subbiah, after deciding that the job opportunities for a degree in
mathematical physics were "not too great", went on to pursue a doctorate in
structural biology at Harvard University.

"But I hated it," he says, grimacing at the memory.

He decided to try something more theoretical and took a postdoctoral degree in
biocomputing at Stanford University.

It was the right decision. He went on to file a few patents and co-founded a
biotechnology software company in the United States.

Today, he does research at Wistar Institute at the University of Pennsylvania,
one of the foremost centres for bioinformatics.

Meanwhile, after getting his degree, Dr Tan went on a masters degree in
biotechnology at University College London and later a doctorate at Edinburgh
University.

As part of his doctorate, he produced a genetically-engineered animal vaccine,
which won the young researcher the United Kingdom's Vaccine Research Trust's
Annual Prize in 1989.

A year later, he returned to join the National University of Singapore's
biochemistry department as a lecturer. Outside his working hours, he continued
to pursue his interest in biocomputing with the help of the Computer Centre at
the NUS.

Dr Tan was also instrumental in introducing biocomputing as an elective for
biochemistry honours course in 1991.

His work in Internet biomedical databases won him the prestigious Gold Medal
awarded by the Council of the World Congress for Medical Informatics in 1992
and the Singapore Youth Award in 1994.

In 1994, he donned another hat, heading the Technet unit, the first local
Internet service for research and development and took it to privatisation in
1995.

This later became the Pacific Internet.

As early as 1991, Dr Tan and Dr Subbiah were already talking about introducing
bioinformatics in Singapore.

With the encouragement of the latter, Dr Tan proposed to incorporate
biocomputing as part of the Bioscience Centre. But this was dropped because of
budget constraints. Says Dr Tan: "At that time, we commiserated with each
other but continued to float the idea to various funding bodies."

One of these was the Economic Development Board.

Their persistence paid off. Last year, the EDB agreed to pump $6 million to
set up of a Bioinformatics Centre at the NUS.

Says Dr Subbiah: "It is really exciting to be working in such a field, the
opportunities are tremendous."

Both credit their success today to their teachers at Anglo-Chinese Secondary
and ACJC.

Says Dr Tan: "I remembered that before I left ACS, my principal wrote in my
testimonial that I would succeed in whatever I chose to do. His confidence in
students was shared by the teachers.

"This confidence has become a virtuous cycle, a self-fulfilling prophecy."

Computer science and biology make good bedfellows: Two men, their
friendship and passion for science

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

IT MAY seem ironic that many of the staff at the newly-opened Bioinformatics
Centre at the National University of Singapore are not trained specifically in
bioinformatics.

Instead, they are either biologists who have picked up computer science or
computer scientists who have learnt biology.

For bioinformatics, which marries biology with computer science, is still a
relatively new discipline, explains the centre's acting director, Dr Tan Tin
Wee.

But it is beginning to be recognised slowly as a discipline in universities
around the world. In Singapore, it was introduced as an elective for
biochemistry honours students at the National University of Singapore in 1991.

Says Dr Tan: "There is an increasing demand for people who are adept at both
computer science and biology."

This is largely because of the explosive growth of genetic data generated by
the Human Genome Project which began in 1991.

The ultimate aim of this global collaboration is to identify and analyse all
the three billion "letters" in a person's genetic make-up -known collectively
as the human genome -by the year 2002.

Biomedical researchers hope the analysed data can identify new genes which may
help in curing genetic diseases. Meanwhile, drug companies hope this
information can help them discover and develop new drugs.

But the biological information is being generated at a far faster rate than it
can be analysed.

Dr Tan points out, for instance, that the process of identifying DNA
sequencing has reached an industrial scale today -about 10 million DNA
sequences are being churned out each week.

Flooded with this huge amount of genetic data, biologists and drug companies
alike are clamouring for people trained in both biology and computer science
to help them retrieve and analyse the data.

The resource unit at the Bioinformatics Centre, located at the NUS Computer
Centre, hopes to create a manpower pool to provide training. It also hopes to
provide facilities to assist biologists with their computational needs and
provide access to databases.

Equally important is the need to carry out more basic research and
development, says Dr Tan.

The centre has a research unit located at the Institute of Systems Science.

Its flagship project, spearheaded by the ISS and in collaboration with the
University of Pennsylvania, one of the foremost centres for bioinformatics, is
BioKleisli.

This is a sophisticated system which pulls relevant information from various
databases, integrates, crunches and analyses them, before giving them back to
the user

Heading the project team is its inventor, Dr Wong Lim Soon, from the ISS, a
Lee Kuan Yew Fellowship holder.

Says Dr Tan: "At present, the other available tools are not so sophisticated
and fast. They can pull information only from specific databases."

To maintain the integrity of the information, the system will build another
layer to help resolve any conflicts found within it.

Right now, the centre is negotiating with at least two pharmaceutical giants
to test the system on their network and to collaborate on projects. It is also
conducting the virtual cell project. It represents biological knowledge in a
virtual reality manner.

Says Dr Tan: "At the click of a button, a person can navigate through a cell
and access information on the part of the cell he is interested in. He can
also get related information and communicate with people who are doing
research in this particular part of the cell."

This project will eventually merge with the BioKleisli Project.

Two art auctions rake in $10 m and record prices

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Claudette Peralta

ART lovers and investors apparently worked up quite a thirst pouring money
into paintings from South-east Asia over the weekend.

One bidder also uncorked $38,500 from his bank account for a lot of wines.

The world's two major auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's, raked in
combined sales of nearly $10 million. More than 800 people attended the
events.

By far the biggest chunk of money went for a piece by the German painter who
lived and worked in Bali, Walter Spies. His View Across the Sawahs To Gunung
Agung alone fetched $1,048,750.

That was more than twice the original estimate of between $500,000 and
$700,000. It was sold on Sunday at the Christie's auction at the Hyatt Regency
Hotel which grossed a total of about $5.5 million in sales.

Other paintings fetched prices three to six times higher than their estimates.

These included A Pasar by Singaporean artist Lee Man Fong which went for
$146,750 against the original estimate of $25,000 to $35,000.

Filipino artist Fernando Cueto Amorsolo's In the Shade Of A Mango Tree sold
for $119,250, well above the original estimate of $20,000 to $30,000.

Kampong Tafereeltje by the Dutch painter Gerard Pieter Adolfs was estimated to
be worth $6,000 to $8,000 but sold for $19,550.

Sotheby's debut sale in Singapore grossed a total of S$3,803,350. It sold
almost 80 per cent of the lots offered.

A painting by A.J. Le Mayeur, Three Women Weaving in the Garden, fetched
$333,750 against the original estimate of between $120,000 and $150,000.

The Sotheby's auction, held at the Raffles Hotel Ballroom on Saturday, also
saw a few world auction record prices for works by some artists. One of them
was Hendra Gunawan, whose Women At A Waterfall was sold for $245,750.

Other records were chalked up by Emil Rizek and Widayat. Rizek's Cockfight In
Bali was sold for $141,250, while the latter's Manula Jogging Dikejar Anjing
went for $93,950.

The lots which did not meet the organiser's expectations was a work by
Singaporean artist Liu Kang titled Offerings and the work of Filipino artist
Juan Luna. These were not sold.

The sales included takings from the auction of South-east Asian paintings,
Straits Chinese works of art and the auction of fine and rare wines.

One happy bidder walked off with a Chateau Le Pin superlot of wines selected
from the 1985, 1986 and 1988 to 1994 vintages. These were sold collectively
for $38,500.

Another highlight was the sale of a very rare famille rose coral-red-ground
"in and out" Kamcheng and cover, originally priced at $18,000 to $25,000,
which sold for $27,600.

Mr Quek Chin Yeow, director of Sotheby's, Asia, noted that Singaporean,
Filipino and Vietnamese artists generally performed well.

But Indonesian art, both by native and foreign artists, were the star
performers and paintings with Balinese themes or subject matter found wide
appeal among buyers.

Ovarian cancer girl may miss umrah

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Tuminah Sapawi

OVARIAN cancer patient Nur Atiiqah Johari, who is due to perform the umrah
(minor pilgrimage) this month, may have to forgo the trip because of her
deteriorating condition.

The nine-year-old girl's doctor, Dr Allen Yeoh, a child cancer specialist at
the National University Hospital (NUH), told Life! that her condition is not
stable and she is unfit to travel.

"She is in great pain and right now, what is good for her is rest -she needs
all the rest she can get," said Dr Yeoh, who declined to reveal more about her
condition.

Nur Atiiqah was hospitalised about two weeks ago at NUH and is still being
treated there.

On learning of her condition, Syakira Travel & Tours, which is sponsoring her
trip, has decided to offer a cash donation of $4,600 instead. This is the cost
of a 12-day umrah package for two adults and one child.

Late last month, the travel agent had agreed to sponsor Nur Atiiqah's parents
for the trip as well.

Said Syakira's managing director Ismail Angullia: "There were two things which
we considered when we heard of her present condition. We could either postpone
the trip until she gets better or we could give her cash instead.

"We chose the latter because we think the family needs all the financial
assistance they could get."

Nur Atiiqah's parents, Mr Johari Simum, 48, and Madam Sariah Samuh, 40, were
too distraught to speak to the press.

Mr Johari is a Malaysian who works there, and he visits the family from time
to time. Madam Sariah is a production operator.

Nur Atiiqah is the third of their five children. The others are Siti Sholeha,
14, Mohamed Hasbullah, 10, Ibrahim Abdul Karim, six, and Mohamed Adam, four.

The girl, who was diagnosed with cancer in March this year, has had both her
ovaries removed and undergone chemotherapy.

Ovarian cancer is more common among older women although the chances of a
young girl getting it are one in 100,000 a year.

Nur Atiiqah stopped attending school when she began chemotherapy treatment in
the middle of this year. Her weight has also dropped from 35 kg to 25 kg.

In an earlier interview with the Malay-language daily Berita Harian, Madam
Sariah said her daughter can walk but is very weak.

Day when two Japanese bombs fell

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Wong Chee Meng

SPEAK MANDARIN CAMPAIGN 

THE reason Mr Teong Ah Chin remains a member of the Singapore Civil Defence
Force even at the age of 80 lies in his personal experiences during the
Japanese Occupation of Singapore.

The sprightly restaurant helper was then a patriotic young man selling flowers
in the streets to raise funds for China's anti-Japanese resistance forces.

One day, he was in the vicinity of the now-defunct New World at Jalan Besar
when a Japanese bomber swooped past him suddenly and dropped two bombs as he
ran for cover.

"One of them landed where Sim Lim Tower stands today, and the other at Jalan
Pisang where the coffeeshop belonging to my brother's father-in-law was," he
recalled.

"When I reached there, the coffeeshop was already reduced to rubble. I had to
remove the debris to rescue my brother."

Mr Teong recounted this experience at a Mandarin storytelling competition,
titled An Experience In Emergency, last Sunday.

The contest, organised by the Civil Defence Association for NS (CDANS), Lianhe
Wanbao, Shin Min Daily News and 95.8 FM as part of the current Speak Mandarin
Campaign, was held at the CDANS Town Clubhouse in Marina Square.

It attracted 35 participants, ranging in age from 15 to 80. About four of them
related historical happenings, including the times when floods and racial
riots gripped Singapore, while others told of personal tragedies resulting
from traffic accidents or factory mishaps.

Businessman Tan Jack Kwang, 37, remembered one weekend in 1978 when torrential
rains caused one of the worst floods on the island.

"The roads in Punggol and Potong Pasir disappeared under a sea of water.
Chickens, ducks, cows, dogs and even crocodiles were seen floating
everywhere."

He was then a national servicemen and, together with his colleagues, they took
out boats to rescue the stranded residents.

Painting sub-contractor Ho Kim Sian, 49, remembered the racial riots in 1964.

For hours, he could not leave his workplace because of the curfew.

Finally, on his way home, he saw a Chinese couple pleading in vain with
rioters not to burn their motorcycle.

"During the racial riots, tension ran high. I could feel every minute and
second ticking away," he said. "It just doesn't make sense for people to use
violence on each other."

Equally instructive were the personal tales.

System analyst Au Yong Keok, 35, shared a tragic incident close to her heart.

"My cousin's 30th death anniversary was just a few days ago, and I still
cannot forgive myself for having caused his death.

"I was five or six then and my cousin was nine years older. He had made me a
kite, and we were flying it when the string snapped and the kite flew to the
road. I bawled so loudly that he was forced to retrieve it for me.

"The next thing I knew, he was hit by a car. When I ran to the road, I saw a
pool of blood. The next day, I heard he had died. I cried."

Like Mr Ho, Mr Tan and most other participants, Ms Au Yong was
Chinese-educated and had taken part in several storytelling contests.

Mr Teong, too, was not a newcomer to such competitions, but he did not have a
formal Chinese education and learnt to speak Mandarin when he was in his 20s.

"I am a Fuzhou and I learnt Mandarin in a night school when I was 23," he
said. "I decided to pick up the language because it was fashionable to
converse in Mandarin then. Besides, we had to sing in Mandarin as part of our
fund-raising activities."

Generally, the contestants spoke in simple Mandarin, peppering their delivery
with an idiom every now and then.

Twelve were chosen for the finals to be held at the World Trade Centre Expo
Gateway on Oct 20.

The top three winners will take home $500, $400 and $300 respectively. The
fourth and fifth winners will receive $200 each and the rest $100 each. In
addition, all finalists will receive a trophy.

Sheer joy with Bartok showpiece

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Terence Dawson

Music

SINGAPORE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Victoria Concert Hall Friday

THERE are three ways of responding to adversity: one can succumb to it, one
can defy it, or one can seize it as an opportunity to discover new things
about oneself.

Shaken by ill-health and the outbreak of World War II, Bartok had emigrated to
the United States. He was suffering from deep depression when the conductor
Koussevitsky commissioned him to write a work for the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.

The result was the Concerto For Orchestra, possibly the most accessible of his
works because it gives such important parts to every section of the orchestra.

It is often admired as a showpiece, but it is much more, representing one of
the most impressive responses to adversity ever written: the transformation of
personality not into self-indulgent expressionism, but joyful affirmation.

On Friday, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra under Choo Hoey gave it a
memorable reading. Having performed it on the European tour in 1988, and again
in 1991, it is a work it knows well. But since then, the orchestra has greatly
improved.

From the first shimmering of the violins against the steady cellos, every
section rose to its respective challenge, with the strings milking the music
for all its Hungarian resonance and the glowing brass in particularly fine
form.

The whimsical East-European cartoon-humour of the second movement was
complemented by a moving account of the scrupulously understated Elegy. The
ebullient humour of the Intermezzo was followed by a thrilling performance of
the alternately tender and joyful Finale.

The performance of Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto, for which Choo Hoey opted
for a medium-sized orchestra, was equally impressive. The soloist was Kun Woo
Paik, a Korean now living in Paris. He is one of those relatively rare
pianists prepared to take risks, to experiment with possibilities rather than
reproduce what the audience have come to hear.

From the electrifying energy of his first entry to his gnomic cadenza, he kept
one transfixed. Instead of the usual hymn-like melody of the Adagio, he
emphasised the pathos of its insecure yearning: unstable and tender, but not
cloying. The last dying strain before the final chords was pure magic.

The evening also included the Overture to Schumann's rarely-performed opera
Genoveva. The SSO gave a splendid account of the tumultuous passions of the
three characters on which it was based, with the work building up to a
magnificent climax.

Souls in containers teem with secret lives

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Susie Wong

Art

DORRIT YACOBY: VESSELS OF THE SOUL By Dorrit Yacoby At Notices The Gallery
Till Oct 26

ONE is introduced to art that lies on the edge between conscious sanity and
unconscious dreams in Dorrit Yacoby's works.

The 70-plus assemblages, which are the accumulated debris of her life, are
wrought with images of long-limbed women flying or raising their arms in
salute or despair, or in an embrace of the vessel.

Here, the vessel is one's heart, the container that may be filled with
purifying water for one's rebirth.

The theme of despair and rejuvenation is inherent in this series of works
which is, for the Israeli-Canadian, who has lived all her life in Israel, a
slow process that embodies her own rejuvenation.

"When I do the paintings, I heal myself," explains the 44-year-old whose works
were exhibited earlier this year in Beijing, Japan and Bangkok, and will
continue its tour from Singapore to India, Vietnam and Australia.

Each work lies in a roughly-made "container" itself. Within it, the works teem
with life through the heavily pock-marked and textured surfaces, created from
sawdust and objects such as shards of glass or porcelain, pomegranates, or
something as personal as her son's shoelace or a rope belonging to her
daughter.

The objects, culled into the space within the frame, carry within them a
secret life.

As artist Kandinsky once wrote: "Everything that is dead quivers. Not only the
things of poetry, stars, moon, wood, flowers, but even a white trouser button
glittering out of a puddle in the street ... Everything has a secret soul,
which is silent more often than it speaks."

The superimposed images of stars, ribbons, candles, vessels and women lend to
the coherence of that life; the works metamorphosise even as they hang there,
drowned in and besieged by the tar that Yacoby has poured into the container.

This struggle between the tar and the objects for "life" matches Yacoby's
constant discovery and confirmation of symbolic meanings.

Having studied Jewish mysticism, she has been surprised at how her
self-created tales parallel folk-myths. For instance, the flying woman she
depicts in The Flying Woman and Golden Tree With Flying Souls, is symbolic of
freedom. In mythology or folklore, a woman who had been fed with stones still
has the ability to "fly".

Overall, this exhibition is about the artist who, despite living in near
isolation, surrounded by the desert on three sides and a neighbourhood street
on the other, has the ability to "fly".

Yet the profundity of her work speaks not only of the individual but also of
the universal as it resonates within those of us who dare to look on when
someone peels back the layer that covers the soul.

Jackson"s concert aims to make HIStory here: "Tickets selling well" and
"Selangor bans concert by Michael Jackson"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Rebecca Lim

With the logistics, nine shows can be put up in Singapore Indoor Stadium, says
production manager

THE Michael Jackson HIStory show, to be held at the National Stadium two weeks
from now, promises to make history here as the biggest pop concert ever.

It would be even bigger than the two staged by the self-proclaimed King of Pop
when he was here three years ago on his Dangerous tour, says Mr Peter Loh,
production manager for the HIStory concerts in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.

Those previous concerts were, by far, the largest among pop concerts to have
been staged here, says Mr Loh, who also worked on them. But the current show
looks set to dwarf them.

"With the logistics for the HIStory concert, you can put up nine shows in the
Singapore Indoor Stadium," he adds. For example, five generators are being
shipped in to churn up 8,400 amperes of electricity needed to power the
one-night show.

"The last time, the power generated was comparable to what was needed to light
up Ang Mo Kio," he says. "This time, we are using one more generator -enough
to light up another row of houses next to Ang Mo Kio."

Some 500 tonnes of equipment and props, including 160 tonnes of steel for the
structure of the stage, will be shipped and flown here.

It seems Jackson will cart in his own kitchen and air-conditioners to be put
on stage to cool him down as he goes about his sizzling dance numbers.

Over here, Mr Loh has to look for a host of equipment and material, including
toilets, about 12,000 chairs and 36,000 sq ft of plywood.

It will take almost a week to prepare for the concert, he adds.

Work will begin on the Sunday before the concert on Oct 25, and a crane will
have to be moved into the stadium for the process.

Mr Loh will be helped by 800 crew members, who will be working 10 hours each
over that period of time.

On the day of the concert, 170 security men, 170 ticket collectors and 160
ushers will be employed to ensure that things run smoothly when the expected
crowd of 36,000 turns up.

As a result of all the effort and the staggering logistics, the audience can
expect to see a lot of visual effects using video, virtual reality, lights and
spectacular pyrotechnics, says Lushington Entertainments director Michael
Roche, who watched the MJ concerts in Amsterdam last week.

His company is promoting the HIStory concerts here and in Kuala Lumpur.

"The consensus among those who saw it is that it is a much slicker show with a
lot more drama," he says.

"He only broke down to cry once," he adds.

He observes that Jackson seemed "much more at ease" and was "having fun and
enjoying himself on stage".

Without revealing too much that will spoil the surprises, he says fans should
watch the guitarist closely and look out for some surprises when Jackson
performs Beat It.

He adds that there will also be a 60-minute countdown before the start of the
concert. Fans can look forward to fancy footwork from Jackson and his eight
dancers.

One can also expect some splitting images with the use of a big screen that
has a tracking system, called the Jumbotron, adds Mr Loh, who also went to the
concerts in Amsterdam.

"There is a lot of work which goes into ensuring that the images are aligned
perfectly," he says.

The opening sequence, which has been described in reviews on the Internet,
uses a virtual reality film footage and has MJ bursting onto stage amidst much
pomp and pageantry in a gold spacesuit.

Says Mr Roche: "I have been following concerts since I was eight or nine years
old, and I still think there is something about Michael Jackson. His stage
presence is unbelievable."

Tickets selling well: Jackson"s concert aims to make HIStory here

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

ABOUT 4,300 tickets priced at $200 for the Michael Jackson HIStory concert
have been sold out.

Certainly, Jacko's much-maligned reputation, with the reports of sex abuse of
children, has not had an effect on ticket sales.

Concert promoters Lushington Entertainments say only limited tickets are
available from the Overseas Union Bank, which has priority booking for its
card members.

The majority of the $200 tickets for seats in front of the stage went on sale
to the public on Sept 27. Those were sold out in two days.

Tickets priced at $125, which are for seats in the sheltered grandstand are
also "moving fast". Also popular are the $55 tickets for the free-seating
section in the gallery.

Show promoters say tickets are also selling well to Jackson fans from the
region. One fan flew here from Indonesia to buy 100 tickets for friends and
family members.

Tickets at $55, $125 and $160 are available from Sistic outlets. OUB card
members are encouraged to call the Sistic hotline on 348-5555 soon for
preferred seats.

PRESIDENT ERNESTO ZEDILLO ANNOUNCES
CONTROVERSIAL CABINET CHANGES

    On Dec. 29, President Ernesto Zedillo announced the fifth
cabinet reshuffle of his short tenure in office.  Among the
changes is a controversial decision to appoint Arsenio Farell
Cubillas--a close ally of former president Carlos Salinas de
Gortari--to head the comptroller's office (Secretaria de la
Controlaria Nacional de la Federacion y Administracion,
Secodam).
    Farell replaced Norma Samaniego, who was in the midst of
an investigation into the financial affairs of Raul Salinas de
Gortari, the brother of ex-president Salinas.  Raul Salinas is
accused of using high-level positions in government to
illegally amass US$100 million in secret bank accounts in
Switzerland and other countries in Europe and the Americas.
Some of the allegations also tie Raul Salinas to prominent
Mexican narcotraffickers (see SourceMex, 12/06/95).
     The new charges of corruption against Raul Salinas come
on top of previous allegations that the former president's
brother masterminded the assassination of Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu, a high-level official of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) in October 1994.  In fact, Raul
Salinas was already in federal custody, awaiting trial in the
Ruiz Massieu case when the new charges brought by Secodam and
the Attorney General's Office (PGR) were announced.
     However, Farell's appointment to replace Samaniego has
created strong skepticism that the full extent of corruption
alleged against Raul Salinas and other members of the family,
including the former president himself, will ever be known.
     As expected, Farell's appointment to head Secodam
attracted immediate protests from members of opposition
parties and independent legislators in the Chamber of
Deputies.
     "Now, with Farell, it is going to be practically
impossible for us to get the information," said Deputy Adolfo
Aguilar Zinser, an independent legislator.  "It is clear that
we will face extraordinary obstacles to carry out the
investigation."
     This charge was echoed by Juan Guerra, a deputy for the
opposition Democratic Revolution Party (PRD).
     "I think Farell is being moved into the comptroller's
office to cover up the tracks of the ex-president and his
brother in the illicit enrichment scandal," said Guerra.
     Farell served as labor secretary and as head of the
controversial government security commission under Salinas,
and he remains very close to the president.
     Some political commentators suggested that Farell was
chosen for the post to heal a split between Salinas and
Zedillo and within the PRI itself.  A major source of the
conflict has been Zedillo's willingness to publicly blame ex-
president Salinas for the devaluation of the peso in December
1994.
     Farell is said to have played a key role in trying to
sooth a public dispute between Salinas and Zedillo early in
1995, hosting a dinner for the two after Salinas ended a brief
hunger strike in March.
     Salinas has not only expressed strong resentment against
Zedillo for linking him directly to the peso devaluation, but
is also said to be very angry at the President for approving
the arrest of his brother Raul in the Ruiz Massieu case.
     Indeed, some political columnists suggest that as part of
the truce between the current and former president, Zedillo
agreed to back down on his vigorous investigation of the
Salinas family.
     "Raul Salinas has heard in prison that his family has
received guarantees of no further persecution," said columnist
Jose Urena in the daily newspaper La Jornada.  Urena, however,
gave no further details of the alleged guarantees.
     Some political columnists suggest that Farell's
appointment to Secodam, while easing tensions within the PRI,
will also further erode Zedillo's credibility.
     "This is a monumental error," said prominent columnist
Miguel Angel Granados Chapa.  "Apart from signifying a
revalidation of the Salinas system, there seems to be no logic
in his appointment."
     Despite all the criticisms, the Zedillo administration
attempted to cast a positive light on Farell's appointment.
     "The new head of Secodam, with his ample knowledge of the
law and ample government experience, will expedite the
modernization of the federal government and take stronger and
more efficient action toward preventing and combating
corruption," the administration said in a prepared statement.
     The controversy over Farell's nomination as head of
Secodam appeared to overshadow Zedillo's appointment of
economist Jesus Reyes Heroles to head the Energy Secretariat
(SE), replacing Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza.  Unlike the Farell
case, this appointment was met with very little opposition,
and in fact was applauded by opposition legislators because of
Pichardo's departure from office.
     Pichardo, who was considered a member of the so-called
"dinosaurs" or "old guard" of the PRI, will be reassigned to
a yet-to-be-determined diplomatic post.
     Reyes Heroles, who leaves his post as director of the
national public works bank (Banco Nacional de Obras Publicas,
BANOBRAS), obtained a degree in economics from the
Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT).  According to an
official statement, Reyes will "oversee the expansion and
modernization of Mexico's energy sector."  Among other things,
Reyes will play a key role in the privatization of the
country's petrochemical plants, which are currently operated
by the state-run oil company PEMEX.
     Among other minor changes announced by Zedillo in the
December cabinet reshuffle was the appointment of Carlos
Almada Lopez as his chief government spokesperson, replacing
Carlos Salomon Camara.  This was partly seen as a move by the
president to spruce up his image.  Salomon was widely
criticized for rocky relations with the Mexican news media.
Meantime, Samaniego, who left the post as head of Secodam, was
named as a special adviser to Zedillo.
     With the changes announced in late December, Zedillo has
replaced almost one-half of his original cabinet.  The most
prominent departure was Jaime Serra Puche as finance
secretary, who received a large share of the blame for the
devaluation of the peso (see SourceMex, 02/08/95).
     Another major departure last year was that of Zedillo's
close ally Esteban Moctezuma, who left the post of interior
secretary in mid-1995.  According to political analysts,
Moctezuma had proven ineffective in dealing with a number of
crisis situations affecting the government, such as the lack
of progress on talks with the Zapatista National Liberation
Army (EZLN) in Chiapas and the failed efforts to reach
agreement with the two largest opposition parties on political
reforms.
     The resignation in mid-1995 of then-public education
secretary Fausto Alzati also proved to be a major
embarrassment to the Zedillo administration.  Alzati was
forced to leave his post after admitting he lied about his
educational background.  The departures of Moctezuma and
Alzati were announced in July of last year (see SourceMex,
07/05/95).
     Political analysts suggest that the latest cabinet
changes announced in December are expected to greatly benefit
Interior (Gobernacion) Secretary Emilio Chuayffet Chemor, who
is close to many of the appointees.
     "Chuayffet must be smiling from ear to ear," said Reforma
columnist F. Bartolome.  "His team and influence are expanding
in the midst of the current administration."
     Indeed, Zedillo's new spokesperson, Carlos Almada, is a
close ally of Chuayffet.  Almada left a high-level post in the
Interior Secretariat (Secretaria de Gobernacion, SG) to take
over his new post.  (Sources: Agence France-Presse, 12/30/95;

ZEDILLO'S FIRST YEAR: PRESIDENT,
OR PRISONER OF CRISIS? (Part 1)

                 By John Ross
[The author is a freelance journalist who has written on
Mexican political and economic affairs for many years.]

     When outgoing president Carlos Salinas affixed the sash
with the colors of the Mexican flag--red, white, and green--
across Ernesto Zedillo's chest on Dec. 1, 1994, Mexico
appeared to be on the rebound after a nightmare year of Indian
rebellion and political assassination.  The new president
inherited an economy that appeared to hold great promise for
Mexico due to the enactment of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA).  Additionally, his long-ruling (66 years)
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) managed to win with
50% of the votes in national elections in August 1994.
     However, less than three weeks after his installation,
massive capital flight and the time bomb of short-term debt
obligations left behind by Salinas, forced Zedillo to devalue
the peso, triggering a chain reaction that quickly plunged
Mexico into an economic and social crisis which has colored
every minute of the new president's first year in office.
     Since the so-called "December errors," Zedillo has
staggered from one crisis to the next, like a shipwrecked
soul, overwhelmed by the flood of events.  In February, as the
economy crashed in flames, Zedillo bowed to the military and
ordered a full-scale offensive into the Lacandon Jungle base
of the popular Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN),
setting off a worldwide tide of protest.
     At the end of February, as public disdain for Salinas
began to soar, Zedillo gave the green light to arrest the
former president's brother for masterminding the murder of the
PRI's secretary-general, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
     For his part, Salinas took umbrage, declared a hunger
strike, and flew off into self-exile in Canada, from where he
has unremittingly sniped at Zedillo's fumbling administration
ever since.
     Meanwhile, the PRI was losing state elections to the
center-right National Action Party (PAN) by lopsided margins
and the bottom continued to fall out of the economy.  Indeed,
a drop of 10.5% in the GDP during the second quarter was a
64-year low.  So desperate has the economic slide become that
when the GDP tumbled only 9.6% in the third quarter, the
numbers were hailed by Zedillo's Finance Secretary Guillermo
Ortiz Martinez as a sign that "the crisis was over."
     In September of 1995, when Zedillo went before the nation
to deliver his annual state of the union message (the shortest
ever), the words most used to describe Mexico's current state
of affairs were "grave" and "crisis."  These terms were used
a total of 27 times.
     From 1981 through 1989, Mexicans endured versions of "La
Crisis."  These were actually a series of crises associated
with short-term debt obligations and the falling price of oil.
Lyable.
Moratoriums, led by debtors' unions like El Barzon, have so
constricted liquidity that some bankers admit privately their
only cash flow comes from money linked to narcotrafficking.
     Zedillo's crisis is also a monetary crisis.  Since the
"December errors," the peso has lost 55% of its worth and some
analysts predict the exchange rate will soon reach 10 nuevo
pesos per US$1.00.  Indeed, Mexico's currency has become
extremely vulnerable to speculators, forcing the Banco de
Mexico (central bank) to intervene by spending hundreds of
millions of dollars loaned last February by the US and the
International Monetary Fund.
     Despite the interventions, the peso is buying less and
less every day.  Inflation is expected to reach 50% in 1995,
a seven-year high, and it now takes two and one half minimum
salaries to buy the basic food basket.
     Zedillo's crisis is not yet a debt crisis as was the case
with La Crisis of 1982.  However, default remains a strong
possibility in the near future.  The nation's combined public
and private debt ended 1995 at close to US$162 billion, 36% of
the GDP and the highest dollar amount ever.  Mexico, which is
now banking export oil revenue in the US Federal Reserve as
collateral for the US-IMF bailout, transfered US$19 billion to
the exterior in debt service in 1995.  In 1996, the government
is expected to pay out another US$25 billion to service the
debt.
     Zedillo's crisis is a also a crisis for the super-rich.
The economic boom under the Salinas administration created 24
Mexican billionaires, but during 1995 only 10 of those
billionaires remained in the rankings of Forbes magazine.
     But Zedillo's crisis is mostly a crisis for the poor and
the extremely poor.  According to the Social Development
Secretariat (Sedesol), 2.5 million poor are at risk of falling
from poverty to extreme poverty, which is defined by the
United Nations as an inability to earn enough to meet one's
nutritional needs.  Under Zedillo, nearly one-fifth of the
population is going to bed hungry every night.  (Cont.)

ZEDILLO'S FIRST YEAR: PRESIDENT,
OR PRISONER OF CRISIS? (Part 2)

     Zedillo's crisis is a nutritional crisis for many
Mexicans.  The price of tortillas has risen three times this
year, for an accumulated 50% increase.  The government's
national nutrition institute (Instituto Nacional de Nutricion)
reports 41% of all births in public hospitals are low weight,
due to poor maternal nutrition.
     The crisis is also one of health care.  Mexico has
registered more cholera cases in 1995 than in any other year
since reporting began.  A regional epidemic of dengue fever is
wracking poor southern Mexican villages.
     Zedillo's crisis has impacted education as well.
According to one organization that advocates for the rights of
families, 150,000 students have had to transfer from private
to pubic schools, straining facilities and exhausting school
lunch programs.
     Zedillo's crisis is also an emotional crisis.  According
to statistics from Mexico City authorities, a record 40 people
have flung themselves before subway trains in the capital this
year.  Meantime, El Barzon claims that 400 of its members,
including its leader in Coahuila state, have committed suicide
since the crisis began, due to financial troubles.
     Indeed, Miguel Garcia, a psychologist who runs a Mexico
City suicide hot line, established after the devastating 1985
earthquake, says that La Crisis has taken a more severe toll
than the earthquake.  "For many, an economic crisis quickly
becomes an emotional one," Garcia said.
     Zedillo's crisis has been worsened by natural disasters.
As the peso skidded last January, the Popocateptl volcano
belched black smoke outside of Mexico City, causing thousands
to flee in panic.  Mexico has also sustained severe damage
from two hurricanes in 1995, one of which knocked out 90% of
off-shore oil production in October.  In addition, the country
has had to cope with a series of frightening earthquakes,
including a temblor on Oct. 10 that measured 7.2 on the
Richter scale, and which leveled hotels and other tourist-
related infrastructure in some areas of Mexico's Pacific
Coast.
     Unlike the debt crisis of 1982, Mexicans have not quietly
accepted the sacrifices imposed upon them.  Rebellion and
social protest are thriving.  Indeed, Mexico City authorities
recorded an average of eight marches a day in 1995.
Demonstrators daily block boulevards, banks, and even the
Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV), curtailing activity on the
trading floor.  When recruiters failed to appear for a job
fair this September, 20,000 professionals battled riot police,
using their briefcases as weapons.
     While the capitan president to consider stepping aside.
     For some, such as the PAN, Zedillo's crisis has created
unprecedented opportunities in municipal and gubernatorial
elections.  Indeed, Guanajuato's PAN Governor, Vicente Fox,
describes the crisis faced by Zedillo and the PRI as a
"pinata" for his party.  The PAN unseated the PRI from a
gubernatorial post in Jalisco in 1995 and managed to retain
the gubernatorial posts in Baja California and Guanajuato
states.  In addition, the PAN won a number of municipal races
in several large cities in Mexico, including Guadalajara and
Puebla.
     The crisis has also proven a boon for some in the US and
Mexico, including investors in Mexican mutual funds, foreign
travelers, and consumers who can afford to take advantage of
the growing number of bargains offered by supermarket chains
and department stores.
     Another major beneficiary of the recent economic
situation in Mexico is La Crisis editor Carlos Ramirez, who
notes sales of his bulletin have continued to grow steadily
since he started publication earlier in the year.

SOUTH AFRICA'S FLYING START FOR 1996

It has been an incredible start to the year. After Christmas financial
markets in Johannesburg stormed ahead as economic indicators and gold
all turned in the right direction. For many fund managers only now back
after the year-end sojourn on the Cape beaches, it's been a difficult
scenario to adjust to.

Gold, as always a key factor in the SA economy, is at least part of the
reason for optimism in financial markets. The price has been reaching
for $400 an ounce in recent weeks, which has led to a 17% gain in the
JSE All Gold index since Christmas. Within this have been some
phenomenal performances with certain shares rising more than 30%.

The reason for gold's surge is, as always, rather difficult to pin
down. Analysts have been pointing to the shortfall of new mined gold
when compared with supply for some time. The year end report published
by Gold Fields Minerals Services highlighted that demand reached a
record 3642 tons in 1995, while output was down with the SA mines'
production falling 10% to 523 tons - the lowest level in 40 years.

Not by gold alone

That there was such large hedging activity in 1995 probably held the
gold price back. With the massive forwards and option deals of the SA
producers now completed, the mood in the gold market has improved and
some analysts, mostly chartists, are talking a price well over $410 an
ounce for 1996 compared with the $380 level of 1995.

But it has not just been gold which has buoyed the market and led to
rather optimistic forecasts for the year ahead. During 1995 SA's
Reserve bank had notable success on the inflation front, with the rate
falling from 10% to under 7%. This contributed to a bull run in the
bond market in 1995, with rates falling from nearly 17% to 13.6%.

Foreign demand was in part behind the run. In 1995, foreigners were net
buyers of nearly R2bn of SA bonds on the JSE alone. This compares with
R1.2bn in 1994. While there has been some profit taking in January, the
demand has contributed to large capital inflows and strength in the
rand. The rand is currently trading at 3.62 to the dollar, which is
stronger than many analysts had forecast a year ago.

Further rand strength is not being ruled out, and there is growing
consensus that further relaxation in exchange control will take place,
possibly in the March budget. In the first quarter of 1995, the
government merged the financial and commercial rands and promised
further relaxation if capital inflows and inflation allowed. Later in
the year, asset swaps by local institutions were given the nod.

Economic data suggest the Bank will be comfortably able to relax
controls even further. The sharp R2.2bn rise in December's gold and
foreign exchange reserves - in a month normally characterised by
seasonal outflows  - has pushed cover on imports to nearly two months
compared with the Reserve Bank's three month target. Further inflows in
the next quarter should make three months cover possible.

This strong reserve position and inflation being under control suggest
that local institutions may be granted further leave to invest
offshore. Speculation is mounting that from March the Bank will allow
them to invest a proportion of their cashflows internationally.

Other signs for a more liberal new year come from recent government
statements about privatisation. While labour has responded angrily, it
appears that government is determined to sell some of the state's
assets to fund development. Deputy president Thabo Mbeki announced in
December the state's intention to sell off part of SA Airways, Telkom,
the airports company, Autonet and Transkei Airways.

Labour's response was one of anger at a lack of consultation. Protests
and work stoppages will probably slow the privatisation process. But
that it will go ahead is reasonably certain. At present the state is
looking at ways to cushion the impact on labour of privatisation.

With good economic news and booming markets, South Africa has entered
1996 in good spirits and with the prospect that the economy will move
further down the road of economic liberation to follow what has
happened on the political front in recent years.

The major blight on the landscape, however, is the violence in KwaZulu-
Natal and crime, neither of which seems much closer to resolution.

ZIMBABWE - STREET RIOTS AND FOREIGN JUNKETS

The year has begun with as much cheerful portent for Zimbabwe and its
economy as the soothsayer who told Julius Caesar to keep his eye on the
Ides of March.

Within days of each other, the country's most authoritative economic
periodicals , issued by the Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) and Anglo
American Corporation-owned First Merchant Bank (FMB), have expressed
disturbing misgivings over the country's deepening economic crisis, and
the government's apparent inability to grapple with it seriously.

A promising start to the rainy season, says SCB, may provide gdp growth
of at least 5%, if the wet weather holds out. But working against the
keenly-awaited rebound in agriculture, until now seen as the engine of
Zimbabwe's growth, are high real interest rates that are unlikely to
drop until, at best, the latter half of the year.

Whether the punitive lending rates - a bank  overdraft attracts 41% -
can be pulled down, depends on whether the government can reduce its
budget deficit in a sustained manner, instead of its current ad hoc
style, the bank says. State spending cuts are in force, with real
government expenditure set to drop 10% in the fiscal year to June 30,
but the main cuts have been in public sector investment, which, the
bank says , "is precisely the wrong solution for a country in
Zimbabwe's situation."

The cutbacks will add to 1995's "substantially lower"rate of
investment, and any recovery in the manufacturing sector, with
production running at its lowest in 11 years, is expected to be
"relatively weak"because of the deep-seated problems faced by the
sector.

The fundamental issue is the vigorous implementation of ESAP II, the
second phase of the country's IMF-designed economic reforms, following
the failure of the first, says the bank. At the top of the list is
macroeconomic stabilisation with critical reforms that include
privatisation of state-owned companies, the establishment of export
processing zones and an industrial strategy.

So far, the bank notes, there has not even been any hint of open debate
on reform - in the way that South Africa published white papers and
draft programmes - being offered by the government. FMB attacks the
issue of unemployment, and is rather less restrained in its comment
than SCB.

In the six years since 1990, when ESAP I began, 820 000 people with
four or more years secondary school behind them, have entered a job
market that has been able to find work in the formal sector for less
than 20% of them. By the year 2000, another 750 000 will have moved
through the same educational process, but by then there will be as many
of them with the same qualifications in the ages of 17 - 30 but who
have no work, as there are no formal sector jobs.

It is automatically assumed, says FMB, that the government is giving
the unemployment crisis its highest possible priority, but this hardly
appears to be the case.

If the jobless crisis had been caused by deliberate measures taken by a
foreign power, "we would consider them acts of war. But we are doing
them to ourselves,"the bank says.

Export processing zones could have been one way of absorbing some of
the surplus highly educated labour pool, says FMB. But it has taken the
government seven years to come up with legislation promulgating EPZs,
and now, it adds, implementation is being delayed yet again, this time
with the trivial issue of who is going to be on the boards to run the
zones. "We can already see signs of a potentially destructive course
being taken as the river of unemployed becomes a flood of angry,
disillusioned people,"warned FMB.

Mugabe shows no sign of sharing the concerns of the two bulletins.His
preoccupation this year is to stand in presidential elections, and in a
New Year interview with the state-controlled daily The Herald, spoke of
his vision in his imminent third term as head of state, of dramatically
enhanced industrial development and heavy state investment in
infrastructure and agriculture. And anyone hoping for a New Year mini
cabinet shuffle bearing a new minister of finance - three months after
the death of previous minister Aristson Chambati - to take charge of
the reforms desperately needed, was disappointed.

The last months of 1995 were marked by unprecented anti-government
street riots.   Deep fissures also appeared in the monolithic ruling
ZANU(PF) party as voters put an independent MP and mayor into office in
constituencies where the party's dominance was previously unquestioned.

The public perception of how Mugabe feels the situation is continual
junkets abroad with huge delegations of officials and members of his
family, and pay increases to himself and senior party members in the
order of around 130%.

ADVERTISING PROSPECTS FOR 1996: "MINDSETS WILL HAVE TO CHANGE"

At a time when new media opportunities continue to fragment the
channels of commercial communication, an alarming trend has appeared in
South African media consumption: people are reading, watching and
listening less.

This decline, in evidence over the last two or three years, poses the
greatest challenge facing advertisers as 1996 dawns.

Simply put, not only is the pie getting smaller, but what is left is
being cut into smaller slices. This makes it more complex and expensive
to reach the same audiences as before.

Newspaper circulations have shown an average decline of 7% (for the 26
leading urban dailies and weeklies between the first half of 1994 and
the same period of 1995.) But some have suffered significantly greater
losses and over a longer period of time.

Circulation of The Star, formerly the country's biggest daily, has
fallen 23% since its 1990 peak, from 235,000 to 182,000. Half the loss
was experienced in the last year.

Initially there was a hope that readership would not decline as well,
but would be compensated for by greater pass-along readership --a
common response to economic hardship. But when the readership survey
came in ti showed a 21% decline in "reading events" since 1993: the
number of times when somebody picks up a newspaper or magazine during
its issue period has fallen from 46.4 million in 1993 to 36.9 million
in 1995.

This is of critical concern to advertisers, who are attracted to
advertise in a newspaper primarily by the number of readers it can
offer.

TV viewing has also slumped, though recently the pace of the decline
has slowed. In the first half of 1995, peak-time audiences were 20%
lower than they had been two years earlier. More recently, they have
been running about 10% behind 1994's figures.

The blame for this has been placed on the South African Broadcasting
Corporation (SABC), which has converted its bias in favour of white
Afrikaners into one in favour of black Africans.

`What is clearly happening,' says Hennie van Deventer, chief executive
of the Afrikans publishing house, National Newspapers, "is that
Afrikaans people, estranged by the strange happenings at the SABC, are
turning to newspapers to provide them with the information they need."
His belief is supported by the fact that Afrikaans newspapers are among
the handful of exceptions to the general decline in circulations.

Adds Ken Owen, editor of the country's biggest newspaper, the 500 000 -
circulation Sunday Times: "It's hard to escape the suspicion that
rightwing newspapers, including the Afrikaans press, succeed because
they give dispossessed whites a voice."

The picture is more erratic in radio listening, with some stations
showing massive increases and others showing equally large losses.
Among the services previously positioned to appeal to whites, declines
of up to 42% have been recorded. In the SABC's English-language
channel, whose audience tends to be older and white, programmes and
announcers were changed to reflect the new political environment. The
audience fell from 643,000 to 373,000 in a year.

African language stations, on the other hand, have shown a slight but
not statistically significant fall. While some see this as evidence of
white racism, it is more constructive to view the issue in marketing
terms.

"Strong newspaper circulations depend on a strong sense of community,"
says Gail York, research manager at Times Media, one of the four big
newspaper groups. "The papers that appear to have held fast have a
sense of community. Those that have a vast demographic spread of
readers appear to be the ones that have suffered the most."

In addition to the Afrikaans newspapers, others whose circulations have
not declined include Business Day (serving the business community),
local community newspapers and newspapers targeted at the black
community.

Noel Coburn, joint managing director of Caxton, the leading publisher
of community newspapers, says declining circulations are attributable
to a failure to remain "relevant" to their consumers.

Numerous other factors probably play a part in the trend, including
disaffection with an unvaried diet of "bad" news (particularly crime),
a deterioration in news interest after the 1994 general election, an
end to costly circulation wars in which sales were boosted by
competitions and prizes and, of course, the proliferation of new media.

Satellite TV damp squib

A flood of new magazines and one new newspaper have been launched, 80
community radio stations have been licensed (of which 56 so far are in
operation), and new satellite TV channels have also come on stream.
(Although it must be said that the satellite TV era has thus far proved
a damp squib because of production problems at the factories
manufacturing reception equipment and decoders.)

What all this means is that advertisers are finding it harder and more
costly than ever to reach their markets. Says Chris Rainford, media
director of Bates South Africa, a leading advertising agency: "It used
to be possible to reach 60% or more of your target market through a
single TV channel. This is no longer possible."

"Previously high reach was always a given" says Gordon Muller, media
director of Saatchi & Saatchi Klerck & Barrett. "I am telling my
clients the party is over. You can no longer go on TV with an
objective of reaching 80% of your target market. Now we may set reach
objectives of 40%. With this lower level of exposure, marketers will
want their advertising to be more focused. Mindsets will have to
change."

The good news

There may be some considerable compensation, however. Economic growth
in 1996 is expected to be at least 4.5%, and given the end of the
devastating drought of the last six years could be even higher.

Advertising expenditure tends to be a highly volatile concurrent
economic indicator, and it is likely to rise even more strongly. "We
expect an excellent year"says Reg Lascaris, whose ad agency, Hunt
Lascaris TBWA, is the third biggest in the country.

MEDIA EXPLOSION IMPACTS ON BRAND NAMES

Cadbury's may not melt under an assault of Mars Bars, but SA hamburgers
have become hidden under Mac's and Pepsi is trying to float Coke out of
the market.

While SA consumers are facing an unprecedented barrage of foreign goods
coming onto the market, SA manufacturers - in particular top corporates
like SA Breweries and the Rembrandt group - are waking up to the need
to develop strong brand identities.

Advertising - the media it supports, and the companies that support
both, face challenging times in SA. Cape Town's 3-D advertising agency
notes that a media explosion, "unprecedented in history", is upon us.

Consumers are also confronted with interactive TV, electronic
newspapers, advertising disks, selective binding magazines and the
Internet.

But Raymond Perrier, of Interbrand-Sampson points out that this
plethora of information may lead some consumers to retire to the safety
of well-known brands, "for example, faced with dozens of new computers
and computer packages they may retreat to names they know well such as
IBM, instead of experimenting."

The value of brand equity

The value of brand equity, not well observed in SA, has increasingly
become more tangible - when Philip Morris bought Kraft it paid four
times the book value and when Nestle acquired Wilson Rowntree
intangible assets represented more than 80% of the purchase price. The
value of a brand lies in its expected future earnings.

Perrier suggests that part of the reason why SA's undervalue their
brands and rely on advertising agencies for branding, is because most
major corporates lack marketeers on their boards. " A top businessman I
recently spoke to here noted that more time will be spent in board
meetings discussing the position of a new plant, than how to advance
the brands it will produce."

Perrier says a brand is more than just packaging and advertising, it is
about the adoption of a corporate culture. He suggests that the success
of British Airways new branding was that it  not only looked at
advertising, it changed the tail design of aircrafts, uniforms and
retrained staff, with company policy reflecting that they had 2500
brand managers - or each staff member.

The 50 biggest global advertisers spent more than R130bn on the
promotion of their brands during 1993 - or the equivalent of almost a
third of SA's Gross National Product. The USA and Europe together spent
80% of that total. Europe has 20 of the world's top spending
advertisers, followed by Japan with 14, the USA with 13 - including top
ranked spender, Procter and Gamble (R16bn) - and South Korea with
three.

Perrier says SA has to avoid what happened in Eastern Europe when that
opened up and consumers quickly switched to more effectively branded
western goods. What SA could become, he suggests, is a country like
Singapore which serves as a springboard to the rest of Asia, and SA to
Africa.

3-D suggests that ads may become event or programme specific, or small
radio stations may - as some linked newspapers already do - group
together and sell advertising packages.

The big unknown, however, is the Internet or the World Wide Web, it
relays information to around 50m computers and in SA - one of the
fastest growing users of the net - there are an estimated 230 000
users. 3-D Agency points out that it "is the first and only unowned
medium in the world. It is uncensored (and uncensorable), totally
democratic and omni-directional. It is the fastest growing
communication medium in history."

But already major SA ad agency Hunt Lascaris is creating a division
solely to place advertising on the Internet for clients.

More South Africans are becoming computer literate, even schools in
remote areas have been funded by SA and foreign corporates who have
provided solar panels for the generation of electricity and computers
to advance skills of previously disadvantaged students.

Research completed last year by Microsoft and Market Research Africa
shows that one in four SA homes in major urban areas have personal
computers and at least a third of employees use a computer in the
workplace.  There is a strong awareness of the need to be techno-
literate, with 85% of those surveyed saying computer skills were
important to achieve educational and business success.

But it also showed that a third of South Africans are still intimidated
by computers, of whom over half were in the surprisingly young age
group of 18 to 34. Hewlett Packard has noted that South Africans are
turning over computers four times faster than any other nation in the
world at present.

What consumers need in the huge tidal wave of information swamping over
them, is brands they can hold onto.

INDIAN OCEAN STATES OUTSTRIP AFRICAN MARKETS

Indian Ocean states in the form of Mauritius, India, Pakistan and
Singapore offer far greater potential for South african trade in the
next few years than all its African markets.

Figures released by the Indian Consulate in Durban indicate that the
two-way trade in 1994 between India and South Africa accounted for
R900m (#160m), while in the first nine months of 1995 alone it had
soared to R780m.

Trade with Mauritius is expanding even more strongly, and in particular
exports from South Africa to this Indian Ocean island are soaring.
Exports to Mauritius have grown from roughly 1bn rupees in 1991 to 5bn
rupees in 1994 helped by the strong growth of the Mauritius economy,
the relatively low value of the rand and the elimination of sanctions.

This growth in exports is concentrated in the fields of iron, steel,
chemicals, foodstuffs and beverages, and is expected to continue
flourishing. Sharp rises in exports of building materials from South
Africa to the island are expected in view of the boom in hotel
construction in Mauritius. At present, however, the rapid growth in
trade between the two countries is overwhelmingly in South Africa's
favour, with exports to the Republic from Mauritius amounting to only
65m rupees in 1994.

On the other hand, cooperation in foreign tourism between the two
countries could emerge on a significant scale in view of the plans to
develop foreign cruise tourism in Eastern and Southern Africa recently
announced by the Port Management Associations of Eastern and Southern
Africa. It has been claimed that South Africa could double its world
market share of cruise vacations within two years.

Indian Ocean states like Mauritius and India are important to South
Africa because of their rapidly growing economies, and the scope they
provide for the sale of a broad spread of manufactured products which
is in contrast to the Republic's predominantly mineral exports to the
industrial countries.

FEAR AND RESENTMENT OVER SA'S INCREASED DUTY

The decision of the South African government to introduce high duty on
goods of other countries passing through it is expected to affect
multilateral trade between SA and its neighbours.

With suspicion growing in some trade circles of the Southern Africa
Development Community  (SADC) to which South Africa is the latest and
eleventh member, it is feared that the proposed 125% duty on customs
clearance will stifle fair competition and the trade efforts of other
countries.

The South African government has temporarily waived the introduction of
the custom duty to February , anticipating trade protests from some
SADC member countries who utilise its rail-road routes and seaports for
both their imports and exports.

In fact, the 125% customs duty proposal has come at a time when some
SADC member states are questioning the benefits they were deriving from
South Africa, which as they see it continues to pursue almost the same
trade practices as under the former apartheid regime.

For example, some SADC countries suspect that South Africa was
deliberately keeping them out of the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) arrangement in order for it to continue dominating trade
benefits with Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland. The South
African government has denied that this was the case with its
traditional partners in the customs union.

However, South Africa's perceived intention to dominate the trade of
the sub-region is expected to draw a backlash from other SADC member
countries, more especially those with a comparatively strong industrial
base and economic potential for growth. Already Zimbabwe has threatened
to retaliate over the withdrawal of some trade concessions by its
southern neighbour.

According to trade statistics, customs duty on a number of goods and
services between Zimbabwe and South Africa has increased some 200 to
300% in the past six months.

For Zambia which has been dependent on South Africa for almost 66% of
its trade since the dawn of multiparty democracy and economic
liberalisation in 1991, the proposed rise in customs duty could be
extremely serious for the country's tottering economy.

The Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce (ZACCI) is particularly
worried and said the bond requirement of 125% duty on customs clearance
which South Africa wants to impose on its trade neighbours would have
far-reaching effects on the general conduct of trade in the sub-region.

According to ZACCI executive director Mr Gideon Phiri, the trade
measure would have a negative effect on the embattled economy of his
country, more especially in the manufacturing, trading and agricultural
sectors.

Landlocked Zambia, which at the moment moves 45% of its cargo through
the port of Durban in South Africa, is likely to suffer the most should
the Pretoria government decide to stick to the new customs duty. Re-
routing its goods through other countries would be too costly for its
run down economy.

A top government official in the ministry of finance in Lusaka
expressed the local feeling that South Africa owed his country
compensation for the country's devastated economy because of the high
price that Zambia paid for South Africa's liberation struggle against
the former apartheid administration when South Africa's African
National Congress (ANC) operated its administrative office in Lusaka.

"We lost lives and properties to give freedom to our colleagues and is
this what we get in return?" the official asked.

This is the general feeling among various Front-line states (Zambia,
Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, and Tanzania), that South Africa should
carry some responsibility for the damage their economies suffered in
supporting its liberation movement.

S A'S RUNAWAY TOURISM BOOM

Foreign tourism generated R7bn (#1.24 bn) in foreign exchange in 1994
and probably reached R9bn in 1995. The boom in foreign tourism is
expected to be sustained in 1996, and the South African Tourism Board
claims that the government is hopeful that this industry will overtake
gold mining within four years to become the biggest earner of foreign
exchange at around R20 bn a year.

This phenomenal growth in foreign tourism has already meant that the
South African hotel industry is enjoying a boom which is expected to
last for several years.

Hotel bookings for the first nine months of 1995 were more than 33% up
from 1994's figure of 7.6 m "bed nights" to more than 10 m "bed nights"
according to the latest figures from the Central Statistical
Service(CSS). The CSS figures indicate that the number of "bed nights"
sold will have broken all records for 1995.

In September 1995 alone, hotels in aggregate accommodated almost double
the number of overseas visitors compared with the same month in 1994,
with the figure up to 203 422 compared with 109 939. More than 50% of
the foreigners who visited the country over the nine month period to
September 1995 came from Europe, led by the United Kingdom and Germany,
followed by Africa with 17% and the Far East with 15%.

For 1995 as a whole the number of foreign tourists is estimated to have
increased by 45%.

The boom in the hotel industry has spread to the bed and breakfast
sector which has traditionally been an insignificant sector of the
market. This sector has now grown into an important segment of the
accommodation industry since the launch of John Read's pilot project in
Johannesburg in 1984. Guest houses have also mushroomed, some of which
focus on offering farm accommodation to tourists in various scenic
parts of the country.

Numerous new hotels are coming on stream, including the R180m Park
Hyatt hotel of Hyatt International which has been built in Rosebank,
Johannesburg, and opened in December 1995. In November 1995 the Don
Group launched a R35m expansion upgrading drive which will increase the
capacity of its executive apartment hotel chain by 10% by the end of
1996.

Sandton in Johannesburg is a particularly popular area for new hotel
developments. This is illustrated by the start of building by the
Hilton International group of a 324 roomed hotel costing R203m in the
area, while Stocks Hotels and Resorts plans to open the Sandton Square
Michael Angelo Hotel in May 1996, costing R130m. Rand Merchant Bank,
meanwhile, has indicated that it is conducting negotiations with local
and overseas  groups to build a hotel as part of its 8 hectare site in
Sandton.

In addition, Golden Tulip International, the 10th largest hotel group
in the world, has established a South African operation which aims to
develop and operate 20 hotels in the next two years, starting off with
the signing of a management contract for the R125 m Spier hotel complex
in the Western Cape, D'Owerse Werf in Stellenbosch and Sanbonani in
Mpumalanga.

The boom in foreign tourism is such that domestic travellers at this
stage comprise only a small part of hotel occupancy, and businessman
travelling between Cape Town and Johanesburg are finding it difficult
to book hotels.

Boost for Coaches

The boom is also giving a much needed boost to the bus coach
manufacturing industry in the Republic. The industry produced only 288
buses of more than 7.5 tons in 1993, 348 in 1994  and should have
manufactured roughly 400 in 1995.  Meanwhile , major airlines flying to
South Africa claim that they cannot keep up with the demand for seats.

Some analysts are claiming that, given the new hotel developments in
the pipeline, within a few years there will be a large oversupply of
hotels unless foreign tourism continues rising at around 25 % per
annum. The optimists claim that this is easily within reach.

The number of international airlines flying to Johannesburg has risen
from roughly 19 to 50 in the last two years, and foreign tourism is
going to continue benefiting from this trend. Caledonian Airlines is
planning to introduce charter flights to South Africa from March 1996 ,
while Virgin Airways of Britain has filed a series of applications to
the Civil Aviation Authority for permission to fly from London to
Johannesburg and Cape Town.

Alongside these developments South African Airways has indicated that
its partial privatisation will furnish new opportunities to market
South Africa to foreign tourists, and thereby  generate higher traffic.

Tourism industry spokesman have long expressed fears that crime
directed against both local and foreign tourists would have a
detrimental effect on the growth of the industry. However, in an effort
to address this problem tourist protection units have been established
in the major centres to try and ensure the safety of tourists. The
Durban hospitality  industry plans to train hotel and restaurant
personnel as police reservists to combat crime on the Durban
beachfront.

INDUSTRIAL TAKEOFF AHEAD FOR SALDANHA BAY

The Saldanha Bay area of the Western Cape is set to become a major
industrial complex following Iscor's decision to establish a large
steel mill in the area.  A series of downstream industrial projects are
likely to follow the building of the steel plant, which will transform
the area and furnish a boost to the Western Cape economy.

Iscor has finally given the go-ahead for the Saldanha Steel project
after securing a new site which is 2 kilometres inland of the
controversial Langebaan lagoon site, and after having reduced certain
capital costs of the project by R500 (#89m) with the total capital cost
now estimated to be R6.8bn.

Building will begin immediately and the plant will be commissioned
early in 1998, although it will take another 12 to 18 months before
full capacity of 1.25m tons of hot strip steel is reached, which will
be mainly earmarked for export markets.

The steel project, for which Iscor raised R1.3bn in a rights issue
earlier in 1995, ran aground a few months ago due to opposition from
environmentalists, who criticised the proposed siting of the plant near
to the wetlands in Saldanha.  This opposition led to delays in starting
the plant, and the higher costs of the project associated with the
delay  prompted Iscor to withdraw from the scheme.

The new arrangements.

Under the new arrangements the Industrial Development Corporation, an
equal partner in the project, has restructured the financing plans to
include a greater element of gearing so as to enhance the return to
shareholders.  The project has been further aided by special tax
concessions  by the government.

The Saldanha Steel project itself could still be expanded by doubling
the hot rolled coil capacity of the steel mill.  This has apparently
been allowed for in the layout of the plant.  In addition, businesses
related to the steel industry are now expected to be attracted to the
Saldanha area.  Angola Alpha is reported to be considering building a
cement factory at Saldanha, using the  Corex slag from the steel plant
as its major raw material.

A steel pipe manufacturing plant geared to exporting is also on the
cards since Iscor is prepared to make some of its steel output
available to local processors, and may indeed invest itself in such a
beneficiation project.  A separate stainless steel mill is also
envisaged.  It is also speculated that once the gas field at Kudu off
the Namibian coast is developed, this will create opportunities for
developing new gas-based direct reduction iron, steel and related
industries in the Saldanha area.

The Saldanha Steel project, together with the other potential new
projects, represents the largest industrial economic development phase
ever in the Western Cape, and the expansion at Saldanha could be even
greater in view of the tourist potential of the area.

SAA AIMS FOR NEW HEIGHTS

Nineteen ninety five was the kind of year SA Airways (SAA) would like
to frame. It left the bad years of having to cope with sanctions and a
moribund civil service attitude behind, moved from being a loss-making
local airline into profitability, and became a significant player on
the world stage. This year it will be looking for more partners.

These are some of the year's highlights:

* After four years of losses, which totalled R254m (#45m), it announced
at the end of its financial year on March 31 that it had shown a profit
of more than R217m for fiscal 1995. In terms of sales that made it the
35th biggest airline in the world, and the second biggest in terms of
profit sales.

* It was unable to cope fully with demand. From Germany load factors
averaged 91% for the year. They were higher between SA and Britain. To
provide more seats it bought a 767 and its fleet of 747-SPs, which were
on sale at bargain-basement prices, were taken off the market,
refurbished quickly and brought back into service.  And in November it
ordered two new Boeing 747-400s and nine new Boeing 777s.

* In the middle of December Deputy President Thabo Mbeke announced that
the government was looking for a strategic partner for SAA. That's
another way of saying the process of privatising the airline has begun,
which pleased the private sector, but angered the unions who translated
it into job losses. They retaliated by calling a number of strikes.

* Two days after the first strike SAA and Lufthansa, Europe's biggest
airline, announced a partnership agreement (which does not, at this
stage, include taking equity in each other's operation) in Frankfurt.
It will, says SA Airways' CE Mike Myburgh, boost his airline's bottom
line. He claims that without it SAA would have floundered before the
end of the century.

Looking for a strategic partner

Myburgh is pleased - upbeat may be a better word - government is
looking for a strategic partner for the airline, a partner that will
take equity.

He explains: "Without it we would not be able to attract share capital.
Government has been unwilling to increase its share capital in SAA. We
need more capital to help us balance our debt and make it easier for us
to pay for our new aircraft.

"In our present situation, where cash flows are high because our load
factors are very high, and we don't have enough aircraft to take full
advantage of our denser routes, it would be easy to finance the
purchase of those aircraft out of loans. But it would be very difficult
to do that in leaner times."

He thinks the timing of Mbeke's announcement was right. "We showed a
healthy profit last year and are likely to show another one this year,
which makes us attractive to investors. Had the decision been taken in
lean years we would have had to look for investors on their terms.

"We believe the economy will continue to grow for a few years and dip
only in 1998. A partnership will give us access to the finance,
technology  and expertise we were denied in the past."

On the question of who SAA would choose as partners, he said: "The
strong commercial alliances we have built up over the years with, for
example, American Airlines, British Midland, Ansett and very recently
Lufthansa, are important to us and we believe it would be advantageous
to us if we gave them preference.

"We would rather have another airline than a financial institution
become our strategic partner. An airline can get more out of a
relationship with another airline than it can with a financial
institution which, of necessity, would be interested mainly in the
growth of its shares and dividends. By working with another airline we
can do things together, we can build up routes together, even in lean
times, and we can use our combined equipment (aircraft) more
advantageously.

"We would probably also go to the SA market, give black investors the
inside track, and then go to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).

"We would, obviously, make shares available for our employees. I have
been working very hard at promoting emotional ownership of the airline
by getting staff involved in our gainshare scheme - we keep 70% of
super achievement (growth that exceeds a set target) and share the
remaining 30% among staff members. If we can offer financial ownership
as well we will improve staff commitment to the airline."

He understands why the announcement upset the unions. "It does seem as
if the government didn't consult sufficiently with them before making
their intention public. From what Cosatu (the Congress of SA Trade
Unions) has said it could lead to ongoing trouble, but if we talk to
the unions - and that's a very important item on our agenda for the
next few weeks - we can sort out the problem.

"They understood our reasoning for retrenching more than 2000 people
two years ago, why shouldn't they understand what government has in
mind now?'

SA AGRICULTURAL PROSPECTS SOAR

Both general morale in the nation and the country's economic growth
prospects for 1996 have ben materially boosted by the copious rains
experienced over large parts of South Africa since early in December
1995.

Many water restrictions introduced in numerous areas in October last
year affecting households have been lifted in line with the significant
boost to dam levels, with the Vaal Dam now 100% full for the first time
since 1989. Underground water reserves have been replenished,
irrigation dams boosted, and good grazing conditions in most areas are
guaranteed for the next nine months or so.

A few maize crops are waterloggied after the exceptionally heavy rains,
 but the overall picture is very promising, and if normal rainfall
occurs in the rest of January and February the national crop could well
exceed 10 tons compared with 4.23 tons last year.  A record crop,
however, is unlikely since this year's maize area is around 3m
hectares, which  is well below the past 10 year average of 3.5 m. This
reflects diversification on some farms towards sunflower seed,
groundnuts and wheat.

The 1995-96 wheat crop is now estimated to reach some 2.28m tons
compared with 1.83m tons in 1994-95. The country will, however, still
have to import some 360 000 tons to meet total domestic demand of about
2.4 m tons.

Meanwhile, the good rains should boost sugar output by about 25% to
2.1m tons this season, and the amount available for export should
roughly double this year. The country could have between 700 000 and
800 000 tons of sugar available for export this year compared with last
year's export yield of between

350 000 and 400 000 tons.  The sugar industry is indeed looking forward
to its best season in four years.

The agricultural sector now accounts for approximately 5% of the gross
domestic product, and since the output of the sector  could grow by
around 20% this year provided reasonable rains fall in the next month
or so, the overall economy could receive a boost of some 1% from this
source alone. Moreover, there are indirect benefits on top of this,
since  agriculture has a number of important forward and backward
linkages  in the economy. The purchase of tractors and fertilisers, for
instance, are boosted by a good agricultural season.

Some economists are therefore, predicting growth in excess of 4% for
1996, the best performance for 15 years. This in turn partly accounts
for the sharp advance in share prices on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange during the first week of the new year.
