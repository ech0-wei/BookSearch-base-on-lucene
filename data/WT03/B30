BIGGER MAY NOT BE BETTER

The general condition of the U.S. chemical industry in 1995 shows
a pattern of slight production growth, substantially increasing
corporate earnings growth and an equally consistent decline in
employment. This pattern shows certain corporate operating
principles that deserve critical judgement. These are as follows.

     1) Profits will be higher if you pay fewer people.
     2) A declining dollar can create a market without investment
     in the human resource for process improvement and change.
     3) It is possible to meet market demand without production and
     process improvement by expanding older system and design
     concepts. The steel industry is a historical precedent.
     4) The investment in human capital can be forfeit now to be
     recovered in the future at a lower price.

The following reference expresses concern for the next year. The
dollar is gaining value and controls are being relaxed. There are
many  talented people in the marketplace. It should not be long
before "mom and pop" operations can distribute rubbing alcohol to
the local pharmacies at half the price. Microbrewries are now a
commonplace on the east coast. At a price they offer quality and
choice not available since before prohibition. Long Island now has
its own wine industry. It will soon recognize that its potato crop
would be useful for production and pipeline delivery of vodka to be
drunk in Manhattan and shipped world wide from the Port of New
York. A right-of-way along the Long Island Railroad will do.

Most of the processes operating in the chemical industry now can
and will be copied and improved by the Chinese. Chemical production
is an ongoing process of growth based on improvement. There are
many aspects to improvement. Purity, safety, reliability, speed,
applications of new materials and computer resources are examples.
The present state of affairs is a one way ticket to obsolescence.

SILICON SENSORS

Few materials can compare to silicon for its usefulness in sensor
design. The first commercial use of the material was in preparation
of photosensors in 1960. In the last 35 years silicon has not
changed but there have been numerous changes in technology and
market demand that increases its usefulness to the measurement and
instrumentation field.

The following reference describes improvements and devices that
serve new demands. There are 10,000 researchers operating in 200
laboratories that continue the study of silicon sensor devices.
Recent improvement in technology makes controlled doping possible.
It is now possible to make multiwavelength sensor that limit
response as a function of the depth of penetration of the
stimulated carriers.

In addition there are demands that appear out of environmental
monitoring needs and biosensing systems. Surface acoustic waves and
microcalorimetric enzyme catalyst measuring systems are two
examples of these applications. The reference contains many more.

Anyone interested in silicon devices should see this paper. It is
18 pages long with about 100 references. Most of them are to recent
papers.

MICROMACHINING TECHNOLOGY MAKES SMARTER USEFUL SENSORS

Developments in micromachining show considerable advancement in the
fabrication of complex sensors. Earlier work was limited to silicon
optical and pressure sensors. Now there are demonstrations of gas
chromatography on a chip. These devices include valving, a flow
channel and a detector.

There are various applications for these devices, but one of the
more important is biological and biomedical sensing. One
application is the monitoring of biological cells individually. An
example is the observation in vitro of the responses of a cardiac
cell under the influence of various chemicals.

On the small scale of these sensors it is necessary to rethink the
physical properties of familiar materials. The surface tension of
water can have a sealing action on a piston cylinder array.
Chemical sensors based on these devices are currently in commercial
development. Taguchi type sensors on micromachined silicon have an
increased level of versatility. The response time can be controlled
by heaters designed into the system with a fast response and
minimum power.

DIODE-BASED DETECTOR SPEEDS DNA ANALYSIS

Allen Northrup of Lawrence Livermore laboratories describes a
compact assembly that performs the polymerase chain reaction. This
reaction is important in cloning DNA to increase its concentration
for more precise and more rapid detection. It is useful in
detecting viruses, bacteria, mutations associated with cystic
fibrosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

The unit is much smaller than the hardware presently available for
these measurements and promises to be an order of magnitude
cheaper. It replaces a laser with a diode in the detection
circuitry. It uses semiconductor fabrication techniques to prepare
the thermal cycling process. This technology incorporates heaters
and controllers in the silicon chambers. The small size and thermal
mass permits rapid heating and cooling.

The technology duplicates a process developed by Kary Mullis that
received the Nobel prize in 1993. Hardware available before this
development to process samples for cloning was between $7000 and
$14,000, requiring hours of processing. This hardware does the
operation in minutes.

The following reference is descriptive. It  would be improved with
a drawing.

PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES TO STUDY COSMIC RAYS AND NEUTRINOS

Photomultiplier tubes were among the first photosensors. Most
replacements now are the simpler, cheaper and lower voltage solid
state devices. Photomultipliers have not disappeared. They are
particularly well suited for high sensitivity at high energy
because they depend on charges transported in a vacuum. Their
application seems to be increasing. They are particularly useful
for the detection of charged particles in space and on the ground.
Cosmic ray detection is an example.

Cosmic rays exist in showers that bombard the outer atmosphere.
Some of them reach the surface. There is an active interest in
modelling these showers at various places on earth. These charged
species have significant influence on the chemistry of the
atmosphere. An example is the loss of ozone at the poles.
Photomultiplier tubes serve this need.

There also is an interest in using photomultiplier tubes for the
determination of muons and neutrinos under water. This revived
interest by astronomers and physicists is driven by new
applications of an old detector. New designs include devices that
are about the size of a TO-5 can. They still require high voltage.

ACCESSING SENSORS USING INTERNET

A project at the Winooski One hydroelectric dam is operated by the
University of Vermont. It uses the Internet as a sensor interface
to measure multiple parameters such as flow and pressure. The
computers on line can bring generators on line when the water
levels are high enough to drive them effectively. The system
contains 85 fiber optic sensors embedded in the structure.
Maintenance personnel monitor these sensors remotely to provide
service as required.

This is a considerable economy over a system that requires
individuals to be on site to record measurements as needed. The
system is useful for control functions and also information
gathering. Apart from the analog-digital boards that are part of
any instrument measuring system, the computer hardware is in every
way the same as other computer systems. It uses software that is
available for the Apple or the PC system.

There are the usual traffic delays that are part of the operation
of Internet during periods of high usage. These are difficulties
that are not as likely to occur if one limits operations to low
usage intervals, such as between 4 and 6 AM eastern standard time.

The authors advise that it is possible to access the installation
on Internet. The Web address is http://issri.emba.uvm.edu/. This
Internet address contains drawings and data from the installation.
In addition it is possible to download a publication submitted to
the Journal of Smart Materials and Structures that contains more
information.

DETECTING CRYPTOSPORIDIUM

In 1993 cryptosporidium slipped into Milwaukee's water supply
sickening 400,000 people and killing 104. There remains a need for
new methods of detection and control of these pathogens. The
current law requires a turbidity standard for potable water
delivery. That does not distinguish the viable from the non-viable
5 micron size cryptosporidia.

There are manual test systems for filtration and tagging of the
filtrate with fluorescent materials. These have about 30% error.
Algae and other materials bind with the fluorescent dye and tend to
give false positive results. There are other methods discussed.
Most do not have a measurement capability for use in protecting the
public health.

All the proposed methods are laboratory intensive. They do not
appear to be suitable for continuous analysis. The problem is
further complicated because the intrusion may only occur
periodically, when there is heavy rain. This is a condition that
inspires complacency.

IMPROVED METHOD OF FABRICATION OF NICKEL-METAL HYDRIDE BATTERY

The demand for cheap portable power continues to stir development
of economic processes of producing batteries. A current focus is on
nickel-metal hydride systems in which energy is produced by
reacting the hydride on a catalytic surface exposed to oxygen or
air. Among other applications the large economic interest is in
clean energy sources for automobiles.

These systems are of particular interest because they can be
recharged electrically by discharging oxygen and reforming hydride.
They also can be charged by supplying gases. They are inherently
clean sources of energy and light in weight. The following
references are to work being done in Sweden

An element of cost in fabricating a metal hydride system is in the
fabrication of the electrodes. The second reference describes a
continuous process to do this. This process involves the rolling
fabrication of a band with one side of nickel hydroxide and the
other of mischmetal required to form the hydride.

The following papers describe the performance characteristics of
the prototype devices. Summaries include changes that will be
necessary to accommodate this technology to electric vehicle
applications.

Electrochemical Society, Vol. 142, No. 12, pp. 4040-4045, December

MODEL FOR METALLIC ELECTROMIGRATION FAILURE

Why would a circuit board that has operated within specification
for a long time fail after six years? There may be several answers
to this question but one may be metallic electromigration between
adjacent anodic and cathodic conductors on the board. The
phenomenon has been recognized since the 70s. It promises to become
a more important concern as multilayer boards find application.

The electromigration phenomenon depends on voltage, humidity,
contamination, distance between electrodes and temperature. To
collect data rapidly observations are generally made at high
voltages, (typically 100 volts). The process occurs more slowly at
10 volts.

The following reference is part of a larger tutorial effort to
focus interest on failure processes. It provides documented
information on the factors that influence the processes involved in
the dendritic growth resulting from metallic electromigration. In
a given application environment these failure processes should
follow a Weibull distribution.
**Krumbein, S.J., IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Vol. 44, No. 4,
pp. 539-549, December (1995)**
NOTE: On page 602 of IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Vol. 44, No.
4, we are advised that much of the federal funding for the very
useful MIL-STD (Military Standards on reliability) is being
transferred to other sources or abandoned. This will be a change in
access and should be examined by those interested in maintaining
access to this information.

Teikoku Sen-i Posts First Profit in 7 Terms


   Teikoku Sen-i <3302>, a textile maker specializing in linen,
has posted nearly 400 million yen in current profits for the
term to December 1995, marking a substantial gain from last
term's 517 million yen in current losses.  Teikoku saw the
effects from rationalization, and national disaster prevention
consciousness contributed to an increase in demand for related
products.  Sales rose 4% to 16 billion yen, and operating
profits reached nearly 700 million yen aided by decreased sales
and administration costs.

Mitsui Mining Ups Copper Foil Production


   Mitsui Mining & Smelting <5706> will expand printed circuit
board-use copper foil operations by 30%, with an investment of
10 billion yen over three years.  The capital will be applied to
operations at five overseas production points.  The company will
also reinforce sales to the West by offering a special copper
foil developed in cooperation with U.S. makers of copper-covered
resin boards.  Mitsui Mining already holds a 40% slice of the
world pie in copper foil production, with aggregate monthly
output of 3,600 tons.  The heightened operating capacity should
put the company in the forefront of the industry worldwide.

Republicans like [New York Rep. Sherwood] Boehlert already
recognize the depth of support for environmental controls,
and they are trying to encourage the party to temper its
stand so it's not anti-environmental," said Doug MacMillan,
executive director for the Environmental Technology Council.
"What they hear in their districts will make them recognize
the depth of public support for it." Superfund Reform '95
Executive George Baker agreed that should GOP legislators
fail to push through environmental reforms, especially to
Superfund, Republicans could "lose the political public
relations war" and could be deemed anti-environment.
"They've allowed their opponents to forecast them as rolling
back" environmental controls, he said.

   EPA, meanwhile, must stand firm with its environmental
policies as Congress attempts to reduce agency staffing and
budget, MacMillan added. Since 1994, "EPA has reversed
course on number of important environmental policies in an
apparent attempt to placate some of its adversaries," he
said. Along with making public statements supporting strict
environmental standards, the agency must not backpeddle on
its regulations. EPA cannot be "talking a good game, while
quietly surrendering to its opposition," he said.


JOIN THE CLUB - EPA began preparing to shut down the federal
Superfund program Jan. 2. The agency is unable to pay nearly
2,000 of its own employees in the program, and 8,000
contractors who perform remediation work. Superfund was not
affected immediately by the federal shutdown because most of
these employees are paid directly from the fund, rather than
from budget appropriations, said Jim Mathews, deputy
assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Solid Waste and
Emergency Response (HWN, Dec. 18, 1995, p. 399). Though
Congress has not reauthorized the program nor issued its
allotment for the next fiscal year, Superfund has operated
since October off a surplus in last year's fund, Mathews
said. That money will run out Jan. 2, and the agency will
begin shutting down the program. Only emergency personnel
will continue working, reducing the agency's program
employees from more than 3,000 to only 80. Several large
Superfund sites will continue cleanups during the shutdown,
while many will cease operations, he said. Contact: Jim
Mathews, EPA, (202) 260-4610.

SUPERFUND REFORM BILLS COULD PLACE
BURDEN ON STATE CLEANUP PROGRAMS


   Superfund reform bills now stalled in Congress may place
a larger burden on state cleanups, or halt remediation
activities outright, according to several state
environmental officials.

   H.R. 2500, proposed by Rep. Michael Oxley (R-Ohio), and
S. 1285, proposed by Sen. Robert Smith (R-N.H.), could
create an intense burden on state remediation programs, Kris
Hoellen, assistant deputy director for the Washington-based
Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management
Officials told the National Council of State Legislatures at
the council's annual meeting Dec. 14 in Washington. Under
these bills, litigation could increase from sites that
already have selected a remedy if they find a more cost-
effective method. State officials also fear the bills would
cap the number of National Priorities List (NPL) sites,
leaving states to fund many cleanups themselves.

   Oxley's bill would pre-empt states from enacting cleanup
standards more stringent than federal levels, Hoellen said.
Smith's bill, however, would allow states to pay the
difference for tougher standards, but it is unlikely states
would not have the funds to enforce further site remediation
beyond federal standards, she said.

   The House version of Superfund reform would cap the NPL
at 125 sites over the next seven years, while 90 sites would
be allowed over three years on the Senate side. There now
are 1,700 NPL-qualified sites EPA has yet to place on the
list, Hoellen said. Shifting these sites to state authority
could overwhelm state agencies, she added.

   Pre-enforcement litigation would greatly hinder site
cleanups, Hoellen told HWN. Both bills would allow parties
to reopen remedy cases if they show they can save at least
$1 million using another method. In addition, the Senate
version of the bill would shift more program costs to the
states, compared with cost-sharing provisions in Oxley's
bill, she said.

   Many states also do not want to pay for orphan shares,
Hoellen said. Particularly, states do not want large
potentially responsible parties cashed out of liability,
which could leave state agencies "holding the bag," she
said.

   If either bill passes in its present form, all new work
on existing sites will stop, said Ed Putnam, associate
director of remediation planning and design for the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. New Jersey
could only continue ongoing work, he said. Superfund would
continue to fund immediate contamination removal programs,
but states could not afford to take additional remedial
action, he added.

   "There always has been competition for funds among state
regulatory agencies," Putnam said. "There's simply going to
be more competition" if Congress reforms Superfund.

   Remediators would not be able to remove contaminated soil
from some sites, preferring to close off the area, he said.
Furthermore, states would not clean aquifers, preferring to
monitor plumes and treat contaminated wells, Putnam said.

   Putnam finds no significant difference for states between
the bills. Both make the pursuit of funding competitive
between states. "It's just a question of how competitive,"
he said.

Reauthorization Still Up in the Air

   A more pressing question for states is the future of
Superfund, which lacks a reauthorization bill and its taxing
authority, Putnam said. "Superfund is stalled; there is no
new work occurring," he said. Faced with the possibility of
significant changes in the law possibly months away and a
dwindling funding mechanism, it is difficult for states to
make any long-term plans for Superfund remediation, Putnam
said.

   Spending money and manpower to maintain retroactive
liability costs more than it would to repeal it, said a
commercial consultant who deals in government affairs.

   If the remedy process is not reformed, states could not
afford remediation, the consultant told HWN. There are many
state agencies who are competent enough to handle cleanups
more efficiently than EPA can, he said. "There are a number
of states embarrassed by EPA's performance" in Superfund
cleanups, he added.

   States do not spend nearly as much money on cleanups as
EPA, the consultant said. Particularly, states historically
do not take as long to select a remedy or to complete
cleanups.

   Though EPA is blaming the Republican Congress for
stalling the Superfund program, the consultant criticized
President Clinton, who vetoed the recent Veteran's
Administration/Department of Housing and Urban Development
bill last month that would have extended Superfund taxes. In
addition, EPA has been dragging its feet in assisting with a
compromise Superfund reauthorization bill, he added. "EPA
has been working overtime to stop the bill," he said.

SUPERFUND REFORM BILLS TOP THE LIST
OF KEY CONCERNS FOR UPCOMING YEAR


   Congressional action on Republican Superfund reforms this
year could significantly alter the course of how hazardous
waste is managed, affecting many aspects ranging from
impending rulemaking to technology, according to several
industry analysts.

   Superfund reform, a priority on the Republican agenda, is
expected to be the key issue in the industry in 1996. Many
Democrats have criticized the reform efforts so far, but GOP
members likely will collaborate more this year with their
colleagues across the aisle to approve a reform package,
said George Baker, executive director of Superfund Reform
'95. The debate should move rapidly because 1996 is an
election year, and most work will be completed by August to
gear up for elections in the fall, he said.

   Republicans "need Democrats to be comfortable with [the
reforms], and get broad support from industry, small
businesses and municipalities," Baker said. "These reforms
are needed to effectively clean up a number of sites
faster." Once a reform package is adopted, Superfund
reauthorization should proceed smoothly, he added.

   Congressional delays on Superfund reform last year
frustrated members of the Chemical Manufacturers Association
(CMA). As the debate drags on, the association is concerned
that legislators will tinker with proposed bills further,
allowing more exemptions. "We're getting to the point where
deals will be made here and there," said CMA spokesman Matt
Weinstock. "As long as it floats around, there are more
chances for industry to make carveouts. Congress needs to
get this thing done without creating a new unfair system."

   CMA also urges Congress to pass H.R. 2036. The bill would
streamline land disposal restrictions under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (see story, this page).
"The bill will make management of waste fairer and easier to
comply," Weinstock said, praising the bipartisan effort to
approve the bill. "If we could have had that effort on
Superfund, we'd be done."

   EPA's Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR),
scheduled for promulgation late this year, also may impact
hazardous waste management (HWN, Dec. 4, 1995, p. 384).
However, Title 9 of H.R. 2500, Rep. Michael Oxley's (R-Ohio)
Superfund reform bill, could render HWIR moot. Officials
with the Environmental Technology Council (ETC) oppose this
portion of the bill because it would allow states to adopt
provisions freeing the management of remediation waste from
RCRA's Subtitle C requirements or the Toxic Substance
Control Act.

   "We believe some modified national standards for hot
spots makes sense for Superfund and RCRA waste," said ETC
Executive Director Doug MacMillan. "If the bill passes,
there will be no purpose to go forward with the [HWIR]
contaminated media rule" to be proposed soon.

   Superfund reforms also could severely hamper marketing
innovative technologies for hazardous waste this year. Bills
in the House and Senate largely favor closing off a
hazardous site rather than seeking permanent remediation,
MacMillan said. "That will be a serious disincentive for
innovative site cleanup technology," he said. "Why worry
about detoxifying waste if you can fence a site off or
provide alternatives to water supply?"

   EPA anticipates proposing its hazardous waste combustion
strategy this year, which has been a bone of contention in
recent years between hazardous waste incinerators and cement
kilns. The agency is slated to propose emission standards
for cement kilns and to determine proper handling of cement
kiln dust. "If EPA could get some realistic, applicable
standards for air emissions and for combustion residues, the
long-running controversies would die down," MacMillan said.
"That would be positive because the arguments between the
various groups have eroded the general public's confidence
about combustion."

LAND DISPOSAL RESTRICTIONS
H.R. 2036 APPROVED IN COMMITTEE;
BILL REQUIRES REPORT ON RELEASES


   EPA next year may ask particular landfills and treatment
systems accepting treated hazardous waste to provide data
for a five-year study on the threat of the sites' waste
stream to human health and the environment.

   The House Commerce Committee Dec. 21 passed H.R. 2036,
the Land Disposal Flexibility Act, with relatively minor
amendments. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Michael Oxley (R-
Ohio), passed the committee's Commerce, Trade and Hazardous
Materials Subcommittee in November (HWN, Dec. 11, 1995, p.
394).

   The measure would allow EPA to set land disposal
standards now prohibited by a federal court decision. The
agency in 1990 exempted from Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA) standards treated hazardous waste at
treatment systems regulated under the Clean Water Act and
nonhazardous deep injection wells regulated under the Clean
Drinking Water Act. In 1992, however, the Washington, D.C.,
District Court directed EPA to apply RCRA standards to these
wastes, which some industry officials said adds up to $800
million annually in compliance costs.

   Democrats worked extensively with Republican committee
members to pass the bill to the House floor, with Rep.
Blanche Lambert Lincoln (D-Ark.) working with Oxley to
address many Democratic concerns. The committee passed an
amendment offered by Lincoln calling for EPA to complete
within five years a study on these sites to determine if
releases are threatening the ground water or human health.
Ranking Democrat Rep. John Dingell (Mich.) warned that
setting a deadline on the study could lead to further court
action, yet did not oppose Lincoln's amendment.

   Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) expressed the strongest
opposition to the bill, calling for an EPA study completed
within three years, whereupon the agency must take action on
the study's findings. Wastewaters from these sites can have
concentrations of toxins up to 99 times drinking water
standards, thereby necessitating quick action on these risk
reports, he said. "Decharacterized waste containing
hazardous constituents may leak from surface impoundments at
the same levels of concerns as listed waste streams,"
Pallone said.

   Several members opposed the amendment, saying it would
require EPA to depend on old data to meet the three-year
deadline, and would force the agency to spend more time and
resources on waste that does not cause a significant threat
to the environment. Committee members sought to push the
bill through Congress before Jan. 17, the court-issued
deadline for the EPA rules to take affect. Contact: Nandan
Kenkeremath, majority counsel, (202) 226-2424.

DIOXIN
ASME REPORT FINDS MINIMAL LINKAGE
BETWEEN CHLORINE, DIOXIN EMISSIONS


   No significant correlation is shown between the type or
amount of chlorine in waste burned in hazardous waste
combustors (HMCs) and the concentrations of dioxin and furan
emissions (PCDD/F) measured at the stack, according to a
recent study by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(ASME).

   ASME analyzed more than 1,900 test results of hazardous,
solid, biomass and medical waste combustors. Limiting the
chlorine content of combustor feedstocks has little or no
effect on the composition or quantity of dioxin emitted,
states the report, The Relationship Between Chlorine in
Waste Streams and Dioxin Emissions from Waste Combustor
Stacks.

   HMCs studied in the report include hazardous waste
incinerators (HWIs), fired boilers and cement kilns. The
concentration of chlorine in the feed stocks for the
generators ranges from less than 0.1 percent for many
biomass combustors up to 80 percent for some HWIs, the study
says. The tests were done at 169 facilities - including 74
hazardous waste combustors - where chlorine and PCDD/F
emissions were measured.

   PCDD/F and chlorine were "simultaneously characterized"
at 107 units in 90 facilities. The data was checked to
identify errors and statistical problems, standardized to
reflect common reference conditions and analyzed to
determine if either the composition of PCDD/F concentrations
or the quantity of those composition changed, ASME states in
the report.

   Tests in 72 waste facilities showed no significant
relationship between chlorine input and PCDD/F measured in
the gas streams. In many of the tests, the combustion units
were "spiked" with larger amounts of chlorinated plastics,
or polyvinyl chloride, to determine if a higher chlorine
content in the waste fuel produced any measure of dioxin,
ASME explains. Cement kilns "displayed no apparent stack gas
PCDD/F concentration increase with increasing chlorine feed
rate," the report states. The result "is not surprising,
since chlorine is frequently added to remove natural alkalis
and produce Portland cement meeting federal and state
construction standards," ASME says.

   The study was not intended to evaluate control systems
performance, generate new data, assess the relationship
between PCDD/F and chlorine in liquid effluents or solid
residues, or to evaluate the removal of particulate-bound
PCDD/F in emission control devices, ASME says.

   "The failure to find simultaneous increases in most
cases, and finding a few inverse relationships, indicates
that whatever effect feed chlorine has on PCDD/F
concentrations in flue gases, it is smaller than the
influence of other causative factors," the society states in
the report. "Any effect chlorine has on PCDD/F
concentrations in commercial scale systems is a factor of
air pollution control system temperature, ash chemistry,
combustion conditions, imprecise measurement and localized
flow stratification." For a copy of the 663-page report,
contact John Varrasi, ASME, (212) 705-8158.

SUPERFUND
LOVE CANAL AGREEMENT EXEMPLIFIES
NEED FOR QUICKER SETTLEMENTS: CMA


   Some chemical industry analysts hope congressional
reforms to Superfund encourage responsible parties to pay
cleanup costs more swiftly, saying a settlement last month
for remediation costs at the infamous Love Canal Superfund
site in New York typifies the need for quicker action.

   The Occidental Chemical Corp. Dec. 21 agreed to pay $129
million over four years to EPA and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) to cover cleanup costs at the Love
Canal site. Under the settlement, EPA will receive $102
million, and FEMA, which relocated area residents and began
site cleanup, will get $27 million.

   Occidental's corporate predecessor, Hooker Chemicals &
Plastics Corp., buried more than 20,000 tons of chemical
waste from 1942 to 1953. Although a housing development
later was built on the site, hundreds of families were
forced to leave these homes in the late 1970s to allow crews
to remediate the site. The site's cleanup costs eventually
lead to the creation of Superfund in 1980.

   In addition, New York originally sought $630 million in
damages from Occidental, but the company in 1994 agreed to
pay the state $98 million. Occidental's suits with the city
of Niagara Falls and several former residents still are
pending.

   "This reaffirms the definite need to move on legislative
reforms so we don't have these cases hanging around for 11
or 12 years," said Chemical Manufacturers Association
spokesman Matt Weinstock, who doubts the settlement will
spark other large Superfund payback agreements. "I'd like to
think things will continue on a case-by-case basis."

   A key EPA official agreed the Superfund program needs
genuine reform, yet not as stringent as Republican bills
proposed in Congress. "We need to speed cleanups and lower
costs so that more property can be returned to communities
for productive use," said EPA Region 2 Administrator Jeanne
Fox. "The lessons learned at Love Canal have been
successfully applied at hundreds of abandoned waste sites
around the country, where toxic threats to public health
have been removed."

   Claims in GOP reform bills stating 40 percent of taxpayer
funding for Superfund goes to litigation are untrue, Fox
said. "That figure refers to the legal costs to private
parties involved in suits and countersuits, often with their
insurance companies," she added. Contact: Howard Collins,
Occidental, (310) 443-6523.

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
BAN ON U.S. IMPORT OF PCBS PROVOKES
CANADIAN COMPANIES TO SUE MINISTRY


   An Ohio company's recent exemption from EPA to import
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from Canada for treatment
led the Canadian government to ban PCB exports from Canada.
Several Canadian companies, in turn, have filed a lawsuit
against Canada's Environment Ministry.

   EPA Nov. 15 granted S.D. Myers, an Ohio-based hazardous
waste treatment firm, a special exemption to import PCBs for
treatment at the firm's Talmadge, Ohio, plant. The next day,
Sheila Copps, Canada's environment minister, issued an
interim ban on the company's exportation of the carcinogenic
chemicals, said Dana Myers, president of S.D. Myers.

   The Environment Ministry bowed to pressure from the
Canadian hazardous waste treatment industry, particularly
Chem-Security, a large Edmonton, Alberta-based firm, Myers
said. Officials from Chem-Security could not be reached for
comment. Prior to the ban, the Canadian government granted
Myers permission to import PCBs with EPA's approval.
"Environment Canada asked EPA to open the borders" to PCBs,
Myers said. "After EPA did, Canada slammed them shut."

   After the Environment Ministry issued the interim ban,
two Canadian firms, General Waste Transport Inc. and the
Quebec Center for the Environment, sued the Environment
Ministry Dec. 19 to lift the ban. The Environment Ministry
issued the ban under the Canadian Environmental Protection
Act. Copps implemented an interim ban from one rule and
applied it to a different rule, which invalidates the ban,
Myers told HWN.

   The companies are bringing Copps and Canadian Attorney
General Allan Rock to court on two separate grounds. First,
Copps did not have the authority to enact the ban because
human health is not threatened with the transport of PCBs
across national borders, said Douglas Hamilton, a partner in
the Toronto firm of Osler & Hoskin, and the attorney
representing General Waste Transport. The ban also would
retain Chem-Security's monopoly of the Canadian PCB
remediation market, thus invalidating the ban, Myers added.
The firms are reviewing Environment Ministry procedures in
implementing the ban to determine if it had the necessary
backing of the Ministry of Health, Hamilton said.
Environment Ministry officials could not be reached for
comment. Contact: Dana Myers, S.D. Myers, (216) 633-2666;
Art Mathis, Chem-Security, (403) 235-8300.

CIEC BIOSOLIDS TECHNOLOGY CUTS NOX
EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA CEMENT KILNS


   The Cement Industry Environmental Consortium (CIEC)
recently unveiled its biosolids injection technology, which
reduces nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and disposes
wastewater sludge.

   The process uses ammonia in the sludge to convert NOx
into a stable, non-toxic gas, CIEC officials said. The
technology mixes sludge with combustion gases from cement
kilns.

   The consortium now is testing the process at the
Mitsubishi Cement Corp. plant in Cushenbury, Calif., the
state's largest cement plant. Use of biosolids injection has
reduced NOx emissions by 45 percent, while treating 10
percent of Southern California's wastewater sludge, CIEC
said.

   Biosolids injection can help cement kilns meet strict
Clean Air Act standards, CIEC said. Contact: Robert Kahn,
CIEC, (206) 236-7200.

CHICAGO BROWNFIELDS FORUM RELEASES
MODEL FINANCING GUIDELINES FOR BANKS


   The Chicago Brownfields Forum (CBF), seeking ways to make
brownfield redevelopment more feasible, last month released
model lending guidelines that may spur bankers to invest in
more abandoned industrial properties.

   The model is designed to allow banks and lending
institutions to extend credit to redevelopment projects,
while protecting the bank's collateral interest and loan
repayment, CBF officials said. The model identifies policies
and procedures lending institutions can follow in financing
redevelopment projects.

   The city-organized forum consists of more than 100 public
and private representatives, including real estate
developers, industry representatives, environmentalists,
government agencies and community groups.

   Chapman & Cutler, a Chicago law firm, led the task force
crafting the guidelines. Banks can adopt the model to
existing policy to initiate financing redevelopment
projects, CBF officials said. Brownfield financing has
suffered because lending institutions did not know which
questions to ask developers, so developers did not know what
information to submit, officials said. The package includes
specific requirements developers must satisfy, with forms
and examples.

   CBF developed the policy as an example for other states
with voluntary cleanup plans. Future models will address
financing in states that have no voluntary cleanup program,
CBF officials said. Contact: Bill Trumbull, CBF, (312) 744-
5711.


   COLORADO - The Broomfield City Council last month opposed
a plan to bury hazardous waste at the former Rocky Flats
nuclear weapons plant, near Boulder. In November, the
Department of Energy (DOE) and Kaiser Hill, a DOE
contractor, proposed to expedite cleanup and closure of the
plant. According to the plan, workers would remove the most
hazardous radioactive waste, but low-level waste would be
buried on-site at the plant. Last month, the council passed
a resolution opposing this proposal. The council also sent a
letter to the state officials overseeing the cleanup.
Contact: Patrick Etchart, DOE, (303) 966-5993.

   HAWAII - EPA last month fined the Department of Interior
(DOI), National Parks Service for violating the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) by storing hazardous
waste at the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The facility
stored hazardous waste without a RCRA permit between March
and October. The waste contained acetone, chromium, lead,
xylene, phenol, arsenic and mercury. EPA also cited DOI for
storing waste in rusted, leaking containers. EPA fined the
facility $243,800 and ordered it to develop a hazardous
waste management plan within two months. Contact: Lois
Grunwald, EPA, (415) 744-1588.

   OHIO - EPA last month completed cleanup at the Coshocton
City Landfill Superfund site in Franklin Township. The
remediation activities included construction of a landfill
gas collection and venting system, construction of a
landfill cap, and ground water monitoring. Potentially
responsible parties completed all work, with oversight from
EPA and Ohio state officials. EPA will review the site every
five years as required by law. From 1968-1979, the site was
used as an 80-acre landfill, which accepted various
industrial wastes from several local companies. The site was
added to the National Priorities List in 1983. Contact:
Anthony Rutter, EPA, (312)886-8961.

   MICHIGAN - EPA last month reached agreement with Dow
Chemical Co. for alleged hazardous waste violations at the
company's Midland facility. The agency cited the firm in
September 1993 for failing to meet Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act requirements governing burning hazardous waste
in a boiler. The company failed to develop a written plan to
analyze the hazardous waste burned; failed to determine ash,
chlorine and chloride concentrations in the waste fed to
boilers; and failed to check for leaks in boiler valves, EPA
said. EPA's consent order called for a $167,000 fine and for
Dow to correct the violations. Contact: Michael Cunningham,
EPA, (312) 886-4464.

   WASHINGTON - The Department of Energy (DOE) last month
gave Westinghouse Hanford Co. (WHC) a "good" performance
rating for the six months ending Sept. 30. DOE awarded the
company a grant of more than $1.5 million based on a
detailed department evaluation. This rating was a
significant improvement over the company's last rating of
satisfactory, DOE officials said. DOE cited improved
performance by WHC in tank remediation and facility
stabilization. DOE, however, noted deficiencies in
conducting an operations procedure for radiological control
and in establishing an effective field work procedures plan.

ERM CASE STUDY DEMONSTRATES NEED
FOR UNDERSTANDING OF PERMIT PROCESS


   Industrial plants can face overly burdensome water
quality-based effluent limits (WQBELs) without a clear
understanding of how regulating agencies determine these
limits and assess the data on which the limits are based,
according to a paper presented by William Hall, a senior
project manager with Environmental Resources Management
(ERM) Group.

   The paper, presented recently at the annual Water
Environment Federation conference, outlines how the
consulting firm negotiated with the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Resources (DER) to set less-stringent
WQBELs for a client. The new limits should be less costly
than a draft National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit DER originally prepared for an electronic
components manufacturer, states Hall's study, Negotiating
Less Conservative Water Based Effluent Limits: A Case Study.

   The draft included WQBELs for copper and lead, as well as
fluoride limits based on historical performance. After
studying the draft limits, ERM concluded these limits were
too conservative, and the company would struggle to comply
with them, the report states.

   The manufacturer discharged 330,000 gallons per day of
process wastewater into a large fresh water river. The
proposed fluoride limits included average monthly limits,
maximum daily limits and instantaneous maximum concentration
limits. A review of historical data of effluent discharge
showed the facility could not comply with the state's
average monthly limit, the study said.

   The WQBELs for copper and lead affected four discharge
streams in the facility - three process wastewater
discharges and a cooling water discharge. Studies showed the
plant's wastewater treatment operations, with improvements,
could easily handle the limits set for lead. However, the
company determined the draft copper limits were three times
lower than the best treatment technology could provide, the
study says.

   The low draft limits stemmed partially from
misconceptions about mineral hardness, or concentration, in
the river. ERM recorded the river's hardness data per month.
River hardness peaked during the late summer and early fall,
which coincided with low effluent flow from the plant, ERM
concluded. DER, therefore, raised the WQBEL for copper in
the permit.

   Moreover, ERM determined the slope of the receiving
river, or the difference in elevation between two points
along the river, was less steep where effluent enters than
at other sections along the river. A mild slope gives the
effluent less time to travel downstream and a greater chance
to disperse in a smaller area, the report says.

   DER has since raised the WQBEL for copper from 0.18
milligrams per liter (mg/l) to 0.47 mg/l. DER also raised
the lead limit from 0.29 mg/l to 0.43 mg/l, thereby removing
lead as a water quality-based parameter. DER also raised the
company's average monthly limit for fluoride 2.5 times the
normal limit, the study says.

   "What this case study clearly illustrates is that a
regulatory authority is not responsible for establishing
optimum parameters value to maximize effluent limits while
trying to protect the environment," the report says. "That
responsibility lies with the permittee." The paper is free

***************
SLANTS & TRENDS
***************


THE ASSOCIATION of American Railroads (AAR) last month
completed the consolidation of hazmat and other research
facilities at its Transportation Technology Center (TTC) in
Pueblo, Colo. As part of the consolidation, AAR closed its
Chicago Technical Center (CTC) at the Illinois Institute of
Technology. Thirty CTC employees were relocated to the TTC.

'CONSOLIDATION of our TTC and CTC facilities will result in
annual savings of more than $2 million," AAR President Edwin
Harper said. "By combining AAR's rail research experts and
equipment at one location, we will increase our research
effectiveness and TTC's capacity to attract future research
and development projects."

PRESIDENT CLINTON entered office three years ago this month
pledging to make government more efficient. In keeping with
that promise, the Research and Special Programs
Administration (RSPA) has proposed placing administrative
procedure on its head. On non-controversial rules, RSPA will
promulgate first and ask for comments later (See story, p.
5).

* * *

QUOTE, UNQUOTE: "If a pilot ticketing program is
implemented, shippers should have the opportunity to contest
alleged violations by telephone as well as in writing. There
have been numerous occasions when letters of warning or
verbal warnings have been issued inappropriately due to
incorrect interpretation of the regulations by inspectors.
These enforcement errors can often be resolved over the
telephone. Under the proposed program it appears that the
relative ease of issuing tickets could result in more
penalties being proposed and that tickets could only be
contested in writing." - American Crop Protection
Association, commenting on a RSPA proposal to issue tickets
for minor hazmat transport violations.

* * *

RSPA SURVIVED 1995 INTACT. A Clinton administration proposal
to combine the Department of Transportation's 10 agencies
into three modal offices apparently got lost in the
legislative shuffle last year.

RSPA Clarifications

     Selective testing: Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee,
asked whether alternative closure methods for packages may
be used interchangeably without retesting, so long as the
packages provide an equivalent level of performance.

     RSPA responded that under the agency's Selective
Testing Variation 4 [Section 178.601(g)(ii) of the Hazardous
Materials Regulations], testing is not required when the
structural design of the tested-out packaging, including
methods of closure, "is maintained." The agency added,
"Thus, any change to the originally tested closure results
in a different packaging design type requiring design
qualification testing."

     Competent authority: The Glidden Co., Cleveland, asked
whether it would need a Competent Authority Permit Number
from the U.S. Transportation Department, and display that
number on all shipping papers, to export a product in RSPA-
approved UN1A2 (open-head) drums. The International Maritime
Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code generally requires shipments to
be made in steel, closed-head drums unless another type of
drum is permitted under competent authority.

     RSPA responded that so long as the U.S. company
complies with the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) it
has permission from competent authority and does not need
other documentation. "The RSPA associate administrator for
hazardous materials safety is the United States Competent
Authority for purposes of the IMDG Code," RSPA said. "The
provisions contained in the HMR constitute competent
authority approval for the United States for transportation
of hazardous materials in instances where the IMDG code ...
specifically permit[s] a variation based on the approval of
competent authority."

     Reportable quantity: The Technical Group Inc.,
Washington, asked whether it is better to rely on the
intended formulation "batch sheet" information or on the
actual laboratory analysis of the end product to determine
whether the lead content of a material meets or exceeds its
assigned reportable quantity of 10 pounds per package.

     RSPA said it is the shipper's duty to classify a hazmat
properly, and the agency "does not prescribe a particular
method a shipper must follow in determining whether a
material is a hazardous substance." Added RSPA: "If any
constituent equals or exceeds its listed RQ per package,
then the material meets the definition of a hazardous
substance. Therefore, if the amount of lead content in a
material equals or exceeds 10 pounds per package, the
material is a hazardous substance."

     Unflanged heads: New Progress Inc., Arthur, Ill., asked
whether Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations
permit cargo tanks with unflanged heads to be used to
transport hazmat. New Progress said if DOT rules allow, the
company would proceed with building chassis-mounted truck
tanks with unflanged heads.

     RSPA had bad news for the company: DOT regulations
prohibit the use of tanks with unflanged heads. "Unflanged
heads have no radius and are unacceptable," RSPA said.
"Flanged heads having a knuckle radius less than that
permitted by Section 178.346-1(d)(3) [of the Hazardous
Materials Regulations] also are not acceptable."

     Made in the USA: Olympic IBC Corp, Kirkland, Wash.,
asked whether it may apply the "USA" mark to bulk containers
the company primarily manufactures at its affiliate in
Mexico. Because it takes full responsibility for the
markings and the final step of manufacture is completed in
the United States, Olympic IBC said it believes the
containers may be marked USA.

     However, the company is wrong, RSPA said. Under the
agency's HM-215A rule, RSPA said, "A USA marked packaging
should be manufactured and marked only in the U.S." The rule
is published in the Dec. 29, 1994, Federal Register.

     Shipping, fueling: Consolidated Edison Company of New
York Inc., New York, asked whether the Hazardous Materials
Regulations, which apply to cylinders used as shipping
containers, apply to cylinders used as part of a system to
fuel a compressed natural gas-powered vehicle.

     "Cylinders used as fuel tanks for propulsion and not to
transport cargo are not subject to regulation under the
federal hazardous materials transportation law or the
Hazardous Materials Regulations," RSPA responded.

     "In addition, as long as those cylinders are mounted on
your vehicles and used only as fuel tanks, there is no legal
requirement to reinspect or retest them under the
exemption," the agency stated. "Therefore, you may make your
own determinations about what reinspections and retests are
necessary for safety purposes."

RSPA IMPROPERLY CEDES AUTHORITY
UNDER TICKET PROPOSAL, NPCA SAYS


     The Research and Special Programs Administration, in a
proposal to ticket hazmat violations that do not
substantially harm safety, improperly surrenders much of its
hazmat oversight responsibility to the U.S. Coast Guard, a
group of paint-makers, suppliers and distributors has told
RSPA.

     The National Paint and Coatings Association (NPCA) also
derided the proposal as ambiguous and a way to discourage
companies from paying fines, even as the group  praised RSPA
for trying to simplify hazmat enforcement procedures.
Nevertheless, the focus of the association's objections is
RSPA's proposal to have Coast Guard hearing officers handle
shippers' appeals of these tickets.

     Under the controversial proposal, RSPA inspectors would
be allowed to write tickets for violations that have "no
substantial impact on safety," including: operating under an
expired exemption, neglecting to register, failing to
maintain training records and not filing incident reports.
The tickets would state the facts supporting the alleged
violation and a penalty amount "substantially less than the
penalty that would be proposed under current procedures,"
RSPA stated.

Coast Guard Would Hear Cases

     Other provisions of RSPA's proposal would give alleged
violators the choice of paying the ticket or contesting the
proposed penalty within 30 days of receipt. Companies
contesting the ticket would have a hearing before a U.S.
Coast Guard hearing officer, a proposal NPCA derided as
unfair to industry.

     "Final resolution of alleged violations by the Coast
Guard, without any recourse back to RSPA, is troubling
because the industry is not familiar with Coast Guard
procedures and the industry is unsure of the Coast Guard's
familiarity with RSPA regulations and the practice of the
motor transportation industry," NPCA said.

     "Although the Coast Guard may have some expertise with
hazardous materials regulations as they relate to maritime
shipping, the Coast Guard has no history of interaction with
motor carriers," the group added. "Therefore, they are not
familiar with the general practices of the industry and this
fact will be an obstacle to a smooth resolution of these
cases."

     NPCA urged RSPA to increase its own role in the
proposal by giving alleged violators a right to appeal the
Coast Guard's decision to the RSPA administrator. After all,
RSPA would be the agency that enforces the Coast Guard's
ruling, the association added.

     "RSPA's desire to offload some of the burden of
handling 'insubstantial' violations through a ticketing
program...to better service cases or violations that do
concern safety issues is laudable," NPCA said. "However,
even in cases where there is no substantial impact on
safety, there may come a time during the resolution process
that the enforcing agency's office needs to examine the
case."

     In addition to its objection regarding the Coast
Guard's role, NPCA said RSPA has failed to define adequately
what the agency means by "no substantial impact" on safety.
"Although it does seem clear that the ticketing option will
only be used for the seemingly innocuous recordkeeping type
of violations, there is no built-in mechanism within the
proposal that clearly establishes succinct boundaries for
inclusion in the program," NPCA said.

Proposal Would Discourage Payment

     RSPA's proposal to permit minor violations to count
against a shipper's safety record, and thereby increase the
company's penalties for future violations, will discourage
the payment of fines. Companies, instead of paying the fines
immediately, would try their luck at a hearing, thereby
delaying payments, the association added.

     "If the ticketing proposal is meant to be a streamlined
method of dealing with 'insubstantial' violations and will
result in a certain percentage of cases being moved away
from RSPA, RSPA will want to encourage companies to
participate in this new streamlined process," NPCA said.

     "If, however, companies learn that the most innocuous
'insubstantial' violations will result in escalating fines
or other ramifications (like an increase in insurance
premiums because of a number of tickets, being published in
the year-end report of violations with a list of tickets),
there will be no incentive to pay the ticket," NPCA added.
"Faced with escalating fines or other ramifications, most
companies will choose to contest the ticket."

     RSPA's ticket proposal was published in the Aug. 21
Federal Register. Contact: RSPA's Office of Chief Counsel,

PE%A ANNOUNCES DELAY
IN NAFTA CROSSINGS


     Approval for trucking companies wishing to conduct
cross-border traffic between the United States and Mexico
under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is on
hold until U.S. and Mexican transportation officials meet
and further "improve safety and security measures,"
Department of Transportation (DOT) Secretary Federico Pe$a
said Dec. 18.

     Under NAFTA, Mexican and U.S. truckers were to be
allowed to cross the border and operate throughout those
U.S. and Mexican states along the border starting Dec. 18.

     Mexican drivers wanting to operate past the up-to-15-
mile commercial zone must file for approval from the
Interstate Commerce Commission's successor agency. Though
that agency, the Surface Transportation Board, will take
applications from Mexican truckers, approval will be
withheld until safety meetings occur, Pe$a said.

Mexico: Move Violates NAFTA

     Since the announcement, the Mexican government wrote to
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor declaring the U.S.
delay a violation of the principles of the agreement and
threatening to file a complaint under NAFTA's enforcement
mechanism. U.S. officials expressed surprise about the
Mexican complaints, saying the Mexican government knew of
the U.S. intent far in advance.

     And, said Kantor in a return letter excerpted in The
Washington Post, despite the Mexicans' concerns, "we must
first and foremost ensure the safety and security of our
citizens."

     The trucking industry, cautiously concerned when Pe$a
first announced the delay, became "outraged" as the week
went on, said Linda Bauer-Darr, vice president of
international relations at the American Trucking
Associations (ATA). "Obviously, there is no deadline" to end
the delay, Bauer-Darr said. "Obviously [the delay] was
brought about because of political pressures.

     "This is not a good way to be conducting business ...
with our important trading partners," Bauer-Darr said.

     As Dec. 18 approached, safety advocates such as
Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways (CRASH) and unions
such as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters stepped
up protests to the pending opening of the border.

     The groups contend Mexican trucks do not meet state and
federal standards regarding safety, weight or insurance and
that Mexican drivers are not sufficiently trained in hazmat
procedures. They also contend state and federal officials in
the United States are not sufficiently staffed, funded or
prepared to enforce U.S. safety standards on the Mexican
trucks. Officials in the four border states - Arizona,
California, New Mexico and Texas - share those worries.

     Giving in to pressure from those groups will hurt the
U.S. trucking industry in the long run, Bauer-Darr said.
"This is going to play very dangerously when it comes to
other pending trade issues with Mexico," she added.

     U.S. and Mexican negotiators are trying to work out
disputes over such issues as small-package delivery, wheat-
transportation rules and the use of 53-foot trailers in
Mexico.

     "This delay destroys any political leverage [the United
States] had at all," Bauer-Darr said. "Here we're saying
it's very important for [Mexico] to live up to its NAFTA
commitments, but then we don't live up to ours."

     The labor and safety groups were "cautiously
optimistic" about the delay. "The delay is good news ...
only if it means that Mexico will ultimately raise its
truck-safety standards to meet our own," said CRASH
Executive Director Jack Rendler. "Our government should be
doing more, not less, to address truck safety, and NAFTA
should not result in any loosening of U.S. truck-safety
standards.

     Despite the delay on the open-border rule, other
actions took effect Dec. 18 as scheduled, such as the cross-
investment rule, which permits U.S. trucking companies to
invest in their Mexican counterparts, and vice versa.

RSPA PROPOSES EXPEDITED PROCEDURE
FOR ISSUING NON-CONTROVERSIAL RULES


     The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA)
Dec. 18 - in what would be a break from usual regulatory
procedure - proposed a new system of issuing rules in non-
controversial areas first and then inviting interested
parties to submit their objections.

     Under the usual procedure, RSPA - like other federal
agencies - proposes rules and invites the public to comment
on the proposals. Only after the time for comments has
expired does the agency issue its regulations.

     However, in an effort to make the agency more
efficient, RSPA has proposed bypassing the notice-and-
comment period by publishing "non-controversial" rules in
the Federal Register and then seeking input from parties who
object to the rules. If RSPA does not receive a "significant
adverse comment" or notice that a party intends to file an
objection by a certain date, the rule would go into effect.

Agency Defines 'Non-Controversial'

     In its proposed procedural change, RSPA defined non-
controversial rules as those that effect minor, substantive
changes to regulations; incorporate by reference the latest
edition of technical or industry standards; or extend
compliance dates.

     The agency also defined significant adverse comment as
a statement from an interested party that explains why the
rule is inappropriate, ineffective or unacceptable.

     "Comments that are frivolous or insubstantial would not
be considered adverse under this procedure," RSPA said. "A
comment recommending a rule change in addition to the rule
would not be considered a significant adverse comment,
unless the commenter states why the rule would be
ineffective without the additional change."

     Parties wishing to comment on RSPA's proposed "direct-
final-rule" procedure must do so by Feb. 16. For more
information, contact: Nancy Machado of RSPA's chief-counsel
office, (202) 366-4400.

     RSPA's proposal is published in the Dec. 18 Federal
Register, p. 65210. The three-page proposal also is
available via BPI's DocuDial Service% as #75-1102. To order,
see page 6.

EFFORTS TO ACCELERATE TIMETABLE
FOR RADWASTE SHIPMENTS QUICKEN


     Efforts to accelerate the timetable for shipping high-
level radioactive waste cross-country seems to be gathering
steam, despite opposition from the Clinton administration.

     Under the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), the
Department of Energy (DOE) must begin accepting high-level
waste from U.S. nuclear power plants by 1998. However, DOE
is behind schedule in constructing a permanent storage
facility, slated for Yucca Mountain, Nevada.

     Next month, the House may vote on legislation (H.R.
1020) that would require DOE to open an interim storage
facility at Yucca Mountain. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.)
introduced similar legislation (S. 167) in the Senate, but
that measure has stalled. Both bills call for the interim
facility to begin accepting waste by 1998, but several
issues must be resolved before the shipments can begin.

O'Leary Cites Concerns

     Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary Dec. 14 told the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee the administration
could not support proposals siting the interim facility at
Yucca Mountain until it finishes suitability studies on the
permanent repository. However, O'Leary said DOE could
complete its suitability determination by the end of 1998,
and, if Yucca Mountain appears suitable, the agency may
consider building an interim facility.

     That day, Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) introduced a bill
(S. 1478) to privatize interim storage, a proposal backed by
nuclear-power interests in his home state. Grams' bill would
let a private consortium build and operate an interim
storage facility and allow DOE to contract with the
consortium for waste storage. The facility would be built on
government-owned land, probably in Nevada.

     "For 16 years, DOE has been charged with the
responsibility of our civilian spent fuel," Grams said. "In
that time, DOE has spent nearly $5 billion of ratepayers'
money, including over $250 million from Minnesota's electric
customers...Privatizing the interim storage program would
improve efficiency and lower costs to the taxpayers."

     But most in the nuclear industry are pinning their
hopes on DOE building an interim facility. "It
[privatization] would be a last resort," said Scott Peters
of the Nuclear Energy Institute.

RSPA Appeals Action

RSPA Ref. No. 90-82-SB. In the Matter of Morton
International Inc., Respondent.

Background

     On Aug. 16, 1991, the Research and Special Programs
Administration (RSPA) fined Morton International $2,000 for
having knowingly violated several sections of the Hazardous
Materials Regulations (HMR). These provisions included 49
CFR 171.2(a), 171.2(c), 172.202(a)(1), 172.202(a)(2), and
173.102.

     RSPA reduced to $2,000 a $3,500 fine the agency
proposed in an Aug. 23, 1990, Notice of Probable Violation.
The company appealed the $2,000 fine.

Discussion

     Morton International conceded RSPA's finding that the
company had violated HMR by failing to mark "DOT 12B" on
each side of the package. But the company contested RSPA's
other findings.

     RSPA said the company was required to meet all mandates
of Exemption DOT E 8214 when offering hazmat for interstate
transportation pursuant to the exemption. Failing that, the
shipments had to meet HMR mandates, the agency added.

     RSPA charged Morton International with violating the
HMR by failing to mark properly its otherwise complying
packagings with the "12B" specification.

     RSPA said Morton International knowingly offered hazmat
for transport in commerce in unauthorized, non-DOT
specification packaging, in violation of Exemption DOT E
8214 and 49 CFR 171.2(a) and 173.102. The company said the
hazmat was part of a shipment from Utah to California, where
it was awaiting transfer to Japan.

     Morton International argued the International Air
Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations
govern movement of the material to Japan and said these
regulations prohibit "double marking" of packages with
United Nations (UN) markings and DOT markings. The company
said this prohibition on dual UN and DOT markings barred it
from placing the otherwise necessary "DOT 12B" markings on
the packages.

     However, RSPA said the company was wrong in believing
that IATA regulations control movement of the packages and
that a prohibition exists on DOT markings on packages
offered for international transportation. The International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions
govern international transport of hazmat and permit dual
markings, RSPA added.

     Even if dual markings were prohibited, Morton
International's violations concern the offering of material
for transportation from Utah to California; that is within
the United States, RSPA said. If a prohibition on dual
markings on international shipments did exist, the company
would still be required to mark the packages with the
requisite DOT specification marking for interstate trans-
portation within the United States and to make any necessary
modifications before offering the packages for international
transportation, RSPA added.

     Because Morton International did not comply with the
DOT exemption, it was required to comply with the HMR, and
its violation lay in its failure to comply with the HMR,
RSPA said. While it met the basic requirements of the "DOT
12B" specification, the company failed to meet with the HMR
because it did not mark the packages with the "12B"
specification, RSPA said.

Findings

     "I find that a civil penalty of $1,500 is appropriate
in light of the nature and circumstances of these
violations, their extent and gravity, respondent's
culpability, respondent's lack of prior violations,
respondent's ability to pay, the effect of a civil penalty
on respondent's ability to continue in business, and all
other relevant factors," RSPA administrator D.K. Sharma
said.

NTSB COUNTS HEAD SHIELDS, COUPLERS
AS BEING AMONG ITS TOP ACHIEVEMENTS


     The National Transportation Safety Board counts the
NTSB-inspired requirement that railroad tank cars
transporting hazmat be equipped with head shields and shelf
couplers as being among its greatest achievements.

     In a recent report, NTSB said these safety features
have dramatically reduced the number of tank-car explosions
and ruptures during the past 10 years. Nevertheless, NTSB
warned the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), railroads
and shippers to remain vigilant.

     "The danger still exists, and accidents still occur,"
NTSB wrote in its report We Are All Safer: NTSB Improvements
in Transportation Safety. The report detailed NTSB studies
on freight-railroad accidents and resulting board
recommendations the federal government or private sector has
adopted. These agency and corporate steps have enhanced
transportation safety, NTSB said.

NTSB Praises Railroads

     For example, NTSB praised the railroad industry for
responding to board suggestions by improving communication
with communities near railyards and rail routes. In
addition, FRA, the Association of American Railroads and
locomotive manufacturers have met to establish a program to
gather data on fuel-tank damage and fuel spills.

     The board singled out CSX Transportation (CSXT) for
special praise for its response to a 1989 derailment and
butane spill in Akron, Ohio. Based on NTSB recommendations,
CSXT began training its railroad crews to assist emergency
personnel responding to hazmat spills and to require crews
to keep up-to-date listings of where the hazmat-containing
cars are on trains, the agency added.

     NTSB also hailed the Chemical Manufacturers Association
for requiring its members to have a chemical-risk management
program to evaluate risks of spills and implement ways to
reduce the chances of hazmat leaks. CMA's actions followed a
1981 NTSB study that found 2,121 railroad accidents
involving hazmat resulted in the evacuation of 100,000
people.

     In that study, the board also examined 45 railroad
accidents. "In at least 21 of the 45 cases investigated for
the study, the safety board found that local emergency
response incident commanders did not have a hazardous-
materials emergency-response plan to follow, and in 19 of
the cases, incident commanders and railroad personnel had
not been in contact with each other to develop a plan of
action in the event of a train accident involving hazardous
materials," NTSB stated.

     For more information, contact: NTSB, Public Affairs
Office, Washington, DC 20594; (202) 382-0660.

CLINTON NOMINATES GEORGIAN
FOR TRANSPORT SAFETY BOARD


     President Clinton last month nominated George Black, a
Georgia county transportation director, for the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

     Black, director of Gwinnett County's transportation
department since 1988, has investigated more than 1,500
highway crashes. As director, he has overseen the design,
construction, maintenance and operation of the county's
roads and its airport.

     "Mr. Black's qualifications and experience as a civil
engineer will provide the NTSB with the technical expertise
necessary to evaluate complex highway, bridge-design and
maintenance issues," read a White House statement. Black's
nomination awaits Senate confirmation.

Transportation Research Board's 75th Annual Meeting is
scheduled for Jan. 7-11 in Washington. Contact:
Transportation Research Board, 2101 Constitution Ave.,
Washington, DC 20418; (202) 334-2934.

U.S. HAZMAT REGS PREEMPT
NEW YORK RULES, RSPA SAYS


     The U.S. Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) preempt
New York state rules that ban the repackaging of hazardous
wastes, require a statement on the manifest of waste
transfers between vehicles and mandate secondary containment
in defined containers for the storage or transfer of hazmat,
the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA)
stated last month.

     RSPA, which enforces HMR, concluded the federal rules
trump New York's after weighing the Chemical Waste
Transportation Institute's (CWTI's) challenge to the state
regulation. In a petition to RSPA, CWTI said the New York
Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) are not "substantively
the same as" the federal regulations and are therefore
invalid under the federal Hazardous Materials Transportation
Act.

     In its decision, RSPA agreed with CWTI's argument that
the NYCRR goes beyond HMR by imposing an absolute
prohibition on repackaging hazardous waste. HMR, unlike the
New York rule, allows for some repackaging, such as the
consolidation of some loads from cargo tanks to tank cars,
RSPA said.

State Went Too Far

     New York also went too far in requiring all hazardous
waste transfers to be listed on manifests, RSPA found.
Federal rules require only that the transporter's company
name and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
identification number appear on the manifest.

     Finally, RSPA objected to New York's requirement that
hazmat be transferred between vehicles only in containers
with impervious bases and drainage and capacity limits. HMR
contains general requirements that the containers be impact-
resistant for the minimum and maximum temperatures
encountered during transportation.

     Before RSPA would consider its challenge to New York,
CWTI had to survive a challenge from New York. The state
urged RSPA to ignore CWTI's petition, saying the group
lacked standing to oppose the state regulation because none
of its members has been hurt by the controversial rule.

     New York, joined by Pennsylvania and Montana, said CWTI
is primarily concerned with hazmat transportation, and the
state regulations in question concern toxins that are merely
waiting to be transported. CWTI countered that many of its
members have refused to engage in certain hazmat-related
activities in New York, lest they be fined heavily for
running afoul of the state rules.

     RSPA, ruling in favor of CWTI, said hazmat awaiting
transportation is still governed by the HMR provisions
governing shipments. The New York rules and HMR, therefore,
affect CWTI members, allowing the group to challenge the
state regulations, RSPA said.

     "Where loading, unloading or storage occurs incidental
to the movement of property in commerce, that activity is
within the scope of federal law governing the transportation
of hazardous material and the HMR," RSPA said. "Requirements
affecting transportation facilities, and transporters'
activities at those facilities, are subject to federal
preemption." For more information, contact Frazer Hilder of
RSPA's chief-counsel office, (202) 366-4400. RSPA's decision
is published in the Dec. 6 Federal Register, p. 62527.

MACHINERY ADVANCES ABET GAINS IN HDPE BLOWN FILM

By:
MICHAEL C. GABRIELE

Spurred by ongoing technical innovations, favorable cost comparisons with
paper and other resin systems, and growing end-use markets, high-density
polyethylene blown film production will register strong annual growth rates
during the next five years.
   North America, Asia, and Latin America are identified as prime growth
markets for HDPE film, while the more mature Western European market is
steady but less robust. Many equipment suppliers say Eastern Europe is
developing as an especially fertile sector for HDPE film growth.

Suppliers project strong growth for HDPE film
   Equipment suppliers are unanimous in their bullish forecast for the
growth of HDPE film. They say many processors, especially those in the
U.S., are set to embark on significant expansion in their production
capabilities over the next 24 months.
   Processors are looking to upgrade the quality of their operations and
film products by utilizing a host of incremental technical innovations.
Many of these capital investments will involve processing lines for
``high-stalk,'' coextrusion high-molecular weight HDPE.
   HDPE film sales in North America are projected to grow at a healthy
average annual rate in excess of 20% during the next five years, sources
say. Much of this increase in business will come at the expense of LDPE and
paper, in various packaging applications.
   An industry source at a major polyolefin resin producer estimates the
total U.S. market for HDPE film in 1995 was upwards of 1.5 billion lb.,
with a value in excess of $1 billion. About 150 billion HDPE film bags were
produced last year for four major market categories: grocery ``T-shirt''
sacks; thin-film industrial can liners; consumer garbage bags; and general
consumer product merchandise bags.
   Eastern Europe is cited by several equipment suppliers as a vibrant
growth sector for the production of HDPE film. Many processors in the
emerging market economies of Eastern Europe are moving aggressively to
invest in high-stalk, coextruded HMW-HDPE film lines, which typically carry
a price tag in excess of $2 million.
   Machinery builders point out that HDPE film's ability to be downgaged
yet maintain physical properties is one factor that will continue to fuel
its growth in both consumer and industrial packaging and insulating
applications.
   ``You can't downgage LDPE or LLDPE like HDPE and still maintain desired
levels of tensile strength,'' David Nunes, president of Alpine American,
Natick, MA, says. ``Also, paper prices are skyrocketing, while the demand
for T-shirt bags is growing at an extraordinary rate.''
   Sources say U.S. paper prices are five times higher than HDPE film in
applications such as T-shirt bags. Recent reports quote the price of 70-lb.
unbleached kraft grocery sack paper at $590 a ton, with supplies tight and
prices expected to continue rising in the near term.

Demand for grooved-feed extruders is picking up
   Joseph Altimari, executive vice president, Black Clawson-Sano Inc.,
Amelia, OH, says his firm's recent marketing alliance with Spanish
machinery builder Covex R.S. Extrusion S.A., of Barcelona, will seek to
capitalize on the growing market demand for grooved-feed extruders for HDPE
blown film. Black Clawson-Sano last spring acquired the exclusive rights to
market Covex HDPE film systems in North America.
   The grooved-feed extruders provide stronger, more consistent, and
predictable extrusion rates compared with smooth-bore types. However,
Altimari points out grooved-feed results in higher wear rates on machines.
To remedy this, Covex has come up with a novel, proprietary groove design
that reduces back pressure and wear in the feed zone.
   Covex film lines utilize an extruder design that reduces screw r.p.m. by
as much as 25 to 50%, compared with existing standard machines, yet
maintains equivalent film output levels, according to Altimari. In
addition, Covex has introduced a bi-layer die design with a single
extruder, which is said to orient HDPE film to help prevent the ``zipper
tear'' effect.
   Paul Kiefel Extrusionstechnik GmbH, Wrentham, MA, and Reifenhauser Inc.,
Peabody, MA, each offer 100-mm. grooved-feed extruders aimed at the T-shirt
bag market. The machines are capable of output rates over 1000 lb./hr.
Alpine is testing a 120-mm. extruder for HDPE, which has been adapted from
an LDPE film system. The design will allow processors to run both HDPE and
LDPE.
   Reifenhauser has unveiled an internal bubble cooling (IBC) technology,
which induces more ``neck-in'' for the stalk or neck of a film bubble.
Matthew Bangert, vice president of sales, explains the IBC system decreases
the neck diameter of the film bubble, just below the frost line. This
enables processors to use larger dies to boost output rates without
sacrificing the desired physical properties of the film.
   Bangert says the technology achieves up to 30% neck-in for the bubble
stalk; the typical neck-in range for most film lines is 5 to 15%.
   Battenfeld Gloucester, Gloucester, MA, recently delivered an enhanced
blown film ``swing'' line to an unnamed U.S. customer, which provides the
capability to change die diameters for the processing of either
high-molecular-weight HDPE or LLDPE.
   Bill Hellmuth, senior product manager, says the new line can switch
between a 17-in. die diameter, for HMW-HDPE, and a 24- in. die diameter for
LLDPE. The unit is equipped with a three-layer die and two extruders: 80-
and 90-mm. The line has a 124-in. nip roll face and an output range of 1000
to 15,000 lb./hr., depending on film thickness.
   Brampton Engineering Inc., Brampton, ON, Canada, has launched its
``Dial-A-Gap'' die gap adjusting system. Bill Wybenga, president, explains
the system isn't an automatic gaging control; it adjusts the total gap
around the die's circumference.
   Wybenga says the system, which can be electronically or manually
operated, allows processors to increase or decrease the nominal film die
gap to suit the needs of the material and the output rate. The gap can be
adjusted in a range of 0.5 to 3 mm. He says that operating with a more
narrow die gap increases the tear resistance and dart impact properties of
the film.
   Alpha Marathon Mfg. Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada, has introduced a
spiral die with a ``flow-mixing channel'' to provide a consistent
temperature gradient at the spiral. This provides more exact film gaging,
with improved optical properties and better machine-direction film
orientation.
   An Alpha spokesman explains that each spiral is fed from two ports, and
each port feeds two spirals, which homogenizes the melt entering the
spirals with a thermal layering effect. The screw also incorporates a
special mixing tip.

High-end applications include insulation
   Most sources were guarded when asked to discuss new market areas for
HDPE film. However, indications are that emerging higher-end applications
will involve using the material as a conductive insulator or shield.
   These applications include conductive bags and over-wraps, in areas such
as printed circuit boards, video and electrical cables, and other
electronic products.
   Hellmuth of Battenfeld says his firm is involved in new market
applications, which call for the development of HDPE film lamination. HDPE
film is laminated to a light-gage PE foam, providing conductive insulation
and a protective covering for consumer products.
   Gunther Neumann, a sales representative with Kiefel Inc., Wrentham, MA,
says a well-established trend for new-equipment sales for HDPE film has
been the inclusion of coextrusion capability. He says feedback from
processors indicates they require the flexibility to pair the strength and
downgaging properties of HDPE with the clarity and puncture resistance of
LLDPE.
   Reifenhauser has done proprietary development work with HDPE/LDPE
coextrusions, to produce higher-clarity film. The opacity typically
associated with HDPE is a surface phenomenon. LDPE, as an outer layer to
HDPE, becomes a clarity enhancer.
   Many processors and end users are evaluating the coextrusion
combination of HDPE and metallocenes, sources say. Application trends point
to using a metallocene as a skin layer over HDPE film. This combination
takes advantage of HDPE's superior tensile strength, along with the tear
resistance and enhanced surface appearance of metallocenes.

New oscillating systems are among advances
   Macro Engineering & Technology Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada, in March
will begin testing a horizontal oscillating nip on a lab-scale line. A
benefit of the design is a lower head-room requirement in processing
plants, compared with a typical vertical oscillating nip system. It also
eliminates the need to stand film on its edge, which reduces sagging.
   Brendan Dorney, sales engineer, says this design is well suited for the
production of HDPE film. He explains that the horizontal skew bars direct
the film in a scissor-like manner through the 180 or 360 deg. of rotation.
The fixed horizontal bars, like those in a vertical process, use an air
cushion for lubrication.
   Recent innovations from Egan Davis-Standard, Somerville, NJ, are a
94-in. oscillating nip, and European-style surface winder. Rick L. Keller,
industry director of film systems, says the new oscillating nip, introduced
last year, helps reduce gage variations in process, allowing for a more
uniform gage distribution, which results in a flatter, more consistent film
roll geometry. The nip is electrically driven and oscillates 720 deg.
(+/-360).
   The Egan surface winder has been rolled out to meet the demands of U.S.
film processors, many of whom are showing a preference to automatic surface
winders rather than center or turret winders.
   Surface winders long have been considered the system of choice among
European blown film processors. Keller says the Egan winder can handle
rolls up to 50 in. in diameter, and enables processors to achieve a higher
degree of control in the film roll hardness.
   Kiefel's ``light'' mono extrusion line (Compex 60 SA.L), is described as
a lower-cost system for HDPE packaging films. The system includes a
stationary extruder with a standard 23 L/D screw length, an internal bubble
stabilizer with a new high-slip, wear-resistant plastic cone, and dual
irises for external bubble stabilization.

EUROPEAN PROCESSORS NEED SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

By:
JOACHIM ECKSTEIN

   In the processing industry, our philosophy is one where basic standards
and strategies influence our everyday business practices. I believe that in
the past, we concentrated too heavily on the operational side. Only when
confronted with change did we consider new strategies. The changes
confronting our industry were often politically motivated, such as taking
back used products, quota regulations, or collection systems, and were not
related to sensible economic practices. We plastics processors too often
only reacted rather than developed our own independent strategies. Thus,
for example, we were not able to promote politically and publicly supported
waste-to-energy recovery through incineration. Today, only a few European
countries favor this economic and ecologically sound method of waste
management.
   We are confronted in all European countries with varied environmental
regulations at varied costs. The highest fees are found in Germany, to
support the Dual System's (DSD) collection and processing activities.
Recycling a kilogram of plastic costs about $2, three times the value of
the collected material.
   Last year members of the EuPC (European Plastics Converters Association)
reoriented their philosophy and strategy toward the same goals proposed by
European politicians. The EuPC has taken the principles of ``sustainable
development,'' as put forth at the 1992 Rio Conference, as tenets. We see
the fulfillment of Sustainable Development as insuring sustainable
existence for the entire plastics industry. Therefore, when the principles
of European plastics processors coincide with those of European
politicians, future conflicts between political and business goals can be
avoided.

PROFIT NEEDED TO WITHSTAND HARDSHIPS
   European processors are mainly small to medium-sized businesses which
understand that entrepreneurial activities, including ecological aspects,
have be economically viable. All new or additional ecological burdens
placed on our industry have to be both bearable and profitable to insure
the processor's economic survival. So far, this has not been the case. If
we are required to use recycled materials, then these materials should be
sold at rates that correspond to their actual costs.
   There are a number of internal actions we as processors can take to
align ecological measures with our business principles. Resource and energy
reduction, investing in modern technology to ensure better productivity and
low exhaust emissions, as well as sensible use of recyclate are just a few
of the measures we can contribute.
   The products we produce have different life cycles of usefulness. The
higher the quality and better the designs we manufacture, the longer they
can be used - therefore increasing the attractiveness for the customer who
should be willing to pay a higher price.
   By reducing raw material use and building in the collection and
recycling costs at the production stage, we can make our contribution to
improving both the environment and the cost situation.
   Collection, sorting, and recycling of used plastics are today not
covered in the processor's cost calculation. They are usually paid by
municipalities. The goal of the Rio Conference was to transfer these costs
to the producer and seller. This is only possible when a realistic cost
structure allows for a pragmatic cost/sales price ratio to cover the
recycling process.
   The EuPC is not propagating any single form of recycling. Of course,
mechanical recycling, the sole technology which the processor can put into
practice, is only attractive if the costs of collection, separation, and
utilization are under or at the same level as virgin raw material. If the
costs of sorting and cleaning plastics waste make mechanical reprocessing
uneconomical, then other methods such as waste-to-energy recycling should
be considered.
   By orienting our philosophy on the principles of sustainable
development, we European plastic processors want to contribute our part in
keeping plastics, with its outstanding properties, a preferred material.
This should stimulate growth in our industry and create jobs.
   A growth rate of only 1%/yr. in the European plastics processing
industry equates to income of $214 million, which finances 6000 extra jobs.
We thus see sustainable development making a meaningful contribution to all
our social security.

SPI SAYS IT WILL REVIEW PROPOSED RAIL MERGER

   Plans by rail line Union Pacific Corp. to acquire rival Southern Pacific
Transportation Co. are under study by the Society of the Plastics Industry,
to determine how such a consolidation of rail service would affect U.S.
resin shipments.
   The merger would create the largest Class 1 railroad in U.S. history.
SPI says that if the deal goes through, 75 to 80% of all resin produced
between Houston, TX, and New Orleans, LA, would be shipped by one company.
This amounts to 39 billion lb. - or 72% - of U.S. resin production.
   SPI is concerned about shipping rates. Transportation is 20% of resin
cost - the second-most expensive cost after raw materials. The group has
until March 29 to file an objection with regulators.
   Union Pacific, which filed notice of the merger Nov. 30 and seeks
approval by August, doesn't believe it will lead to higher prices. ``Lower
transport prices will result over the long run,'' says regional marketing
director Edward Trandahl. He notes 40 plastics shippers in support of the
merger.
   One supplier in favor is Andrew Smith, CEO of polyolefins producer
Rexene Corp. ``We believe the merger will provide more efficient
transportation service.''
   One statistic to emerge from SPI's review is the impact of plastics on
Texas and Louisiana. The industry employs 88,000 in those states, and pumps
$21 billion into their economies annually.

SABIC ADDS PET AND LDPE

   Addition of these resins by Saudi Basic Industries Corp. will make the
company, known by its acronym Sabic, one of the world's most broadly based
resin suppliers by 1996-97. Sabic already produces high-density
polyethylene, linear low-density PE, polypropylene, polystyrene, and
suspension grades of polyvinyl chloride.
   A 310-million-lb./yr. polyethylene terephthalate facility, including
capacity for bottle grades, was due on line late last year. A
770-million-lb./yr. plant for purified terephthalic acid monomer, a PET
precursor, is scheduled for startup in 1997, which would make Sabic
self-sufficient in PET feedstocks (it already makes ethylene glycol).
   The addition of conventional (high-pressure) low-density polyethylene
capacity is due on line in 1997. A 440-million-lb./yr. facility will make
heavy-duty bag, shrink wrap, and other film- and molding-grade resins.
Abdullah Nojaidi, Sabic's president, says that local users in the Middle
East now want their suppliers to provide them with LDPE to complement LLDPE
in blending and other roles.
   While LDPE has been losing share to LLDPE and HDPE for such applications
as films in various regions, it continues to find use in many markets for
the process efficiencies it provides as a blending resin with LLDPE. There
are also many process machines that are configured to run low-density PE,
which are not likely to be replaced or upgraded soon to take LLDPE.
   Sabic is also entering PVC emulsion (paste) supply, with a
50-million-lb./yr. unit just brought onstream. Support facilities to make
di-octyl phthalate plasticizers (using a technology to be licensed from
Japan's Mitsubishi), as well as DOP feedstocks, are also under
construction.

PC SHORTAGE MAY PROMOTE RESIN ALTERNATIVES

   Supply shortfalls, long lead times, and rising price continue to plague
polycarbonate. Several suppliers of PC (and competing clear/tough resins)
say lead times for delivering PC in North America, Europe, and Asia stood
at 8 to 16 weeks in late December. In October, a fourth price hike in six
months went into effect, bringing prices for blow molding grades to US$1.80
to $1.90/lb. for volume buys, a rise of at least $0.30/lb. since
first-quarter 1995. Many accounts are on allocation. (See related article,
p. 67.)
   Users are scrambling to cope. In some markets, where compromise on
clarity is feasible, a shift to lower-cost clear/tough styrenics is
occurring. Blending of PC and other polymers in opaque markets is
increasing, too. Bayer, for example, reports a shift in some markets to
alternative materials in its slate like ABS/PET alloys. The result is that
clear styrenics, like Phillips 66's butadiene-modified grades and Novacor's
acrylic-modified resins, are sold out, with inquiries in medical and other
roles flooding in.
   Indeed, some say a permanent change may be underway in select markets,
as end-users learn to adapt to alternatives that sell for under $1/lb. ``PC
shortfalls create a new mind-set - and a window for replacement,'' states
Steve Shelby, K-Resin commercial manager at Phillips 66, Houston, TX.
Another approach is to send out metallized PC scrap (e.g., from compact
disks), which is usually landfilled, for cleanup by recyclers and
subsequent reuse.
   ``PC today is simply precious,'' a supplier explains. Consultants peg
current PC capacity utilization rates at near 100%. And demand is viewed as
continuing to outrun announced capacity increases through 1996-97,
according to Bill Kuhlke, Kuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX. PC shortfalls and
high costs could persist until 1998-99, observers say.

LOSS OF GM WORK MAY FORCE SALE AT GENCORP

   GM's switch from sheet molding compound to steel for body panels on the
U-van platform has prompted GenCorp, the supplier of body panels, to
consider selling its Reinforced Plastics Div. Preliminary sale talks are
being held with Cambridge Industries Inc., Madison Heights, MI.
   GenCorp produced lift gates, doors, side panels, and other components
for the all-plastics-exterior U-van in Shelbyville, IN, since 1989.
Production of U-van components will end at mid-year. Parts are also made
there for GM's Camaro, Firebird, and Corvette, Chrysler's Jeep, and Ford's
Ranger.
   Cambridge is a diverse automotive supplier that maintains 11 plants in
the U.S. It produces interior trim, exterior panels, and structural
components.
   Observers say GM switched to steel for economy. The automaker is
redesigning the van for 1997 and anticipates volumes of 300,000 to 400,000,
a production level that is more cost-effective for steel. In 1995, volumes
reached 120,000 for the U-van, which consists of the Lumina APV,
Silhouette, and TranSport models. Only 100,000 units are planned for 1996.

PVC WINS 2, LOSES 1 IN LATEST GO-AROUND

   Proponents of polyvinyl chloride gained ground in two high-profile
regulatory showdowns.
   In Berlin, the city legislature voted down restrictions on vinyl use in
municipal construction, reversing a position that it took five years
earlier. Thus, in Germany's future capital, PVC resumes a familiar role as
a building material in windows, shutters, roof beams, and pipe.
   In Canada, Toronto officials urged legislators to reject an
activist-proposed ban on PVC pipe. Testimony by the industry is credited
with thwarting a citywide ban.
   A setback was encountered in Sweden, where Greenpeace claims victory in
a campaign to have Parliament approve the ``speedy'' phaseout of most PVC
products.

quality standard (Dec 95 MP, 23). U.K.-based body Amtri Veritas presented
the company with the certificate.
   According to Pao-Hiun Wang, president of FCS, the company is the first
Taiwanese injection machinery supplier to gain the CE mark. FCS spent a
year upgrading machinery with the assistance of its agent, Excel UK, for
certification.
   The CE mark is a prerequisite for machinery suppliers selling in Europe.

GROWTH PROJECTED FOR BLOW MOLDED BULK CONTAINERS IN U.S. AND EUROPE

By:
Michael C. Gabriele

   The U.S. and Europe are emerging as high-growth markets for the
production and sale of blow molded intermediate bulk containers. Demand for
the specialized industrial containers is steaming along at an annual growth
rate of at least 15%, a trend expected to continue over the next five
years. However, the wider use of blow molded IBCs is coming at the expense
of rotationally molded containers.
   IBCs represent a class of large-volume (275 or 330 gal., and 1000 or
1250 liter) industrial containers, with a blow molded tank enclosed and
supported by a tubular steel or welded wire mesh structure.
   A critical boost to the growth of blow molded IBCs occurred in late
1994, when the United Nations passed an international commerce regulation
(HM-181E), which stated blow molded IBCs containing hazardous materials
could be reused. Prior to this ruling, only rotationally molded tanks could
be recycled for the shipment of hazardous materials. The chemical industry
and food processors represent the two major end-use markets for IBCs.

Four major processors are located in U.S.
   Tom Barrett, president of Scheutz Container Systems Inc., North Branch,
NJ - one of four major U.S. producers of blow molded IBCs - notes the
growth of blow molded IBCs is being pulled by solid demand from end users.
``End users see the advantages in more efficient, cost-effective material
handling, and safer overall storage of materials using IBCs, compared with
55-gal. drums,'' Barrett states.
   Hoover Material Handling Group Inc., with three production facilities
(Mount Vernon, OH; Anniston, AL; and Beatrice, NE) is the largest U.S.
producer of blow molded IBCs. John R. Redmond, president, estimates that
his company currently produces nearly half of all blow molded IBCs in the
U.S.
   Other U.S. processors include Sonoco Product Co., Lavonia, GA, and
Scheutz (production installations in North Branch; Atlanta; and
Perrysburg, OH). Sonoco produces blow molded IBCs under a license
technology agreement with Sotralentz, a machinery builder and system
integrator based in Drulingen, France.
   A fourth company, Van Leer Containers Inc., based in Alsip, IL, is
slated to begin production at a plant in Lawrenceville, GA, during the
first half of this year. The firm is a unit of Van Leer Nederland BV,
Amstelveen, the Netherlands.
   Blow molding equipment suppliers for the production of IBCs include
Krupp Kautex Maschinenbau GmbH, Bonn, Germany; the Plastics Machinery Div.
of Cincinnati Milacron, Batavia, OH; Battenfeld Blowmolding Machines Inc.,
Boonton, NJ; Bekum America Corp., Williamston, MI; Ube Industries Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan; and Uniloy Srl, Calenzano, Italy.
Two German equipment builders - Rikutec GmbH, based in Altenkirchen, and
Mauser-Werke GmbH, located in Bruhl - produce their own line of blow
molding machines for commercial sale, as well as process IBCs.
   Hoover operates two Krupp Kautex machines - one in Mt. Vernon and one in
Anniston. Last April, Hoover went on line with a new Bekum unit in Mt.
Vernon.
   Michael D. Hodges, Sonoco market manager, plastics, says his company
utilizes two Krupp Kautex machines at its Lavonia site.
   Sources say there are as many as 15 processors in Europe producing blow
molded IBCs, with the companies concentrated mainly in Germany, France, and
the Netherlands. Scheutz Werke GmbH, Selters, Germany, (the parent firm to
Scheutz Container), and Van Leer are identified as the largest European
producers of blow molded IBCs.
   It's estimated that between 900,000 and 1.1 million blow molded IBCs
were produced and sold in Europe in 1995, according to industry sources. By
contrast, the U.S. market reached just over 400,000 units last year. Both
totals represent a growth rate of 15% compared with the previous year, a
level of average annual increase anticipated to continue for this business
segment through the year 2000, sources say.
   Bob Zendel, Sonoco general manager, says IBCs are developing as a
preferred mode of material transportation, replacing the venerable 55-gal.
drum. Compared with the drums, IBCs are described as being more efficient
containers, in terms of shipping space utilization, handling and storage,
enclosure cleaning and reuse, and material dispensing, he says.

Technical innovations for blow molded IBCs
   The leading-edge technological trend for blow molded IBCs involves the
use of coextrusion techniques. Multilayer tanks can incorporate a
combination of resin systems, or can make use of regrind material,
depending on the application.
   Sonoco and Van Leer this year will initiate production of coextruded
IBCs in the U.S. Sonoco will employ its existing Krupp equipment, while Van
Leer will use a Rikutec machine. Hoover, with its Bekum unit, also will
have coextrusion capability.
   In another development, Hoover recently unveiled its ``Tufftote'' line
of IBCs, which combines an inner HDPE blow molded vessel with a two-part
outer RIM shell. The RIM material is a thermoset olefin (dicyclopentadiene
or DCPD) known as Telene, supplied by BFGoodrich Co., Cleveland, OH. The
result is a freestanding plastics IBC with no metal support frame, which
can be stacked up to three units high.
   Hoover officials say Tufftote IBCs have a 60% lower tare weight
compared with standard metal-caged containers, and eliminate the corrosion
problems commonly associated with metal frames when transporting various
hazardous liquid chemicals.

PEEK GETS PUMPED

By:
Joseph A. Grande

   Metal is slowly taking a back seat when it comes to low-wear and
low-friction applications in the oil refinery and petrochemical industries.
Polyether-etherketone (PEEK) is increasingly being used in stationary and
rotating wear components in centrifugal pumps which are used in oil
refineries, petrochemical plants, and pipeline installations.
   A good example is a new large-scale refinery in Thailand. The builder,
Caltex Corp., Dallas, TX, specified PEEK for the case rings in all the
refinery's process pumps. It may be the first time that a new pump
construction has been specified with non-metallic wear rings, according to
PEEK compounder and processor EGC Corp., Houston, TX.
   In contrast to 410 stainless steel, bronze, or cast iron, PEEK is
non-galling and non-seizing when in contact with other metal-mating
surfaces. The formulation, called Xytrex 451, is a 30% chopped carbon fiber
resin with tensile strength of 17,000 p.s.i. and continuous use temperature
of 350 to 400F. The material has a coefficient of friction that is six
times better than stainless steel, according to the supplier. The
compression-molded rings are 6-in. x 5.5 in. x 1-in.

MANIFOLD MIXING UNIT PUTS A SKIN LAYER ON MOLDINGS

By:
Peter Mapleston

   A small mixing unit that fits between nozzle and mold in injection and
blow molding machines can be used to produce sandwich moldings in which
colorants and other surface-active additives are present only in the skin
layer of the molding. The system was introduced at K'95, and according to
its developers has aroused considerable interest, not only among potential
customers, but also suppliers of additives as well as thermoplastics.
   The Addmix system works with any type of additive in liquid form. One
primary application is colors, but Addmix says the unit is equally
appropriate for such additives as release agents, and even laser-sensitive
additives used in moldings that are subsequently printed by lasers (Aug 95
MP, 28).
   As of January, the London-based company will supply off-the-shelf
manifolds that attach to the back of each mold. The additive is mixed into
the polymer melt between the end of the injection barrel and the mold. By
selective addition of the additive into the first part of the shot - the
part which becomes the skin layer of the molding - processors can cut down
on their additives consumption by as much as 80%, depending on the geometry
of the part. Users can adjust the volume of melt into which the additive is
mixed, over a limited range.
   Use of the manifold does not affect production cycle times. Although no
details are available on the design and the means of mixing the additive
into the melt, company director Simcha Kilim describes the manifold as a
``form of hot-runner manifold.'' He says it does contain a non-rotating
moving part connected to the injection head. ``It does not affect the
regular behavior of the machine,'' he says. Additive is metered to the
manifold using a simple peristaltic pump that delivers constant pressure.

System helps molders save money, material
   Kilim says that although it might appear at first that additive
suppliers would hesitate to embrace a technology that will reduce their
sales, companies supplying additives with low degradation temperatures are
interested because the Addmix manifold submits the additives to little
thermal and shear stress.
   The Addmix system can be used in various ways. The company's main
interest is in skin molding, and around the middle of next year it will
introduce a version for multiple-cavity molds that enables selective
coloring (diagram). In this system, melt is split into two streams, and
each stream can be mixed with a different color.
   A manifold suitable for linking to a mold with a cavity around 200 cu.
cm. costs around $8500 (5000). Addmix says that money can be recouped in a
few months. It cites savings possible with a typical polymer with a base
cost of $0.865/lb.
   A yellow compound containing 1.5% additive priced at $10.468/lb. costs
$1.009/lb. In production of a part with a 3-mm. wall thickness, the Addmix
system can be used to give a skin layer of 0.5 mm. (1 mm. total). If the
color in the skin layer is added at 2% for security, the total cost for
material in a part weighing 1 lb. is $0.927, giving a saving of $0.08/lb.
of processed material. The savings are even more stark when more exotic
colors, some of which cost over $70/lb., are used.

MD&M-WEST CONFERENCE TO ADDRESS DESIGN REGULATION

By:
Merle R. Snyder

   Regulatory issues, technology advances, and global business
opportunities will be the focus of attention as participants from the U.S.
and about 30 other countries gather for the 12th annual Medical Design &
Manufacturing (MD&M) West conference and exhibition, Feb. 6 to 8, at the
Convention Center in Anaheim, CA. About 800 exhibitors are expected to
occupy 112,000 sq. ft. of space.
   An early session, Feb. 5, conducted by representatives of the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), is billed: ``GMP (good manufacturing
practices) Design Controls and the New 510(k) Environment - a Regulatory
Update.'' Visitors may also sign up for 15 minutes of free consultation
with industry and regulatory agency experts in the ``Meet the Experts''
forum.
   The new GMP rule has been designed for compatibility with the
quality-systems philosophy of the International Standards Organization
(ISO) 9000 series of international standards. Manufacturers that properly
implement design controls can also reduce their product liability exposure
and minimize product development costs. The session will include discussion
of the new 510(k) guidelines' impact on device marketing.
   Specific topics to be addressed include implementation timing for
specific design controls; component, labeling, and packaging design
controls; design input, verification, and output; biocompatibility
considerations; and proper preparation of a 510(k).
   Also on Feb. 5, is a tour of the R&D and clean-room assembly operations
of Gish Biomedical, Irvine, CA. Gish manufactures medical devices used in
cardiovascular and orthopedic surgery, orthopedic and thoracic autologous
blood recovery and reuse systems, and vascular access products for extended
home-care infusion therapies. Tour participants will have the opportunity
to meet with researchers, product designers, manufacturing engineers, and
corporate management in the course of the tour of the 150,000-sq.-ft.
production facility.
   Speakers in a Feb. 6 session on clinical trials will discuss the use
of human subjects to determine a product's efficacy and marketability,
while focusing on such issues as investigational device exemptions (IDEs),
FDA regulations, effective clinical trial design, difficulties in
conducting trials, and alternative techniques for overcoming problems.
   In a partnership that is now entering its third year, the Medical
Plastics Div. of the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE) is presenting a
Regional Technical Conference (Retec) in an all-day session Feb. 7,
concurrent with the MD&M West event. Hosted by Exxon Chemical's Robert
Portnoy, and chaired by Udayan Patel of Advanced Cardiovascular Systems,
the session is billed ``Application of Plastics to Medical Devices:
Problems and Solutions.''

Molders, designers seek global opportunities
   International considerations loom ever larger in the medical device
business. International standards-setting groups are creating a wide range
of global standards regarding clean-room and aseptic processing and
packaging. A session on Feb. 8, instructed by Anne Marie Dixon, managing
partner of a clean room consulting firm, will discuss the work of ISO's
Technical Committee 198.
   Also on Feb. 8, speakers will address opportunities in Japan, greater
Asia, Taiwan, Europe, and Latin America in a session entitled ``Global
Expansion: International Opportunities for Medical Device Manufacturing
Companies.''
The market for medical devices and supplies in China is expected to surpass
$1 billion this year. The country is therefore the focus of a session to
include presentations by officials of the Ministry of Health, People's
Republic of China, including: an ``Overview of the Chinese Health-Care
System''; ``Hospital and Clinical Needs for Medical Devices''; and
``Reimbursement Policies and Cost Containment.''
   U.S.-China government initiatives will be discussed by Paul E. Barry,
international trade specialist, Office of Microelectronics, Medical
Equipment, and Instrumentation, International Trade Administration, at the
U.S. Dept. of Commerce.
   MD&M West is sponsored by Medical Device & Diagnostic Industry magazine,
published by Canon Communications Inc. For information, call (310)

ORGANIC PEROXIDES FACE STIFF TECHNOLOGICAL COMPETITORS

By:
Gordon Graff

   New technologies for producing and modifying polymers are posing a
formidable challenge to organic peroxides as the additives of choice in a
number of traditional high-volume areas.
   According to industry observers, peroxides are still secure in such
current applications as initiators for vinyl polymerization, curing agents
for thermoset resins, and crosslinking agents for elastomers and PE. But
they say that fast-rising competitors like metallocene catalyst technology
and electron beam processing could eventually edge out peroxides in their
present roles as rheology modifiers for PP and as initiators for production
of LDPE.
   In the modification of PP, ``metallocenes definitely have an advantage
over peroxides,'' says consultant John Murphy of The Catalyst Group, Spring
House, PA. Right now, peroxides are often used to degrade PP in a
controlled fashion, after it emerges from the reactor. This
``vis-breaking'' produces a polymer with a relatively narrow molecular
weight (MW) distribution, a feature that improves its melt flow properties
during processing. But metallocene catalysts have the ability to produce PP
right out of the reactor with the requisite narrow MW distribution. Such
polymers in principle should need no post-reactor peroxide treatment.
   There is little uncertainty in the minds of metallocene polymer
producers. Malcolm Kaus, Exxpol venture manager at Exxon Chemical, Houston,
TX, declares flatly that Exxon's recently commercialized metallocene PP
technology ``will greatly diminish, if not eliminate, peroxide use'' in the
treatment of PP. ``Of course this is only a projection,'' he adds, ``and
I'm not sure in what time frame this will be realized.''
   Besides Exxon, other developers of metallocene-based PP include Hoechst
AG, Frankfurt, Germany; BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; and Japan's Mitsui
Toatsu, Tokyo.

Metallocene claims concern peroxide makers
   Peroxide producers are taking the metallocene competition seriously.
``We're definitely concerned about claims'' that metallocenes will displace
peroxides, says R. Gerald Gimbarski, business manager for organic peroxides
at Elf Atochem, Philadelphia, PA. ``I agree that metallocenes could be a
threat,'' adds Ronald Pastorino, market manager for organic peroxides at
Witco Corp., Greenwich, CT, although he says that any challenge is not
likely to materialize for ``several years.''
   Electron beam (E-beam) processing is also presenting a frontal challenge
to peroxides. E-beam processors claim that their systems have advantages
over peroxides in such applications as crosslinking rotationally molded PE
storage tanks and curing the resin in PE water tubing. For example, Karen
Butler, marketing director at E-Beam Services, Cranbury, NJ, points out
that peroxides, which are temperature-sensitive, are not compatible with
high shear rates or the process temperatures required for high line speeds
and thin-walled or intricately shaped products, whereas E-beam curing can
be used in these applications. She adds that E-beam allows more precise
control of crosslinking density than peroxides or other chemical curing
agents.
   One drawback of E-beam systems is that fabricators, who seldom wish to
invest in an E-beam facility on their premises, typically have to ship
their uncured objects to a distant processor. On the other hand, the extra
transportation costs are reduced by the savings from eliminating peroxides
in the formulation.
   Despite stiff competition from other technologies, peroxide makers are
continuing to innovate. At Elf Atochem, Gimbarski points to two recent
introductions under its Lupersol line of organic peroxides. These products,
grades 610-M50 and 688-M50, are hexylene glycol peroxyesters that serve as
low-temperature, fast front-end initiators in the production of polyvinyl
chloride. They are intended to speed up polymerization cycle times.
   The 610-M50 grade is also the first new peroxide additive approved in
the U.S. in 12 years not required by the Environmental Protection Agency to
carry a warning label of carcinogenic hazards. Elf avoided the label by
submitting voluminous safety testing data to EPA.

LIQUID COLORANTS ARE FREE OF OLD DRAWBACKS, GAIN IN POPULARITY

By:
Gordon Graff

   Liquid colorants, which were once confined to a small niche in the
injection molding business, are now competing head-on with traditional
color concentrates and other solid systems in high-volume extrusion and
extrusion blow molding markets. Behind this trend are technical advances
over the past five years that have made liquid colorants more reliable and
economical for many applications than pellet concentrates and other solid
colorants.
   In particular, improved carrier vehicles have made liquid systems
compatible with just about all thermoplastic resins, and a new generation
of highly accurate liquid dispensing pumps now offers consistent color
quality in fabricated products. The high concentrations of pigment in the
latest liquid systems also enhances their economic appeal for processors.
   The liquid colorants industry received a big boost earlier this year
when Rubbermaid Inc., Wooster, OH, one of the country's largest plastics
processors, decided to switch from solid colorants to liquid systems in
many of its plastics fabricating operations. Details of the switch are
sketchy, and Rubbermaid declines to comment on it. But according to one
industry observer, the move will be ``very influential'' in convincing
smaller processors to adopt liquid systems.

Business is booming for colorant pump suppliers
   While there are few estimates of the size of the liquid colorants
market, suppliers of both the colorants and the dispensing pumps often sold
with them report that business is booming. ``Sales of liquid colorant pumps
have more than doubled for us this year,'' says B. Patrick Smith, vice
president for marketing and sales at Maguire Products Inc., Media, PA, one
of the leading suppliers of dispensing equipment for liquid systems. And
Michael R. Shaughnessy, president of ColorMatrix Corp., Cleveland, OH, a
supplier of liquid colorants, estimates that such products are growing
``significantly faster'' in the U.S. than the plastics colorants business
as a whole.
   Despite their inroads into extrusion applications, liquid systems are
still concentrated heavily in injection molded products. According to one
industry observer, liquid colorants now account for 20 to 25% of the
colorants used for injection molded products in North America.
   By most accounts, use of liquid colorants is far more widespread in
North America than Europe. In explaining this disparity, industry sources
cite the fact that many European pigment manufacturers also make color
concentrates, which have well-entrenched markets. Elsewhere, pigment makers
are more independent and thus freer to experiment with new formulations.
Nonetheless, liquid systems are catching on in Europe. In fact, new
business there has been so brisk that ColorMatrix recently opened a
manufacturing plant near Liverpool, England, to address the market.
Meanwhile, interest in liquid colorants is said to be particularly strong
in Latin America.
   Liquid colorants have come a long way from their first appearance in the
late 1970s, when incompatibility between their liquid carrier vehicles and
many thermoplastics caused slippage of extruder screws. Many formulations
were also slow to disperse in melted resins, and liquid dispensing
equipment was often inaccurate or costly.
   Today's liquid carriers - their compositions are well-guarded trade
secrets - are compatible with most polyolefin, styrenic, and engineering
resins; screw slippage is largely a thing of the past. Better milling
procedures are producing very fine pigment particles that make liquid
colorants easier to disperse than competing dry powdered colorants and even
the liquid colorants of just a few years ago.

Dispensing units are more accurate, less expensive
   Perhaps the most significant factor responsible for the growing
popularity of liquid colorants is the accurate and inexpensive dispensing
pumps that have recently come to the fore. These pumps are portable and
generally cost between $1000 and $2500. Liquid colorants are often
formulated for particular dispensing machines. In fact, such liquid
colorant suppliers as Ferro Corp., Edison, NJ, and Morton International,
Chicago Heights, IL, also offer their customers dispensing machinery.
   Although they differ in details, most current liquid color dispensing
units feature a peristaltic pump, in which liquid is released by periodic
compression and release of a flexible pumping tube by a series of rollers.
The rollers are driven by a variable-speed, microprocessor-controlled
motor. Precise metering is achieved by automatic counting of each rotation
of the motor, which is set to deliver a known amount of liquid per
rotation. The liquid colorant always remains inside the feed tube and never
comes into contact with the rollers or any other part of the pumping
mechanism. As a result, color changeovers can be rapid.
   The colorant feed tube usually enters injection or extrusion machines in
one of two locations: immediately below the hopper at the feed throat, or
into a groove machined into the base of the barrel. Both configurations
promote rapid mixing of colorant and resin in the barrel and an even
distribution of color in extruded or molded articles.
   While liquid colorants usually cost more on a unit basis than powders or
pellet concentrates, they are so concentrated (typically 75% pigment
loadings) that they are often more economical to use than competing
products.
   Despite the favorable economics, liquid colorants have been slow to
penetrate some applications. Blown film is one such area, because liquid
systems are less efficient than the concentrates in achieving required
levels of opacity in very thin films.
   Meanwhile, suppliers of liquid colorants are unveiling grades for
special applications. For example, Riverdale Color Manufacturing, Brooklyn,
NY, is developing liquid colorants for use with ABS resins.
   Overall, growth of liquid colorants during the next year is expected to
remain strong. Among the reasons, notes Riverdale Color president Charles
Irish, are recent price hikes for polyethylene, polypropylene, and other
carrier resins used in pellet concentrates. Because of the resulting run-up
in concentrate prices, he says, ``more processors may entertain switching
to liquids.''

AUG 95 MP, 15

   An article about machinery supplier Starlinger & Co. indicated that
three years ago it bought, then sold, fellow Austrian company Maplan
International (Aug 95 MP, 15). In fact, although Starlinger bought the
entire Maplan International business, encompassing twin- and single-screw
extruders and rubber processing equipment, it only subsequently sold the
twin-screw business (to Theysohn Extrusionstechnik, also of Austria). It
retains the remaining businesses. Starlinger has never had any holding in
American Maplan, which was separate from Maplan Int. and which was recently
acquired by the Battenfeld Group.

PLASMA POLYMERIZATION USED FOR SCRATCH-RESISTANT COATINGS

By:
Robert Colvin

   Researchers at Germany's Institute for Plastics Processing (IKV),
Aachen, have come up with an innovative process to coat injection molded
polycarbonate and polymethyl methacrylate optical parts to obtain high
scratch resistance. This high-density process - a vacuum-coating method
which produces a glass-like surface - is performed at relatively low
temperatures in a microwave bath. IKV scientists are predicting the
technique can eventually be used to economically coat any size surface.
   Its specific advantage is that properties of the polymer layers
deposited on the plastic can be modified through selective process control
and aligned to a range of requirements such as crosslinking and the ability
to withstand chemical and mechanical stresses. This coating is free of
micropores, has an amorphous layer structure, and offers good adhesion,
even to nonpolar surfaces.
   Previously used methods for applying coatings include painting them on
the lens surface, which carries the drawback of dust contamination and ion
plating, and allows only low scratch resistance over small areas and
entails long process times. Plasma-aided evaporation is another option.
Here, clean-room conditions are needed, as well as resources to deal with
solvent-laden air.
   Plasma polymerization's adhesive qualities are obtained through a form
of process control which involves the formation of coupling agent layers
during coating. These layers are aligned to the substrate being used. By
varying the process parameters, it is possible for the hardness of the
interface layer to be further tailored.
   To obtain adequate scratch resistance as determined by the sand drop
test (DIN 52348-1) on PC, a coating of 6 micron is needed. The coating rate
is up to 2 micron/min., 50 times higher than plasma-aided evaporation
systems, says IVK's Harald Zell.
   IKV engineers have developed a plant concept for the production of
large-area coatings. So far they have been able to apply plasma
homogeneously over a width of 500 mm. at a deposition rate of 0.2
micron/min.
   Apart from transparent, scratch-resistant coatings, plasma
polymerization may find other applications. Since the surface tension of
the coatings can be selectively varied, hydrophobic layers can be employed
as anti-stick coatings. With hydrophilic coatings, good anti-misting
properties can be obtained, since droplets of water on the substrate
spontaneously form a transparent film which doesn't scatter light. IKV
researchers say anti-permeation coatings for PE fuel tanks are also on the
horizon.

CONNECTOR MARKETS FACE DECADE OF HIGH RISKS AND BIG REWARDS

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   At first glance, today's fast-emerging information age looks like a
bonanza for some 500 companies worldwide that mold electronic connectors,
and for their materials and equipment suppliers. Indeed, overall resin use
should continue to grow at about 10%/yr. Yet the breakneck speed of
technological change in the varied end-markets that use connectors is
disconcerting.
   In fact, the connector industry faces a tough, risky decade ahead as it
copes with expanding yet swift-changing demands by multinational giants who
manufacture computer, business machine, wireless, cellular phone,
automotive, and other electronic systems, and which in turn depend on
connectors.
   Ongoing evolution in electronics makes it difficult to understand or
predict market needs, according to a study to be issued in early 1996 by
Fleck Research, Santa Ana, CA. The consultant is estimating global unit and
polymer use rates for some 700 distinct connector segments through 2005.
   A central dilemma is that the exploding demand for the number of
connector units worldwide coincides with miniaturization and integration of
the devices. Fewer, smaller connectors eventually can mean less resin use
for each application. Also, miniaturization intensifies the performance
requirements for both the connectors and resins selected to make them.
   Miniaturization of connectors is driving designers to more
lightweighting and precision, higher flame-retardancy ratings, and higher
operating temperatures as compared to the past, says Ken Fleck, coordinator
of the study. This opens new opportunities for resins like liquid crystal
polymer.

Connectors claim 600 million lb. of resin
   World connector markets attract captive and custom producers that
include major global technology powerhouses (table). In 1995, world
thermoplastics use in connectors hit 600 million lb., according to the
Fleck report. This includes about a 10 to 15% fraction of thermosets
(mainly phenolic).
   Thermoplastics in connectors tend to be high-performance, high-value
materials. Most cost about $1.60 to $2.27/lb.; a fifth cost $2.27 to
$9.10/lb.
   Polyamides and thermoplastic polyesters are the most widely used
polymers, followed by polyphenylene sulfide, PC, and liquid crystal
polymers.
   The U.S. is the largest regional market, with a global share of 35%, or
210 million lb. Its largest end-use markets are data communication, phone,
wireless, computer, and automotive systems.
   Western Europe and Japan each have roughly 25% of the world market for
connectors, with a dozen Pacific Rim nations supplying another 10%. Shifts
in automobile production (e.g., to the Far East, Eastern Europe, and Latin
America) in recent years have made automotive connectors more widely used
there. They come in tiers used in the engine (e.g., anti-lock brakes) and
passenger compartment (seat belts), having quite different requirements.
   Global demand for connector units is exploding. The report estimates 50%
more connector units will be sold in the U.S. in the next five years, from
20 billion to 30 billion units. But profiting from this expansion may be
less than easy for molders and materials suppliers.

Challenges come with changing electronics
   The composition of connector markets is changing in lockstep with
changes in electronic products. For instance, 65% of the computers sold in
1995 in North America were desktop models, and 9% were workstation models.
But this 74% segment of computers consumed 90% of connector units and 96%
of resin.
   A decade from now, the market is expected to shift to notebook and
handheld computers, which tend to use fewer, smaller connector units. In
1995, these categories made up 25% of computers, but used only 4% of
resin.
   Another escalating design requirement is increases in the density of
pins (i.e., number per sq. in.), and increases in the pitch of pins and
connectors. Additionally, smaller connector designs generally involve lower
shrinkage rates, thinner walls, and more precise processing.
   The types of polymers used in connectors is in flux as a result of these
pressures. For example, Woo Young, Pyungtaek, South Korea, recently
switched a 300-pin connector for telephone exchanges to a nylon 46 from DSM
Engineering Plastics, Sittard, The Netherlands. The Stanyl material
replaces cross-linked PPS, and is said to offer problem-free insertion,
high pin-retention, and soldering resistance to 260C.
   At the same time, new versions of PPS, including linear grades made by
Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany, are replacing polyesters in some roles.
A strong shift from thermosets to thermoplastics is also underway, Fleck
reports.

                   connectors face a major

POLYPROPYLENE SHOWS ITS METTLE IN TEXTILE DYE-TUBE DESIGN

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   Compressible dye-tube moldings illustrate how designers can use plastics
to enhance manufacturability, consolidate parts, and reduce material waste.
The cylindrical, lattice-walled, spring-like devices, injection molded in
PP by Technimark Inc., Randleman, NC, compress 40% when under high-speed
load, yet resist crushing.
   The necessary balance of flexibility and strength, along with desired
thermal and chemical resistance, are provided by PP resins supplied by
Epsilon Products, Marcus Hook, PA.
   PP dye tubes are rapidly replacing stainless steel versions in the U.S.
for high-speed winding of polyester and PP yarns through 270 degress F. dye
baths. The devices incorporate molded-in fins that allow the yarn to be fed
directly from the item to the subsequent weaving or knitting steps in
textile-making. Moreover, a three-fold transfer of yarn to separate metal
and paper tubing pickup devices (a process called ``backwinding'') is
bypassed. These previously needed steps had added to labor costs, generated
considerable tubing waste, and degraded fiber quality.
   The spring-like behavior of the PP devices in effect increases the
effective capacity of costly dye baths by 40%, and reduces chemicals and
water use. In 1995, Technimark expected to mold 30 million of the
lightweight (0.25 lb.) parts for the U.S. market, where a rapid transition
to PP is underway.
   Mike Pembroke, Epsilon's sales director, asserts that the application
``extends the envelope of PP design capabilities.'' Technology and know-how
for processing the complex, high-tolerance part is licensed by Joseph
Zimmerman, Aachen, Germany.
   Technimark has adapted the tube design for the U.S. Two- and four-cavity
molds are used; cycle times are 10 to 14 sec. The processor has designed in
stop buttons to prevent overcompression of tubes. Machines used are 400-ton
Van Dorn HT units. The disposable dye tubes can be reused in PP
furniture.

EXPORTS AND LOW MONOMER COST KEEP SUPPLY AND PRICING STABLE

By:
Robert Colvin

   Subdued buying by processors and a quarter-by-quarter drop in the cost
of ethylene monomer helped to keep polyethylene prices last year from
rising to what many producers would have termed an acceptable rate. Bad
news for the producers, no doubt, but good news for processors, especially
after 1994, which saw some of the steepest price run-ups for PE in recent
years.
   Though manufacturers are banking on low customer inventories helping to
stimulate buying in the first quarter of this year, chances are that prices
will remain pretty much where they were at the end of 1995.
   In North America, for example, fourth-quarter polyethylene prices ranged
from 37 cents/lb. for blow molding grades of high-density PE, to 40
cents/lb. for low-density PE liner grades. These levels were down
substantially from second-quarter 1995, when the average price for blow
molding grades of HDPE topped out at 50 cents/lb. and liner-grade LDPE hit
48 cents/lb.
   Moreover, in North America, ethylene monomer prices began the year at 31
cents/lb. and finished 1995 at 21 cents/lb.

North American pricing affects global resin costs
   Not surprisingly then, North American LDPE prices are considered to be
very competitive vis-a-vis those of other exporting regions on the global
market. According to McGraw-Hill's Platt's Polymerscan, a pricing service
in London, offshore resin sources continue to exert an influence on global
pricing. In Western Europe, imports, though slowing, remain a factor in the
price structure of resin. Asian prices have weakened as a result of high
availability from a variety of sources, according to Platt's Hazel Marlow.
   Among the various PE types, consultants note that HDPE inventories
remain high and export sales show no signs of taking off. They attribute
this to direct competition in film applications with linear low-density PE,
which itself is hit by overcapacity.
   Change might be in the offing in 1996, however. Advances in HDPE film
process technologies and blown film extrusion lines, coupled with
price-driven gains in large-volume markets like T-shirt bags, bode well for
the resin's use in many areas, notably, Western Europe and North America
(see story, p. 44).
   Compounding the situation for PE producers is market agitation in
Europe. Investigators acting on European Commission orders swooped down
late last year on corporate offices of manufacturers Borealis, BASF, BP,
DSM, Dow, Shell, Petrofina, Hoechst, Solvay, and Polimeri Europa, over
allegations of possible illegal cartel operations in pricing. The
investigation, which is still underway, appears to have been prompted by
complaints from processors and buyers stemming from limited supplies early
last year, allegations of price fixing, and possible restrictive
competitive practices.

Formulation advances upgrade properties
   Prices and politics aside, polymer technology is sparking optimism with
regard to properties enhancements. DSM, Sittard, the Netherlands, has come
up with an injection molding grade of LLDPE, Stamylex, which offers high
purity and a narrow molecular weight distribution.
   London-based BP Chemicals and Germany's Hoechst, Frankfurt, have come
out with a range of grades (rated as PE 100) for high-pressure water, gas,
steam, and industrial pipes.
   Not to be outdone, both HDPE market leader Solvay, Brussels, Belgium,
and Borealis, Lyngby, Denmark, introduced at K'95 third-generation grades
for similar applications (rated PE 80 and PE 100).
   The high-pressure pipe grades are, for the most part, bimodal.
   Hoechst is also eyeing future applications that will take market share
from other materials with its HDPE. Key among them is the hoped for
switch-over by Germany's mineral water producers from glass to polyethylene
terephthalate bottles, and the resulting demand for new bottle crates as
well as substitution of aluminum caps by HDPE caps.
   Even machine manufacturers are getting into the act by upgrading
extrusion lines for HDPE. Increases in competitive materials' prices and
waste-management costs have allowed HDPE film to make important inroads
into the film market through its down-gaging properties. Reifenhauser,
Troisdorf, Germany, for example, is designing better certain of its lines
to fit the polymer's characteristics.
   New capacity coming on stream includes production for specialty grades.
One example is the new Borstar technology for manufacturing
enhanced-property bimodal PE, which went into commercial operation at the
end of last year in a 264-million-lb./yr. plant run by Borealis in Porvoo,
Finland.
   Quantum Chemical, Cincinnati, OH, has a new Unipol PE gas-phase
LLDPE/HDPE unit, with a capacity of 480 million lb./yr., set to start up at
the end of 1996 in La Porte, TX. At the same site, the company will
maintain its 85-million-lb./yr. LLDPE unit dedicated to making rotational
molding resins. By the end of June, it will also have restarted a
250-million-lb./yr. Unipol reactor at Morris, IL. Another Unipol LLDPE
reactor at the site will be debottlenecked to raise capacity by 100 million
lb./yr. to a total of 400 million lb./yr.
   In a final move, Quantum has plans to convert its dedicated LLDPE
reactor at Port Arthur, TX, to a dedicated HDPE unit using BP technology
offering a capacity of 300 million lb./yr. Work is slated for completion by
October.
   Other suppliers are also increasing capacity. Montell, Wilmington, DE,
has started up a 440-million-lb./yr. PE plant at Lake Charles, LA, using
its Spherilene process technology.
   Dow Plastics, Midland, MI, plans to debottleneck an LDPE plant in
Sarnia, ON, Canada, and an LLDPE train located in Fort Saskatchewan,
Canada.
   Polimeri Europa, the Enichem/Union Carbide joint venture, in Milan,
Italy, will build a 400-million-lb./yr. Unipol swing reactor for HDPE and
LLDPE in Brindisi, Italy.
   Meanwhile, several companies say plants are scheduled for construction
in Brazil, India, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and parts of Southeast Asia and
China.
   While few plans exist for deactivating plants, Dow Plastics recently
announced it is shuttering a slurry HDPE facility in Sarnia, ON, Canada,
with a nameplate capacity of 160 million lb./yr.
   Konrad Scheidl, former PE manager at Dow and now market analyst with
Maack Business Services, in Au, Switzerland, sees one affect of all this
new capacity on the market, especially that using swing technology to
produce either LLDPE or HDPE: loss of share by LDPE. These swing-capacity
resins are making rapid penetration in the film market because of HDPE's
downgaging qualities and alpha-olefin-comonomer LLDPE's improved tensile,
heat seal, and impact strength, and high miscibility. LLDPE is calculated
by Maack to overtake HDPE this year in capacity growth, and to surpass LDPE
in 1998.
   Peter Toohy, manager of plastics sales for Chevron Chemical, Houston,
TX, says he doesn't see LDPE rolling over and yielding market share so
easily. The resin is in big demand in countries where LLDPE is readily
available, but where processing equipment and expertise have not reached
the levels of North America or Europe, he says.
   Rob van Ooijen, PE manager at DSM, agrees. He adds that to compensate
for difficulties in processing LLDPE, an addition of 10 to 40% of LDPE can
act as a blending agent. Thus, some plants that run LLDPE may still need
low-density grades for processability. DSM is one of the few companies to
make recent investments in LDPE facilities. Van Ooijen says production has
been sold out.
   This year Union Carbide, Danbury, CT, is launching Ultra Tuflin, a
hexane-based LLDPE aimed at replacing LDPE. It reportedly offers up to 110%
more machine-direction tear strength (at 89 micron) than existing
higher-alpha-olefin LLDPE's.

RESINS REPORT 1996
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, EXPANDING MARKETS

   This is a dynamic time in resins supply. On one hand, technology is
expanding the properties and applications potential of materials. On the
other, burgeoning demand in developing countries is creating a huge market
for plastics, while influencing supply and pricing around the world.
   For processors, these trends signal opportunity and challenge. As the
following articles indicate, the capabilities of plastics design have never
been greater. New technologies, grades, and application concepts increase
market penetration.
   But growth can be difficult. The runup in demand for resins last year,
much of it influenced by inventory buying to offset shortages, stretched
production to the limit. Some resins remain in tight supply. New capacity
is coming on line, though, and 1996 is seen as a year of more balanced
supply and demand. Prices, moreover, should be relatively stable for most
resins.
   Modest economic growth is forecast for most of the industrialized world.
This should assure steady if unspectacular gains in resin consumption. In
developing countries, GDP growth and resin consumption will stay at
double-digit rates.
   This year will be one in which innovative technologies and expanding
markets define plastics use. With no major economic problems on the
horizon, and supply and pricing relatively stable, processors have the
foundation in place for a successful 1996.

STABILITY SEEMS TO BE AT HAND IN GLOBAL COMMODITY-RESINS MARKETS

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   Processors of large-volume resins have experienced an unusual degree of
chaos in buying raw materials over the past year. But industry seers
predict that 1996 holds the potential for greater stability (and so
predictability) in the cost and availability of polyolefin, styrenic, and
vinyl resins.
   ``Expect a reasonable equilibrium between demand and supply in 1996,''
says Jim Fisher, president of consultant IBMA, Princeton, NJ. He and other
consultants generally expect the prices of most volume resins to stabilize
at or near fourth-quarter 1995 levels early in the new year. But some
suppliers expect that a ``bounce,'' or slight upswing in prices, might
occur. One possible harbinger of this: Dow Chemical, Midland, MI, saying PE
is undervalued, announced a 5 cents/lb. across-the-board increase for Jan.
1.
   What disturbs processors most about an uneven pricing course is the
uncertainty it entails in strategic planning. Volatility, no matter how
slight, thwarts efforts to schedule production, control inventory, or
follow a business plan. An underlying concern about pricing is global
demand. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene are maintaining growth
rates, on average, at 50 to 100% higher than the typical increases in gross
domestic product for many countries, particularly developing nations.

Memories of recent cost carousel linger
   In 1994-95, volume-resin pricing took an erratic course worldwide
(graphs). Global interconnections in resin supply are apparent in parallel
pricing patterns for the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
   Overcapacity and low pricing levels for the various grades of PE, PP,
PS, and PVC had been widely projected for the period 1994-95. In fact,
mid-1994 prices stood close to historic lows. Crystal PS in the U.S. was at
45 cents/lb.; spot tags for PP homopolymer in Germany and PVC in Asia were
at $1000/metric ton.

Unforeseen scenarios thwart business plans
   But the unexpected intervened. A spate of natural and operational
difficulties struck resin and monomer plants worldwide at the turn of 1995,
pushing monomer costs up and disrupting resin supplies. A hoarding frenzy
and six-month-long inventory buildup followed. Moreover, resin exports to
China, a burgeoning market, kept soaring. At the May-June peak, PS had
risen by 26% in the U.S., PP by 35% in Germany, and PVC by 13% in Japan as
compared to mid-1994.
   Around mid-1995, a reversal was underway. IBMA's Fisher attributes this
to effects of the continuing recession in Japan, to slowdowns in France and
the U.K., China's sudden retreat from aggressive resin buying (which
depressed export prices), and a resultant inventory rundown. Major monomers
fell in cost, but less so than resin; supplier margins were squeezed.
   At presstime, all the large-volume resin prices had dropped from their
1995 peaks, typically by approximately 25% in the U.S. and about 40% in
Europe and Asia. Nevertheless, prices generally remain above the lows they
reached in 1994.
   Ron Yocum, CEO at Quantum Chemical Co., Cincinnati, OH, a major
polyolefins producer, says that the demand side for PE and PP remains
favorable. He pegs underlying PE growth at about 1.5 to 1.7 times that of
GDP. National economies obviously vary by region, but in the developed
countries, this could yield growth in the low single digits - generally on
the order of 3 to 5%/yr. In countries like China, where GDP is increasing
at double-digit rates, PE growth would be much greater.
   But why did official PE demand in one major market, the U.S., rise by
12% in 1994 and remain relatively flat in 1995? (Figures released at
presstime by the Society of the Plastics Industry, Washington, DC, show a
0.9% decline in production and a 3% drop in sales and captive use for PE in
the U.S.) Inventory shifts, brought about by turmoil in 1994-95, obscured a
real growth rate for 1995 of around 4 to 5%. Yocum sees continued growth
being aided by technology (e.g., super-condensing modes that double
LLD/HDPE capacity at 40 to 70% of cost), and improving polyolefins
cost-performance.
   In PP, suppliers expect underlying growth to be twice that of global GDP
through 2000.

Substantial growth seen in developing nations
   Long-term, demand prospects favor other resins, too. Developing
economies (e.g., China, India, parts of Latin America) represent a dramatic
source of growth for styrenics and PVC. For instance, PS use is booming in
Brazil. Alberto Carvalheiro, commercial director of EDN, the top PS
supplier there, puts domestic growth at 25% for 1994 (a boom period) and
10% for 1995. Underlying growth is 1.3 times GDP, and expanding PS use in
packaging and export products (appliances, toys, TV cabinets) is credited.
   A striking example of demand strength is Mexico. Despite the collapse of
the peso and a 10% decline in GDP, demand by packagers and export-oriented
processors for some resins in Mexico actually grew in 1995. Monica Conde,
an analyst with consultant IMPI, Mexico City, estimates that demand in
Mexico for polyethylene terephthalate, PP, and PS rose, respectively, by
38%, 8%, and 4% last year.
   By late 1995, some industry sources argue, the decline of prices for
large-volume resins had bottomed out in the U.S., with inventories becoming
more in balance. IBMA's Fisher, however, says softness in many European
economies makes it less likely that prices there will firm up as quickly.
He says that many countries in Europe have yet to fully address the high
social cost of their social welfare policies. The seers pepper their
forecasts with caveats, most notably discounting the impact of a possible
recession, or a new, unexpected round of plant shutdowns.
   Stable monomer costs are one reason cited for expecting more resin
stability in 1996. Fred Petersen of Probe Economics, Armonk, NY, who tracks
monomers, notes that ethylene, which gyrated from 16 to 28 cents/lb. in
1994-95, is now at 21 cents/lb. Currently announced ethylene expansions, if
carried out, should assure adequate ethylene supply for two years, Petersen
adds. Propylene and styrene are considered likely to tighten slowly, not
moving upward before 1997-98.

Planned capacity will meet demand
   As for resin capacity, experts foresee two major waves of expansion over
the next several years. In PE, for instance, North American-based suppliers
will add some 2.8 billion lb. (e.g., Novacor in Canada) in 1997-98, or
enough to almost balance new demand. A much larger spurt in capacity is set
to occur offshore, notably in the Far East. Most forecasts see world PE
capacity rising by 16% through 1998.
   Bill Kuhlke of consultant Kuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX, puts today's
global PE operating rate at 86%. He sees growth absorbing added capacity by
1998. Utilization rates by then would rise to 91%, which would put new
pressure on pricing.
   Super-condensing-type modes for LLD/HDPE plants developed by BP
Chemicals, Exxon Chemical, and Union Carbide make a second PE expansion
feasible. But the impact won't be felt before 1999.
   In styrenics, consultants foresee crystal grades averaging 48 cents/lb.
in 1996, a figure that is close to current levels. Added capacity in the
styrene-importing regions (Western Europe and the Far East) is seen causing
a 50% drop in U.S. exports. Ed Glatzer of Chem Systems anticipates styrene
averaging 36 cents/lb. in 1996 and 33 cents/lb. in 1997, which would help
keep PS and ABS prices low.
   In vinyl, Richard Roman, Roman Assoc., Cleveland, OH, sees a
supply-demand balance lasting several years. New capacity will about match
anticipated growth. The U.S. and Eastern European producers, moreover, are
likely to be export bases for meeting the PVC needs of developing nations.

STRONG GROWTH WILL CARRY OVER INTO DIVERSE MARKETS AND APPLICATIONS

By:
Robert Colvin, with Stephen Moore in Tokyo

   Polypropylene is the only olefin resin in North America, Western Europe,
and Japan to have registered substantive growth last year. The material
showed most gains in blow molded containers (North America), sheet,
profile, and film extrusion, and injection molded packaging.
   These results stem from end-use growth and polypropylene's continuing
versatility as a resin, which is expanding its use in areas like
packaging.
   The results in North America, at least, also reflect a shift that took
place in inventory and production last year. In 1994, U.S. sales of most
commodity resins were at double-digit levels - at times beyond the
abilities of production capacity, according to Kevin Boyle of Occidental
Chemical Corp., Dallas, TX, chairman of the Society of the Plastics
Industry's Committee on Resin Statistics. This in turn led to a run on
purchasing, which shifted inventories of volume resins from producers to
converters. As buying slowed in 1995, inventories shifted back to
producers, with the result being that in the U.S., while production of all
plastics rose 3.4% in 1995 over 1994, total sales and captive use increased
by only 0.3%, according to figures released by the SPI at a press briefing
in its Washington, DC, headquarters on Dec. 6, 1995.

Resin's strength lifted U.S. production figures
   Though SPI began including Canadian sales with those of the U.S. in PP
last year, thus making year-to-year comparisons with 1994 difficult, Boyle
noted during the press briefing that had PP production been deleted from
1995 U.S. resin figures, thermoplastics production would have declined by
half, to 1.7% over 1994.
   In many global markets polypropylene producers are, however,
anticipating a first-quarter turnaround from fourth-quarter 1995. If this
happens, processors will find plenty of material - inventories at many
suppliers are reportedly hovering at around 6 to 7 weeks' supply. Prices,
moreover, should remain at or around current levels in most areas. No wild
fluctuations are predicted. Nor do many experts foresee PP supply
tightening before 1999.
   Consultant Phillip Townsend Assoc. Inc. (PTAI), Houston, TX, projects an
average annual growth in worldwide PP consumption of 7.2% between 1994 and
1999.
   Continuing advances in PP performance are strengthening its
price/properties ratio. A number of manufacturers have come up with ways to
improve properties and thus bridge the performance gap between the resin
and select engineering polymers. Examples include the Hivalloy
polymerization process from Montell, Wilmington, DE; injection molding
grades of impact copolymer from Fina Oil & Chemical Co., Dallas, and new
Controlled Crystallinity PP (CCPP) resins manufactured by Borealis, Lyngby,
Denmark.
   Some observers estimate that as much as two-thirds of PP's consumption
increase is at the expense of other thermoplastics. Robert Woods, business
manager for PP at Quantum Chemical, Cincinnati, OH, says that due to gains
in clarity, renewed interest has surfaced in PP as a substitute for PET in
some dairy and food containers such as peanut butter jars.
   Rexene Products Co., meanwhile, has a developmental PP-based flexible
polymer, Rexflex FPO, which the Dallas-based supplier claims will pull
automotive market share from PUR and foamed PVC, by virtue of its improved
melt strength and a 35% lower density than PVC.
   Joseph T. Bonk, specialty polymers manager, says automotive applications
are expected to include skin-covered foamed instrument panels whose
strength will be that they are made from a single resin - PP - thus 
facilitating recycling. Since the material contains no plasticizers, window
fogging is not a problem. To meet expected FPO demand, Rexene is building a
50-million-lb./yr. facility in Odessa, TX, that is to come on stream in the
third quarter.

Asia remains large growth market
   Outside North America, Western Europe, and Japan, the demand equation
for PP changes radically. Consultant Andrew Stevens at PTAI, for example,
sees average annual growth for Asia (excluding Japan) of 11.5% through
1999.
   Demand for PP in China remains high and is growing by as much as 11%
annually. Present local production stands at 2.64 billion lb./yr. compared
with demand of 4.4 billion lb./yr. By 2010, some 8.65 billion lb./yr. will
be needed. Because local producers won't be able to meet demand, observers
predict that imports will not only meet consumption needs in China, but
have a ripple effect on global supply. Assuming demand remains constant and
price is attractive, excess capacity could flow to China and create tight
supplies elsewhere.
   Tianjin United Chemical, Tianjin, China, has just started up an
882-million-lb./yr. PP plant based on Montell technology. Two other
882-million-lb./yr. plants have also come on stream: one in Guangdong,
financed by Hong Kong and Taiwanese investors, and one at the Zhongyuan
Petrochemical Union, which uses Montell technology.
   Other important PP markets include India with about 16% yearly growth
potential. India, despite a population of about 950 million, has one of the
lowest per-capita plastics consumption rates in the world, about 1 kg. (2.2
lb.) The average global consumption rate is around 16 kg. (35 lb.) The
U.S., by contrast, consumes about 60 kg. (132 lb.) of plastics/person. The
potential for PP (as well as other resins) is thus tremendous.
   Major players like Reliance Industries, Bombay, and Indian
Petrochemicals, Baroda, are expanding capacities. Domestic PP capacity
should rise to 1.19 billion lb./yr. by 1996 and to 2.64 billion lb./yr. by
2000. Reliance is setting up a 771-million-lb./yr. plant at Jamnagar in
addition to a 771-million-lb./yr. facility at Hazira. This capacity will
make it the sub-continent's largest PP producer.
   Elsewhere in the region, Pakistan's Ravi Chemicals Group, in a joint
venture with British-based Alyph Ltd., is to build a 154-million-lb./yr.
plant in Karachi - the country's first. Pakistan uses 110 million lb./yr.
The balance is for export.

Production expansions, consolidations proceed
   Capacity expansions and realignments are, of course, ongoing everywhere.
In Japan last year there was the merger of Tokyo-based Showa Denko and
Nippon Petrochemicals, which created a polyolefins giant offering 762
million lb./yr. of capacity. This was followed by further consolidation in
the Japanese market with a union between Mitsui Petrochemical Industries
and Ube Industries, in Tokyo, to offer 992 million lb./yr. of nameplate
capacity.

New capacity is coming on stream
   Europe has 14 PP suppliers. Among them is Dow Europe, Horgen,
Switzerland, which has plans to build a 440-million-lb./yr. plant at Buna
in the former East Germany.
   In Africa, meanwhile, Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany, has increased
capacity from 132 million lb./yr. to 330 million lb. at its 50:50 joint
venture in Sasolburg, South Africa.
   In the U.S., Solvay Polymers, Houston, TX, is building a gas-phase
reactor and also debottlenecking lines to increase capacity from 440
million lb./yr. to 770 million lb. at Deer Park, TX, this year.
   Exxon Chemical Co., which is also based in Houston, has plans to build a
527-million-lb./yr. plant in Baytown, TX.

Many plants are built, few are being closed
   Will all this capacity be needed? Particularly in Europe where many
observers have complained for several years that there is already too much
capacity in place from too many producers?
   Observers point out that although a number of plants are going up, few
older ones are being decommissioned. Among the reasons that are cited for
this, according to Quantum's Woods, is that it may be easier to keep older
plants operating than to pay the cost of shuttering them and cleaning up
the property. Regulation not only influences plastics use, but affects the
economics of production as well.

VOLUME IS BEGINNING TO BUILD AS END-USERS ASSESS RESINS' BENEFITS

By:
Robert D. Leaversuch

   Metallocene-catalyzed polyolefins have generated much notice. But 1996
may be a watershed in determining their impact.
   Until now, metallocene polyethylene (mPE) and polypropylene (mPP) resins
have been circumscribed by narrow (though widening) grade slates,
confidential R&D, and patent disputes. Small, dedicated resin units
operate, but their capacity is less than 0.5% of market potential.
   Now, the catalysts are being retrofit to full-scale units for every
major polymerization process, which puts them into the production
mainstream. The trio of current mPE suppliers (Exxon, Dow, and Mitsui)
becomes a pack in 1996. Five suppliers are set to launch mPP grades.
Processors can also expect mPE and perhaps mPP technology to be licensed by
other producers before 1996 is over (table).
   The materials could help to sustain plastics growth rates at historic
levels (i.e., double the GDP). ``Metallocenes potentially allow polyolefins
to replace [some] higher-cost performance materials,'' states Ron Yocum,
CEO at Quantum Corp.
   There's little doubt among processors and suppliers that mPE and mPP can
offer cost-performance gains across a swath of specialty markets.
Metallocene PE is commercial, in the U.S., in niches like
controlled-permeation films (e.g., produce bags) and low-residuals wire and
cable, and, in Europe, flexible hosing.
   In dispute is how fast and how far grades can go in ``pseudo-commodity''
markets. Pseudo-commodity applications use volume resins like PE and PP,
but require property enhancements, like clarity and toughness, which
justify a premium and are attainable via metallocene catalysis.
   Examples are some clarity films (now served by LDPE), stretch film
(typically higher-alpha-olefin LLDPE), and flexibles (plasticized vinyl and
rubber).
   Consultants foresee 1996-98 as a time when mPE and mPP extend their
reach (most rapidly in the U.S.) to larger markets: e.g., stretch film
(superior toughness and cling), molded medical parts, and polymer
modifiers.

Battling constraints in metallocenes' use
   ``There's no doubt about mPE's specialties role; what's less clear is
end-user commitment in volume markets,'' says John Murphy of Catalyst
Consultants Inc., Spring Hills, PA. One reason for end-user ambiguity is
the desire to keep a low profile to retain a competitive advantage. More
substantive reasons for questioning the growth of metallocene materials use
have been resin capacity limits, cost, and processability.
   ``Capacity limits are no longer a realistic long-term constraint,''
declares Bob Bauman, of consultant Chem Systems, Tarrytown, NY. He says
that in the past year, a number of suppliers have run mPE in gas-phase,
slurry, loop, and high-pressure process units (table). Retrofits involve
upgrading a unit's catalyst delivery system and changing reactor
conditions, both done at modest cost.
   Exxon has run 30 million lb. of mPE on a 1-billion-lb./yr. gas-phase
plant in the U.S. Thus, it seems feasible to capitalize on mPE benefits
without building specialized or dedicated capacity - a view also taken by
BP, Union Carbide, and Mobil. In theory, at least, it is feasible to use a
new type of swing capacity - units that shift between metallocene and
conventional catalysts.
   Other sources point out the practical limits to retrofitting metallocene
catalysts to units. In fact (as with current LLDPE/HDPE swing units), this
capability is likely to be used rarely, since units are large and
inflexible. Except in large volumes, shifting between grades and catalysts
adds downtime, increases off-spec transition material, cuts throughput, and
raises cost.
   A common strategy is to convert small, often aging, reactors to mPE, an
approach taken by Union Carbide, Hoechst, BASF, and BP. David James,
Carbide's R&D director, suggests that dedicated plants best optimize
comonomer use at present (metallocenes being 10-fold more efficient than
regular catalysts).
   Dow favors dedicated capacity. It has announced a 300% increase in
worldwide mPE (tradename Insite) capacity for 1996. This includes a second
125-million-lb./yr. unit in the U.S., and a 150-million-lb. unit in Spain.
Len Azzaro, PE commercial director, says LLDPEs using Insite technology
will be made at a 400-million-lb./yr. unit by late 1996.

Cost is an issue: will premium stay or be cut?
   Metallocene PE catalyst costs 1 to 1.5 cents/lb. more than HAO-LLDPE
catalyst. This helps make mPE 10 to 15% costlier than LLDPE. And it creates
a dilemma: dedicated units cost more to run, volumes do not yet justify
dedicating full-scale units, and economies of scale are adverse. Balaji
Singh of consultant Phillip Townsend Assoc., Houston, TX, says suppliers
must pare mPE costs to gain share. He sees catalyst costs falling to under
1 to 1.5 cents/lb. in excess of LLDPE in five years.
   In theory, this should lower resin prices. But Bill Kuhlke of consultant
Kuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX, expects suppliers (with an estimated $3.3
billion in metallocenes investment) to keep premiums up, perhaps for as
long as 15 years, to pay back costs of development and in capacity. Others
say the market will determine price, payback notwithstanding.
   Exxon and BP plan to run mPE on large-scale gas reactors. This could
entail high operating costs, but they see it as the best way to seed
markets as demand grows. Eventually, mPE volumes would rise, and a
full-scale plant could be dedicated. Estimates of when this crossover might
occur range from five to 10 years.
   Suppliers cite gains in making mPE more processable. Singh notes that a
shift to metallocenes in markets like stretch film and medical moldings can
be a ``minor headache'' for processors versus shifting from LDPE to LLDPE.
   Horst Maack, president of consultant Maack Business Services, Au,
Switzerland, questions whether mPE can be run in Europe's (mostly LDPE)
process equipment by just tweaking machinery. Maack says mPE involves
higher conversion costs for those adopting mPE in film in Europe. Changes
in screws, die gaps, feed sections, and winding equipment add 5% to 30% to
investment. And mPE also runs hotter than conventional PE, so throughputs
could fall and costly controls may be needed.
   ``A landslide in volume markets in Europe is likely when mPE matches
LDPE's processability,'' says Maack. He sees 200,000 tons (400 million lb.)
of mPE use in Europe by 2000.
   Hartz Mann, BASF's PE applications director, sees blending as one way to
introduce mPE in Europe. BASF's tubular LDPE capacity is said to be optimal
for plastomer versions (grades of 0.886 to 0.910 g./cc. density). Slurry
process units may prove most suitable for high-density mPEs.
   Penetration by mPE and mPP technologies also depends on licensing.
Exxon, with a broad stake in patents, and alliances with Hoechst
(catalyst), Mitsui (gas-phase process), and DSM (plastomers), may have an
edge. But licensing also requires a servicing and know-how infrastructure,
which may give Union Carbide and BP an inside track.
   Roland Hingmann, BASF's R&D director for polypropylene, says that
running mPP in PP plants is feasible, if not as simple as for mPE. The
ability has, in fact, been demonstrated by Hoechst, Exxon, BASF, and others
in gas and slurry reactors. BASF is promoting with its technology improved
homopolymer, controlled-rheology grades, high-stiffness and -toughness
copolymers, and reactor TPOs.


These are the top contenders in the drive to commercialize technology for
production of metallocene-based polymers*

DEMAND MATCHES GDP GROWTH IN DEVELOPED NATIONS, SURGES IN ASIA

By:
Joseph A. Grande


   Last year ABS demand stabilized in many areas and approached more
traditional growth rates.
   Use of ABS showed a decline of about 8% in the U.S., the first drop in
four years, while Europe managed a slight gain. Consumption was strong in
Japan, which posted an 8% gain, the first significant increase in five
years. Meanwhile, the rest of the Far East had double-digit growth. The
overall performance was a distinct contrast to 1994, which saw
above-average consumption.
   ``Performance in 1994 was not real growth because we were coming out of
deep recession,'' says Harald Laesche, ABS product manager at Bayer AG,
Leverkusen, Germany. As a result, observers say 1995's weaker numbers
should be viewed within the market's overall performance of the last five
years. During that period, ABS has grown about 3% annually, in line with
GDP growth of developed countries, says Ulf Buergel, business manager of
styrene copolymers for Dow Europe, Horgen, Switzerland.

Bayer acquisition changes global scene
   The lineup of global players changed last year, as Bayer revealed plans
to purchase Monsanto's ABS business. The move will more than double Bayer's
capacity and propel it into the top tier of ABS producers, alongside Chi
Mei and GE Plastics.
   A global study of the styrenics business by consultant Chem Systems,
Tarrytown, NY, predicts 5 to 6% annual growth through 2000. Mature U.S. and
European markets will see marginal gains.
   Demand in Japan will grow at an average of 1.6% over the next three
years, led by toys, leisure goods, and construction, according to the Japan
ABS Resin Industry Assn., Tokyo. Use in vehicles will decrease due to lower
production volumes and increased substitution of PP. Meanwhile, exports are
forecast to grow at an average annual rate of 9.2%. Hot destinations are
China, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
   The rest of the Far East will enjoy double-digit growth, says Edward
Glatzer of Chem Systems.
   In inter-polymer substitution, competition with PS and PP is at
equilibrium, suppliers claim. High-impact PS and PP continue to nip at ABS,
however, particularly in appliances that were over-engineered in ABS. In
European autos, governmental requirements for impact at low temperature may
bring back interiors that had been switched to PP.
   One bright spot last year was continued demand for ABS and ABS/PC blends
in computers and telecommunications. Growth is spurred by miniaturization
and the ability of materials to provide thin walls, strength, and high
processability. These blends are growing at a 15 to 20% rate in
applications such as cellular phones and notebook computers. On the other
hand, ABS has seen significant erosion in computer monitors and keyboards.
PS has gained a strong foothold based on cost and lower physical
requirements.
   A key target for GE Plastics is building and construction. The firm is
pushing Cycolac ABS, coextruded with a capstock of
acrylic/styrene/acrylonitrile, for window profiles, cladding, and other
components.
   Most of the world's capacity buildup is in Asia. Chi Mei, Tainan,
Taiwan, has plans to construct a 441-million to 882-million-lb./yr. plant
in Singapore or Malaysia. The company also plans to boost capacity in
Taiwan to 2.6 billion lb./yr. by 1998.
   Toray Industries, Tokyo, will double capacity in Malaysia to 353 million
lb./yr. by summer, making it the largest ABS facility in Southeast Asia.
   Improved processability remains crucial. At Dow, new Magnum ABS grades
provide lower plateout and double the melt flow rate.

SPECIALTY GRADES PROMISE GROWTH DESPITE SHORTAGES OF GLASS FIBERS

By:
Peter Mapleston


   Supply problems for nylon compounds have much to do with the
availability of glass-fiber reinforcements. A shortage in fibers occurred
after a fast pick-up in demand that started in 1994 and carried through
first-half 1995.
   Glass-fiber prices also moved up over 15% in 1995, though they are still
at sub-1980's levels. This year could see them rise again, from 5% into
double digits, depending on market conditions, which are softening in
areas.
   Another issue is the decision by Owens Corning to phase out 10-micron
fibers favored by many compounders (mostly European) and focus on 11- and
14-micron fibers that are less costly to produce. That's reflected in the
price: OCF 14-micron fibers sell for around 15% less than 10-micron
grades.
   At Hoechst-Celanese in Dallas, TX, nylon 66 product manager Chuck
Calhoun says the company has ``outstanding'' glass fiber-reinforced
products that rely on very fine fibers for much of their performance -
performance that could be hard to reproduce with thicker types.
   Jim Morelli, sales and marketing director at AlliedSignal, Morristown,
NJ, is sanguine. Allied's Capron nylon 6 grades ``are very forgiving. We
can use a significant number of types of fibers.''
   Resin-wise, if demand stays around 7%/yr., there should be no problems
in nylon 66 supply. Nylon 6 supply is less critical, due largely to a
slackening in the fibers market that enables polymer makers to divert
material to compounds. In Europe especially, millions of pounds of polymer
from ex-East Bloc countries are available. Nylon 66 prices are thus firm,
while nylon 6 price is under downward pressure.
   While the auto market in North America is flat overall, growth in nylons
will come through increased penetration into manifolds. Japanese car makers
are also switching to nylon manifolds.
   Prospects, in fact, look good for nylon 6 in air-intake manifolds.
Glass-reinforced compounds perform as well or better than 66 in parts
assembled by vibration welding, which is replacing lost-core injection
molding for manifolds fitted to some European cars. Allied says Capron HPN
(high-productivity nylon) 6 grades, initially for packaging, may be
preferable to 66 in lost-core molding, since their high flow improves cycle
times and reduces core shift. The company claims the grades allow
productivity gains of 20 to 30% over standard nylon 6.
   Bayer has programs with auto-makers for making large parts using hybrid
technology in which plastics, often nylons, are molded around large metal
inserts. Parts include cross-car beams, door panels, and seat frames.
   At Hoechst-Celanese, Calhoun cites good growth in niche automotive
electronics, as well as in components for suspension systems called
spring-seat spacers. The components, each around 4 oz., replace fabricated
metal, saving weight and cost.
   Several companies are introducing nylons with improved high-temperature
properties (Dec MP, 74). DuPont has added Zytel HTN semi-aromatic grades in
Europe. Main target is automotive - fog-lamp housings, ignition parts,
sensors, components for ABS brakes - but several electronics applications
are turning up for dimensional stability and heat resistance. Grades have a
glass-transition temperature 135 degrees F. higher than nylon 66;
properties are marginally affected by water uptake. Creep is low.
   Most activity for nylons in packaging is in films with improved barrier.
EMS-Chemie, Domat/Ems, Switzerland, has introduced what it terms
``multi-polyamides'' that contain over three types of nylon, and in some
cases as many as five. The copolymers are for niches such as cheese
packaging, to prevent the ballooning that occurs when cheese gases can't
escape through skin packaging.
   The materials replace PVdC in multilayer structures. According to EMS,
they are as good as PVdC at keeping oxygen out of the pack, and better at
letting carbon dioxide out. The materials are also said to be easier to
process than PVdC. Their low melt point and crystallinity suit them for
biaxial orientation.

SURGING DEMAND IN HIGH-GROWTH REGIONS BUOYS END-USE OUTLOOK

By:
Martin O'Neill


   Polyvinyl chloride sales were generally even in North America and
Western Europe last year, and off substantially (approximately 9.5%) in
Japan. Reasons for the material's performance in these regions, apart from
the continuing recession in Japan, include a second-half decline in
economically sensitive end-use markets like housing starts and general
construction, conversion to competitive materials like PET and PP in
packaging, and, to a degree, issues of recyclability.
   Exports, however, were up in many areas, notably from the U.S. (about
1.4 billion lb. - a 20% jump from 1994); also, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, and
Eastern Europe. Factors influencing this range from the weakness of the
U.S. dollar to European currencies like the German mark (though the price
differential is not as pronounced as it was in 1994), to overcapacity in
Japan chasing developing market opportunities in Asia.
   The outlook for PVC use this year varies by region. Since PVC demand
tends to follow GDP growth in the developed nations, average growth is
forecast for North America and Western Europe. Some economists predict
economic growth in the 2 to 2.6% range for the Group of Seven nations - the
U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan - primarily
as a result of efforts to reduce budget deficits. Others predict that some
national economies will experience less growth - as little as 1.3% in the
U.S., for example. The winner would appear to be Japan, for which growth of
2.1% is forecast by some experts for 1996 - low compared to many countries,
but a substantial jump from the 0.1% growth predictions for 1995 that were
made late last year.
   In other areas, PVC could see sizeable growth. Infrastructure repair,
for example, will continue in Eastern Europe, creating demand for window
profiles. The growing economies of some Latin American countries and the
continuing strength of Asia bode well for PVC use in these areas.
   And while PET continues to take share away from PVC in packaging, some
applications are holding firm while others are reverting to the material.
In France, Evian has switched from PVC to PET bottles for its mineral
water, and Vittel will follow suit this year. Yet due to its price, PVC
continues to play a major role in bottled water. In film, one European
grocery chain is changing back to PVC from polyethylene for meat wrap, to
get a shelf life of 2 to 4 days versus 24 hr. with PE.
   The bright spot in the PVC market, as with other resins, is Asia, where
capacity and demand are increasing, albeit from a relatively low starting
point. Joint ventures among Japanese, South Korean, and Western companies
are prominent, but domestic development is also strong.
   Thailand was a net exporter of PVC for the first time in 1994. It has
embarked on an ambitious expansion program that could see it become the
world's largest supplier in the next decade.
   India's PVC market is expected to grow from 1.03 billion lb. to 1.76
billion lb. by 2000, according to industry estimates.
   Demand for PVC in Vietnam is 110 million lb./yr., but growing by 20%
annually. Occidental Chemical Corp, Dallas, TX, and trading house Marubeni
Corp., Osaka, Japan, are establishing a 220-million-lb./yr. suspension
plant in southern Vietnam, which is due on stream by 1998. The venture,
Oxy-Vina Plastics and Chemical Co., is the first involving a U.S.
corporation in that country since resumption of diplomatic relations
between America and Vietnam last year.
   In China, PVC capacity is about 3.3 billion lb./yr. Imports amounted to
1.07 billion lb. in 1994, including copolymers. The country plans to
complete three plants before 1998, increasing capacity by 352 million
lb./yr., according to the Ministry of Chemical Industry.

REGIONAL GROWTH, OVERCAPACITY MAY CHANGE PATTERNS OF SUPPLY

By:
Martin O'Neill


   The phenomenal growth of PET in packaging over the last 20 years may be
slowing in mature markets, like North America, but its potential in largely
untapped markets assures solid growth for the foreseeable future.
   G. Keith Mitchell, director of consultant PCI Ltd., in London, noted the
potential for PET in several regions at a conference late last year
sponsored by The Packaging Group Inc., Milltown, NJ. Per-capita consumption
in North America and Europe is, respectively, 3362 and 1150 g. But it's
only 520 g./person in South America, 270 g. in the Middle East and Africa,
and 220 g./person in Asia-Pacific.
   Overall, observers say the outlook for 1996 is ``snug,'' with Europe
projected to import up to 363 million lb. of resin this year, a 7.8%
increase over 1995. The North American supply-demand ratio should be
relatively balanced in 1996, with quantities available for export to Europe
and South America. Much surplus capacity exists in Asia and Asia-Pacific,
where output is 20% for domestic use and 80% for export.
   Meanwhile, the capacity buildup continues worldwide, and will have an
impact as soon as next year. In 1997, Europe's PET imports are projected by
Mitchell to decline to 15 million lb. In 1998, he forecasts that Europe
will be a net exporter, capable of shipping 321 million lb.
   By 1997-98, if all the capacity that's under construction or planned
comes on line, says Guido Ghisolfi, CEO of Sinco Engineering, an Italian
builder of PET plants, there could be global overcapacity of 6.6 billion
lb.
   Among changes that experts like Ghisolfi see from this is a demand by
the major end-users of PET to stabilize the resin's price structure
worldwide. Ghisolfi says that about 10 multinationals (e.g., Nestle,
Unilever, Coca-Cola) consume 60% of PET. If such overcapacity occurs, it
would be a buyer's market, and the volumes these end-users consume will
give them much leverage in pressing for price stability - even to insisting
that prices not be tied entirely to raw materials' costs.
   Such observations are speculative. Yet expansions continue.
   Eastman Chemical is building in Spain and Latin America, and targets 3.4
billion lb. in place globally in late 1998.
   Hoechst will triple capacity to over 3 billion lb. by 2000, and may
build in Asia.
   Shell Chemicals will bring North American capacity to 1.1 billion
lb./yr. In Italy, capacity will be doubled to 352 million lb./yr. by early
1997, in Patrica.
   ICI has a U.S. plant in precommission, which will boost North American
capacity to 363 million lb./yr. A 264-million-lb./yr. European plant will
come on stream this year, raising the regional total to 484 million
lb./yr.
   Meanwhile, Dow Europe has entered the PET business via an agreement with
Enichem, whereby Dow acquires 80% of its Inca Intl. subsidiary in Italy.
   In Japan, Kaneko is adding a 33-million-lb./yr. unit in Sabae to
complement its 55-million-lb./yr. plant in Hofu.
   Mitsui Petrochemical has absorbed Mitsui PET Resin Co., its bottle-grade
marketing arm, to combine its PET and purified terephthalic acid
activities.
   And China's Shantou Oceanic Group recently obtained approval to build
PET film and bottle-grade resin plants. Japanese sources believe China's
total PET resin capacity will grow from 3.8 billion lb./yr. in 1994 to 5.3
billion lb./yr. in 1997. Nonetheless, the country is expected to remain a
net importer of the resin through the 1990s.

RESIN SHORTAGE SHOULD EASE THIS YEAR AS CAPACITY COMES ON STREAM

By:
Peter Mapleston


   The market for PC has been tight, due to high demand (10 to 12% growth
in late 1995) and supply problems experienced by several producers last
year.
   But relief is coming. This year there will be 135 million lb./yr. more
in GE's Burkville, AL, plant, and a further expansion of undisclosed size
at Bergen op Zoom, in The Netherlands. Bayer is debottlenecking three
plants, in Belgium, Germany, and the U.S.; and it is considering adding a
third line in Antwerp, Belgium. Dow is also debottlenecking. Bayer,
meanwhile, awaits approval - possibly in the first quarter - for a
25-million-lb./yr. plant in China.
   The net result of these expansions, says Bayer vp. Mark Witman, is that
supply will be back in balance in 1997.
   ``Demand will be strong in 1996, but not as strong as in 1995,'' says
Dow Chemical's PC business director Mike Murry, in Midland, MI. GE's Lexan
manager in Europe, Robert Williams, expects a slowdown in growth to as
little as 5%/yr.
   Meanwhile, prices rose over 10% last year, with the highest jump in the
Far East, where they are near twice those of mid-1994, compared to some 40%
higher in Europe. Suppliers expect prices to stick in 1996.
   Growth in the Far East remains strong. Production of PC in Japan was
likely to exceed 450 million lb. last year. Demand is fueled by electronics
and exports. With Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and South Korea active importers
of Japanese PC, exports are again expected to account for over half of
Japanese shipments. Coupled with increases in domestic use, Japanese
shipments may rise 10% in 1995, versus 35% in 1994.
   Korean demand for PC is seen surpassing 50 million lb. in 1995, owing to
growth in electronics and automotive. The market is expected to continue
its dependence on imports until the only polymer maker, Samyung Kasei,
completes an expansion to 66 million lb./yr. at the end of 1997.
   Demand for PC in China, mainly from processors in Guangdong, will likely
double by 2000. China imports almost all its PC. Local producers have
capacity of 5.5 million lb./yr., but production problems have seen output
dwindle to under 2.2 million lb./yr.
   Production of CDs for music, computer data, and (soon) movies will
provide double-digit growth through the decade, with some putting the
figure at around 25%/yr. Bayer, GE, and Japan's Teijin are leaders in this
sector; Dow has a grade in development.
   Bayer is working on film insert molding for automotive and other
applications. First commercial use of the technology has been small parts
on which the film provides functional markings on switches and dials. Films
will be used for esthetics on larger parts. Films coming out of Bayer's
plant in Berlin, CT, coextrusions of PC and thermoplastic polyurethane,
have a soft touch.
   Prospects for PC blends in bumpers don't look good. GE, however, is
getting Xenoy used in body panels (mostly fenders) on limited-edition cars
as well as trucks. And it will supply material for the plastics-bodied
Smart car to be built by the Mercedes-Swatch venture in 1997 or 1998.
   Packaging activity revolves around multitrip containers for milk and
water. Dairies in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland have switched to PC
bottles, which can make 50 trips or more. Consumers like them because they
open more easily than cartons and are lighter than glass. Retailers like
them because, being square, they fit better onto pallets and require 30%
less space.
   Three- and 5-gal. containers for mineral water are finding more use.
Bayer cites double-digit growth in Europe, the Far East, and South America,
and says the potential market is 10 times higher than today.

WELCOME TO A `WORLDWIDE WEB'

By:
Patrick A. Toensmeier

   In 1996, MODERN PLASTICS will offer its own version of a ``worldwide
web.'' The ``web sites'' will be international plastics shows. Our ``web
servers'' will be tabloids developed for each show and distributed
on-site.
   There will be at least seven shows so covered. They are, as highlighted
on the map: Aseanplast, in Jakarta (Mar. 12-15); Argenplas, in Buenos Aires
(Apr. 18-24); Plastexpo, Lyon, France (May 21-24); Mercoplast, Rio de
Janeiro (Aug. 20-21); International Plastics Fair, Tokyo (Oct. 11-15);
Ausplas, Melbourne, Australia (Oct. 22-26); and Interplas, Birmingham,
England (Nov. 10-14). We may also produce a tabloid for Chinaplas, in
Beijing (Mar. 26-30), and for Equiplast, in Barcelona, Spain (Oct. 20-25).
   The tabloids will feature information about new products on display at
each show. They will also include overviews of local markets, business
trends, and other issues of interest to processors.
   Importantly, the news that MODERN PLASTICS acquires in developing these
tabloids, and in covering the shows, will be reported in the magazine as
well. And the contacts that our editors make in this process will help us
to provide, on a continuing basis, the information and perspective on
process technology, market issues, and business trends our readers need for
their decision-making.
   We will, of course, have a presence at more expositions this year.
MODERN PLASTICS' global editorial staff will cover over 20 shows around the
world in 1996. Show coverage may seem routine. But it's an opportunity for
readers to review the latest developments in materials and machinery that
can contribute to the capability and profitability of their operations.
   In today's global economy, trade shows are not local events. The
products and technologies they feature have an impact on companies
worldwide. Show coverage is part of the continuing effort by MODERN
PLASTICS to keep readers in step with developments that affect their
businesses, no matter where they do business.

MODULAR INJECTION MACHINES SUIT A WIDE RANGE OF REQUIREMENTS

By:
EDITED BY MERLE R. SNYDER

   The Allrounder S models have further extended the degree of modularity
in Arburg's injection molding machines to incorporate units for all levels
of sophistication. The company has introduced two models, with platen
tiebar distances of 220 by 220 mm. and 270 by 270 mm. Both accept clamp
units with clamp forces of either 17 or 28 ton, and injection units with
Euromap designations 60 and 150.
   These are all standard equipment. The 60 injection unit takes cylinder
modules with diameters of 18, 22, and 25 mm., while the 150 version takes
25-, 30-, and 35-mm barrels. The standard control is the Selogica, with a
32-bit multiprocessor and a monochrome flat screen.
   The 220S model with 17-ton clamp replaces Arburg's 170CMD, which will
cease production in the second quarter (Arburg gave up production of larger
CMD models two years ago). These two new machines go into series production
in February, and are part of what will eventually be a complete line.
   Arburg says special attention was paid to floor-space requirements,
noise emissions (maximum noise level is 72 dB) and ergonomic design. For
example, mold-temperature control units can be fixed onto the frame of the
machine and plugged into cooling water distribution channels integrated
into the machine base. Other peripherals can also be positioned in the
immediate vicinity of the machine. With high-end Selogica controls,
multi-axis robots can be programmed directly from the machine control
panel.
   Electrical interfaces are integrated into the base, at front and rear.
The water-cooled electrical cabinet on the front of the machine is divided
in two, with 23-v. electronics on one side and 230-v. electronics on the
other.
   There are four pump combinations on the hydraulics. The basic machine
has a servo valve for movements and pressure hold, a main pump, and a
manual cooling water distributor. Users can opt for extended hydraulics to
enable injection and clamp movements to run parallel, motor capacity can be
increased, and there are levels of regulation for the injection unit and
for cooling water distribution.
   The clamp unit employs a double-piston system that is highly compact and
also provides good force distribution. The hydraulic valves are attached
directly to the rear face or (for core pullers) on top of the third platen,
and oil is pumped straight to the pistons, without need for hose
attachments.
   The central hydraulics unit at the rear of the machine is
self-contained, and is easily fixed to the machine base. Replacement where
possible of hoses by fixed metal pipes makes assembly easier and also
increases precision in use, since the pipes have fixed volumes. Arburg

GRAVIMETRIC BLENDER

   GRAVIMETRIC BLENDER. Model 400 VME-II combines the economy of slide-gate
metering with an accuracy that reportedly rivals auger metering. Its double
``V'' slide gate design gives consistent material flow through the
discharge opening even when ingredient ratios are as low as 1%. This allows
the computer to determine the amount of material falling between the
metering device and the weigh hopper. To facilitate fast changeover, the
unit has easily removable weigh hopper, slide gate and auger units and
large clean-out doors. Menu-driven format simplifies operation. A movable
control panel stores up to 99 recipes, inventories all material, and
calculates average use rate. HydReclaim Corp., 3145 Copper Avenue, Fenton,

TWO-MATERIAL MACHINE

   TWO-MATERIAL MACHINE. The VL2000 coinjection molding machine is the
largest of its kind ever shipped by Milacron. Two injection units feed into
a manifold that directs and meters the two different melts. Injection
capacity of each unit is 232 oz. Either or both of the injection units can
be backed out of the manifold for independent purging. The manifold can
also be independently purged. Both the units and the entire molding process
are integrally controlled by the Milacron Camac 486 Plus control system. In
operation, a pin in the manifold moves to open path A, path B, or both
paths together. The control system integrates simultaneous operation of the
two injection units. In most cases conventional molds can be used with no
modification. The operation is essentially an encapsulation process.
Separate core and skin layers can be molded. The skin layer of virgin,
transparent, or other resin types is injected first. Next, the core resin
follows the skin resin, pushing the skin out in front of it. The core resin
can consist of regrind, post-consumer reclaim, or a structural material. A
small finishing amount of skin resin is injected after the core to seal the
gate and complete the encapsulation. Cincinnati Milacron, 4165 Halfacre
Road, Batavia, OH 45103

VERSATILE STAMPING SYSTEMS ENHANCE USER CAPABILITIES

By:
Martin O'Neill, with Jennifer Gordon


   The growing sophistication of control systems on hot-stamping machines
improves the accuracy and versatility of the process. The use of
micro-processor-based systems assures reliable digital control of key
functions. This allows for more consistent decorating, improved
trouble-shooting, and less downtime. Touch-button access on many units also
displays messages of machine functions.
   20 Examples include equipment from Acromark, Berkeley Heights, NJ, that
focuses on exterior marking of cylindrical and tapered parts, and features
improved marking speed, repeatability and safety. Its line of direct-acting
presses ranges from 1/2 to 20-ton force, with die areas from 4 in. by 5 in.
to 24 in. by 36 in. Model 730RR variants include automatic loading and
unloading, plus double-sided versions with double silicone rollers to
increase output speed to close to 60 parts/min. Applications include foil
or preprinted heat transfer decoration of cosmetics containers, canisters,
and bracelets.
   Cassco Machines, Don Mills, ON, Canada, offers a system controller as
standard, allowing operation with turntables, slide tables, peripheral
roll-on attachments, foil strip delays, and pick-and-place units. Control
extends to a dual-speed heat-transfer indexing system for multi-color image
application in a single operation. High-speed, automated systems range in
use from a 1/4-ton hand-fed application to an 18-ton automated factory
press.
   Kensol/Franklin Hot Stamping Machines, Norwood, MA, assembles
hot-stamping machines and makes foils, dies, and tooling at three U.S.
facilities. The KF Model 500 1/2-ton air-operated press features a
user-friendly microprocessor control system, micrometer depth-stop control,
and dual-hardened steel head guides, in ball bearings, suitable for
silicone rubber dies and rugged enough to stamp with metal engraved dies.
   Meanwhile, Air Hydraulics Decorating Systems, St. Louis, MO, offers a
standard line of heat-transfer and foil machinery including horizontal and
vertical roll-ons. The horizontal Accu-Roll is used to apply large heat
transfers while eliminating air entrapment and foil wrinkling. Standard
features include a non-contact infrared temperature sensor, overheating
protection circuit, and variable carriage speed up to 4 in./sec. A coaxial
air/hydraulic cylinder carriage drive with left to right stroke motion
supplies stroke lengths ranging from 15 to 27 in.
   Baier, Rudersberg, Germany, makes both direct-imprint hot stamping
equipment and label-stamping with die-cutting machines for label
production. The company's Geba 1/PPP is adapted to the plastics-processing
industry, with three heads mounted at different angles to stamp various
parts in one operation.
   Cosmetics containers and closures demand refined, fashionable colors,
and eye-catching matte or high-gloss effects to produce an elegant image
and add value to products. Baier developed its new Geba 60 model for
hot-stamping round, oval, and conical shapes. Advantages include fast
tooling changeover for dies and holders, and economic small-run
capabilities. For larger quantities, the machine can be equipped with a
magazine feed system. Capabilities include line or motif stamping, or both
combined.

Equipment is specialized to meet diverse needs
   Because of its cost advantage and durability, hot-stamping is
increasingly used for storage boxes. Hydraulic and hydro-pneumatic machines
are most suited to this application. Baier's model Geba 4/HY has a stamping
pressure of 15 tons. The movement of the plunger is dependent not on
distance, but on pressure, allowing differences in material thickness to be
overcome. Throat and insertion height allow the processing of voluminous
parts.
   Kurz, Furth, Germany, has an in-mold decoration (IMD) technique,
combining injection and hot-stamping of multi-dimensional, flat, or curved
thermoplastics parts for automotive components, cosmetics containers,
electronic equipment casings, domestic appliances, watch faces, picture
frames, door blinds, and nameplates. Foils are fed through a custom-built
injection molding tool.
   During resin injection, pressure and heat from the material cause
release of lacquer layers from the polyester carrier, which bond to the
part providing good chemical and scratch resistance. The thickness of the
polyester carrier depends on decoration depth, part size, injection
position point, and the material being processed. The spent polyester is
wound off. Kurz claims this technique reduces costs by 10 to 50%.
   20 Maple Roll Leaf Co. Ltd., Windsor, ON, Canada, manufactures
pigmented stampings for use in automotive, appliance, cosmetic, or
pharmaceutical industries. The company says bright colors can be applied to
dark substrates.
   Stamp-Rite, Lansing, MI, manufactures steel hot-stamping dies for long
runs. Dies can be surface ground several times with no measurable change in
the stroke of characters. The manufacturing process forms raised characters
on the die while it is in the hardened condition, reducing distortion or
shrinkage possibilities.
   Transfer Print Foils, Inc., East Brunswick, NJ, claims to provide a wide
selection of hot-stamping foils and laminates for decorating plastics.
Customization of printed foils is available for such items as home
furnishings, profiles, and appliances. Decorated laminates in roll or sheet
stock are 2-ply and 3-ply, from 0.020 gage to 0.187 gage. The company says
laminates are available on ABS, PVC, PC, styrene and acrylic.
   United Silicone, Lancaster, NY, provides hot-stamping systems, tooling,
and services. The 2-1/2-ton Model US 25 applies foil or heat transfers to
flat or slightly flat crowned surfaces, and up to 90 deg. of a cylindrical
part's circumference. The US 25's foil-advance system is
electric-motor-driven and produces constant pulling torque for smooth
advance. The system features a foil-tensioning arm, which automatically
removes slack from the foil to eliminate wrinkling. Adjustable foil guide
bars and guide rings provide flexibility and ease of adjustment without any
tools.

HYDROGEN FLUORIDE IS CUT FROM COMPOUNDING PROCESS
ACID SCAVENGER ADDITIVES NUKE (NEUTRALIZE) NOXIOUS FUMES

By:
GAIL S. NONNEMACHER AND DR. STEPHEN I. FOSTER
Edited by William A. Kaplan

   Hydrogen fluoride earns the highest hazard rating given by the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration for dangerous materials in
the workplace. Even in low concentrations its effects can still cause
significant health problems. We have found that HF can be released from
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) micropowders during compounding, and reach
impermissible levels capable of causing physical injury to workers. The use
of acid scavengers has been found to be highly effective in eliminating the
presence of this hazardous substance.
20 While studying the compounding of micronized PTFE (also termed
micropowders) in general-purpose polystyrene (GPPS), we encountered an
acrid odor. Although ventilation was used to mitigate the odor, it
persisted, especially in the vapor space of confined packages of the
micropowder and the concentrate. Our micropowder supplier thought the odor
originated from residual mineral oil used as a lubricant in its processing
operation and could be controlled by ventilation. This explanation did not
satisfy us and we discovered, surprisingly, the odor was HF. Although HF
can be liberated when PTFE decomposes at approximately 600 degrees F., this
is well above the processing temperature used in our study.
20 During the next compounding run, measurements at the vent port and die
face of the extruder as well as in the vapor space of the gaylords showed
HF concentrations well above 20 p.p.m. HF was also detected in the extruder
hoppers, which fed the concentrate for subsequent processing. The
concentration of HF in air was measured using a Sensidyne Model 800 pump
with hydrogen fluoride detector tubes. The estimates of HF concentration
depend on the degree of color change in the detector tube and the amount of
air drawn through the tube, and can be used to measure HF from 0.25 to 50
p.p.m. However, no HF could be detected outside the gaylords or the plastic
liner, or at a distance of greater than 4 ft. from the compounding
extruder.
   Micronized PTFE is normally prepared from virgin or scrap PTFE resin of
either the fine powder or granular variety. In producing micronized powder,
the PTFE is first coarsely ground and is then subjected to either electron
or gamma irradiation to reduce the molecular weight of the polymer. In
lowering the molecular weight, the PTFE becomes more crystalline; hence,
friable and grindable. The particle size can then be further reduced to
approximately 1 micron by air-impact grinding.

MW reduction process is a factor
   This processing sequence was followed by our micropowder supplier. From
discussions with PTFE industry experts, we learned that during the
irradiation process, the molecular weight of the PTFE is significantly
reduced from the 2- to 5-million range to approximately 200,000. This is
accomplished by breaking the carbon-carbon bond along the PTFE chains, a
process which creates many free radical species where the chains are
terminated. These reactive free radicals can combine with oxygen and/or
water from the air to form stable organic acids and acid fluorides. The
acid fluorides can further react with water to form organic acids,
liberating HF gas. Higher temperatures accelerate the liberation of HF.
Thus, when the micropowder is compounded, HF is liberated and slowly
diffuses out of the concentrate.
20 For example, one sample of the concentrate made during our study that
contained 20% PTFE was analyzed to determine the amount of hydrolyzible
fluoride, i.e., potentially releasable HF. The results indicate that the
pellets contained 5 p.p.m. hydrolyzible fluoride, which was assumed to be
available as HF. Assuming that a gaylord contains 1000 lb. of 20%
concentrate and that HF is an ideal gas, we calculated that, if all the HF
were instantaneously released, about 3000 p.p.m. could be found in the
vapor space of the gaylord. This calculation indicated that while the
amount of releasable HF in the pellet was small, there is enough
hydrolyzible fluoride in the concentrate to account for the HF measured in
the vapor space of the gaylords. The difference between the calculated and
actual amounts of HF in a gaylord is probably due to diffusion-limited
release of HF from the pellets.
20 We conjectured that HF generation during compounding was aggravated
due to the high melt temperatures that were employed, which ranged from 500
to 550 degrees F. Reduction of heating setpoints and throughput yielded a
lower melt temperature of 490 degrees F., but did not significantly impact
the generation of HF. We also hypothesized that pre-baking the PTFE
micropowder prior to compounding might reduce or remove much of the HF.
Several types of baked and unbaked, high and low irradiation PTFE were
obtained from our micropowder supplier and were compounded using our normal
extrusion temperatures, i.e., 500 to 550 degrees F. However, the level of
HF generated from the baked and unbaked samples was far in excess of
industrial hygiene limits.

Potential scavengers selected
   Based on the chemistry involved and our calculations indicating that the
concentration of HF in the pellets was exceedingly small, the use of an
acid scavenger represented a realistic approach to solving this problem.
Similarly, the suspected role of free radical chemistry in the production
of HF suggested that antioxidants, which scavenge free radicals, might also
be useful in solving this problem.
20 Acid scavenger candidates were: calcium stearate powders, DHT-4A (Mg
subscript 4.5 Al sbuscript 2 (OH) subscript 13 CO subscript3 .3 .5 H
subscript 2 O), and magnesium oxide powder. The calcium stearate and
magnesium oxide were pre-compounded into GPPS resin. Irganox B225 (from
Ciba-Geigy), an anti-oxidant, was also investigated, since it might react
with the PTFE chain ends to form a stable, non-reactive chain.
20 Blends of the 20% PTFE/80% GPPS concentrate and the potential
scavengers were re-compounded using typical operating conditions. (Table 1)
Potential scavengers were initially evaluated at loadings of 1% to provide
excess scavenger based on the measured level of hydrolyzible fluoride and
the reaction stoichiometry. The residual HF level was measured by
collecting a 7- to 10-lb. sample of the concentrate in a 60-liter PE bag,
sealing the bag for five minutes, and then measuring the HF evolved in the
air space. Upon discovery of a scavenger that resulted in a non-detectable
level of HF, the level of scavenger was halved and the experiment was
repeated. The lowest scavenger level investigated was 0.20%. (Table 2)
   Additional evaluation of successful scavengers considered their
hydroscopic nature and the expected likelihood to agglomerate. Also, to
confirm that enough scavenger remained to prevent HF formation during
additional processing steps, the preferred acid scavenger was initially
compounded at a level of 0.25% into the concentrate and the resulting
concentrate was re-compounded two times.
   Calcium stearate, DHT-4A, and magnesium oxide were determined to be
effective acid scavengers at 0.25 weight percent in the production of 20%
PTFE in GPPS concentrate. Irganox B225 was not effective at the levels
tested. Based on these results, calcium stearate was selected as the least
hydroscopic and having the smallest probability of agglomeration due to its
lower melting temperature and fine particle size. Re-compounding this
material two times produced no detectable HF after subsequent passes. Thus,
calcium stearate was incorporated into the production of the concentrate at
our contract compounder. No HF could be detected in the concentrate
produced, in sealed containers of the concentrate, or in any area of the
facility. Industrial hygiene monitoring has since been routinely conducted
and has failed to detect any HF.
20 It is reasonable to assume that the calcium stearate reacts with the
HF or HF-precursor to produce calcium fluoride (CaF2) and stearic acid.
Both of these reaction products are considered innocuous materials from an
industrial hygiene and reactivity standpoint, particularly at these low
concentrations. Stearic acid is known to act as a processing aid but at
these low levels it did not appear to impact extrusion conditions.
   This information may be useful to other processors, but it is important
to verify that acid scavengers will work in a particular system by
monitoring the level of HF in various areas.

RELATIVE STABILITY IN SUPPLY AND PRICING IS PROJECTED FOR MARKET

By:
Joseph A. Grande

   After a blockbuster 1994, demand for polystyrene eased to what many term
realistic levels in 1995. The market took off early in the year but fizzled
by mid-summer, as inventories soared, prices rose before settling in the
fourth quarter, and demand softened.
   In North America, demand dropped slightly. U.S. production of PS
declined by 0.9%, according to the Society of the Plastics Industry, while
sales and captive use were off by 2.6% over 1994.
   Western Europe and Japan were relatively flat as well. A bright spot in
Europe was expandable PS, which posted a 4% gain from demand for building
insulation in eastern Germany.
   The Far East enjoyed strong growth despite tight import restrictions in
China.
   Throughout the decade, PS should grow by 3 to 4% annually, says Edward
Glatzer, principal with consultant Chem Systems Inc., Tarrytown, NY, which
recently completed a study of the styrenics business. Glatzer said the
modest gains are attributed to more mature markets in North America and
Europe and the loss of export business in Japan to offshore companies.
Surging economies in the Far East, particularly China and India, will yield
double-digit growth in those areas.
   Suppliers see ample availability of feedstocks this year. Costs,
moreover, seem to have settled. Though prices rose through the summer in
North America and Europe, they have dropped 20 to 25%. Fewer imports into
China forced prices in the Far East to drop during the summer, says Karl
Foerster, PS market manager for BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany.
   Market-wise, in the U.S., observers agree that polystyrene is under less
pressure for material substitution. ``The easy substitutions by
polypropylene have been done; it's a lot slower than 3 or 4 years ago,''
said Marvin Sauers, PS business manager for Amoco Polymers, Alpharetta,
GA.
   In Europe, some volatility is possible, particularly in packaging
applications, because of the price gap between PP and PS (DM 0.90 to 1.20
for PP versus DM 1.60 for PS), says Bruno Barbet, product manager for Dow
Europe, Horgen, Switzerland.
   In North America and Europe, high-impact PS continues to penetrate the
business equipment market. As a less costly alternative to lower ABS and
PC/ABS, polystyrene finds growing use in keyboards, monitors, and housings
due to lower mechanical and thermal requirements.
   In 1995, polystyrene completed its virtual replacement of ABS in 3.5-in.
micro floppy disks, according to Richard Marchetti, director of market
development for Huntsman Chemical Co., Chesapeake, VA.
   Oriented PS, meanwhile, is making strides in rigid food packaging.
Grades with lower residual monomer don't affect the taste of packaged
goods.
   BASF, Mt. Olive, NJ, will unveil this year high-impact,
ultraviolet-light-stable grades that compete with PC/ABS in computer
housings. Under development are high-impact, high-gloss specialty grades
with 20% better melt flow, equivalent gloss, and improved impact compared
to the company's workhorse grade ES 9524. The materials would compete with
medium-impact ABS in small appliances and other consumer durables.
   There's not much expansion planned in the West this year, though BASF is
adding capacity in Mexico and the U.S., and Novacor, Leominster, MA, is
starting up 70 million lb. in Springfield, MA.
   Far East suppliers continue to build capacity, however, in response to
strong demand.
   One project made Zhanjiang Zhongmei Chemical Industries Co., Guangdong
Province, China's largest PS producer, when it added a second
88-million-lb./yr. line last year. The company is a Sino-American joint
venture, 70% owned by American Pacific Enterprises Group, Los Angeles, CA.

BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS OFFER TAILORED RATES OF DEGRADATION

By:
EDITED BY ROBERT D. LEAVERSUCH

   A number of biodegradable polymers have been developed that provide
precision-controlled degradation. These polymers are considered to be a
viable approach to plastics waste disposal in selected end-uses. They
include:
   -- Polyester amide is said to compost without residue at a rate
comparable to lettuce leaves. The semi-crystalline yet translucent material
resists solvents and light, has a melting point of 125C., and works in film
and fiber extrusion, and molding. Potential applications are garbage bags,
disposable flower pots, and mulch sheet. Bayer AG, Bayerwerk, D-51368,
Leverkusen, Germany
   -- Starch-based thermoplastic made from cereal feedstocks has
antistatic properties. The basic structure is comprised of copolyesters. A
plasticizer is blended on-line with the copolyester to form an antistatic
biodegradable material. Household and packaging films display toughness and
good elongation at break. BASF, Carl-Bosche Straabe 38, D-67056
Ludwigshafen, Germany
   -- Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) stays flexible from sub-zero to 130C.
temperatures, and biodegrades in a few months. The thermoplastic polyester
is a joint development of Biomer (a manufacturer of biodegradables) and PCD
Polymere, the European polyolefin supplier. Injection molding grades with
properties comparable to PS and PP run on conventional equipment. machines.
PCD Polymere, Danubiastrabe 21-25, A-2323, Schwechat-Mannsworth, Germany
   -- Aliphatic polyester works in PE, PP, and PS. Bionolle processes on
conventional processing equipment at 140 to 260 degrees C., in blown and
extruded films, foams, and injection molded products. Application areas are
paper lamination, trash bags, diapers, and cosmetic and beverage bottles.
Showa Highpolymer Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan
   -- Aliphatic polyester that biodegrades in soil as well as fresh and
ocean water areas, decomposes to water and carbon dioxide. Skygreen's rate
of degradation depends on grade, product shape, and level of
microbiological activity. Typically, degradation of a 40-mil-thick film
takes two months. Odorless material has properties similar to those of PE
and PP and can be readily processed on conventional equipment. Sunkyong
Industries Ltd., Kukdong Bldg., Choogmuro, Jung-Gu, Seoul 100-705, South

PBT MAKES A CLEAN SWEEP

   Thermoplastic polyesters allow the redesign of vacuum cleaner motors by
the Electrolux Group, Luton, U.K., yielding cost-performance benefits. The
motor's one-component, input air guide is molded from polybutylene
terephthalate, providing a smooth surface (for reduced turbulence) and
parts consolidation. The part had been a 10-component, stamped-metal
system. The air guide snapfits to a PET (Rynite 530) housing, eliminating
mechanical attachments. System cost is cut by less materials use and
simplified manufacturing. DuPont Engineering Polymers, P.O. Box 80713,

POLYETHERIMIDE RESINS

   POLYETHERIMIDE RESINS are said to improve processability and to optimize
the balance of heat and impact properties. Ultem HTX is targeted at
replacing stainless steel or high-performance polymers in medical and food
service markets. Notched Izod impact strength is 500% higher than a
standard polyetherimide grade. The new grade also features improved
chemical resistance for medically sterilizable applications. Ultem ATX is a
next-generation PEI/PC blend providing high impact strength, intermediate
thermals, and reduced cost. Unreinforced, the heat-distortion temperature
is 165 degrees C to 190 degrees C. Resin is for food-service applications
(microwaveable cookware, utensils), and also has potential in automotive
headlamp reflectors (it can be metallized without costly basecoat
procedures). GE Plastics, One Plastics Ave., Pittsfield, MA 01201

THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN 

THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN dragged on this week, with 
congressional and White House negotiators still exchanging 
philosophical barbs on Wednesday, Jan. 3, but offering no 
real retreat from hard-line positions for public view.  The 
Wall Street Journal summarized:  "Success is not at hand."  
The EPA parking lot was at least half full, however, begging 
the question as to whether a plethora of regulations and 
proposals would drop into the hopper once the government 
reopens.  More than a handful of "non-essential" workers were 
sneaking into their offices anyway.  Unlike past involuntary 
"furloughs," questions were raised as to whether employees 
would get their paychecks, half a paycheck or none at all.  
The questions were even more pressing for government 
contractors, who were looking at the possibility of layoffs.

DELANEY CLAUSE 

DELANEY CLAUSE decisions by EPA's OPPTS were among the key 
matters left hanging by the government shutdown.  EPA must 
decide whether to cancel some pesticide tolerances because 
of the anti-cancer provision of the law and whether to apply 
the clause to dried agricultural products under a definition 
which considers drying to be "processing."

A CHEMICAL SPILL 

A CHEMICAL SPILL in Bogalusa, La., in October is attracting 
dozens of lawyers, according to a Jan. 2 Fox-TV presentation 
"A Current Affair," with 50 cases already filed.  
Prominently featured was Johnnie Cochran of O.J. Simpson 
case notoriety, who accused EPA and the community of 
negligence in their emergency plan and said "somebody is 
going to be held responsible" (See Dec. 6, Page 2).  Gaylord 
Chemical Corp., the company involved in the freight train 
spill of nitrogen tetraoxide, was said to be holding 
transportation officials responsible.

UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS 

UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS are unlikely to be the cause of 
elevated breast cancer mortality rates in the Northeast, two 
Maryland epidemiologists wrote in the Dec. 20 Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute.  "Further reassurance is provided 
by the near absence of regional differences among younger 
women, plus the convergence of breast cancer rates across the 
country over time," wrote William Blot and Joseph McLaughlin 
of the International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Md.  
Their conclusion was based on an NCI statistical analysis of 
the regional distribution of breast cancer mortality in 1987.  
More research is needed to determine the role of genetic

MONSANTO's ROUNDUP 

MONSANTO's ROUNDUP was noted in the Jan. 2 Wall Street 
Journal as having continued success and even dominance, 
despite the growth of competition.  The journal said 
Monsanto plans to introduce "Roundup-ready" soybean seeds 
for plants resistant to the herbicide during the 1996 spring 
planting season.  It was also noted that the firm 
aggressively cut prices during 1995.

TRICHLORFON, AN ORGANOPHOSPHORUS INSECTICIDE, 

TRICHLORFON, AN ORGANOPHOSPHORUS INSECTICIDE, has been 
suggested as the cause of such congenital abnormalities as 
Down's Syndrome among a small Hungarian population who ate 
fish contaminated with the substance in the late 1980s, said 
researcher Andrew Czetzel of the World Health Organization 
in a letter to the editor in the January 1996 issue of 
Epidemiology.  According to Czetzel, of 15 births in a small 
village in Hungary in 1989-90, 11, or 73%, were affected by 
congenital abnormalities.  Several of the women who gave 
birth had consumed fish contaminated with 100 mg per kg of 
dichlorvos, which is slowly released in fish treated with 
trichlorfon, he said.  In the study, researchers ruled out 
teratologic factors, familial inheritance and consanguinity.  
Czetzel added that the cluster ceased when the chemical 
treatment of farmed fish with trichlorfon was banned in 
March 1991.

METHYL BROMIDE AND PENTACHLOROPHENOL STUDIES 

METHYL BROMIDE AND PENTACHLOROPHENOL STUDIES by the 
California EPA Department of Pesticide Regulation are not 
yet complete, and giving manufacturers additional time to 
complete them "is a question of process and fairness, not a 
health and safety issue," said department director James 
Wells.  Wells said that California Gov. Pete Wilson Dec. 29 
called a special legislative session to consider legislation 
in the state that would allow DPR to grant manufacturers of 
the two pesticides additional time to complete the last of 
several required toxicology studies.

EPA FACING MANDAMUS WRIT REQUEST ON SEWER GROUT

EPA is faced with an inability to answer as the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia considers a request 
for a writ of mandamus to compel an agency response on its 
proposed ban of acrylamide sewer grout (See Oct. 25, Page 
9).

The court on Dec. 14 upheld a mandamus request from the 
National Association of Sewer Service Companies, ordering an 
EPA response within 21 days to a NASSCO demand for an EPA 
answer.  EPA then filed a request for additional time, citing 
the furlough imposed by the government's budget impasse.

NASSCO attorneys Lynn Bergeson and Lisa Campbell opposed the 
extension in a Dec. 22 briefing that traced the chronology 
of the proposal and argued that EPA has had plenty of time.  
Among the statements by the attorneys for Weinberg, Bergeson 
& Neuman were:

-- "EPA issued the proposed rule at issue over four years 
ago.  The proposed rule seeks to abate human health risks 
that, despite the passage of time, EPA continues to 
characterize as 'unreasonable.'  These human health risks 
are apparently not unreasonable enough for EPA to take 
action, however.

-- "The Office of Management and Budget rejected the draft 
final rule and returned it to EPA on Oct. 18, 1995.  EPA 
informed NASSCO on Oct. 30, 1995, that it would not be 
withdrawing the rule by the end of October, nor would EPA 
commit to withdrawing the rule at any time in the future.  
Within 24 hours of being so advised, NASSCO submitted the 
petition on Nov. 1, 1995.

-- "Respondent (EPA) was served with the petition by first 
class mail on Nov. 1, 1995, a full seven weeks ago.  
Counsel for respondent, Jon Lipschultz, called on or about 
Nov. 15, 1995, five weeks ago, to state that he had 
received the petition and would be working on it.  Indeed, 
NASSCO notified EPA that it intended to bring court action 
to compel the issuance or withdrawal of the proposed rule 
last summer, long before respondent was actually served 
with the petition on Nov. 1, 1995.  

-- "Respondent's claim for the need for time beginning with 
the court's Dec. 14, 1995, order thus inaccurately reflects 
the amount of time that respondent has had to work on its 
response to the petition....




-- "Respondent claims that the current furlough of federal 
workers affects it ability to prepare its response.  As 
stated above, respondent had ample time before the court's 
order was issued and before the furlough commenced to 
prepare its response to the petition...."

NASSCO  concluded that "every day of continued delay in the 
issuance or withdrawal of the proposed ban harms NASSCO 
members." ((6PTCN 1002, 8 pages, $6)

INDUSTRY CALLS PROPOSED WPS DECONTAMINATION CHANGES TOO 
COSTLY

EPA's proposed modifications to Worker Protection Standard 
decontamination rules would place an economic hardship on 
growers, industry groups and trade associations said in 
comments submitted to the agency.  

Requiring decontamination facilities even after a crop has 
been harvested would be "an unjust and unduly burdensome 
economic expense to the producer," the Coalition for 
Sensible Farmworker Protection said.  

EPA published proposed WPS decontamination changes in the 
Sept. 29 Federal Register (See Aug. 23, Page 2; Sept. 27, 
Page 19).  The agency proposed to shorten the amount of time 
in which growers must provide decontamination facilities to 
between one and 15 days for most pesticides.

It would cost $4,400 to provide decontamination sites for 
1,000 acres, the coalition said, criticizing EPA's estimate 
of compliance costs as "quite low."  

"[T]he undersigned organizations continue to believe that it 
is inappropriate for the agency to require decontamination 
facilities at the end of the restricted entry interval," the 
coalition said.  The group includes state departments of 
agriculture, university agriculture departments and several 
trade associations.  Decontamination facilities should be 
required only when workers are present and have contact with 
pesticide-treated surfaces, it said.   

The coalition also criticized EPA's proposal to require 
decontamination sites for pesticides with REIs longer than 
four hours.  Such determinations should be based on a risk-
based, sound science standard, not solely on length of 
exposure, it said.

The Yuma (Ariz.) Vegetable Shippers Association also said it 
would be expensive for growers to comply with the proposed 
decontamination requirements.

The Society of American Florists asked EPA to apply the 
proposal to all pesticides, instead of only to those with 
REIs of four hours or longer.

In its comments, the American Farm Bureau Federation 
proposed a zero-day decontamination period for all 
pesticides with REIs less than four hours.  A zero-day 
decontamination requirement for these pesticides would 
encourage the use of low-toxicity pesticides, it said.  
"This makes lower-risk products more cost competitive."  
Like the Coalition for Sensible Farmworker Protection, the 
federation called the cost of decontamination kits 
"significant."

The federation also asked EPA to:

-- "eliminate the requirement for a decontamination site 
after crops are harvested; 

-- "eliminate the decontamination requirement when the REIs 
expire, and

-- "allow field workers to bring decontamination kits into 
treated areas as early entry.  EPA should allow growers to 
make similar arrangements for provision of decontamination 
kits for all types of agricultural workers."

The Georgia Department of Agriculture asked EPA to simplify 
the proposed changes by limiting the number of exceptions to 
the WPS.  "[T]here are already too many 'if/then' statements 
or exceptions....  Regulations that are simple, easily 
comprehended and have few exceptions are more likely to be 
followed....  More exceptions usually mean more complexity 
and the more likely the regulated community is to be 
confused, which adversely affects enforcement," it said.  
GDA proposed a seven-day decontamination site requirement 
after the REI expires.

Columbia, Md., resident Louis True Jr., a former EPA 
official, said EPA failed to indicate why the agency plans 
to depart from its 1992 WPS regulations.  He asked the 
agency to repropose a WPS standard instead of modifying the 
current one.  "Absent such a step, there will have been no 
reasonable opportunity for public comment on a rational 
presentation of the basis for the proposed changes, and any 
conclusions drawn by EPA would be arbitrary and capricious," 
he said.

The WPS changes EPA seeks can be achieved by a case-by-case 
review of labeling requirements rather than revising the 
1992 regulation, he said.  ((6PTCN 1001, 24 pages, $10)

EPA, HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS ARGUE OVER TIMING ISSUES

Arguments over minute details, particularly concerning 
timing, continued in the EPA FIFRA case against Health Care 
Products as EPA filed -- just before the furlough clamped 
down on the government -- an extensive brief with the Office 
of Administrative Law Judges (See Dec. 6, Page 20).

EPA noted its earlier request to have the hearing proceed 
under the name Smartel Communications instead of Celltech 
Media or Health Care Products, noting that ALJ Daniel Head 
had not allowed the filing and had ordered a schedule of 
motions from both parties.

Following the end of a first furlough last November, EPA 
said, attempts were made to contact Health Care Products 
attorney James Piccozi to set up the schedule, but to no 
avail.  EPA's problems with the later and current furlough 
were described in the agency's brief:

-- "Judge Head's Nov. 14, 1995, order, which was filed 
following a feverish and pointedly irregular flurry of 
telephonic and letter writing attempts by counsel for 
petitioner/respondent to circumvent established agency 
procedures, clearly set forth the mechanism by which 
petitioner/respondent's requests for any schedule changes 
were to be decided.

-- "In anticipation of federal shutdown which loomed and 
which in fact occurred on the very day that the judge issued 
his order, Judge Head directed that the parties consult with 
one another concerning the schedule and any alternative 
dates to be set immediately following the end of the federal 
shutdown.  It was clear from the judge's order that no 
responses to pending motions should be filed during the time 
period between the judge's order and the reopening of the 
federal government and the parties' taking the steps ordered 
by the judge.

-- "In flagrant disregard of the judge's Nov. 19, 1995, fax-
served order, on Nov. 19, 1995, petitioner/respondent 
dispatched its response to the Oct. 23, 1995, motion.  It 
did so even with the knowledge that complainant/respondent 
intended to file an amendment to its motion and could not do 
so at the time of the still-crippling federal shutdown....

-- "Petitioner/respondent appears to have attempted to 
exploit the absence of counsel for complainant/respondent 
and their inability to take any actions in this litigation 
to its unfair advantage.  It filed a document which was 
affected by the judge's order and which it should have known 
should have only been filed following the ordered 
consultation with counsel for the agency and the parties' 
subsequent report to the judge."

The brief pointed out that in addition to the controversy 
over use of the name "Smartel Communications," Piccozi had 
raised an issue as to whether the company should be called 
"Health Care Products" or "Health Care Products, Inc."  
Accusing Piccozi of demanding changes in EPA's work 
schedule, agency counsel Philip Ross, Bret Williams, Carl 
Eichenwald, Davina Pujari and Scott Garrison complained:  
"... Counsel for petitioner/respondent seems to think that 
the agency should 'drop everything' to meet the needs and 
convenience of complainant/respondent and its counsel.  
Though counsel for complainant/respondent may have 
difficulty realizing that the agency has other matters to 
which it must attend other than business that pertains to 
his client, such is indeed the case."

This program has ended.

In the same notice, EPA denied specific exemption requests 
from the California Department of Pesticide Regulations for 
the use of fenpropathrin on tomatoes to control silverleaf 
and greenhouse whiteflies; the Montana Department of 
Agriculture for the use of tralkoxydim on wheat to control 
weeds since the situation is "routine and not urgent," and 
to the Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota Departments 
of Agriculture for the use of propiconazole on wheat and 
barley to control fusarium head blight because residue 
chemistry indicated the crops would contain carcinogenic 
residue in processed foods, triggering the Delaney "anti-
cancer" clause.  

The agency also denied specific exemption requests for use 
of Pirate on cotton to control beet armyworms since it is 
unregistered due to "risk of unreasonable adverse effects to 
nontarget birds, aquatic organisms and the environment."  
EPA added that an exemption for a registered alternative, 
tebufenozide, was granted to control the pest in the 
Southeastern Cotton Belt region.  Exemption requests were 
denied to:

Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries; Arkansas 
State Plant Board; Georgia Department of Agriculture; 
Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry; 
Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce, and 
Tennessee Department of Agriculture.

INDUSTRY, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS DISAGREE ON IMPACT OF TAKINGS 
BILL

A broadly worded bill in the Senate that would compensate 
property owners and businesses adversely affected by federal 
regulation is drawing widely different reactions from 
environmental and business groups. 

The so-called takings bill could weaken pesticide 
regulations by making it prohibitively expensive for the 
government to impose usage restrictions, environmentalists 
said.  Business groups said the measure would give growers 
and landowners much-needed regulatory relief.  Either way, 
both agreed it could have a far-reaching impact on pesticide 
regulation.

Both the Senate and the House are working on so-called 
takings bills.  But while the House bill targets wetlands, 
endangered species and water use, the Senate version, 
recently approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
contains broad language that could subject any regulatory 
agency to takings claims from private citizens, according to 
environmentalists. 

"Some restriction on the application of a particular 
pesticide that has the effect of reducing the yield of the 
land and therefore the short-term or long-term real estate 
values could be a taking under the definition of takings in 
this bill," said John Echeverr, general counsel for the 
National Audubon Society.  "As written, S 605 is 
extraordinarily broad and applies to any type of 
governmental regulation under any federal law," he said.

"The one exception to the bill is that if an activity 
constitutes a nuisance, then regulation on the activity does 
not constitute a taking.  But pesticide application as a 
nuisance generally doesn't have strong roots in common law," 
Echeverr said.

Agricultural Groups Support Bill's Implications

Jim Egenrieder, director of regulatory affairs for the 
Agricultural Retailers Association, said his group supports 
the broader implications of the takings bill.  "The growers 
are prohibited from using certain materials in certain areas 
without any recognition of the financial impact of some of 
those initiatives, and without going through any cost-
benefit analysis," said Egenrieder.  "I think this takings 
legislation is asking 'Should a person be compensated when 
he or she can no longer use that land because of regulatory 
or legislative action?'"

Floyd Gaibler, vice president of governmental affairs for the 
Agricultural Retailers Association, said a broad group of 15 
agricultural associations and companies signed a Dec. 5 
letter supporting the bill.  "We say it would clarify the 
takings standards that courts have not been able to clearly 
articulate," said Gaibler. 

The letter says, "The agriculture community increasingly is 
impacted by regulations which prohibit ordinary land uses 
just as effectively as if a highway were built across 
private land."  The letter goes on to say that farms are 
often collateral for operating loans, and that the 
accumulated value of land is often a landowner's primary 
source of retirement income.

Sierra Club Calls Measure Anti-environmental

The Senate takings bill "is a radical anti-environmental 
bill," said Roni Lieberman, media director for the Sierra 
Club.  "The bill distorts the meaning of American property 
rights.  In the case of pesticides, corporations could say 
they should be compensated for having to add environmental 
controls to their properties," he continued.

Lieberman also said the bill would subject agencies to 
costly review to determine possible takings effects of new 
regulation.  "This is not about property rights, which are 
protected under the constitution," said Lieberman.  "It is 
about boosting profits," he said.

Clinton Vows to Veto Senate Takings Bill

The Clinton administration charged that the Senate bill 
would create "one of the most expensive new federal spending 
programs in recent history" and block new laws to protect 
public health and safety.  In a Dec. 14 letter to Senate 
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Clinton 
said he would veto S 605 or any similar legislation.  This 
drew a quick response from Hatch. 

Hatch Says Regulators Would Need to Step Lightly Around 
Property Rights

"President Clinton astonishingly says this bill does not 
protect legitimate private property rights," said Hatch, who 
added that the bill creates a "system of incentives for 
agencies to reduce the number and size of the takings they 
commit." 

Hatch said a Congressional Budget Office report released in 
October suggests that the bill will not burden federal 
regulatory agencies with a lot of takings actions.  "That 
estimate concludes that the bill will have only minimal costs 
and will achieve the stated goals of the bill by encouraging 
agencies to change their behavior," said Hatch, adding that 
the provisions in the bill come out of current case law.  "So 
when we debate this bill, let's remember that many of the 
provisions of the bill are simply codifying what the Supreme 
Court has said the Fifth Amendment requires," he said.

SORGHUM PRODUCERS GROUP CHALLENGES GRANULAR CARBOFURAN 
CANCELLATION

The National Grain Sorghum Producers Association is 
preparing oral arguments in its challenge of EPA's decision 
to cancel sorghum uses for granular carbofuran.  Oral 
arguments in the case are scheduled for Feb. 22 before the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for Washington D.C.

The association said in its Nov. 22 pleading that EPA has 
no basis in the record for its conclusion that granular 
carbofuran poses an unreasonable risk to birds.  It also 
contended that EPA failed to hold a hearing on its final 
decision.

"EPA relied solely on avian mortality as the basis for its 
decision not to allow the continued use of granular 
carbofuran," the association said.  "After more than 10 
years of study, there is no evidence of birds killed by 
granular carbofuran applied in sorghum in accordance with 
its label."

The pleading charges that EPA "misapplied" data allegedly 
supporting its conclusion about avian deaths.  For 
instance, the agency referred to 41 incidents of alleged 
bird kills attributable to direct granular carbofuran 
poisoning, 25 of which were water fowls in rice fields in a 
single area in California, the pleading says, adding that 
this data is not relevant because new agricultural 
practices have eliminated water fowl deaths in rice fields.

EPA also emphasized alleged raptor kills by granular 
carbofuran without strong evidence that reported raptor 
incidents were the result of exposure to the chemical, the 
association argued.

"Not only was the analysis EPA employed deeply flawed, the 
agency ignored studies that did not support its desired 
conclusions," the group said, claiming that EPA ignored 
Maryland and Florida field studies suggesting that granular 
carbofuran, when used properly, did not cause bird deaths.

The association also accused EPA of denying its request for 
a hearing before the pesticide was canceled.  "A trial-type 
hearing would have allowed petitioner to more fully 
demonstrate the lack of evidence supporting cancellation of 
granular carbofuran on sorghum," it said.

The association claimed that cancellation of granular 
carbofuran would cause hardship on farmers who would not be 
able to find an affordable alternative to control chinch 
bugs.  "An alternative to granular carbofuran for 
controlling chinch bugs, flowable carbofuran, is more 
expensive and requires different equipment for 
application," said the pleading, which adds that the 
additional expense of this application equipment is too 
expensive for sorghum producers farming fewer than 250 
acres.  ((6PTCN 1003, 39 pages, $14)

BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL AGENTS  MINOR-USE PROGRAM SOUGHT

Beyond Integrated Pest Management, biological control 
methods development needs much more research, more 
government coordination and a program similar to the minor-
use pesticide development program.  These were major 
recommendations this week of a committee of the National 
Research Council's Food and Nutrition Board.

The report, "Ecologically Based Pest Management -- New 
Solutions for a New Century," was developed by the Food and 
Nutrition Board's Committee on Pest and Pathogen Control 
through Management of Biological Control Agents and Enhanced 
Cycles and Natural Processes, headed by Ralph Hardy of the 
Boyce Thompson Institute, Ithaca, N.Y.

The committee saw an "urgent need for an alternative 
approach to pest management that can complement and 
partially replace current chemically based pest management 
practices."  Noting the introduction of synthetic chemical 
pesticides in the 1940s, the committee said:

"It is now clear that their use has some unfortunate 
consequences.  Many consumers believe that trace residues of 
synthetic chemicals in food are undesirable and represent a 
significant food safety risk.  In some cases, undesirable 
environmental impacts of synthetic pesticides have caused 
consumers to oppose the use of these materials in 
agriculture and caused governments to regulate or outlaw 
their use."

Ecologically based pest management (EBPM) as proposed by the 
committee would go beyond Integrated Pest Management's 
reliance on synthetic controls and "rely primarily on inputs 
of pest biological knowledge and secondarily on physical, 
chemical and biological supplements for pest management."  
The description continued:

-- "The EBPM systems will be built on an underlying knowledge 
of the managed ecosystem, including the natural processes 
that suppress pest populations.  It is based on the 
recognition that many standard agricultural practices 
disrupt natural processes that suppress pests.

-- "In contrast to standard practices that disrupt and 
destabilize the agrosystem, agricultural practices 
recommended by EBPM will augment natural processes.  These 
practices will be supplemented by biological-control 
organisms and products, resistant plants and narrow-spectrum 
pesticides."

As to EBPM's improvement over integrated pest management, 
the committee said:  "Early IPM innovators should be 
recognized for conceiving a framework for an integrated 
approach to arthropod, weed and pathogen pest management....  
The practice of IPM, unfortunately, is not always consistent 
with the theory of IPM.  The focus of early IPM programs was 
devoted to control of insects, setting a precedent for the 
focus of IPM on arthropod pest management.  In many cases, 
this management was limited to pest scouting and precise 
applications of insecticides.  Consequently, this focus has 
been at the expense of IPM of weed and pathogen pests."

The three fundamental goals of EBPM were outlined as:  "(1) 
safety, (2) profitability and (3) durability."

The acute and chronic toxicities associated with synthetics 
generally have not been found with biological-control 
organisms, the committee said, elaborating on the second and 
third goals with:

-- "For EBPM to be successful, it must also be profitable for 
the grower....  Because producers will implement only those 
pest control methods that lower economic risks and enhance 
profits, they will insist on assurances that biologically 
based tools are cost-effective and provide consistent 
responses....

-- "EBPM strategies also must be long-lasting to have a 
positive impact on crop protection....  Decreasing the pest's 
rate of development of resistance to new inputs is essential 
for the durability of EBPM."

Noting a "large annual research and development investment 
of more than $500 million" for the production of organic 
pesticides, the committee said, "... An increased investment 
in research of biological processes will be needed to 
support the development of EBPM."

Monitoring, Certification Seen as Needed

Following an extensive description of biological control 
programs to date, the committee outlined implementation 
steps for EBPM as including:

Small-market support -- "Some of the most effective 
biological-control organisms and products in EBPM are 
projected to have modest uses or small markets, and will 
require public-sector support for regulatory approval as 
well as for research....  [T]he costs associated with 
obtaining registration can discourage commercialization of 
biological-control organisms, as is the case now for minor 
use chemical pesticides, products needed on small acreage or 
in such small markets that they lack commercial appeal.  In 
the same way that public funds help with approval processes 
of minor use chemical pesticides by regulatory agencies, 
public investment can ensure continued progress for 
biological technologies."

Certification -- "Organized efforts to increase distribution 
of high-quality biological tools will facilitate grower 
acceptance of EBPM.  The procedure of crop seed 
certification by state agencies guarantees that new 
cultivars are genetically pure and that noxious weeds, 
arthropods and pathogens are below detection limits.  Each 
certification board tests, increases, releases and 
distributes new field crops according to predetermined 
standards....  Such a process of release benefits the 
individual grower with valuable information on product 
performance and quality, lowering the risk of adoption."

Monitoring pests -- "Monitoring for the potential development 
of resistance by pest organisms is key to managing the long-
term viability of ecologically based systems....  The 
importance of monitoring pest populations in individual 
fields is critical to the accurate assessment of tactics 
aimed at delaying pest resistance to biological control."

Emphasizing the importance of "durability" of biological 
solutions, the committee said it "must be managed through 
collective action" and continued:

-- "An effective mechanism currently used to delay pest 
resistance is the coordination of pest control activities 
among growers (National Audubon Society, 1994); sharing pest 
monitoring activities and collected information is useful in 
developing countermeasures that will limit additional crop 
losses.

-- "Practices, comparable to the use of mixtures and multilines 
to conserve the durability of plant resistance genes, can be 
developed and put into practice in order to enhance the 
durability of valuable biological-control organisms and 
products.  Efforts to do this can be coordinated by industry, 
perhaps modeled on such organizations as the fungicide 
resistance working group, which is dedicated towards 
developing practices and implementation recommendations to 
enhance the long-term use of fungicides.  Cooperative efforts 
among researchers, industrial suppliers and growers can 
increase the durability of these biological tools."

Gaps and Inconsistencies in Public Oversight Listed

After devoting 19 small-type pages to research priorities 
and methods of accelerating research, including changes in 
institutional approaches, the committee's report delved into 
public oversight.  Listing "gaps and inconsistencies in 
current oversight" programs, the committee said in part:

-- "... The complexities and anomalies of the current system 
may be attributed to the overlapping jurisdiction of several 
agencies and the diversity of organisms to be regulated, and 
the attempt to make the decision-making 'template' developed 
for registration of conventional chemical pesticides 
applicable to biologically based controls.

-- "Current federal oversight generally evaluates the risks 
of biological-control macroorganisms using the procedures 
developed for exotic plant pests under the Federal Plant 
Pest Act (FFPA); microbial biological-control agents are 
subject to oversight procedures developed for chemical 
pesticides under (FIFRA).  Neither set of procedures is 
tailored for registration of biological-control agents; 
therefore, both pose unnecessary barriers to registration of 
biological-control organisms."

 'Dual Review' at EPA

Noting that EPA reviews killed products under TSCA and 
others under FIFRA, the committee said the situation 
"results in a dual review process within EPA, with the 
manufacturing portion of the process reviewed separately 
from the field release of the killed microbial pesticide."  
The distinctions in TSCA and FIFRA for review of "chemical 
intermediates" is irrelevant for microbial pesticides, the 
committee said.  The discussion of oversight continued:

-- "The existing fragmented oversight process employs 
different assessment criteria to biological-control 
organisms that pose similar human or environmental risks, 
resulting in unnecessary scrutiny of some low-risk organisms 
and almost complete lack of regulatory review of others.

-- "The most important inconsistency is the differential 
treatment of macroorganisms by USDA/APHIS under FFPA and of 
microorganisms by EPA under FIFRA.  For example, neither EPA 
nor APHIS regulates nonpathogenic nematodes, whereas both 
agencies regulate microorganisms.  In addition, microbes are 
exempt from oversight if vectored by a nonpathogenic, 
indigenous macroorganism (such as a nematode).  There is no 
clearly defined process for risk assessment of biological-
control macroorganisms that are not plant pests, resulting in 
indecisiveness in granting permits for field release....

-- "To provide appropriate oversight of biological-control 
organisms and products, USDA, EPA and other federal and 
state agencies with oversight authority should jointly 
develop criteria and protocols specifically for the testing, 
registration and use of living control organisms, 
biological-control products or plants resistant to pests or 
diseases.

-- "No formal oversight structure exists for traditionally 
bred resistant plants, whereas genetically engineered 
resistance will, it appears, be subject to close scrutiny.  
A question confronting policy makers is whether host plant 
resistance accomplished through genetic engineering should 
receive a higher degree of scrutiny than resistance achieved 
through traditional plant breeding.  Such a distinction 
embedded in regulatory practice would not necessarily 
reflect differences between actual human or environmental 
health risks posed by the two technologies."

Options for Improvement Outlined

Calling for departure from current oversight practice, the 
committee said agencies' criteria for risk assessment must 
vary with the possibilities presented by each organism, 
product or resistant plant.  Suggesting the desirability of 
Technical Advisory Groups, the committee characterized these 
as "a consortium of representatives from government and 
research established to provide advice to the government on 
the safety of biological organisms for weed control."  The 
committee emphasized:

"The U.S. EPA and the USDA, currently responsible for 
oversight of pesticide regulations, should develop and 
publish a guide to risk criteria, data requirements and 
oversight procedures that apply to importation, movement, 
introduction, testing and release or registration of 
biological-control organisms or products."

The 89-page report concluded:

-- "... Principles of ecology that lay the foundation of EBPM 
must be incorporated into implementation and oversight.  An 
important goal of EBPM is to restore and preserve balance to 
the managed ecosystem by duplicating natural processes to the 
maximum extent possible.  

-- "Risk assessment also should reflect that principle.  
Biological-control products must be developed and implemented 
in ways that complement managed ecosystems and facilitate the 
biological and natural controls already existing to suppress 
pests.

-- "Monitoring of new products and processes is key.  The 
resultant information will lead to early identification of 
durability problems.  The knowledge gained from this 
monitoring of the dynamic interactions among organisms will 
increase the understanding needed to manage old and new pests 
in a safe, profitable and durable way."

CHINA TO CUT LPG, OLEFIN IMPORT TARIFFS TO 6% BY APRIL 1

By:
David Hanna, Christopher Park, Platt's Tokyo


China this week announced plans to cut in half tariffs on chemical imports
effective Apr 1, pledging to 'open the chemical sector wider to foreign
investment'. Included in the change are import tariff cuts for olefins and
LPG to 6% from 12%. The International Business Journal under Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation published two lists of new tariff
rates for a total of 363 items, mostly related to petrochemical and
chemical industries. Import tariffs for liquefied ethylene, propylene,
butylene, butadiene will also be slashed by 50% to 6%. Rates for propane
and butane will be slashed by 3% to 6% starting April. New rates for
imported benzene, toluene and xylene will be lowered to 6% from the present
12% by then. China said it would cut import tariffs of over 4,000 items by
an average 35% to 23% from Apr 1. No information was forthcoming on duties
for polymer imports. Traders in Korea and Japan peg current duty rates on
commodity polymers at 15-30%. China's Ministry of Chemical Industry
forecasts that the industry's output value will grow by 8% from 1995 to
Yuan 245-mil ($306-mil) in 1996. Meanwhile, chemical imports grew by 8% to
$5-bil, while exports rose 20.9% to $3.8-bil during the first half of 1995.
Industry sources believe these figures should rise once the new tariffs go
into effect.

METHANEX TO BUILD 900,000 MT/YR METHANOL PLANT IN CHILE

By:
Louise Egan, Santiago

   Methanex, the world's largest methanol producer which owns a methanol
plant in Cape Horn, Chile, will build a second plant in Cabo Negro, in the
southern region of the country. The new facility will have a capacity of
900,000mt/yr of methanol. Enap, the Chilean national oil company, which is
the principal supplier of natural gas for the project, has stated that
construction will be completed in December 1996. The Chilean government has
authorized $350-mil in additional investments by the Canadian company for
the project. Together with the Cape Horn plant, Methanex will be producing
1.7-mil mt/yr, or 12% of world demand for methanol. Methanex Cabo Negro
plans to eventually export methanol to other Latin American countries.
Chilean consumption is expected to reach 100,000mt/yr in the short term.

INDIAN CHEMICALS MINISTRY WANTS IMPORT DUTY CUTS

By:
Neel Patri, New Delhi

   The Indian ministry of chemicals and petrochemicals has sought
across-the-board cut in the import duty on several chemicals and
petrochemicals to a uniform 10% from the present levels that range from 15%
to 50%, officials said.
   In its memorandum to the finance ministry which is preparing the 1996
federal budget, the ministry has also suggested hiking duties on some
catalysts.
   The chemicals recommended for duty reduction to 10% include carbon black
feedstock which bears 30% tariff at present, napthalene which carries 30%
duty, high purity limestone that is subject to 50% duty at present, and
cumene that carries 20% duty now.
   However, the import tariff on methanol may be set at 40% compared with
the present 50%. The ministry is seeking a cut in methanol duty from 50% to
40%.
   The items for which duty hikes have been recommended include four
specific catalysts used in the manufacture of ethylene, formaldehyde,
de-sulphurisation process, and methyl ethyl ketone from secondary butyl
alcohol (from the present 25% to 50%.
   Simultaneously, the ministry has favored reduction in import tariff on
specific pesticides to 30% from the present 40% and in order to encourage
caustic soda chemical manufacturers to shift to membrane cell technology
from mercury cell process of manufacture, total exemption of capital goods
imports needed for this switch-over has been recommended. The present duty
is 25% on capital goods imports.
   'The idea is to keep duties on basic rawmaterial low and the end
chemicals onthe higher side.' 'The idea is to keep duties on basic raw
material low and the end chemicals on the higher side to make import of
former cheaper for export after value addition. Some sort of protection for
the indigenous industry against cheap imports and dumping has been one of
the criteria,' explained a senior ministry official.
   Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corp has selected Norsk
Hydro and the Madras-based WS Industries as partners for a proposed 150,000
mt/yr PVC resin project, expected to cost around Rupee 7.5-bil ($214-mil),
TIDCO officials said this week.
   Company directors have approved a proposal to offer 51% of the equity to
Norsk Hydro, while WS Industries would hold 10% and TIDCO 11%. The equity
sharing proposal would have to be approved by the Tamil Nadu government,
which owns TIDCO.
   The PVC project is likely to be located at Ennore, south of Madras,
where a new port is proposed to be built by the government. The port
project includes building a chemicals import terminal.
   The PVC project entails importing 124,000 mt/yr of ethylene dichloride
and 48,000 mt/yr as feed. A market survey commissioned by TIDCO showed that
the demand for PVC was growing in the southern region, and that fresh
capacity was called for.
   At present, there are two major PVC producers meeting demand in southern
India, Chemplast Sanmar with 48,000 mt/yr capacity, and Dhrangadhara
Chemical Works with 42,000 mt/yr capacity. Both are located in Tamil Nadu.
   State-owned Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd has been allotted land at
Baikampady village near the New Mangalore port in southern Karnataka state
to build a chemical terminal, a company release said.
   HOC will invest some Rupee 360-mil ($10-mil) in the 50,000 kl terminal,
to be built in two stages. HOC, a major importer and exporter of chemicals,
is currently renting storage tank facilities at the New Mangalore Port for
operations at Cochin, as well as for exporting phenol and acetone.
   'In all, 10 storage tanks are expected to be constructed under phase
one. It is proposed to handle a diverse range of chemicals, including
benzene, toluene, xylenes, cumene, phenol, acetone, and methanol. The first
stage is expected to be completed during 1996-97,' the release said.

NWE POLYMERS PRICES REACH EXTREMES IN VOLATILE 1995 MARKET

By:
Elinor Else, Platt's London


   European polymer prices rollercoastered in 1995, peaking on high demand
and tight supply but then crashing as a slower economy, high stocks and
higher prices undermined buying interest. Another major influence on Europe
was the Asian market, whose demand was the main motor behind market
balances world- wide.
   All the polymers started the year at relatively high price levels, with
the polyolefins averaging around DM1.80/kg FD Germany in early January, PVC
a few pfennigs lower and general purpose polystyrene a little over
DM2.00/kg FD Germany.
   There were some difficulties related to local currencies weakening
against the deutschmark in the UK and Italy which held back prices in those
markets. New import tariffs on polymers moving into the EU temporarily
slowed shipments from Mexico and eastern Europe. But underlying demand was
good and supply was balanced to tight in most markets.
   PVC, polystyrene and PP were all firm through the first quarter of 1995
as producers pushed through targets and supply was either tight - as in the
case of PVC which suffered a series of monomer and polymer outages - or at
least balanced to supply.
   But towards the end of the first quarter the first few signals of change
started to emerge. Firstly, demand for low density polyethylene began to
slip late in Q1 as consumers started to run down stocks built at the end of
1994. Also, prices adjustments were made to bring countries that had
suffered from a weak currency against the German mark back into line.
   This meant a push for price adjustments in the UK, Italy and France but
it also meant German prices had to be held steady while the rest of the EU
caught up.
   Meanwhile, relative strength in German prices started to attract the
attention of east European importers as well as sellers of other exotics.
This began to undermine the German LDPE market, the market which tends to
lead price levels around Europe.
   During April and May PVC prices were stabilizing as demand for pipes
proved slower than expected and finished pipe stocks were said to be high.
Polypropylene and polystyrene were both benefiting from stronger
fundamentals and prices for both of these polymers remained firm.
   Two things happened: the traditional summer slowdown and a crackdown on
VAT collection and smuggling of polymers into China.
   The effect of the 'summer lull' is a regular seasonal effect and is
factored into most people's forecasts for supply and demand during the
year: in later July, demand will tend to slacken off as converters in much
of Europe close their factories for all or part of Aug. Demand in Sep is
usually slow to start but will pickup until Oct, which is usually a 'normal
month'.
   However, the sudden halt to Chinese buying, along with the pressure on
Asian prices from ample US export availabilities, was not expected. The
initial effect was to divert a significant proportion of US and other
exports into Europe. Longer term, the effect was an overall dampening of
global polymer demand and a sense among consumers in Europe that there was
plenty of material available to cover their needs.
   Prices for PVC, PE and PP started to erode in June as European buyers
sensed a price decrease to come as the Asian problems emerged and European
demand was set to slow for the summer.
   PS resisted as producers pushed for another increase and succeeded in
both June and July.
   But by the end of July, all polymer prices were on a downtrend that was
only to bottom out at the very end of the year. With Chinese buying on
hold, exotic availabilities were plentiful and west European producers
found it more difficult to control stocks by selling excess supply
overseas.
   In addition, the summer lull lasted through Oct, adding several weeks of
very low demand to the expected period as consumers rode down their stocks
and were confident that prices would be lower in the coming weeks.
   This process of destocking and buying hand-to-mouth characterised the
latter half of 1995.
   The lack of forward buying kept up considerable pressure on producers
and attempts to control stocks through cutting production were only
partially successful.
   There was considerable competition to maintain market shares in the
various European markets: for example in the UK market there were several
instances of producers undercutting each others' prices for PP and PE.
Exports were moved out at discount prices to ease pressure on mounting
stocks.
   Through Oct and Nov, the production cutbacks did have an effect on
producers' stock levels which were better balanced by the end of the year
except for some cases in the PE market. The re-entry of Chinese buyers in
Nov lent some support to European and US markets, even if that demand was
only a form of prebuying ahead of import license changes in 1996.
   But prices in Europe had hit bottom and with or without China, many in
the industry said that with prices below available cost in many cases,
there was no room for further price erosion.
   PP, PE, and PVC all ended the year with the low end of the price range
firmly below the DM1/kg FD Germany level. PS had fallen steeply but had
stabilized close to DM1.50/kg FD Germany for general purpose material and
DM0.10/kg higher for high impact.
   Increases were announced for Jan 1 for PP and PE, which were felt to
have reached unsustainably low levels. PS has not seen a price increase
announcement and suppliers say they are looking to rollover prices from Dec
into Jan. However, consumers say there is still room for a slight erosion
in PS prices and as Chinese demand is not expected to pick up until later
in Feb, the impetus for price increases seems likely to be limited until
later in Q1.
   PVC pipe grade has seen a period of poor demand, the summer too dry to
allow for much construction or cable-TV pipe laying and the winter being
the traditionally low demand season. Some are indicating price increases
could be on the cards for Mar or Apr.
   In broader terms, most in the industry expect there to be some
improvement in early 1996 as demand and prices both recover to more normal
levels.
   Consumer stocks are more balanced now and prices are seen as either
stable or firming, producers argue, so that when demand kicks in in late
January, coverters will come into the market to top up low stocks.
   Overall growth in underlying demand for polymers is expected to grow at
around 3% in 1996 and both buyers and producers are hoping for a less
volatile year in 1996.

ASIAN BENZENE PRICES SLUMP IN 1995

By:
Joanna Lim, Platt's Singapore


   Asian benzene prices began the year bullish, driven largely by strong
styrene demand. In response to spiralling styrene prices, Japanese and
Korean producers cranked up operations at their plants, with less benzene
subsequently available in the spot market.
   The strength of the US benzene market also led to less deepsea product
moving into Asia. At the same time, plant turnarounds in Japan and Korea in
Mar through June also heightened the region's shortage.
   Benzene prices climbed $5-10/mt monthly during the first quarter, with
prices peaking in April at $395-400/mt FOB Korea from $365-370/mt in Jan.
   In May, styrene prices in Asia started to deteriorate, brought on by
China's sudden withdrawal from styrenic derivative imports, dueto Beijing's
measures to crack down on smuggling and tax invasion in China's ports.
   Local traders had been evading a 17% value added tax on imported resins
by negotiating private agreements with local authorities. State officials
were despatched to the ports to enforce the VAT collection, and this
brought business to a halt.
   Styrene producers throughout the region reduced their operating rates in
order to cope with high inventory. Japanese producers cut operations to by
20-30%; Taiwan producers reduced production by 30-50% and in Korea, Yukong
Oxichemical had a unscheduled shutdown of its 300,000 mt/yr styrene plant
for one week, citing bearish market conditions for the outage.
   Furthermore, ethylene plants throughout Asia cut runs by 15-20% in July.
Lack of Chinese demand for ethylene-derivative products had led to drastic
drop in its prices, prompting ethylene producers to run their plants just
enough for their own downstream requirements, dropping their export ratio
altogether.
   In Nov, benzene prices firmed in Asia, driven by a surge in Chinese
demand for styrenic derivatives. This time the Chinese government was known
to be planning to reduce the export rebate on the value added tax next
year.
   From Jan 1 1996, the current 17% VAT and 14% rebate for exports will be
revised to a 9% rebate. The new rebate will apply to imported material
delivered into China from Jan 1.
   Traders also report that import licenses for 1995 are due to expire on
Dec 20, and that the Chinese government is expected to severely limit the
number of new licenses issued next year.
   These two factors prompted Chinese end-users - who were already low on
stocks because of a clampdown on imports and speculative trading since May
- to buy large quantities before the end of the year.
   Last week Korea rejected bids at $240/mt FOB, holding out for $250/mt
and above. The last trade into India last week was at $290/mt C+F. This
week sellers have brought up their offers to around $300/mt C+F, following
the US Jan contract price nomination at 90 cts/lb, 10 cts/lb over Dec.
   Meanwhile other consumers in Asia are staying sidelined amid uncertainty
over the benzene price trend. Most agree that in the short term the market
is firm. However, they refer to waning Chinese demand for styrene and
ethylene derivatives as the basis for a possible return to weak benzene
prices in Asia.
   Toluene began the year on a bearish note in Asia, with ample deepsea
cargoes outpacing demand. It was only towards mid-March that the market
began to firm, as Korean producers began their plant turnarounds.
   Between May and July, toluene prices held up relatively better than
benzene due to its comparatively tighter supply. And, unlike benzene,
toluene enjoyed relatively steady demand from China where it is used to
upgrade 95 RON unleaded gasoline to 97 RON.
   But toluene's decline escalated with the unplanned shutdown of two TDP
units in Korea in early Aug. In order to cope with their benzene and
xylenes surpluses Korea's Yukong Ltd and HanWha Energy shut down their TDP
units indefinately from early August, and the surplus in Korean toluene
which subsequently followed led to increasingly bearish market sentiments.
Bearish benzene prices also severely softened the toluene markets.
   Producers also had been quick to decrease their prices in order to to
keep arbitrage cargoes out of the region.
   Taiwan's Chinese Petroleum Corp is known to issue monthly toluene buy
tenders for delivery two months out, thereby extending eligibility to US,
NWE and other deepsea product.
   Asian producers therefore did not rule out the possibility of the
traders shipping out additional toluene to Asia along with CPC's volumes
especially in times of weak market conditions in the US.
   Currently toluene prices have firmed in line with tight supply and also
because of strong benzene and MTBE markets in north and southeast Asia.

US OLEFINS PRICES WEAKEN STEADILY AS DEMAND DWINDLES

By:
Richard Capuchino, Platt's Houston; Nicholas Towasser, Platt's New York


   US olefin markets experienced a downturn in prices through 1995, however
none more drastically than ethylene and refinery grade propylene. Both
products lost about 10 cts/lb in contract prices from the beginning to the
end of the year.
   Ethylene began 1995 settling up 1 ct/lb in Jan, Feb and Mar to place
most contracts in 29-33 cts/lb range, while spot prices were at 31-34
cts/lb FOB USG by the end of Mar.
   The National Petroleum Refiners Association reported Q1 1995 inventories
at 1.28-bil lbs, up from the 1.11-bil lbs in Q1 1994. Meanwhile, Q1 1995
production totaled 11.64-bil lbs, down from the 11.70-bil lbs in Q1 1994.
   By late Mar, demand began to fall, while spot prices also fell from the
low 30s to 28-29 cts/lb. Producers rolled over contract prices from March
to 29-33 cts/lb in April and May.
   Jun brought the first decrease in ethylene prices, when producers agreed
to settle contracts down 0.50 cts/lb. Contract prices for Jul also settled
down 1 ct/lb to 27.50-31.50 cts/lb. Spot prices in Jul had also fallen to
25.50-26.50 cts/lb due to consumers meeting commitments from contract
material.
   The NPRA reported that both inventories and production increased in Q2.
Inventories in Q2 totalled 1.88-bil lbs, a two-year high, while Q2 outputn
totaled 11.95-bil lbs.
   High Q2 inventories were due to turnarounds scheduled for Sep and Oct.
High stocks and decreased demand from polyethylene producers caused several
ethylene producers to cut production rates to about 80% capacity. By late
Sep producers had settled Aug and Sep contracts down 1.50 cts/lb placing
Sep contracts at 24.50-28.50 cts/lb, with spot prices at 22-23 cts/lb FOB
USG.
   By early Oct, at least one producer made a three-month nomination of Oct
down 1 ct, November down 0.50 ct and a rollover for Dec. Some sources
doubted the nomination's chances of acceptance, and by mid-Nov it seemed
most consumers had chosen to take a month-by-month approach.
   Around the same time a rumor circulated that Union Texas had offered to
settle October volumes with a formula of 75-80% at an Oct contract price of
1.5 cts down from September and 20-25% at a Oct spot price of 15.5 cts/lb.
Two Texas producers said they settled some accounts for Oct at a level
'competitive' with the formula. One producer said the formula resulted in a
contract price of 20.70 cts/lb for Oct, and settled some accounts at that
level.
   Also complicating the Oct contract price was the question of at what
level exactly the Sep price had been. According to one report Exxon, in an
effort to devise a contract price that would more accurately reflect the
market price and eliminate the need for discounts, revised its Sep contract
price from 24.50 cts/lb to 23.50 cts/lb. However, another producer refused
to revise its Sep contact price, and maintained an Oct contract of 23
cts/lb.
   Early in Oct there was unconfirmed talk of some customers demanding an
additional 0.25 ct/lb discount on the Sep contract price, in addition to
the original 1.5 cts/lb decrease from Aug.
   By late Nov, most sources reported settling Oct at 22-23 cts/lb, down
1.5 cts/lb from Sep, though another producer, who had not yet settled
accounts, did report hearing an Oct contract of 21 cts/lb as a reference
point.
   By the year's end, neither Nov nor Dec had definitively settled. Some
producers reported invoicing or settling Nov down 1 ct/lb. One producer
reported settling half its accounts with a two-month settlement: Nov at 20
cts/lb, down 1 ct/lb, and Dec at 19.50 cts/lb, down a further 0.50 cts/lb.
   Another producer reported some participants were working toward a
two-month agreement. He said a reduction of 1 ct/lb for Nov was tentatively
agreed, and that talks centered around whether Dec would settle down 0.50
ct/lb or 1 ct/lb. However, one consumer reported offers to settle Nov at
more than 1 ct/lb down.
   This week, one producer reported that settlements for Nov varied from
down 1 ct to 1.50 cts/lb, and that Dec negotiations were still ongoing.
   To compound the year-end confusion, in Dec several US PE producers
announced a 5 cts/lb US domestic price increase for all grades of PE
effective Jan 1. Similarly, one producer expected higher feedstock prices
as the colder weather might make producers less inclined to give
concessions.
   Fiber grade ethylene glycol began the year tight due to strong global
demand for polyester, while weather continued to affect demand of
anti-freeze grade. Spot prices for A-F grade began the year at 30-31 cts/lb
FOB USG. Industrial grade was pegged at 29-31 cts/lb at first of the year,
with contract prices for fiber grade at 28.5 cts/lb.
   Strong demand for PET kept the MEG market tight. Fiber grade was tight,
with spot supply almost non-existent at the beginning of the year.
   In Mar, producers nominated a 2 ct/lb increase for fiber grade due to
strong demand and extremely low inventories. By mid-Apr, fiber grade had
settled at 30.5 cts/lb, while industrial and A-F grade were at 30-32 cts/lb
for spot deals.
   In mid-Apr sources reported that A-F grade buyers were looking to indus
grade market for incremental volumes. Export demand for fiber grade was
described as 'phenomenal' in May.
   In early Jun, one producer nominated 2 ct/lb increases on all grades for
both list and off-list prices. Stocks on all three grades remained
relatively low.
   Spot prices in late Jun were seen at 30-34 cts/lb FOB USG for industrial
and fiber grade.
   Mid-Jul saw fiber grade contracts settle at 33.5 cts/lb FD USG, while
spot prices for A-F and industrial grades around 33-35 cts/lb FOB USG.
Strong demand and low inventories forced some producers in late Jul to buy
material in the spot market.
   A traditional seasonal decrease in A-F grade demand saw a 'lull' in
demand. By late Aug spot prices for industrial and A-F grades fell to 29-31
cts/lb FOB USG, while demand for fiber grade continued strong. The decrease
in demand also allowed for a slight buildup in inventories.
   Mid-Sep saw producers cautiously building up stocks, recalling the
previous winter's mildness.
   Throughout Q4 sources reported generally less-than-dynamic A-F grade
sales. In mid-Oct there was talk of Mexican and Venezuelan industrial grade
material available at 26-27 cts/lb FOB USG, but few buyers were seen. Some
sources believe the A-F grade buying season will continue into 1996, as
consumers maintain low stocks.
   For propylene, the year began with contract prices for all grades in the
high teens and low 20 cts/lb range.
   Jan contracts for all grades settled up 1 ct/lb from Dec, with polymer
grade at 21.75 cts/lb, chemical grade at 20.25 cts/lb and refinery grade at
18.50-19 cts/lb. Spot polymer grade showed a 10 ct/lb premium above
contract, chemical grade had a 2-4 ct/lb premium, but spot refinery grade
was about 1-1.50 cts/lb below contract.
   Some tightness in supply was noted in the market when several producers
took turnarounds at FCC units along the Gulf Coast early in the year.
Strong demand and scheduled outages kept market snug for several months,
with producers having little opportunity to build inventories.
   Alkylation values for refinery grade propylene were at 7-8 cts/lb in
Feb, with values depressed by low gasoline prices. Values of 6-7 cts/lb in
late Mar continued to encourage producers to sell refinery grade on the
spot market where it commanded a higher value. Excess refinery grade
material was entering the US Gulf from California, the Midwest and South
Louisiana.
   By early Mar, producers were building inventories. Contract and spot
prices slipped for refinery grade propylene by early Jun to 15.75-18.25
cts/lb and 15.00-15.50 cts/lb FOB USG respectively, due to overproduction
and low alkylation values. However, contract prices for polymer and
chemical grade had added 1 ct/lb in Feb, Mar and Apr to 24.75 cts/lb for
polymer grade and 23.25 cts/lb for chemical grade for Apr.
   Although an increase was passed in Apr, discussions were drawn out due
to the levelling off in ethylene prices and the decline in the refinery
grade market. Discussions for Apr included talk of a 0.5-1 ct/lb decrease
in prices. However, after the 1 ct/lb increase in Apr, consumers settled
May as a rollover.
   By mid-May, outages at several Gulf Coast fluid catalytic cracking units
helped firm the market, while alkylation values as high as 15-17 cts/lb
were attributed to the onset of the driving season.
   Due to excess supply of polymer grade material, spot prices fell to
25-26 cts/lb FOB USG for polymer grade and 23-24 cts/lb FOB USG for
chemical grade in Jun. Demand for the higher grade propylene was softer due
to falling polypropylene demand.
   By mid-Jul the weak polymer market was also affecting refinery grade
propylene producers who upgrade material via splitting, and spot prices for
all grades had fallen below contract prices by late Aug. Polymer grade spot
was at 20.50- 21.50 cts/lb FOB USG, while chemical grade at 19.50- 20.50
cts/lb and spot refinery grade at 14.25-15.00 cts/lb ex-tank FOB USG.
   Inventories for Q2 totaled 965-mil lbs, while production totaled 6.7-bil
lbs. By late Sep, spot prices had declined further due to ample supply and
lower demand for all three grades. All spot prices had fallen considerably
below contracts prices by the end of Q3.
   Although some US sources reported settling Oct polymer and chemical
grade propylene down 1.5 cts/lb, Nov down 1.5 cts/lb and Dec down 1 ct/lb,
the Dec contract price for both grades seemed to be very much in question
by the year's end.
   One source reported discussions were divided between a large number of
producers who contended Dec should be down 1 ct/lb, and some consumers who
contended it should be down 1.5 cts/lb.
   By early Dec, polymer grade was heard in the pipeline at 11 cts/lb and
10 cts/lb in railcars. Chemical grade was heard at 10 cts/lb in pipeline
and 9.5 cts/lb in railcar. Refinery grade propylene also dropped to
significant lows. Its Dec contract price settled between 9.00 and 9.50
cts/lb, while Dec spot was reported between 8.50 and 9.00 cts/lb.
   Butadiene contracts began the year settling up 1 ct to 25 cts/lb, while
spot prices were at 25-27 cts/lb CIF USG. Jan 1 inventories totalled
221-mil lbs/yr, up 39-mil lbs/yr from Dec 1994.
   Feb 1 inventories totaled 229-mil lbs/yr, while spot market at 23-24
cts/lb CIF USG. Producers that were seeking to build inventories in
anticipation of turnarounds allowed stocks to total 235-mil lbs on Mar 1,
and reported approaching capacity at storage tanks by early Mar.
   After rolling over in Feb and Mar at 25 cts/lb, butadiene contracts
settled down 2 cts to 23 cts/lb in Apr. Apr 1 inventories totaled 225-mil
lbs/yr, which was the first decline in stock levels since Nov 1994. Spot
prices in mid-Apr were at 22-23 cts/lb CIF USG.
   May 1 inventories totaled 249-mil lbs, while spot prices were pegged at
20-22 cts/lb CIF USG. However, the industry was at odds over the reporting
of Jun 1 inventories at 145-mil lbs. The decrease was due to downtime at
ethylene and butadiene units, decreased imports and high freight rates.
Contracts settled at a rollover at 23 cts/lb in both May and Jun.
   Spot prices in early Jul were pegged at 23-24 cts/lb CIF USG. Jul 1
inventories rebounded somewhat to 166-mil lbs/yr, but this figure was
without the participation of one large consumer that took issue with the
Jun 1 figure.
   Jul contract prices settled late in the month at 25 cts/lb, while Aug
contracts settled unchanged. Aug 1 inventories totaled 173-mil lbs. In Sep
butadiene derivative markets reported weakness, though this was offset by
the turnaround of two major butadiene plants. Sep 1 inventories totaled
200-mil lbs, which was ascribed to expected turnarounds in Oct and to
several tanks taking on extra material for operators whose other tanks were
out of service.
   Contracts rolled over in Sep at 25 cts/lb. Spot transactions were
minimal due to high inventories. By the end of Sep, spot butadiene was
pegged at 23-23.5 cts/lb CIF USG.
   In late Oct, Lyondell, Texas Petrochemical and Shell nominated the Nov
contract price at 23 cts/lb, down 2 cts from Oct. The downward push came at
a time of high stocks.
   From Jul to Oct, consultants Hodson & Co reported a sustained rise in US
butadiene inventories. Oct 1 inventories were reported at 226-mil lbs, an
increase of 13% over Sep.
   As consumers sought to work off butadiene bought at 25 cts/lb, the spot
market seemed to vanish by mid-Nov. Aside from the uneconomic pricing of
imported material, sources also said storage was often an issue.
   As the year closed, high inventories continued to weigh on the market,
and there was unconfirmed talk of at least a large consumer demanding yet
another price decrease for Jan of 2 cts/lb, pushing the contract down to 19
cts/lb.
   In early Jan, one trader heard reports that three producers are indeed
settling at this level. Two producers have reportedly settled 19 cts/lb for
Jan, while a third has granted a 'temporary volume allowance', in the
trader's words, bringing the net contract price to 19 cts/lb, but
preserving 21 cts/lb as a basis for Feb negotiations.

JAPAN'S SHIN-ETSU CHEMICAL CO LTD

   Japan's Shin-Etsu Chemical Co Ltd plans to construct its second PVC
plant in the US with a capacity of 400,000 mt/yr, local press reported.
Shin-Etsu reportedly plans to startup the PVC plant in early 1998.
   Meanwhile, the company's US subsidiary, Sintech, is currently surveying
possible plant locations along the Gulf of Mexico. The company will
reportedly makes its decision in the spring of 1996. Total investment in
the new PVC plant is estimated at $700-mil.

ETHYLENE

   Shanghai is to invest an estimated Yuan 40-bil ($4.8-bil) to build an
ethylene plant in a joint venture with neighbouring Zhejiang province, the
Shanghai Star bi-weekly newspaper reported.
   The plant would be built in the Caojing chemical base near Hangzhou Bay
and would produce 600,000 mt/yr, with production starting as soon as
possible, according to the report.
   'Foreign funds would be introduced to promote the project,' the report
quoted Yu Dexiong, a senior chemical industry industry official, as
saying.
   Yu said Shanghai's strategy was to develop the chemical industry not
only in the city but also in the Yangtse river valley.
   The Shanghai Chemical Industry Bureau was recently transformed into an
entreprise and renamed Shanghai Chemical Shareholding (Group) Co in a move
to give new impetus to the chemical industry.

KOREA ETHYLENE DEREGULATION

   Eight of Korea's ethylene producers plan to negotiate with the
government on matters regarding deregulation of investment policy on naptha
cracker expansions, according to a Korean press report last week.
   A meeting was held recently of senior officials from eight of the
nation's top petrochemical producers who are discussing how to better
coordinate investments in naphtha cracker expansion projects.
   According to an industry source, the government is concerned about the
new round of ethylene expansions based on negative results from previous
expansions.
   However, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy is set to deregulate
the petrochemical industry in mid-1996 and is reportedly set to authorize
Hyundai Petrochemical's new naphtha cracker expansion project by early
1996. Currently, all investments geared toward expansion projects must meet
approval from the Ministry.

   Japan's Idemitsu Petrochemical has sold its 15% stake in a polyethylene
joint venture based in Malaysia to UK's BP Chemicals, a Petronas source
said last week.
   BP now has a 60% controlling interest in the 200,000 mt/yr PE plant in
Kertih, on the northeast coast of the Malaysian peninsula, with Malaysian
national oil company Petronas holding 40% as before, the source said.
   The plant produces high density polyethylene and linear low density
polyethylene using BP technology.

POLYETHYLENE TEREPHALATE

   Continental Pet Espana announced plans to construct a new
bottle-manufacturing plant that will more than double polyethylene
terephalate demand to 55,000 mt/yr.
   The facility, to be located in Madrid, is expected to be completed in
1997. A possible second phase would boost PET demand to 70,000 mt/yr.
   Although the Continental Pet Europe subsidiary, which currently has four
plants in Spain, usually buys raw material from central European producers,
local supply is poised to increase.
   In November, Seda de Barcelona subsidiary Catalana de Polimers announced
plans to boost PET production to 150,000 mt/yr from 40,000 mt/yr by
year-end 1996.
   Meanwhile, Eastman Chemical is building a 120,000 mt/yr PET plant in San
Roque in southern Spain, in conjunction with Cepsa subsidiary Interquisa
doubling purified terephthalic acid capacity to 400,000 mt/yr. Both
projects are also scheduled to be completed by year-end 1996.

LPG

   Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Petroleum Corp have announced January LPG
postings for propane at $205/mt FOB, an increase of $10/mt over the
December price. Butane has been set at $188/mt FOB, unchanged from the
December level.
   Last week, BP announced January North Sea prices at $230/mt FOB for
propane, an increase of $50/mt, while butane was posted at $155/mt, down
$7/mt from December.

SUPERFUND

   The Republican balanced budget plan vetoed by President Clinton included
a short-term extension of the Superfund excise tax on petroleum and
chemical feedstocks and a corporate environmental tax.
   The tax was due to expire midnight Dec 31, and will not be collected
after that date until there is a budget agreement between the White House
and houses of Congress.
   The excise tax on petroleum and chemical feedstocks was extended for
nine months, pending efforts to overhaul and reauthorize the existing
program. The budget plan also extended the 5 cts/bbl oil spill liability
tax, which was due to expire Dec 31.
   The fund is close to its $1-billion cap, at which point collections
cease. The 0.1 ct/gal tax to clean leaks from underground storage tanks
also expired Dec 31, and is not extended under the Republican plan.

PROPYLENE OXIDE

   Dow Chemical and its subsidiaries plan to expand propylene oxide
capacity at Freeport, Texas; Stade, Germany; and Aratu, Brazil, by a total
of 250,000mt/yr through continuous process technology improvements, the
company said.
   In 1994, Dow announced the addition of more than 227,000mt/yr of PO
capacity at its Plaquemine, Lousiana; Freeport, Stade and Aratu facilities.
All of these expansions will be completed by the end of 1996.
   Dow will now add an additional 45,000mt/yr at its Freeport plant by the
end of 1996, bringing the plant's total capacity increase to 160,000mt/yr
since 1994.
   An additional 205,000mt/yr of capacity will be added at the Stade and
Aratu sites. Dow expects to achieve these two increments between mid-1998
and early 1999.

What's Ahead
for Chiral in '96

The past year saw chiral technology transition from being more than
just a niche in some corner of a pharmaceutical company to become
a major part of drug-development efforts. With the breathtaking
revelations of enzymes, receptors, and genes as new potential
targets for therapeutic interventions being made, Big Pharma now
finds it obliged to team with combinatorial chemistry firms just to
keep up with all the exploding opportunities. To be sure, not all
the potential therapeutic molecules are chiral, but the majority
are so.

Stereochemical technology has applications also in
nonpharmaceutical areas, such as pesticides, flavors, aromas, dyes,
liquid crystals, and polymers. The new year is not yet the time
when we will see maturation in the pharmaceutical sector, however,
and these other fields will likely remain minor outlets, except
perhaps for liquid-crystal applications, which will continue to be
significant. Will chiral technology firms miss the "ground floor"
opportunities to be had in these other areas, or are their plates
simply too full as it is?

The unfolding year will undoubtedly yield new, dazzling feats in
the synthetic duplication of natural molecules.  Most of them,
however, will likely continue to be marvels of academic
accomplishment but will be commercially inviable because of poor
yields, impractical complexity, or costly raw materials.  They
will, though, point up new possibilities for asymmetric chemical
catalysts and resolving agents.

Biocatalysts -- live microbes and refined enzymes -- will probably
carve out significant new roles for themselves in 1996. They
already have an important place in stereochemical technology, but
organic chemists are beginning to look more favorably on them as
useful tools, in part because genetic engineering, protein
engineering, and new screening technologies are delivering up newer
and better enzyme performances.

Synthesis and separation will continue to be opposing strategies
for chiral molecule manufacture this new year. But companies
increasingly see the virtue of combining the two in a way that
makes both economically feasible and efficient.

5.5 Million ChiRex
Shares Offered

Sepracor Inc. (33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, MA  01752;  Tel:
508/481-6700, Fax: 508/481-7683) and Sterling Organics Ltd.
(Sterling Place, Dudley, Cramlington, Northumberland NE23 7QG,
U.K.), a fine chemical company, will join forces to create a new
chiral technology company, ChiRex Inc.

The two companies jointly announced the filing by ChiRex Inc. of a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
relating to a proposed offering of 5,500,000 shares of ChiRex
common stock.  Net proceeds from the proposed offering will be used
to combine Sepracor Inc.'s chiral chemistry business, which is
conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SepraChem Inc., with
Sterling Organics' in a newly formed U.S. company.  The offering
will be managed by CS First Boston, Lehman Brothers, and Smith
Barney Inc.  The S-1 has been filed with a proposed maximum
offering price of $16.50 per share.

ChiRex Inc. will combine SepraChem's chiral chemistry process
technology with Sterling Organics' large-scale chemical
manufacturing capability.  SepraChem, established in 1994, supplies
Sepracor and pharmaceutical companies with chiral pharmaceutical
intermediates and active ingredients.

The business of Sterling Organics was established in the 1960s to
manufacture pharmaceutical intermediates for Sterling Winthrop Ltd.
(4 New Horizons Court, Harlequin Ave., Brentford, Middlesex  TW8
9EP, U.K.), of which it was a division.  Eastman Kodak Co. (343
State St., Rochester, NY  14650; Tel: 716/724-4000,  Fax: 716/477-
3681) sold Sterling Winthrop to Sanofi Winthrop (1 Onslow St.,
Guilford, Surrey  GU1 4YS, U.K.) in September 1994, which in turn
sold the Sterling Organics operation to a group consisting of
Sterling Organics management investors and Montagu Private Equity
Ltd., the European private equity arm of the HSBC Group (10 Lower
Thames St., London EC3R 6AE, U.K.).

Following the offering, ChiRex is expected to have approximately
9.8 million shares outstanding, of which Sepracor is expected to
own approximately 38%.

Celgene Adds
to Its Board

Celgene Corp. (7 Powderhorn Drive, Warren, NJ  07054;  Tel:
908/271-1001,  Fax: 908/271-4184) reports that its board of
directors elected Richard C. E. Morgan to be acting chairman and
chief executive officer effective Jan. 1, 1996, filling the post
held by Richard G. Wright, who is retiring.   Morgan, a director of
Celgene since 1986, is a general partner of Wolfensohn Partners
L.P. (New York) and serves as a director of several medical
technology companies.

Separately, Celgene said Sol J. Barer, president, chief operating
officer, and director, will replace Wright on the board's executive
committee, which also includes Chairman Frank T. Cary, and Morgan.

Chiroscience Turns to
Generic Bulk Actives

Chiroscience (Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4
4WE, U.K.) is entering the intermediates market for generic drugs
with an initial goal of grabbing a 10% market share of global sales
of the bulk active ingredient for the anti-inflammatory and
analgesic medicine S-naproxen.  The company will concentrate on
development of technologies for low-cost production of generic bulk
actives, rather than manufacturing the materials itself.

Naproxen is one of the largest selling enantiomeric drugs, having
worldwide sales in the prescription market of about $1 billion,
perhaps $300 million in the U.S. alone.  Sales should go even
higher now that the over-the-counter market is being tapped.
Syntex is the major producer of naproxen and is its patent holder.
Naproxen is coming off patent, however, and Syntex has collaborated
with Procter & Gamble to market an OTC naproxen under the name
Aleve.  Lederle intends to enter the market with a generic version.

Chemically, naproxen is 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionic acid.  It
is, therefore, a chiral 2-substituted propionic compound, a
characteristic shared with the profens.  The substance is marketed
as the single S isomer, which has 28 times the biological activity
of the other isomer.

Chiroscience intends to license its technologies or use contract
manufacturers for supply of bulk actives, which the company will
sell to generic drug formulators.  The company will use a
technology licensed from DuPont (Wilmington, DE  19810; Tel:
302/695-5234,  Fax: 302/695-5286), using a catalyst for asymmetric
hydrogenation, to produce s-naproxen.  Other processes will be
developed using Chiroscience's own enzymatic catalyst technology.

Alan Shaw, sales director for technical services, says his company
believes it can significantly reduce process costs while
maintaining normal margins due to its chiral technology know-how.
Chiroscience currently provides chiral building blocks as well as
active ingredients for new chemical entities being developed by
other pharmaceutical firms.  The other component of the company's
business focuses on developing pharmaceuticals for marketing on its
own.  One category of pharmaceuticals in its development portfolio
is identified as "fast-track single isomers," which are single-
enantiomer versions of drugs already on the market.

Chiroscience estimates that the current worldwide market for bulk
S-naproxen is around 2,000 tons per year, worth $200 million.  This
could rise, however, to 3,000 tons, worth $300 million, by the year
2000, mainly as a result of introduction of OTC naproxen in Western
Europe.

Stereochemical Stock Watch
(At close, Jan. 2, 1996)

The big winner in our portfolio this month is Chiron, on the news
that its beta-interferon for multiple sclerosis has received a
favorable nod by an FDA committee. Vertex got a boost when its
marketing partner Glaxo Wellcome announced commencing a clinical
trial of the company's protease inhibitor for HIV/AIDS (see
article, this issue).

Chiral Technology
Aided by AIDS

The AIDS pandemic provides a virtual goldmine for chiral
technology, since almost all the drugs available and in development
for treating this disease and its associated conditions are
enantiomeric.

In 1995, the worldwide total sales of all currently marketed HIV
reverse-transcriptase inhibitors amounted to about $450 million.
Nucleoside types have about two-thirds of this market, or $300
million worldwide in 1995, while non-nucleosides have about one-
third, or $150 million.

The newest to join the arsenal of AIDS antivirals are HIV protease
inhibitors, which prevent the action of the enzyme needed by the
virus to convert directly transcribed precursors into mature
proteins as part of its replication process.  The first of this
type to receive regulatory approval, which came in December 1995,
is Invirase (generically called saquinavir) from Roche (Pf. 4002,
Grenzachenstrasse 124, Basel CH-4002, Switzerland; Fax:
011/410/616/911-111; and 340 Kingsland St., Nutley, NJ 07110; Tel:
201/235-5000, Fax: 201/235-7034).

Most likely to reach the market next is Ritonavir from Abbott
Laboratories (1 Abbott Park Road; Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-3500;
Tel: 708/937-6100, Fax: 708/937-2013). Abbott reports recent
results from a clinical trial showing this protease inhibitor
significantly reduced plasma viremia and elevated counts of CD4
lymphocytes.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (40 Allston St., Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel:
617/576-3111, Fax: 617/576-2109), developing its own HIV protease
inhibitor, reports that its partner, Glaxo Wellcome (Berkeley Ave.,
Greenford, Middlesex UB6 OHE, U.K.; Fax: 071/493-4809), has
commenced Phase I/II clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe. This
effort is being supported also by Kissei Pharmaceutical (Matsumoto,
Japan).

Although monotherapy with one compound or another does a reasonable
job at keeping the virus at bay, it seems probable that combination
therapy with a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor and a protease
inhibitor will constitute the future direction of treatment. The
virus may develop a resistance toward one drug type, but it faces
a greater obstacle to its replication when confronted with both
types. It seems possible that while the RTIs will rise to perhaps
$500 million by 2000, for an average annual growth rate of 1.9% in
this five-year period, the PIs will rise rapidly from zero to $500
million themselves, before settling down to a more normal growth
rate.

Numerous other drugs, appproved or experimental, also treat AIDS or
AIDS-associated conditions. The short list includes gamma-globulin,
alpha-interferon, ganciclovir, fluconazole, pentamidine,
erythropoietin, foscarnet, itraconazole, atovaquone, rifabutin,
dronabinol, megestrol acetate, trimetrexate, clarithromycin,
trimethoprim, doxorubicin, and amphotericin B (see table)

To these can be added target-specific antibodies, antigen-based
vaccines, immune-boosting cytokines, immunomodutar chemcals, and
herbal medicines. Almost every biopharmaceutical and Big Pharma
company has some sort of involvement with AIDS drugs.

Sepracor Makes
Improvements

Sepracor Inc. (33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, MA  01752;  Tel:
508/481-6700, Fax: 508/481-7683) has been granted its eleventh and
twelfth U.S. patents for Improved Chemical Entities (ICE).

U.S. Patent 5,470,868 covers the use of R-ondansetron as an
antiemetic.  Marketed by Glaxo Wellcome (Lansdowne House, Berkeley
Square, London W1X 6BZ, U.K.; Tel: 1714934060) as Zofran, racemic
ondansetron already is a leading antiemetic used to treat nausea
and vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatments and surgery.
Sepracor estimates that emesis occurs in 70% of the 3.6 million
chemotherapy episodes and 30% of the 23 million surgical procedures
performed in the U.S. each year.  The sales of Zofran in 1994 were
approximately $600 million.

Despite its effectiveness for emesis, racemic ondansetron has shown
a meaningful incidence of adverse side effects such as tachycardia,
angina, and electrocardiographic alterations, including second-
degree heart block most prevalent in nonchemotherapy uses.
Sepracor believes that the single isomer of ondansetron provides an
opportunity for development of a safer, more effective antiemetic.
Preclinical trials have indicated that R-ondansetron has superior
antiemetic activity compared with the racemic product.

In preclinical studies, Sepracor has discovered that a purified
version of itraconazole retains full antifungal activity with
reduced risk of drug-drug interaction.  Marketed by Janssen
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (1000 E. Garvey Ave. S., West Covina, CA
91790; Tel: 818/918-8510, Fax: 818/918-2862) as Sporanox,
itraconazole is a leading antifungal agent.  The product had 1994
worldwide sales of $276 million and is protected until June 1998
under its composition-of-matter patent.

Sporanox is a complex molecule consisting of several isomers.
Despite its effectiveness for treating fungal and yeast infections,
Sporanox carries a warning label about certain drug interactions
that cause adverse effects, such as cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular
tachycardia, and torsades de pointes.  Other adverse effects
include liver toxicity, nausea, vomiting, and hypersensitivity
reactions.  U.S. Patent 5,474,997 claims pharmaceutical
compositions containing (2R,4S)-itraconazole is a way of treating
local and systemic fungal and yeast infections while avoiding the
concomitant liability of adverse effects associated with the drug.

David S. Barlow, president of Sepracor Pharmaceuticals, said that
the improvement in safety profile may ultimately help enable the
switch of itraconazole from a prescription drug to an over-the-
counter product. That would help extend the franchise for the drug
and expand its market.

Sepracor additionally seeks to commercialize norastemizole, a
third-generation antihistamine and potentially improved allergy
therapy. Norastemizole is an active metabolite of astemizole, the
nonsedating antihistamine marketed by Janssen under the brand name
Hismanal. The astemizole product may produce cardiac arrhythmia,
however.  Preclinical studies by Sepracor indicate that
norastemizole may avoid this side effect.  The fact that
astemizole, as well as norastemizole, are nonchiral entities points
up that Sepracor does not deal exclusively with chiral molecules.

(R)-Lomefloxacin
Eliminates Headaches

James W. Young of Sepracor Inc. (33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, MA
01752;  Tel: 508/481-6700, Fax: 508/481-7683) has been issued a
patent for methods and compositions that treat bacterial infection
using optically pure (R)-lomefloxacin (U. S. 5,476,854). Optical
purity is important since certain isomers may actually be
deleterious rather than simply inert. For example, it has been
suggested that the D-enantiomer of thalidomide was a safe and
effective sedative when prescribed for the control of morning
sickness during pregnancy, and the corresponding L-enantiomer was
a potent teratogen.

It has been discovered that the optically pure (R)-isomer of
lomefloxacin is effective in treating infection in a human while
avoiding adverse effects associated with the administration of
racemic lomefloxacin, including headache, stomach discomfort,
gastrointestinal disorders, hypoglycemia, renal and hepatic
dysfunction, allergic reactions and respiratory distress, and
arthropathy, such as cartilage lesions and erosion and
abnormalities in bone growth in immature patients.

Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e. they
have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In
describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R
and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule
about its chiral center(s).  A specific stereoisomer may be
referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is
often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of
enantiomers if referred to as a racemic mixture.

Stereochemical purity is of importance in the field of
pharmaceuticals, where 12 of the 20 most prescribed drugs exhibit
chirality. A case in point is provided by the L-form of the b-
adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, which is known to be 100
times more potent than the D-enantiomer.

Sepracor's development includes methods for treating the above-
described conditions in a human while avoiding the adverse effects
that are associated with the racemic mixture of lomefloxacin by
administering the optically pure (R)-isomer of lomefloxacin.

Lomefloxacin is currently available commercially in Argentina,
Japan, Mexico, and other countries in Asia and Eastern Europe as
the racemic mixture.  Racemic lomefloxacin, having the chemical
name 1-ethyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(3-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-
oxo-3-quinolinecar-boxylic acid, belongs to the quinoline class of
antibiotics. The quinoline antibiotics, in general, exhibit a broad
spectrum of antibacterial action, demonstrating effectiveness
against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains.

Quinoline antibiotics have been shown to be effective in treating
infections of the respiratory, genito-urinary, and gastrointestinal
tracts.  Racemic lomefloxacin exhibits a broad spectrum of
antibacterial action, demonstrating effectiveness against both
gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Lomefloxacin has
shown to be more effective against gram-negative bacteria.

Ketoprofen Gains
Market Share

The chiral drug, ketoprofen, sold under the Orudis KT brand name by
the Whitehall-Robins Healthcare Division of American Home Products
(5 Giralda Farms, Madison, NJ 07940; Tel: 201/660-5000), has
achieved a 3.7% share of the $2.75 billion OTC pain reliever market
in the U.S., according to A.C. Nielson. The survey covers just the
two-month period ended Dec. 16, since introduction of the product
on Nov. 9. The share figure translates into sales of $102,000,
which comes to $610,000 on an annualized basis, although it's too
early to foretell the actual full-year performance.

To achieve even this modest share so quickly, Whitehall-Robins
undertook the largest overnight delivery of new medication to
retail stores it has ever made.  In a 24-hour, nationwide
distribution effort, more than 20,000 trucks were mobilized to
deliver the Orudis KT to more than 30,000 retail outlets. Retailers
apparently confirm the product's market acceptance. Says John
Spellman, analgesic category manager of American Drug Stores,
"Orudis KT has made a surprisingly strong, early impact on the
over-the-counter pain-relief category at [the company's] stores."

Meanwhile, the consumer Care Division of Bayer (1 Mellon Bank
Center, 500 Grant St., Pittsburgh, PA 15219; Tel: 412/394-5500,
Fax: 412/394-5586) has entered the arena, with its Actron brand of
ketoprofen. Although the tablet has the same strength as American
Home Product's Orudis, Bayer's advertising campaign will emphasize
Actron's smaller tablet size. Promotion of Actron will include
newspaper displays in the top 20 markets and television
advertising. As Gary Balkema, president of Bayer Consumer Care
says, "The powerful medicine in Actron delivers safe and effective
relief of many types of pain.  And its unique size offers a new,
tangible benefit for consumers: it's very easy to swallow."

Ketoprofen chemically is in the same class as ibuprofen and
naproxen, a 2-substituted propionic acid that gives the molecule
its chiral character.

Motilin Focus of
Two-Pronged Effort

Motilin is a recently discovered peptide hormone found in the
gastrointestinal tract and has a molecular weight of around 2,700
daltons.  Its function is to stimulate gastric movement.  Efforts
to imitate and to suppress motilin's action is the subject of drug
development by several companies.

In one recent development, Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho (35 Higashi,
Sotobori-cho, Higashi-ku. Nagoya 461, Japan; Fax: 052/951-7650), a
relatively small pharmaceutical firm, has developed an orally
absorbable form of motilin. Instead of the natural molecule, Sanwa
uses a derivative, L-leucine-13-motilin-homoserine.  The agent's
formulation includes a special surfactant that includes a bile
salt, a saponin, and a polyethylene glycol/higher alcohol ether.
The surfactant acts as an inhibitor of peptide cleaving enzymes.

Too much gastrointestinal activity can be as bad as too little, and
it commonly manifests itself as "nervous stomach" -- diarrhea and
the like. The pharmaceutical division of BOC's subsidiary, Ohmeda
(110 Allen Road, Liberty Corner, NJ 07938; Tel: 908/647-9200, Fax:
908/647-9245) has invented motilin analogs that antagonize the
hormone's receptor and thereby inhibits gastrointestinal motor
activity.

The analogs are optically active isomers of the amino acids that
make up motilin, but some have the D instead of the natural L
configuration, e.g. D-arginine, D-lysine, D-ornithine, D-glutamine,
D-asparagine, or D-alanine. Unnatural amino acids also may be part
of the composition, e.g. D-2,4-diaminobutyric acid, a
halophenylalanine, and cyclohexylalanine.

Ergo Uses Ergot
for Diabetes

Ergo Science Corp. (Boston, MA; Tel: 617/241-6816) finds that
bromocriptine, an ergot alkaloid derivative having five chiral
centers, can benefit in the treatment of Type II diabetes.  The
formulated product, brand-named Ergoset, is currently in Phase III
clinical trials.

In an animal study using seasonally obese, hyperinsulinemic Syrian
hamsters, a carefully timed administration of bromocriptine
produced a significant reduction in noctural lipolysis and hepatic
glucose production accompanied by a 75% decrease in circulating
insulin and improved daytime glucose tolerance.  Timed
bromocriptine may improve glucose tolerance by inhibiting lipolysis
and free fatty acid oxidation through a central and possibly
peripheral effect that increases the ratio of dopamine to
noradrenaline activity. An increasing body of evidence points to
the influence of circadian rhythm on human metabolism.

Bromocriptine already has medical use as an anti-Parkinson's
disease drug, e.g. Sandoz's Parlodel, where the substance acts as
a dopamine receptor agonist. The substance also inhibits the
secretion of prolactin, a hormone that stimulates milk production.

Enantiomeric Sertraline
Synthesized by Pfizer

Pfizer markets sertraline under the brand name Zoloft.  It is an
antidepressant drug and, in fact, is one of the top-selling ones,
with worldwide sales in the area of $720 million annually.

The company has devised a new multistep process for synthesizing
sertraline that involves first synthesizing the (4S) enantiomer of
4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-1(2H)-naphthalenone in high optical
purity. The process starts with the familiar 4-(3,4-
dichlorophenyl)-4-ketobutanoic acid, then proceeds through an
esterification with isopropyl or tert-butyl alcohol, a reduction of
the keto to hydroxy (creating the 4R configuration), and ultimately
yielding the key (4S) naphthalenone intermediate.

Subsequent transformations of the intermediate finally yield cis-
(1S)(4S)-N-methyl-4-(3-,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3-4-tetrahydro-1-
naphthaleneamine, in other words, sertraline.

SmithKline Produces
Camptothecin Analogs

Camptothecin is an alkaloid originating from the Chinese tree,
Camptotheca acuminata, and chemically it is 4-ethyl-4-hydroxy-1H-
pyrano-[3',4':6,7]indolizinol[1,2-b]quinoline-3,14(4H, 12H)-dione.
The substance has anticancer activity by virtue of its acting as an
inhibitor of topoisomerase I, also called "DNA-relaxing enzyme."
This enzyme uncoils double-helix DNA, the first step in replication
of the genetic material during the process of cellular
proliferation.

SmithKline Beecham (1 Franklin Plaza, Philadelphia, PA 19101; Tel:
215/751-4000) is clinically evaluating camptothecin relatives for
breast and colon cancers, and one such compound has the designation
SKF-104864. The company describes a process for the asymmetric
total synthesis of camptothecin analogs.

In the process, a cis-dioxolanone having the same desired absolute
configuration as the end compound is converted to a diester in a
way that conserves the chirality.  This substance then is converted
to one bearing either a good leaving group, a cyano, a carboxylic
acid, or an N-aryl carboxylic amide.  This is converted to a
compound incorporating a propargyl or substituted propargyl, which
finally is converted to the end camptothecin analog.

The chief rival to SB in this arena is Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, which
has in clinical development a camptothecin analog, called
irinotecan and  brand-named Campto, the company licensed from
Yakult Honsha.  The latter also licensed Upjohn, which uses the
brand name Camptosar for the same compound.

Oxazolidinones Show
Diabetes Potential

Celgene (7 Powder Horn Drive, Warren, NJ 07059; Tel: 908/271-1001,
Fax: 908/271-4184) sees potential in oxazolidinones as therapeutic
agents for diabetes and hyperglycemia. The company developed a
stereopreferential synthesis of the (R,R) diastereoisomers of 3-(1-
phenylprop-2-yl)-5-phenyloxazolidin-2-ones as intermediates for the
final compounds.

The method starts with a reduction of the addition salt of an (R)-
N-protected-N-phenylcarboxymethyl-1-phenylprop-2-ylamine to form a
secondary alcohol of predominantly the desired enantiomeric
configuration at the two chiral centers. The next step is a removal
of the protecting group that forms a secondary amine.  Then the
secondary amine is reacted with a carbonyl source. The overall
process results in a chemical purity and an optical purity both in
excess of 99%.

Chemical drugs other than insulin for the control of diabetes and
hyperglycemia has combined worldwide sales of perhaps $3.5 billion
annually, at present. The major fraction of these sales come from
sulfonylurea drugs. They are under challenge by new contenders
because of their tendency to produce hypoglycemia, a serious
problem of its own.

UOP Provides
Good Yield

David W. House of UOP (E. Algonquin Road, Des Plaines, IL  60017;
Tel: 708/391-3963,  Fax: 708/391-3804) has worked out a way to
conveniently racemize benzyl alcohols having a chiral center at the
benzylic carbon by treatment with solid acids that are strongly
acidic cation-exchange materials (U.S. Patent 5,476,964).

It has been known for some time that for medicinals having at least
one chiral center the pharmacological effectiveness of the
enantiomers of the racemic mixture may substantially differ.
Although the recognition of the desirability of using the
pharmacologically and pharmaceutically more acceptable enantiomer
is old, nonetheless the use of optically pure medicinals generally
is relatively new, simply because of the difficulty and cost of
resolution of the racemic mixture and/or the difficulty and cost of
asymmetric synthesis of the desired enantiomer.

With modern chemical advances, especially in asymmetric synthesis,
has come both an increase in the feasibility of selectively
preparing the more acceptable enantiomer of a given chiral
medicinal, as well as increasing pressure on the pharmaceutical
industry to make available only that enantiomer. An instructive
example, pertinent to the subject matter of this invention, is the
class of serotonin-uptake inhibitors exemplified by fluoxetine
(whose racemate is available as Prozac), tomoxetine, and
nisoxetine.

Enantioselective synthesis depends on chiral reagents of high
enantiomeric purity that can be quite expensive. Consequently,
another general approach is based on the efficient resolution of an
early precursor, used as a raw starting material in synthesis, with
high enantiomeric purity, followed by subsequent conventional
synthetic techniques that maintain high enantiomeric purity in
intermediates through final product formation.

When one enantiomer is more desirable than the other in practice
only the more desirable enantiomer will be utilized in subsequent
synthesis. Unless one is willing to accept the economic burden of
discarding the less desirable (or even undesirable) enantiomer --
which is half of the starting material -- it is imperative to
somehow recycle the undesired enantiomer. This application is
directed precisely to this need to afford a cost-effective solution
to the preceding problem.

Racemization of benzyl alcohols may be effected generally in the
range from 20-150C in aqueous or partly aqueous systems in
combination with a water-miscible organic solvent to improve
solubility of the alcohol. Similar racemizations may be effected
for benzyl ethers and esters. This process is valuable for
recycling of unwanted enantiomers obtained in the resolution of
racemic mixtures.   The purpose of this invention is to racemized
benzylic alcohols, ethers, and esters, especially in a continuous
process, with high specificity and good yield.

Supercritical Fluids
Yield Higher Purity

Chemists at Duke University (Durham, NC) have teamed up with Los
Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos, NM) to get high
enantiomeric purities without resorting to toxic solvents.  The
scientists find that they are able to get as great or greater
enantiomeric excesses by catalytic hydrogenation in supercritical
carbon dioxide as in organic solvents.

Above its critical temperature of 31C, nonflammable, non-toxic
carbon dioxide is compressible to densities of 0.5 g/ml, meaning
that users can vary solvent properties by manipulating pressure.
Organic chemistry professor Mark J. Burk and coworkers reported in
the Journal of the American Chemical Society [117, 8277, 1995] on
the hydrogenation of substituted a-acetaminoacrylic acid to
substituted N-acetylalanines in carbon dioxide at 5,000 psig total
pressure and 40C with an asymmetric diphosphine-rhodium catalyst.

The team was able to get 88.4% enantiomeric excess of a-acetamin-
oisobutyric acid, the highest ever achieved from the acrylic acid
precursor.

Fredericamycin A
Is Scripps First

Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute (Claremont, CA) have
achieved the first total synthesis of both enantiomers of the
antitumor-anitbiotic agent fredericamycin A. While the natural
product exhibits potent in vitro cytotoxic activity and has shown
antitumor activity in vivo, not much is known about its site of
action or the structural features responsible for its activity.  In
an effort to identify the origin of its biological properties, Dale
Boger, Ottmar Hter, Kapiamba Mbiya, and Minsheng Zhang of Scripts
accomplished a convergent total synthesis of its two enantiomers.

As reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society [117,
11839, 1995], the scientists used a Michael addition to add the DE
ring system to an F ring precursor, a benzannulation reaction to
construct the AB moiety, and then an aldol closure reaction to
close the C ring in between.

This research complements earlier attempts at total syntheses of
racemic fredericamycin A by other groups.  Boger and coworkers
found that natural fredericamycin A and its enantiomer exhibit
essentially equivalent cytotoxic activity.  This comparable
cytotoxic potency should permit the use of the two enantiomers in
distinguishing the site and potential mechanism of action of
fredericamycin A.

USC Characterizes
Stable Tetracation

Chemists at the University of Southern California (Los Angeles, CA)
have prepared and characterized the first stable tetrahedrally
oriented tetracation.  The synthesis was carried out by
postdoctoral associate Nicholas Head, working with chemistry
professors G. K. Surya Prakash and George Olah.

As reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society [117,
12005, 1995], an adamantane tetrahedrally substituted with four
ester groups was first converted to a tetraol.  The tetraol is then
ionized to the tetracation under superacid conditions at -80C.
The tetracation is stable up to -40C.

Tetracations are very rare and long-lived tetracarbocations that
were previously unknown.  According to Prakash, the researchers
hope to use the tetracation to catalyze the polymerization of other
molecules to yield hyper-branched polymers.  They see the potential
for using the tetracation as a building block in the construction
of self-assembling supramolecular structures.

PerSeptive Introduces
New PNA Chemistry

Peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis chemistry comprise a bedrock
of chiral technology applications, for both research molecules and
potential therapeutics.  A new development is the emergence of
"peptide nucleic acids (PNA)," a hybrid type that uses a peptide-
like backbone with nucleotide pendants. Such hybrid molecules have
the complementary binding capabilities of oligonucleotides for
nucleic acid sequences, but resist the degradative action of
nuclease enzymes.

PerSeptive Biosystems (500 Old Connecticut Path, Framingham, MA
01701; Tel: 508/383-7700, Fax: 508/383-7851) introduces a new line
of products for the synthesis of peptide nucleic acids.
Applications include affinity purification, in situ  hybridization,
enhanced PCR, improved Southern blots, single-point mutation
analysis, and antisense research.

The chemistry employs new monomers with Fmoc (9-
flurenylmethoxycarbonyl) and Bhoc (benzhydryloxycarbonyl)
protecting groups. Syntheses are run on solid-phase supports using
mild conditions and automated instrumentation. PerSeptive has
applied for a patent on its new class of PNA synthons. Says Michael
Eghold, director of PNA research at PerSeptive, "PNA is now being
used in over 100 labs worldwide as a tool for molecular biology and
diagnostic research and functions in very different ways from any
previous molecule."

Having taken over the Biosearch Milligen business from Millipore in
August 1994, PerSeptive is now the second leading supplier of
materials for peptide and oligonucleotide chemical synthesis. It
also supplies the synthesis equipment.

Arrhythmia Drug
Uses Bioreduction

Merck is developing a new drug for cardiac arrhythmia, designated
MK499.  Its production makes use of an asymmetric bioreduction, by
which 6-bromotetralone converts to (S)-6-bromo-2tetraol.  The
reductive activity is furnished by the yeast Trichosporon captatum
MY-1890 (ATCC 74312) which, along with the substrate for
conversion, is cultivated in a medium incorporating glycerol, soy
peptone, and yeast extract.  An optical purity greater than 98% is
obtained.

Arrhythmia is an irregularity of the heart beat. A cluster of
specialized cells, located at the junction of the superior vena
cava and the high right atrium, called the sinoatrial (or sinus)
node, forms the pacemaker of the heart. These cells produce a
rhythmic electrical discharge that initiates the regular
contraction of the heart muscle, which in turn forces (pumps) the
circulation of blood. The sinoatrial cells are modulated by
autonomic nerves and by circulating catecholamines.

Antiarrhythmic drugs to regularize the heart beat had worldwide
sales in 1995 of about $900 million. The Group I antiarrhythmics,
which behave as sodium channel antagonists, have about an 89% share
of this market, while calcium channel blockers, potassium channel
blockers, beta blockers, and miscellaneous others comprise the rest
of the antiarrhythmics.

Process Not Picky
About Enzymes

Researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (345 Park Ave., New York,
NY 10154-0004; Tel: 212/546-4000) have refined a method of chiral
epoxidation of benzopyran or pyranopyridine derivatives using
microorganisms (U.S. Patent 5,478,734). The enzymatic epoxidation
process is advantageous in that it provides high yields of the
chiral epoxides of the compounds with high optical purity.

The invention is a novel process for preparing a chiral epoxide
and/or a (+)-trans dihydroxy compound.  The process comprises the
step of treating a compound with an enzyme or microorganism capable
of catalyzing the stereoselective epoxidation of the compounds to
form the chiral epoxide or the stereoselective hydroxylation to
form the chiral dihydroxy compound.

It has been found that in the presence of one or more epoxidizing
enzymes or microorganisms producing epoxidizing enzymes, the
stereoselective epoxidation of the compounds is achieved. When the
reaction is carried out at ambient temperature, for example, an
optical purity of greater than about 80% may be obtained with a
reaction yield of greater than about 50%. Preferably, an optical
purity of greater than 85% with a reaction yield of greater than
about 60% may be obtained.

In addition to the chiral epoxide, the method comprises the
stereoselective hydroxylation of compounds to produce the chiral
trans-dihydroxy compounds.  The chiral dihydroxy compounds may be
prepared from the racemic trans diols by treatment of the racemic
trans diols with lipase, esterase, or microorganism capable of
supplying lipase or esterase.

Any enzyme or microorganism having the ability to catalyze the
stereoselective epoxidation or stereoselective hydroxylation of the
compounds as described may be employed in the processes. Two or
more -- as well as single -- species of microorganism may be
employed.  Various enzymes, regardless of origin or purity, are
suitable for usefor example, the enzymes may be in the form of
animal or plant enzymes or mixtures thereof, cells of
microorganisms, crushed cells, extracts of cells, or of synthetic
origin.  The use of genetically engineered organisms is being
contemplated.

Hoechst Makes
A Fast Switch

Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft (Frankfurt, Germany) researcher Javier
Manero has invented a process for preparing highly pure enantiomers
of oxirane alcohols (U.S. Patent 5,478,954)  The process involves
recrystallizing a mixture of the isomeric oxirane alcohols, in
which the desired enantiomer is present in an excess of at least
60%, in a solvent or solvent mixture at a temperature just below
the melting point of the oxirane alcohol.  Oxirane alcohols
prepared according to the invention are distinguished by high
enantiomeric purity.

For almost 150 years, chemists have endeavored to produce chiral
compounds in the form of largely pure enantiomers, either by
synthesis of a single enantiomer or by separation of the two
enantiomers. Chiral compounds are in general optically active, i.e.
they rotate the plane of polarized light by a certain amount. This
amount is of the same magnitude for the two enantiomers but has
different signs.

Particularly in the field of biochemistry, it is known that only
one of the two enantiomers usually shows a certain given activity,
even when the two can have completely different activities. In many
other fields of chemistry and industry it is important to work with
enantiomeric compounds that are as pure as possible. Examples
include plant-protection chemicals and ferroelectric liquid
crystals, i.e. those which contain chiral molecules and form tilted
smectic phases.

Clark and Lagerwall have been able to show that the use of
ferroelectric liquid-crystal systems in very thin cells leads to
optoelectric switching or indicating elements that, as compared
with the conventional twisted nematic (TN) cells, have switching
times that are shorter by a factor of up to 1000.  The optical
switching time of ferroelectric liquid-crystal systems depends on
the rotational viscosity of the system on the spontaneous
polarization and the electric field strength.

It is also known to obtain pure enantiomers of compounds by adding
seed crystals of the desired enantiomer to the solution of the two
enantiomers. This so-called spontaneous resolution of racemates
succeeds only if the racemic mixture crystallizes as a
conglomerate, i.e. as a mixture of crystals of one enantiomer in
each case, which is the case for only a few compounds.  It was a
goal at Hoechst to provide a process to more easily obtain oxirane
alcohols of an even higher purity of the enantiomers.

Hoechst found, surprisingly, that oxirane alcohols without
detectable contamination by the other diastereomers or enantiomers
can be obtained by recrystallization in suitable solvents at
temperatures that are just below the melting point of the oxirane
alcohol. The interval between the melting point and the temperature
of the recrystallization can be the wider, the higher the melting
point of the compound.

Continuous Sampling
Elucidates Absorptions

The University of Kansas (Lawrence, KS) has developed an interface
for use with a multiple-sample acquisition device and a capillary
electrophoresis separation device (U.S. Patent 5,449,064). The use
of continuous sampling can permit the user to better elucidate the
pathways and kinetics of absorption of a particular compound of
interest to determine how the compound is transformed within the
body and to determine the rate at which the compound is eliminated
from the living organism. This information is often necessary to
permit the researcher to fully assess the safety of both
pharmaceutical and environmental compounds.

One might desire information about the reaction of an analgesic
chiral compound in a living organism. To determine this, a known
amount of the compound could be given to the organism, and
continuous tissue samples (e.g., brain fluid) are obtained. By
analyzing the brain fluid samples that were withdrawn at various
time intervals after giving the analgesic to the animal, one could
obtain a great deal of information about the manner in which the
specific analgesic functioned within the living organism.

By continuously obtaining samples, it is also possible to determine
the amount of time required to remove the particular analgesic
system from the living organism. Knowing the rate of elimination of
the analgesic can be especially important for enabling its
manufacturer to either adjust the dosage or alter the drug (such as
through micro encapsulation) to enable the drug to achieve a proper
titer within the living organism for a proper time period.

One goal when performing continuous or semi-continuous sampling is
to improve the temporal resolution of the sampling and detection
process. Temporal resolution relates to the number of data points
that one can obtain over a given time span. Figures for temporal
resolution are typically given in units of time span. To say that
a particular experiment had a temporal resolution of 1 minute means
that a data point was taken (or capable of being taken) each
minute. The factor limiting temporal resolution is the time
required to accumulate and collect a sample of a size adequate for
the particular detection method being used in conjunction with the
sampling.

Methods for obtaining time-interval type, sequential multiple-
sample chemical information from tissues of living systems have
usually involved either a postmortem analysis taken at several time
points or the use of biosensors implanted in vivo. Postmortem
analyses typically require the use of a large number of animals
with only a single sample being taken from each animal. The "pseudo
continuity" of samples is achieved by taking the samples from the
different animals at different points in time.

The use of postmortem analyses to construct a temporal plot of
chemical events is difficult and often provides ambiguous results.
While several compounds can be determined at each time point (and
hence from each sample), each animal can provide data for only a
single time point. It is therefore preferable in terms of both the
quality of data obtained and the number of experimental animals
needed that the entire time course (data set) be obtained from one
animal by taking a large number of samples over a span of time.
Although this can be accomplished through the use of a biosensor,
biosensors suffer the drawback of providing less chemical
information since they are usually limited to monitoring only a
single chemical species.

To overcome the sampling difficulties, some researchers use a
microdialysis sampling technique. Microdialysis sampling is
accomplished by implanting a microdialysis probe that consists of
a small, semi-permeable membrane fiber at the site of interest.
This fiber is slowly perfused with a sampling solution. The
semipermeable microdialysis membrane allows certain molecules of
interest to pass from the animal into the sampling solution.

Small molecules in the extra-cellular space can diffuse into the
microdialysis membrane fiber and are swept away by the sampling
solution to be collected for analysis. Microdialysis probes can be
implanted in many tissues with minimal discomfort to the
experimental animal.  A limitation of microdialysis has been the
limited temporal resolution that has been achievable to date. While
microdialysis is a continuous sampling technique, it is typically
coupled to a separation method that requires discrete samples.

Beckman's New
Analysis Method

The rapid analysis-time characteristic of capillary electrophoresis
(CE) has allowed Beckman Instruments (2500 Harbor Blvd., Fullerton,
CA  92634; Tel: 800/742-2345 or 714/871-4848,  Fax: 714/870-8083)
to develop an easy-to-use, ultrafast chiral separation method for
the analysis of optically active drugscyclodextrin-array chiral
analysis.

Andras Guttman, Anthony Aumatel, Sandy Brunet, and Nelson Cooke of
Beckman reported the results of separations utilizing the new
method in American Laboratory [27, 18, 1995]. Earlier, STN
(November 1995) reported on Beckman's integrated capilllary
electrophoresis system that uses special software for computer-
based analysis of the data.

Cyclodextrin-mediated capillary electrophoresis of enantiomers was
first introduced by employing several native cyclodextrins
entrapped in polyacrylamide gels.  Later, a similar methodology in
an open tubular-separation mode was applied.  Natural a-, b-, and
g-cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides of 6, 7, and 8
glucopyranose units, respectively.  The diameter and volume of the
DC cavity are determined by the number of glucose units in the CD
ring.

The most energetically stable form of this ring structure resembles
a truncated cone in aqueous solution with the linking glycosidic
and glucopyranose oxygens pointing inward and the C-6 hydroxyls
opposite to the C-2 and C-3 hydroxyls.  As a result, the chemical
characteristics of the cavity are determined by the hydrogens
projecting into the cavity and the nonbonding pair of electrons
contributed by each of the ring-forming oxygens.

To obtain chiral separation with CD, it is necessary for different
interactions to take place between the enantiomer and the CD.
These interactions are as follows:  electrostatic, dipole-dipole,
inductive, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions.  If at
least one of these interactions is stereochemically dependent,
chiral separation of an enantiomeric solute is possible.

Recently, a rational approach to predicting the electrophoretic
mobility differences for enantiomers of weak acids and bases in CE
using different natural and derivatized CDs as chiral selectors was
introduced.  Three types of CD-based chiral CE separations were
identified, differentiated by the selective interaction of the
ionic/nonionic forms of the enantiomer.

In desionoselective separation, selective interaction occurs only
between the nondissociated form of the enantiomer and the CD.  In
ionoselective separation, selective interaction occurs only with
the dissociated form of the enantiomer.  In duoselective
separation, selective interaction occurs with both the charged and
uncharged forms of the enantiomer.

CD-array chiral analysis uses an array of chiral selectors, such as
b-, g-, hydroxypropyl-b-, and dimethyl-b-DCs, in various
concentrations to accommodate different types of solutes.  After
the application of the CD array on CE, the appropriate CD type is
usually identified in conjunction with the suitable pH.  Other,
more typical CE separation parameters, such as field strength and
temperature, can be varied in order to influence the separation
efficiency and, thus, resolution.

Chiroscience Blends
Chemistry, Enzymes

Chiroscience Ltd. (Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge
CB4 4WE, U.K.; Tel: 44/01/223-420430, Fax: 44/01/223-420440) makes
the claim of being the world's leading chiral technology company.
At the very least, it is one of the larger companies specializing
in this field. The company was founded by Chris Evans and is headed
by Nowell Stebbing.  Andrew Headland is the marketing manager, and
Joe Carey runs international collaborations.

The company has a willingness to employ both chemical reagents and
enzymes to make chiral compounds.  Moreover, it is wedded to
neither resolution nor asymmetric synthesis, accepting both
approaches to the furnishing of enantiomers. The company, however,
does regard itself as a pharmaceutical firm, excluding other
applications of chiral technology from its portfolio of interests.

Recently, Chiroscience acquired a license to phospholane asymmetric
hydrogenation catalysts from Du Pont.  Hydrogenation is one of the
most common reactions in preparative chemistry. The company notes
that rhodium complexes of Du Pont's DuPhos ligand family have
applicability to obtaining single-enantiomer amino acids by an
asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral enamides.

The reductions have high turnovers of catalyst, a low requirement
of hydrogen pressure, stereoconvergent  transformation of Z/E
mixtures, and high enantiomeric excesses. The phospholane catalysts
were discovered by Mark Burk at Du Pont, and he continues to work
at Duke University (North Carolina).  His latest advance is the
hydrogenation of b,b-disubstituted enamides in a medium of
supercritical carbon dioxide, giving the highest enantiomeric
excesses so far attained for the reduction of such tetrasubstituted
olefins.

Chiroscience also licenses ligands from Professor Barry Trost at
Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA), which the company uses for
palladium catalysts to promote asymmetric allylic substitution
reactions, for instance, the generation of carbovir (an antiviral)
and aristeromycin. The Trost catalysts can also be used to convert
allylic carbonates and acetates into useful synthons by reaction
with nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles, providing
access to a wide range of chiral cyclic molecules. Either
enantiomer can be produced.

Unnatural amino acids are of increasing importance as components of
therapeutic peptides, by modifying the receptor selectivity of the
peptide, and by enhancing its metabolic resistance to degradation
or by improving its bioavailability.  Chiroscience has developed a
"one-pot" route to unnatural amino acids using an immobilized
acylase for the resolution of the BOC derivative.  The unwanted
isomer recovered after the resolution is racemized and put back
into the process stream. The company now seeks to apply this method
to the production of cyclic amino acids as analogs of proline or
pipecolic acid.

When a D-acetyl amino acid is racemized with acetic anhydride, an
azlactone is formed as an intermediate.  This intermediate
spontaneously racemizes via its achiral enol tautomer, but
azlactones also can be biotransformed.  For instance,  the
introduction of n-butanol into  tert-leucine azolactone  using a
lipase takes place only on the L isomer, but the D isomer
spontaneous racemizes, channeling all the material toward the L in
a process known as "dynamic resolution.  Additionally, when
azlactones are made by condensation of an N-acyl glycine (such as
hippuric acid) with an aldehyde, the resulting olefins can be
opened to enamides, which then serve as substrates for the DuPhos
hydrogenation.

The g-lactam synthon (-)-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one is an
intermediate for the synthesis of carbocyclic nucleosides having
the same configuration as the natural ones they mimic.
Chiroscience's chemistry has the capability of producing not only
the lactam but also more advanced downstream intermediates.  The
company uses a proprietary resolution methodology based on
enantiocomplementary biotransformations by lactamases selected by
screening microorganisms of the natural environment.  Applying this
process ultimately results in at least a 20,000- fold improvement
in biocatalyst cost relative to early biocatalysts.

Among the pharmaceutical compounds for which Chiroscience has
developed production methods are a protein kinase C inhibitor, an
immunosuppressant, a k-opioid analgesic, and a dopaminergic
agonist.

SUIT ALLEGES AEC RAN
SECRET RADIATION TESTS
ON OREGON PRISON INMATES

     A class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Oregon Dec. 5 alleges that 67 Oregon state prison
inmates were the subjects of risky and painful government
experiments in the 1960s to study the effects of ionizing
radiation on the human body.  Bibeau v. Pacific Northwest
Research Foundation Inc. et al., No. 95-06410-HO (D OR).

     The inmates consented to the experiments, which involved x-
ray irradiation of their sex organs, but the defendants conspired
to conceal from them the true nature of the research and the
risks involved, the complaint charges.

     Harold Bibeau, an inmate at Oregon State Penitentiary in
Salem, OR, from 1963 to 1969, and his wife Melanie Ann, filed the
complaint on behalf of three classes of alleged victims: the 67
inmates who were subjected to the experiments, their family
members and any children who were conceived after the subjects
were irradiated.

     Named as defendants are two laboratories, the Pacific
Northwest Research Foundation Inc. (PNRF) and Battelle Pacific
Northwest Laboratories; two medical doctors who were employed by
the Oregon Department of Corrections, Dr. Daniel E. Dilaconi and
Dr. Fernando Leon; a PNRF employee, Mavis Rowley, and four
officials of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), the forerunner
to the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which
allegedly funded and oversaw the experiments.

     According to the complaint, the prison experiments (called
the Heller experiments after chief researcher Dr. Carl Heller,
now deceased) were undertaken after a 1962 accident at the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland, WA, exposed workers to
significant amounts of ionizing radiation.

     The AEC wanted to study the short- and long-term effects of
ionizing radiation on spermatogenesis among the workers and also
to investigate the effects of long-term exposure on pilots of a
then-proposed nuclear-powered airplane (which was never
developed), the complaint charges.

     The Heller experiments involved irradiating the inmates'
testes with eight to 600 rads of radiation over 10 years from
1963 to 1973.  Periodically, the researchers gathered blood,
urine and semen from the inmates and also performed biopsies and
vasectomies on them.

     The defendants knew that the experiments subjected the
inmates to prolonged pain, increased their risks of developing
cancer and other serious illnesses, and caused radiation sickness
and burns and chromosomal damage that may affect the health of
children conceived after the testing.  They conspired to conceal
those risks from the test subjects, the complaint charges.

     Bibeau claims he and the other inmates were thus deprived of
the opportunity to give their informed consent and that the
prison environment and the large monetary compensation the
inmates were given relative to their regular prison compensation
were inherently coercive.

     He alleges violations of civil and constitutional rights,
intentional infliction of physical harm and emotional distress,
strict liability, personal injury, absence of informed consent,
loss of consortium, negligence, gross negligence, breach of
fiduciary duty, conspiracy, fraudulent concealment and failure to
provide ongoing medical monitoring.  The complaint also states a
claim pursuant to Bivens (Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 [1971]) because it
alleges that government officials (the AEC defendants) and
private parties illegally conspired to cause injuries to the
plaintiffs.

     Bibeau is seeking compensatory damages of $50 million and
punitive damages of $200 million, medical monitoring of the
inmates and any children conceived after the experiments,
interest and attorneys' fees and costs.

     The plaintiffs are represented by Daniel Berger, Stanley
Siegel, Bernadette M. Rappold and Eric L. Cramer of Berger and
Montague, Philadelphia; E. Cooper Brown and H.W. Cummins of
Tacoma Park, MD; Martin H. Freeman of Bethesda, MD; and Raymond
J. Heslin and Leonard M. Marks of New York City.  They are also
represented by Jerry S. Cohen and Anthony Z. Roisman of Cohen,
Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, Washington, DC; and by Roy S. Haber,
Eugene, OR.

DEATH BENEFIT AWARDED
FOR ETS EXPOSURE
AT VA HOSPITAL

     A federal Department of Labor claims examiner in Cleveland
on Dec. 8 awarded death benefits to the husband of a Veterans
Administration nurse, who claimed that his wife died of lung
cancer from exposure to cigarette smoke while caring for mentally
ill veterans.  In re Mildred Wiley, No. A9-365951 (U.S. Dept. of
Labor, Office of Workers' Comp. Programs).

     The decision is believed to be the first award of benefits
for a workplace injury attributed to environmental tobacco smoke
(ETS).

     The claim was brought by Philip E. Wiley of Marion, IN, who
claimed that his wife, Mildred, died as the result of exposure to
ETS during the course of her employment at the VA Medical Center
in Marion, where she worked for 18 years.  Mildred Wiley died at
the age of 56, one month after being diagnosed with lung cancer
in 1991.

     Wiley contended that his wife's only exposure to cigarette
smoke was during her work at the hospital.

     Wiley's claim was denied twice, once in 1992 and again in
1993, on grounds that the causal relationship between Mildred
Wiley's cancer and her ETS workplace exposure had not been
established.

     The claim was resubmitted in December 1994 by Wiley's
attorneys, Joseph Young and William N. Riley of Young & Riley in
Indianapolis, and was accompanied by a report from Dr. David M.
Burns, a University of San Diego medical professor who has
testified in several tobacco cases.

     According to the compensation order issued by Cynthia F.
Bujakowski, Labor Department reconsideration claims examiner,
Burns said that based on a review of the entire record, "Mildred
Wiley's adenocarcinoma of the lung, and the carcinogenic process
itself, was significantly aggravated and accelerated by her
exposure to ETS at her worksite."

     Burns also noted that neither Mildred Wiley, her husband,
family or friends smoked cigarettes and that she avoided ETS in
public and social situations.  Also, Burns said, Mildred Wiley
regularly worked in an environment where ETS was commonly present
at levels where the tobacco smoke was easily visible or
perceptible.

     Burns said that "tobacco smoke is the only proven human lung
carcinogen that [Mildred Wiley] was exposed to at a substantial
level."

     The VA contested the claim, arguing that Mildred Wiley had
never complained about cigarette smoke and that she had lived in
several other cities where she could have been exposed to other
carcinogens before beginning work at the hospital in 1973.

     Bujakowski noted in the compensation opinion that, in
response to the earlier claims, the hospital did not dispute the
extent of Wiley's exposure to cigarette smoke.  And, Bujakowski
said, the hospital's own expert witness conceded that he could
not rule out ETS as the cause of Mildred Wiley's cancer.

     Riley, Wiley's attorney, said that Wiley will receive a
$1,000 death and funeral benefit and will be entitled to payments
of approximately $21,500, one-half his wife's annual salary, each
year for the rest of his life.

     In May 1993, Wiley filed a product liability suit against
the major cigarette manufacturers in Delaware County, IN, state
court (Dunn et al. v. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. et al.,
No. 18D019305CT06 [IN, Delaware Cty.]).  The tobacco industry
moved to transfer the case to Grant County; that motion was
denied.  The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the
case should be transferred from Delaware County to Grant County
because Mildred Wiley resided in Grant County at the time of her
death.  The plaintiffs appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court.

     On Dec. 5, the Indiana Supreme Court reversed the Court of
Appeals and affirmed the trial court decision that the proper
venue for the trial was the Delaware County, IN, court.

     The VA, which is responsible for making the payments to
Wiley, could seek recovery by filing a claim against any judgment
Wiley may win in his lawsuit, or by filing claims against the
companies directly.

NC CT.: OFFICIAL NOTICE
OF CONTAMINATION STARTS
CLAIM CLOCK RUNNING

     An official government notice of well water contamination
starts the statute of limitations running, even if a plaintiff
notices earlier that the water smells and tastes bad, the North
Carolina Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 5.  Crawford v. Boyette et
al., No. COA95-37 (NC Ct. App.).

     The panel reinstated a nuisance, trespass and strict
liability suit against the owner and operator of a gas station by
a residential neighbor.

     From 1986 to 1991, John Crawford rented a house near a gas
station owned by Gary Boyette and operated by Cary Oil Co.  When
Crawford moved in, he attributed the noticeable funny smell and
taste of his well water to the known presence of lime in the
vicinity.

     In 1987, he contacted the county health department, which
recommended chlorination but did not test for petroleum products.
It was not until April 6, 1989, that Crawford was notified by the
state of specific chemical compounds found in his water,
including benzene and paradichlorobenzene.  In June 1989, he
received the state's official health risk evaluation warning of
the risks of gasoline contamination.

     A nuisance and trespass complaint was filed in Wake County
Superior Court on April 2, 1992, within three years of the
April 6, 1989, notice.  Judge George R. Greene granted summary
judgment in favor of the defense, holding the suit barred by the
three-year limitations period.

     The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded in an opinion by
Judge Ralph A. Walker, saying the limitations period did not
start to run until Crawford received official notification that
chemicals from petroleum products were found in his water.
Although Crawford noticed a peculiar smell and taste, he
attributed those problems to lime and took reasonable steps to
determine whether his well was contaminated by contacting the
county health department, it said.

     In addition, it said Crawford received no warnings about
petroleum contamination until the state sent its detailed
evaluation in June 1989.

     Kenneth N. Barnes argued for Crawford.  Defense counsel were
Robert R. Smith of Smith & Holmes and Phillip C. Ransdell of
Ransdell, Ransdell & Cline.

ED VA JUDGE DENIES MOTION
TO REMAND LEAD POISONING
LITIGATION TO STATE COURT

     A lead poisoning personal injury suit that names a federally
funded public housing authority as one of the defendants will
remain in federal court, according to a Nov. 20 ruling by a
federal judge in Norfolk, VA, denying the plaintiffs' motion to
remand to state court.  Hunter et al. v. Estate of Baecher et
al., No. 2:95CV878 (ED VA).

     A complaint was filed in state court against the estate of
John Joseph Baecher, who owned the property leased to the
plaintiffs.  It was amended to add as a defendant the Norfolk
Redevelopment and Housing Authority (NRHA), which administers the
federal section8 subsidized housing program.  As amended, the
complaint seeks $5 million in damages under section1983 and
federal housing statutes, breach of contract, negligence, breach
of warranty and violations of the state Residential Landlord and
Tenant Act and Virginia Consumer Protection Act.

     After it was added to the suit, the NRHA petitioned to
remove the case to the Eastern District of Virginia on the basis
of the federal court's original jurisdiction over the civil
rights and federal housing statute claims.  The plaintiffs moved
to remand to state court, and arguments were heard on the motion
on Nov. 17.

     U.S. District Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. denied the remand
motion, rejecting arguments that state claims predominate and
that construction of the two Virginia statutes in the context of
lead paint poisoning present novel and complex issues that state
courts should resolve.

     Although case law in Virginia is sparse on how the
landlord-tenant statute handles lead paint poisoning disputes,
that statute is modeled on a uniform statute with abundant case
law, the judge said.  In addition, he said the state law claims
are no more technically or intellectually involved than the
federal claims.

     Beyond that, Judge Clarke found the interests of judicial
economy and fairness to the litigants warrant supplemental
jurisdiction over the state law claims.  The federal and state
claims all center around the issue of what duties exist regarding
the presence of lead paint in a rental residence; the parties and
operative facts also are the same.  Nor does the statute under
which the case was removed to federal court authorize a remand of
the federal questions, he said.

     "In this case, Plaintiffs have consolidated their claims
against the two defendants and have invoked federal law in the
process.  In bringing one suit, Plaintiffs and Defendants could
expect to be part of only one proceeding.  By bringing federal
claims, Plaintiffs could expect that proceeding would take place
in federal court.  Defendants, by removing the case, showed their
preference for federal court," Judge Clarke said.

     The plaintiffs were represented by Richard James Serpe,
Harold Seward Lawlor and Richard Steven Glasser of Glasser &
Glasser in Norfolk; and by Oscar Lawrence Gilbert of Rabinowitz,
Rafal, Swartz, Taliaferro & Gilbert in Norfolk.

     Defense counsel were Marshall Topping Bohannon Jr. of
Bohannon, Bohannon & Hancock in Norfolk; John D. Radd of Huff,
Poole & Mahoney in Virginia Beach; and Melanie Fix, James Long
Chapman IV and Francis N. Crenshaw of Crenshaw, Ware & Martin in
Norfolk.

CA JUDGE DENIES MOTION
TO VACATE CONSENT DECREE
IN LEAD FAUCET SUIT

     Finding that he made no error in issuing a consent judgment
approving a settlement between the state and seven water faucet
manufacturers to eliminate the lead in their products, San
Francisco County Superior Court Judge Carlos Bea on Nov. 28
denied a motion by defendant Price Pfister to vacate the
judgment.  People ex rel. Lungren v. American Standard et al.,
No. 948017 (CA Super. Ct., San Francisco Cty.).

     Judge Bea also granted the state's request for sanctions in
the amount of $950.  He ruled that Pfister's motion was not
entirely frivolous, but that it showed bad faith by introducing a
confidential settlement letter from the state that it had agreed
to keep out of the proceedings.

     Pfister was one of 16 defendants in a suit brought by the
state and several environmental groups alleging that the faucet
makers were in violation of the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic
Enforcement Act, also known as Proposition 65, a state law
enacted in 1986 that prohibits the discharge of toxic chemicals
into sources of drinking water.

     The settlement agreement with seven of the major faucet
manufacturers was approved in October in Superior Court over the
objections of Pfister and Chicago Faucet Co.  It calls for the
faucet makers to eliminate lead from their faucets by 1999 and to
affix warning labels on faucets that do not meet California's
standard limiting the amount of lead in drinking water to
0.5 micrograms of lead per day.  The seven companies " American
Standard, Moen, Masco, Eljer, Elkay, Whirlpool and Universal
Rundle " have agreed to apply the same standards nationwide.

     The settlement came about after the state lost its case
against the faucet manufacturers in Superior Court and lost an
appeal in the California Court of Appeal.  The defendants
successfully argued that household drinking water is not a
"source of drinking water" within the meaning of Proposition 65.
However, in two consolidated cases in Alameda County against
three water pump manufacturers, the Superior Court ruled just the
opposite, i.e., that Proposition 65 does apply to tap water, thus
prompting the settlement.  The three water pump manufacturers
also joined in the settlement.

     In the meantime, the California Supreme Court has agreed to
hear an appeal of the appellate court ruling in the San Francisco
case solely on the issue of whether Proposition 65 includes
plumbing fixtures.

     In its motion to vacate, Pfister argued that the court erred
in presuming that the attorney general properly carried out his
duty to enforce Proposition 65 and that the court accepted an
improper standard for testing the lead content in faucets that
does not accurately detect whether the daily lead exposure
exceeds the legal limit of .5 micrograms per day.

     Judge Bea ruled that Pfister misconstrued the attorney
general's actions and the consent judgment.

     "No 'standard' has been adopted by the Attorney General or
the Court.  The testing protocol at issue is merely a means for
implementing and enforcing the .5 micrograms of lead per day
exposure standard called for in the regulations," he said.

     The state had requested $2,500 in sanctions against Pfister
for bringing a frivolous motion to vacate, but Judge Bea found
that the motion was not wholly frivolous because the state's
Rules of Civil Procedure do permit parties to contend that a
court's decision is based on legal error.  He did find, however,
that Pfister showed bad faith in filing the confidential
settlement letter under seal as part of its motion and in using
the letter as the basis of a declaration from an expert witness
that the testing protocol is not accurate.

     Pfister had agreed not to use the letter in any form in the
litigation and it should have adhered to that agreement, he said.
"'An honest man's word is his bond,'" Judge Bea said quoting from
Don Quixote.  "In this court, at least, the words of Don Miguel
de Cervantes are not only found true but enforced."  He ruled
that the state is entitled to recoup $950, its expenditures
caused by Pfister's use of the letter.

     Pfister was represented by James L. Meeder, San Francisco.
The state was represented by Deputy Attorney General Edward G.
Weil.

9TH CIRCUIT REINSTATES
COUNTY WORKER'S CLAIMS
AGAINST EXTERMINATORS

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Oct. 26
reinstated the claims of a former Santa Clara County, CA, planner
against two exterminating companies that she alleges made her
sick when they applied pesticides to the building where she
worked.  Jensen v. County of Santa Clara et al., Nos. 94-16063
and 94-16824 (9th Cir.).

     The appellate court, however, ruled that her claims against
the county and some of its employees are barred by California's
workers compensation and government immunity statutes.

     Cheriel Jensen was an associate planner for Santa Clara
County from 1977 to 1993.  On June 14, 1993, she filed suit in
Santa Clara Superior Court against the county, 14 county
employees and officials, two pest control companies " Instar Pest
Consultants Inc. and Applied Pest Management Inc. (APM) " and an
APM official, Gregory Clark.  Instar provided pest control
services to the county from 1983 to 1990, and APM provided pest
control services from 1990 to 1993.

     Jensen's suit alleged that the two companies applied a
pesticide called Safrotin, which made her chronically ill.
Acting pro se, she alleged 22 federal and state law causes of
action including negligence, failure to warn, denial of civil
rights, violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act,
fraudulent concealment and breach of contract.

     The suit was removed to U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California where Judge James Ware dismissed 13 of the
county defendants and 17 of Jensen's causes of action.  He also
dismissed with leave to amend five of Jensen's claims against the
remaining county defendants, and Jensen filed a first amended
complaint in February 1994.

     In April 1994, Judge Ware granted summary judgment to
Instar, finding that Jensen's personal injury claims against the
company were time-barred by California's one-year statute of
limitations.  He later denied Jensen's motion to remand the suit
to state court, dismissed her remaining claims against the county
defendant and dismissing her second amended complaint against APM
and Clark.

     Jensen appealed all of those judgments, and the Ninth
Circuit affirmed all but the personal injury claims against
Instar and her second amended complaint against APM.

     According to the unpublished opinion, the circuit court
found that the district court correctly dismissed the claims
against the county defendants because they are barred by the
exclusivity provisions of the California Workers' Compensation
Act.

     The lower court also correctly dismissed the claims against
the county employees and officials because they are immune from
liability for actions taken within the scope of their employment
under the California Government Code section820.9, the appellate
panel said.

     In addition, Judge Ware ruled correctly that Jensen could
not file a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
because it is not retroactive.  She stopped working 25 days
before the ADA went into effect, the circuit court said.

     On the personal injury claims against Instar, the Ninth
Circuit reversed and remanded Judge Ware's dismissal of those
claims because they were filed on time from the date she
discovered the alleged cause of her injuries.  Although Jensen
had suffered symptoms from 1977, she believed that her illness
was caused by the state's Malathion medfly spraying.  It was not
until June 12, 1992, that she discovered that her injuries may
have been caused by the county's pest control actions, and she
filed her first complaint on June 14, 1993, which is within the
one-year statute of limitations period, the appellate court said.

     The Ninth Circuit also reinstated Jensen's second amended
complaint against APM, which the district court had dismissed
because of her failure to comply with its court order to remove
four claims.  The appellate panel said that Jensen did try to
comply with the order and that the district court's sanction was
too harsh and constituted an abuse of its discretion.

9TH CIR. DETERMINES HEALTH
ASSESSMENT TO CONSTITUTE
REMOVAL OR RESPONSE

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 affirmed a
Washington federal court's dismissal of a citizens' group's bid
to compel the Agency for Toxic Research and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) to initiate a health assessment program in the region of
the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.  Hanford Downwinders Coalition
et al. v. Dowdle et al., No. 94-35100 (9th Cir.).

     The panel agreed that no federal court jurisdiction existed
over the claim and concluded that the ATSDR's ongoing health
assessment activity in the region constituted a removal or
remedial action for the purposes of CERCLA's Timing of Review
provision.

     The litigation stems from ongoing cleanup efforts at the
Hanford facility in Richland, WA, which for some 30 years
produced plutonium for the Department of Defense.  The facility
generated releases of radioactive iodine and other hazardous
substances into the atmosphere, soil and water of the region.

     In 1988, the EPA proposed adding the Hanford site to the
National Priorities List (NPL).  The following year, the EPA,
Department of Energy and Washington Department of Ecology
outlined their response.  The ATSDR was assigned specific
responsibilities under the response plan to prepare preliminary
health assessments, and was given the discretion to expand them
to full health assessments if warranted.

     The Hanford site has remained the subject of continued
research by the ATSDR.  In 1993, the ATSDR declared the site to
be among the Superfund sites posing the greatest threat to public
health, and has applied the results of the Centers for Disease
Control's 1994 study to its criteria for determining whether
medical monitoring would be appropriate.

     Plaintiffs Hanford Downwinders Coalition Inc. (HDC) brought
the instant litigation in July 1993, alleging that the ATSDR has
a mandatory duty under CERCLA section9604(i)(9) to commence a
health surveillance program in the region, including medical
testing and monitoring for individuals exposed to radioactive
iodine.  The Eastern District of Washington granted the defense's
dismissal motion, concluding that the ATSDR's health-related
activities at Hanford constituted ongoing removal or response
activity, and that the plaintiffs' claim was therefore an
impermissible challenge.

     Affirming, the Ninth Circuit first rejected the plaintiffs'
contentions that the language of the statute supported their
construction of the statute.  The HDC asserted that when Congress
instructed the ATSDR to "effectuate and implement [CERCLA's]
health-related authorities" in section9604(i)(1) of the statute,
it meant to distinguish these health-related authorities from
"response authorities" as defined under section9604.  "There is
no indication that Congress' characterization of ATSDR
authorities as 'health related' was intended to render the
section9604 'response authorities' section superfluous as to
ATSDR actions," the panel rejoined.

     The panel found that the language of section9604(i)(1)
"should be read narrowly as a means to distinguish between
different types of response authorities, rather than interpreted
broadly as an effort to differentiate ATSDR health assessment and
surveillance activity from response actions protected by the
Timing of Review provision."

     Cautioning that not all section9604 "response authorities"
are to be considered removal or remedial actions per se, the
Ninth Circuit engaged in an analysis of whether the ATSDR's
conduct could be shown to be removal or remedial activity.  "The
ATSDR health assessment and surveillance activities challenged by
the HDC," the panel wrote, "are a necessary part of the
government's efforts to safeguard the public health at NPL
sites....  [The ATDSR] is an integral part of Congress' effort to
protect the health of those exposed to hazardous releases from
facilities listed on the NPL."

     The court reconciled the instant case with its holdings in
Durfey v. E.I. DuPont (1995) (See Toxic Chemicals LR, July 18,
1995, P. 21,563) and Price v. U.S. Navy (1994) which declared
that independent private actions for medical monitoring were not
removal or remedial actions.  "The reasoning in Durfey and Price
does not apply to health assessment and surveillance actions
engaged in by a governmental agency pursuant to explicit CERCLA
provisions," wrote the panel.

     The plaintiffs pointed to the structure of CERCLA, noting
that section9607(a)(4)(A), which provides for the government to
recover "all costs of removal or remedial action," is separate
from section9607(a)(4)(D), which provides for the recovery of
"the costs of any health assessment" made by the ATSDR.  The
panel rejoined that section9607(a)(4)(D) was in fact part of the
1986 SARA amendments, and "decline[d] to read the failure of
Congress to accomplish the seamless integration of ATSDR
provisions with the other authorities found under subsection
9607(a)(4)(A) as compelling proof of Congress' intent to
distinguish ATSDR activities from removal and remedial actions."

     The plaintiffs also pointed to the separate treatment of
response costs and ATSDR costs in CERCLA sections 9611(a) and
9611(c).  Noting the fact that the legislative history was silent
as to why the distinction was made, the panel stated its
obligation "to choose the interpretation that is most consistent
with the remainder of the Act."

     Having established that the ATSDR's conduct constituted
removal or remedial action, the Ninth Circuit disposed of HDC's
assertions that the requirements of the Timing of Review
provision were otherwise unsatisfied.  The panel looked to its
1995 holdings in MESS v. Perry (see Hazardous Waste LR, March 1,
1995, P. 28,144) and Razore v. Tulalip Tribes (see Hazardous
Waste LR, Oct. 4, 1995, P. 28,238) in concluding that the HDC's
suit was a "challenge" to the ongoing removal or remediation.

     Tom H. Foulds, Seattle, represents the appellants.

     Elizabeth Ann Peterson of the U.S. Department of Justice,
Environment and Natural Resources Division, Washington, DC,
represents the appellees.

3RD CIR.: NEIGHBORS,
VISITORS TO WASTE SITE
ARE NOT KNOWN CREDITORS

     Neighbors of a dump site contaminated by low-level radiation
were not known creditors and, therefore, the corporate owner of
the sites had no obligation to provide them with actual notice
when it went into bankruptcy, the Third Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals ruled Dec. 18.  Chemetron Corp. v. Jones et al., No. 94-
3371 (3rd Cir.).

     From 1965 to 1975, Chemetron Corp. owned and operated a
manufacturing facility that made an antimony oxide catalyst
utilizing depleted plutonium, as well as a nearby landfill where
it dumped waste products from that manufacturing process in
Cuyahoga Heights, OH.  Chemetron sold the sites in 1975, but was
involved in cleanup efforts between 1980 and 1988 after it was
discovered that the sites were contaminated with radioactive
waste.

     In 1988, Chemetron filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
The court issued a claims bar date order fixing the last day for
creditors to file claims as May 31, 1988.  Chemetron sent the
required actual notice to all of its known creditors and also
voluntarily placed advertisements in the New York Times and Wall
Street Journal in an effort to reach any unknown creditors.

     In 1992, 15 individuals filed suit against Chemetron and its
successors in interest in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common
Pleas claiming to have been injured from exposure to radioactive
and toxic chemicals at the dump site.  Eventually the list of
plaintiffs grew to 21.  Two of the plaintiffs had lived in houses
near the site and the rest were periodic visitors to the houses.

     Chemetron moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that any such
claim had been discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings that
ended in 1990.  The plaintiffs then petitioned the bankruptcy
court to be allowed to file late claims.  In August 1993, the
bankruptcy court granted the petition, finding that the
plaintiffs were known creditors that had been entitled to actual
notice of the proceedings and the claims bar date.  The
bankruptcy court then reserved ruling on the issue of whether the
plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable.

     Chemetron appealed the bankruptcy court ruling to the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which
reversed the bankruptcy court's grant of the motion to file late
claims.  The district court held that the plaintiffs were not
known creditors and that the notice published in the two national
newspapers was sufficient to alert them to the bankruptcy
proceedings.  The district court also ruled, without explanation,
that the plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable and were
discharged as a result of the bankruptcy action.

     The plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit, which affirmed
the district court finding that the plaintiffs are unknown
creditors.  In Tulsa Professional Collection Service Inc. v.
Roper, 485 U.S. 478, 490 (1988), the U.S. Supreme Court
characterized a known creditor as one whose identity is either
known or "reasonably ascertainable by the debtor," Circuit Judge
Jane R. Roth wrote.  Generally, debtors are expected to identify
known creditors through a careful search of their own books and
records and further efforts are not required, she explained.

     In this case, she said, the bankruptcy court replaced the
"reasonably ascertainable" standard with a "reasonably
foreseeable" standard.  Under that test, the bankruptcy court
said Chemetron knew or should have known that it was reasonably
foreseeable that it would suffer claims from individuals living
near the sites, making them known creditors.

     This "reasonably foreseeable" standard is an incorrect rule
of law that imposes an impossible burden on debtors, the Third
Circuit found.  None of the claimants currently lives near the
site and some have moved as far away as Texas.  "We are hard
pressed to conceive of any way the debtor could identify, locate,
and provide actual notice to these claimants," Judge Roth said.

     Having affirmed the district court's ruling that the
plaintiffs were unknown claimants in the bankruptcy action and
that the newspaper notices therefore were sufficient to inform
them of the proceedings, the circuit court found that the
district court erred in failing to consider whether the
plaintiffs' failure to file their claims in a timely manner was
due to "excusable neglect."  The appellate panel remanded that
issue to the district court with instructions to consider the
totality of the circumstances and the potential prejudicial
impact on Chemetron.

               It also vacated the district court's ruling that the
plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable and discharged by the
bankruptcy action and remanded that issue to the bankruptcy
court.  Because the bankruptcy court had postponed ruling on the
issue of discharge, it was not an appealable order and therefore
was not properly before the district court, the Third Circuit
said.

     Circuit Judge H. Lee Sarokin concurred in the judgment but
said that the Third Circuit went too far in discarding the
"reasonably ascertainable" test entirely.  "These tests are not
mutually exclusive, or even at odds.  They address separate
issues," Judge Sarokin wrote.  One has to do with whether a
debtor knew or should have known a claim would be brought while
the other has to do with the debtor's ability to identify a
potential claimant, he said.

     The Jones plaintiffs were represented by William Mitchell
and Deborah J. Papushak of Armstrong, Mitchell & Damiani,
Cleveland.  Chemetron was represented Dennis G. Terez of Squire,
Sanders & Dempsey, Cleveland, and George L. Cass of Buchanan,
Ingersoll, Pittsburgh.

PLAINTIFF IN ILL HEALTH
SEEKS EXPEDITED APPEAL
OF DEFENSE VERDICT

     The plaintiff in a personal injury suit against the owners
and operators of the St. Onofre Nuclear Generating Station
(SONGS) will petition the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
this week for an expedited appeal of a jury verdict in favor of
the defense after losing a bid for a retrial on Dec. 5, according
to his attorney, Don Howarth.   James v. Southern California
Edison Co., No. 94-1085 (SD CA).

     Howarth filed a notice of appeal on Dec. 22.  He said that
his client, Glen James, 63, who is suffering from chronic
myelogenous leukemia, is in rapidly deteriorating health and that
he wants to expedite the appeal on James' behalf "while it may
still do him some good."  James, an engineer, worked at SONGS in
the mid-1980s.

     Howarth moved for a new trial after the eight-person jury
returned a verdict in favor of defendants Southern California
Edison and Combustion Engineering Inc. on Oct. 12.  He argued
that the jury was improperly influenced by the O.J. Simpson trial
and by juror misconduct.

     Howarth argued that the verdict was against the weight of
the evidence, that it was the product of improper passion and
prejudice and that the jury improperly considered extraneous,
prejudicial information.

               According to the motion, one of the jurors, Genevieve
Fitzwater, told the others that she had received radiation
therapy for thyroid cancer and that "it had saved my life."  In
addition, after the jurors were allowed to watch the verdict in
the O.J. Simpson case, Fitzwater also allegedly told the others
that they must apply the same "reasonable doubt" standard used in
the Simpson murder case to the evidence in this case.

     James also alleged that a second juror told a post-verdict
gathering that he had made his mind up for the defense early in
the trial before all of the evidence had been presented and that
he had never wavered in his belief.

     Southern District of California Judge Napoleon Jones Jr.
rejected all of those arguments, finding that under the Federal
Rules of Evidence, most of juror Gregory Hafen's declaration
supporting the allegations of juror misconduct is inadmissible.

     According to Rule 606(b), a juror may not testify to
anything that may have influenced his decision during
deliberations except on the question of whether extraneous
prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's
attention.

     Under that rule, only Fitzwater's statements about her
radiation treatment and applying the reasonable doubt standard
may be admissible if they can be shown to be extraneous
information and prejudicial by a preponderance of the evidence,
Judge Jones said.

     He ruled, however, that Fitzwater's alleged statements about
her radiation treatment are not prejudicial extraneous
information but "are best classified as personal experience
applied to the evidence in the case...."

     Citing to Hard v. Burlington Northern Railroad Co., 870 F.2d
1461 (9th Cir. 1989), Judge Jones said, "The type of after-
acquired information that potentially taints a jury verdict
should be carefully distinguished from the general knowledge,
opinions, feelings and bias that every juror carries into the
jury room."

     In Hard, he said, the Ninth Circuit found that it is
acceptable for a juror to use his own personal experience to
interpret the evidence in a case.  In addition, even if
Fitzwater's statements did constitute impermissible extraneous
information, the plaintiff failed to show prejudice by a
preponderance of the evidence.

     On the reasonable doubt issue, Judge Jones found that such
allegations are not admissible because they constitute testimony
on the mental processes of the jury.  He found no Ninth Circuit
precedence on the issue, but he cited two Fifth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals cases that hold that once a verdict is rendered,
the court may not inquire into the jury's deliberative process to
determine if the jury properly followed the court's instructions
(United States v. D'Angelo, 598 F.2d 1002 [1979] and Robles v.
Exxon Corp., 862 F.2d 1201 [1989]).

     In addition to Howarth, the Jameses are represented by
Suzelle M. Smith of Howarth & Smith in Los Angeles.  Southern
California Edison is represented by Jack Reding of Crosby,

OHIO JUDGE GRANTS J.N.O.V.
TO PLAINTIFFS AFTER JURY
RETURNS DEFENCE VERDICT

     The defendants in a sick building syndrome suit in
Cincinnati filed a notice of appeal Dec. 29, challenging the
trial court's grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict to
four plaintiffs on the issue of negligence after a jury returned
a unanimous verdict in favor of the building's owners.  Beck v.
A & D Limited Partnership et al., No. A-91-06574 (OH C.P. Ct.,
Hamilton Cty.).

     While Common Pleas Judge John W. O'Keefe found that the
evidence overwhelmingly supported a finding of negligence, he
denied the plaintiffs' motion for j.n.o.v. with regard to
punitive damages and also denied their motion for a new trial.
His decision was entered into judgment on Dec. 6.

     (The memorandum specifying grounds for the decision is
available from Andrews Document Access Service.)

     Judge O'Keefe granted j.n.o.v. to plaintiffs Sue Marshall,
Linda Bachman, Karen M. Ringland and Joseph Schwetschenau.  He
denied a motion for j.n.o.v. as to the loss of consortium claims
of Schwetschenau's wife, Dolores, finding that the jury's verdict
on that claim was acceptable.

     The four plaintiffs were sample plaintiffs for some 700
class members who claim that the A & D Building where they work
in Cincinnati caused headaches, fatigue, drowsiness, sore throat,
sinus problems, nausea, dizziness, eye irritation, chest pains,
disorientation, anguish and justifiable apprehension.

     Judge O'Keefe said that the jury should have answered in the
affirmative both Interrogatory 1 (Were the defendants negligent?)
and Interrogatory 2 (Do you find by a preponderance of the
evidence that any defendant breached any lease agreement?).

     "The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that A & D was
unsafe and unsanitary, and the defendants thus were negligent,
and reasonable minds could come to only one conclusion as to
safety and sanitation," he said.

               He cited the testimony of four expert witnesses that
conditions in the building caused human health problems, as well
as two exhibits from the Cincinnati Health Department that
verified the poor indoor air quality as evidence of causation.

     Given his grant of j.n.o.v. on negligence, Judge O'Keefe
denied the plaintiffs' motion for a new trial because, he said,
there is no ground for a new trial unless the j.n.o.v. is
overturned on appeal.  By denying j.n.o.v. on the issue of
punitive damages, Judge O'Keefe said that the jury verdict
denying punitive damages would stand for the entire class of
claimants.

     On the issue of actual damages, Judge O'Keefe ordered a
bench hearing for Jan. 8 to determine the amount of actual
damages.  That hearing has since been postponed pending a
resolution of the appealability of the judge's j.n.o.v. order.
In a footnote, Judge O'Keefe said that "probably there is no
final appealable order until damages are determined and made part
of the Court's ultimate judgment,"  but the notice of appeal
specifically challenges the j.n.o.v.

     The plaintiffs are represented by Louise M. Roselle and
Colleen M. Hegge of Waite, Schneider, Bayless & Chesley and by
William Eric Minamyer of Kepley, MacConnell & Eyrich.  The
defendants are represented by W. John Sellins and A. Dennis
Miller of Droeder & Miller.  All three firms are located in
Cincinnati.

PARENTS OF PRO GOLFER
HEATHER FARR SUE MOTOROLA
FOR WRONGFUL DEATH

     The parents of professional golfer Heather Farr filed suit
against Motorola Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Arizona Nov. 17, alleging that groundwater pollution from
three Phoenix-area Motorola plants caused the breast cancer that
killed Farr in 1993 at the age of 28.  Farr v. Motorola Inc.,
No. 95-2530 PHX-ROS (D AZ).

     The complaint alleges that Motorola has been dumping
trichloroethylene (TCE) and 19 other toxic and hazardous
chemicals into the air and ground since the 1950s and that a
plume of the chemicals seeped into the groundwater that Farr and
hundreds of other people used for drinking water.  It says that
Farr grew up in the vicinity of the plants.  Two of the plants
have been designated as federal Superfund sites, and the third
has been declared a polluted site under Arizona's state anti-
pollution statute.

     Farr was an All-American at Arizona State University before
turning pro and becoming the youngest golfer to qualify for the
LPGA tour in 1986.  She died in November 1993 after undergoing a
mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a bone-marrow
transplant.

     The complaint filed by her parents, Sharon and Gerald D.
Farr, allege wrongful death, negligence, trespass, infliction of
emotional distress, fraudulent concealment/failure to warn and
strict liability.

     According to the complaint, Motorola negligently disposed of
large quantities of toxic chemicals in and around the plants
resulting in bodily harm to Farr.  The company had special
knowledge of the types, amounts, dates and methods of disposal of
the chemicals going back the 1950s, but it failed to warn persons
living near the plants of the potential harm from the dumping and
it made express and implied false representations to conceal the
dangers of the chemicals from the public.

     "Motorola's acts of knowingly and intentionally disposing of
toxic and hazardous substances and wastes into the environment
without proper treatment constitute extreme and outrageous
conduct, which Motorola knew or should have known would cause
severe emotional distress to persons such as the deceased or
acted in reckless disregard of whether such emotional distress
would result," the complaint said.

     The Farrs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages,
attorneys' fees and costs.  The plaintiffs agreed to grant
Motorola an extension to file a motion or answer until Jan. 16

     Lead attorney for the plaintiffs is John M. O'Quinn of
Houston.  They are also represented by Robert H. Hinton of Hinton
& Cox, Houston; Dennis C. Reich of Reich & Binstock, Houston;
Stephanie Shapiro and Elaine Watson of Shapiro & Watson, Houston;
John A. Buttrick and Charles S. Price of Brown & Bain, Phoenix;
and Carl D. Shaw in O'Quinn's Phoenix office.  O'Quinn and Brown
& Bain are also involved in 800 cases brought against Motorola by
neighbors of the three plants.

     Motorola is represented by Garrett B. Johnson in Kirkland &
Ellis's Chicago office; John A. Zackrison in Kirkland & Ellis's
Los Angeles office; and Floyd P. Bienstock of Steptoe & Johnson,
Phoenix.

OCCIDENTAL PAYS $129M
TO CLOSE A CHAPTER
ON LOVE CANAL

     Occidental Chemical Corp. has agreed to pay the U.S.
government $129 million in cleanup costs and interest to settle a
16-year-old suit resulting from decades of pollution at Love
Canal, the incident that spurred Congress to enact the Superfund
Law of 1980.  United States et al. v. Hooker Chemical Corp. et
al., No. 79-CV-990C (WD NY).

     Under the proposed consent decree, announced Dec. 21,
Occidental Chemical Corp. (Oxychem) will pay $102 million to the
Environmental Protection Agency and $28 million to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  FEMA handled the initial
cleanup and relocation of Love Canal residents.

     From 1942 to 1953, Oxychem's corporate predecessor, Hooker
Chemical, dumped an estimated 22,000 tons of toxic chemicals and
hazardous wastes at Love Canal from its Niagara Falls
manufacturing plant.  The site was eventually covered over and
deeded to the City of Niagara Falls.  Homes and a school were
later built on and near it.  Chemicals began seeping into the
houses in the 1970s, sickening residents.  One resident, Lois
Gibbs, led a crusade to expose Hooker's actions and to clean up
the site.

     In 1979, the federal government and New York state brought
suit against Hooker.  The federal government initially sought
compensation of more than $200 million in cleanup costs under
CERCLA, and the state sought $250 million in punitive damages.
Oxychem was held liable in the liability phase of the trial, but
the state's claims for punitive damages were denied.

     In June 1994, Oxychem agreed to pay the state $98 million to
settle the remaining state claims.  The U.S. Army has also agreed
to pay the government $8 million for its share of the costs for
cleaning up hazardous waste that it dumped at the site during
World War II.

     The consent decree, which is expected to receive final
approval in 30 days, eliminates the need for a second trial on
damages.  Under its terms, Oxychem will pay the $129 million in
four installments over three years, beginning three months after
the court grants final approval.

     While the proposed settlement closes out the federal and
state cleanup claims, it does not end the litigation over Love
Canal.  The City of Niagara Falls is seeking $4 million in costs
and interest, and 900 former residents have personal injury
lawsuits still pending.  In the wake of the federal and state
settlements, Niagara Falls expects that it will soon reach a
settlement with the company to end its suit as well.

     In announcing the settlement, U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno called it "the transformation of an environmental disaster
called Love Canal into a success story.  It stands for the
principle that when people make a mess, they should clean it up."

     A spokesman for Occidental Chemical said that the company
has never denied liability, but that the settlement represents a
compromise among the parties on the amount of compensation,
rather than fines or penalties.  The agreement, he said, avoids
having to go through a protracted trial on damages.

     Occidental Chemical is represented by Steven K. Yablonski of
Piper & Marbury, Washington, DC.  The federal government is
represented by Steven Novick and Steven R. Baer of the U.S.
Justice Department, Washington, DC.

CA APP. CT. REVERSES
CARRIER WIN ON
WRONGFUL ENTRY

     The California Court of Appeal, Second District, on Dec. 5
overturned a Los Angeles judge's grant of summary adjudication to
Insurance Co. of North America (INA) on the environmental
coverage demands of Martin Marietta Corp.  Martin Marietta Corp.
et al v. Insurance Co. of North America, No. B084709 (CA
Ct. App., 2nd Dist.).

     The panel found that the policyholder had raised the issue
of potential of coverage for its environmental claims under the
"wrongful entry" provisions of INA's policies.

     Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) named its carriers to
the present action to determine their obligations concerning the
insured's liabilities incurred at multiple Superfund sites.  The
policyholder made claims against INA with respect to the
Stringfellow site and six others across the country.

     INA issued automobile and personal injury coverage to Martin
Marietta from 1968 to 1972; the insured averred that the
"wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of
private occupancy" language provision of the personal injury
provision created the potential of coverage for its environmental
liabilities.  The Los Angeles County Superior Court concluded
that the coverage "for certain damages because of personal injury
cannot reasonably be construed as including government pollution
clean-up claims."

     In its review, the state appellate panel noted INA's
contention that the "wrongful entry" language "provides coverage
only for 'classic landlord/tenant-type disputes.'  Under INA's
interpretation, 'wrongful entry or eviction' refers only to
forcible eviction claims brought by one with a possessory
interest in the land, and 'other invasion of the right of private
occupancy' extends that coverage to claims brought by occupants,
rather than owners."

     The court next looked to state precedent that interpreted
the challenged language outside of the environmental context.
The panel found these cases to establish that "under California
law, the language 'wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion
of the right of private occupancy' is limited to tort claims
relating to the invasion of an interest in real property....
[C]ontrary to INA's argument here, personal injury coverage is
not determined by the nature of the damages sought in the action
against the insured, but by the nature of the claims made against
the insured in that action."

     The court then looked to the February 1994 ruling of the
California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, in Titan Corp. v.
Aetna Casualty, which had refused to find environmental coverage
under the personal injury provision.  "[U]nlike Martin Marietta's
INA policy, the insurance policy under review in Titan Corp.
contained a pollution exclusion which 'unambiguously declared'
that the policy would not pay for either bodily injury or
property damage caused by pollution," wrote the panel.

     The Titan court alternatively reasoned that it is not
"objectively reasonable for an insured to expect personal injury
to mean property damage, or to expect contamination of
groundwater to harm either a private right or an occupancy
right."  The panel here found that this reasoning "seems to
depart from California law."

     After reviewing the federal and out-of-state precedent on
the issue cited by both sides, the panel found them to "lack a
consensus of approach and of result.  Many concern insurance
policies which are in important ways different than the one we
are called on to interpret."

Trespass and Nuisance

     In looking to the language of the policy at hand, the court
stated that it "cannot accept INA's contention that the coverage
clause at issue is limited to 'classic landlord/tenant'
claims....  [I]t seems manifest that 'wrongful entry,' in the
context of torts relating to the invasion of an interest in real
property, includes trespass and may include nuisance, and that a
reasonable insured would so understand the coverage."

     INA averred that neither trespass nor nuisance was
specifically enumerated in the torts listed under the policy; the
panel rejoined that "the language of the policy clearly
encompasses those causes of action, and there is no requirement,
in the policy or in the law, that each covered cause of action be
'specifically enumerated.'"

     The panel cited to an 1885 ruling of the California Supreme
Court that stated that "every wrongful entry upon lands in the
occupation or possession of the owner constitutes a trespass."
The court also noted that it is established in California "that
trespass and nuisance claims may include wrongful entry or
invasion by pollutants....  To agree with INA that 'wrongful
entry' does not include trespass and nuisance claims would fly in
the face of this long-standing law."

               The panel rejected the insurer's contention that a wrongful
entry claim requires proof of forcible entry with intent to
ouster; it was further unmoved by the contention that the
underlying claimant (the government) cannot claim a right of
"occupancy" in the contaminated groundwater.

     "INA has not established that the government is seeking to
enforce only a public or residual interest in groundwater," wrote
the court.  "Instead, the undisputed facts indicate that the
government claims include allegations that pollutants emanating
from Martin Marietta have contaminated the water wells and
groundwater on land owned by individuals, businesses, and,
perhaps, governmental entities."

     The court lastly determined that INA had not met its burden
of showing that it was entitled to summary judgment.  The
underlying claims, wrote the panel, "are based in part on
trespass and nuisance....  [T]he actions [include] allegations of
wrongful entry and of invasions of the right of private occupancy
in real property."

     Kirk A. Pasich, Martin D. Katz and Linda D. Kornfeld of
Troop Meisinger Steuber & Pasich, Los Angeles, represent the
policyholder.

     W. Mark Wood, Martin S. Checov and H. Douglas Galt of
O'Melveny & Myers, Los Angeles, represent the insurer.

SLANTS & TRENDS

FISHER'S VIEWS ON TITLE III:  The pressue on industrial companies resulting
from annual reports of routine toxic releases under the Emergency Planning
and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) will continue to build, said
Environmental Protection Agency Assistant Administrator Linda Fisher.

'MORE AND MORE PEOPLE are paying more attention" to EPCRA because all
companies want their emission numbers to improve year by year, she said
Dec. 15.  "Information in the public's hands is a powerful tool, and it
has allowed, in a sense, industry to fix itself, which is probably a more
effective way than others."

THE LAW HAS BEEN 'VERY EFFECTIVE,' Fisher told TMN.  "When you have the
head of Monsanto or Du Pont or even small companies saying, 'I am making a
concerted effort to change behavior in my plant so we don't emit as much of
a toxic chemical,' that to me is a very postive thing."  Du Pont Inc.
Chairman E.S. Woolard stated Dec. 12 that the company would try to cut
toxic air emissions by 60 percent by 1993 (TMN, Dec. 20, 1989).
Monsanto Co. Chairman Richard J.  Mahoney said June 30, 1988, that the
company would cut toxic emissions world-wide by 90 percent by December
1992.

CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION members are being urged to take part in
the April 22 anniversary celebrations of Earth Day.  CMA is providing
members with ideas for getting their facilities involved in community
activities.  Allied Signal's Fluorine Products Division, Morristown, N.J.,
said it will purchase and donate a siren system to the county, CMA noted in
a release.  The system will be operated through the county emergency
services agency to warn residents of hazardous materials spills, fires and
natural disasters.

SOLKATRONIC CHEMICALS INC., Morrisville, Pa., donated a weather station to
communities surrounding its facility, held a seminar for local officials
on chemical dispersion modeling and donated equipment and funds to the
Bucks County Hazardous Incident Response Team.

NRC REPORTS DOE NUCLEAR SITE WORKERS
AT RISK FROM CHEMICALS AND RADIATION

     Workers at virtually every facility in the Department of Energy's
(DOE) 17-site nuclear weapons complex are at risk due to contamination of
the plants by radioactive and other hazardous materials, says a report
released Dec. 20 by the National Research Council (NRC).

     However, chemical hazards at DOE's weapons plants probably pose the
greatest threat to workers' health, notes "The Nuclear Weapons Complex:
Management for Health, Safety and the Environment."  While substantial
progress has been made in controlling exposure to ionizing radiation, there
appears to be a less than adequate emphasis at DOE's plants on hazards
associated with exposures to chemicals routinely used in industrial
operations, NRC says.  The substances of greatest concern include
beryllium, asbestos, cutting oils, organic solvents and plating solutions.

     "Occupational medical programs within the complex should increase the
emphasis placed on protection of workers from chemicals suspected to be
hazardous at the acute, subacute or chronic level of exposure," NRC
recommends.  The council suggests "removal of the worker from the hazard,
as in the case of pregnant workers," as one type of "control" for handling
toxic materials.  So-called "fetal protection policies" have come under
fire in federal courts as discriminatory (TMN, Nov. 1, 1989).

     The collection of health-related data concerning employees in the
nuclear weapons complex is inadequate with regard to both the kinds of data
collected and how they are stored, NRC says.  To correct the situation, the
report urges DOE to improve monitoring and surveillance programs for
exposure to hazardous substances through the use of standardized protocols
for data collection and analysis.  "In particular, data collected within
the complex should be comprehensive, accessible and comparable," the report
advises.

     NRC also cites as inadequate the fire control programs and the efforts
to control inhalation of radioactive dust by workers.  At least two
facilities have plutonium in their exhaust ducts, it notes.

     Blame for some of the problems lies with DOE's "complex management
structure with ambiguous lines of responsibility and authority," the NRC
says.  The report suggests that safety and other related decisions should
be made "at the lowest possible management levels."  DOE has accumulated a

KENTUCKY'S DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (DEP) has drafted a
comprehensive plan to strengthen environmental regulations.  The proposals
for toxic materials include:  installing air monitoring net?works in
selected areas; requiring waste reduction audits; proposing legislation to
have industry partially fund research on toxic effects; setting up a risk
assessment department in DEP; and monitoring ground water near hazardous
waste sites, land farms and under-ground storage tanks.  The department,
which intends to seek funding this year to implement its plan, also made
enforcement and hazardous waste reduction proposals.  For copies of the
full plan at no charge, write:  Kentucky DEP Deputy Commissioner Russell

SCIENTISTS CHAMPION PERMEABLE ZEOLITE
AS NEW DETECTOR OF TOXIC MATERIALS

     Recent technological breakthroughs in chemical analysis may lead to a
new era of inexpensive, high-speed monitoring of ground water, waste sites
and work places for toxic substances.  Researchers from the University of
New Mexico and the Sandia National Laboratories of Albuquerque, N.M., are
developing new chemical sensors using zeolite, a porous mineral that can
act as a "molecular sieve."

     Using polymers, the zeolite crystals can be arranged so that they act
as highly selective chemical screens, said Thomas Bein, assistant chemistry
profes?sor at the University of New Mexico and a member of the research
team.  These "screens" will allow only a single type of molecule to be
absorbed.  "The concept is very, very general and can be applied to almost
all chemicals," he said.

     Acoustic wave sensors located underneath a thin coating of the
zeolites may enable detection of substances up to the parts-per-billion
level.  This information then would be transmitted to a central control
station without removing the sensor, Bein added.

     This method of chemical monitoring has several advantages, Bein
explained.  Perhaps most importantly, it may allow for continuous and
"almost instantaneous" monitoring that could provide early warnings of
pollution.  It also may eliminate the need for human involvement in
collecting toxic samples.

     The new technology has not yet been tested in the environment.  But
the research team will be working on experimental testing devices aimed at
monitoring halogenated hydrocarbons leaking from waste dumps, Bein said.
The research group hopes to test a number of different zeolites and develop
a data bank about the different sensors.  The project is sponsored by an
Energy Department program that encourages cooperation between New Mexico
academic institutions and the two national laboratories in the state.  The
National Science Foundation provided funding for the sensor project, which
started about 30 months ago, Bein added.

     The research group's findings were presented Dec. 18 in a paper,
"Molecular Sieve Sensors for Selective Operation at the Nanogram Level," at
the 1989 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies in
Honolulu.  For more information, contact Bein at 505/277-4935 or the
American Chemical Society at 202/872-4600.

FISHER SEES IMPORTANT ROLE FOR
INTERNATIONAL CHEMICAL TESTING

     A recent international agreement to test 150 industrial chemicals won
praise as an "interesting and important development in chemical testing and
con-trol" from Linda Fisher, the Environmental Protection Agency's
assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances.

     She cited this pact, under which member nations of the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreed to
determine the chemicals' adverse effects by 1994, as one of her three
priorities for administering the Toxic Substances Control Act.  (For
details on the OECD agreement, see TMN, Nov. 22, 1989).  The others
are pollution prevention, which is being pushed across-the-board by
Administrator William Reilly, and developing a strategic plan for the
Office of Toxic Substances.

     "My [overall] priority is to take advantage of those three activities
to target, perhaps, some new approaches to TSCA -- to build on what's going
on in the international community, to take a look at how we can use TSCA to
bring about pollution prevention or better management of chemicals, and to
use the strategic plans," she told TMN in a Dec. 15 interview.

     EPA also is "looking at an initiative under [TSCA] Section 8(e) to
identify ... in industries' minds more clearly their responsibility under
that section to report to us adverse effect findings in their [chemical]
studies," Fisher said, although she provided no timetable for a possible
proposal.

EPA TO ASSESS PCB CONTAMINATION
IN HUDSON RIVER, AGENCY SAYS

     Environmental Protection Agency officials in New York City have
released plans to re-evaluate the pollution on the bottom of the Hudson
River by polychlorinated biphenyl wastes from two General Electric Corp.
plants.  The agency's Region 2 said there would be a "reassessment of
whether further cleanup activities should now appropriately be taken under
the Superfund program."

     The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has been
using a demonstration program involving the dredging of the PCB sediments
from the river and capping them in an aboveground landfill with a $20
million federal grant under the Clean Water Act.

     "EPA has decided to reassess the 1984 decision in light of additional
data developed by New York state with respect to the movement and
persistence of the PCBs in the sediments, and in recognition of recent
advances in PCB-destruction technologies such as incineration," the agency
said.  "EPA's reassessment will be carried out independently of the DEC
[capping] plan."

     But $17 million of the grant will be redirected to support New York's
wastewater treatment programs due to delays in building a landfill for the
river sediment.  "The [state] project has not moved forward as planned
because of difficulties in siting the landfill," said EPA.

     PCB wastes were released into the river in 1973 by two GE facilities
in Fort Edward, N.Y.  In 1984, EPA signed a Superfund "record of decision"
that postponed the removal of PCB-contaminated sediment from the river
bottom.  A cleanup plan calls for PCBs on the river bank to be capped in
place temporarily.

STUDY FINDS LINGERING POLLUTION
IN MIDWEST FARM-STATE STREAMS

     Toxic herbicides were found in more than half of 155 Midwestern
streams tested early last spring, the time of year when contamination
levels should be lowest, a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) study showed.

     Although fields had not been treated since the previous growing year,
55 percent of the streams tested in 10 farm states still had measurable
levels of herbicides such as atrazine and alachlor, both widely used on
corn and soybeans to control weeds.  A second round of sampling conducted
in May and June -- after fresh applications of herbicides -- found 90
percent of the streams had detect-able contamination and dozens of samples
exceeded federal health advisory standards for such residues.

     Donald Goolsby, lead study author and USGS's water quality specialist
for the central United States, said his sampling team expected to find some
contamination, but not as mush as they did.  "The surprise was the large
and widespread concentrations," he explained.  "These herbicides have been
detected before in streams in agricultural states, but we do not know of
any reports of the wide-spread occurrences found in our study."

     Agricultural chemicals should be at their lowest concentrations in the
environment in the spring, Goolsby said, speculating that the springtime
contamination may be the result of streams tapping ground water
reservoirs, where herbicide residues can persist for six months or longer.
Another explanation, he observed last week, might be related to the general
drought conditions in the Midwest over the past few years.

     "It's possible there has not been sufficient rainfall to flush them
[herbicides] from the fields," he said.  The stream contamination "could
be coming from the previous year's application."

     The study tested streams in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.  Those
states were chosen because they account for 60 percent of all pesticide use
in the country and produce 75 percent of the nation's corn and 60 percent
of its soybeans.

     The second round of stream testing, conducted after springtime field
spraying, found dozens of samples had concentrations of herbicide residues
above federal health advisory levels.  Of the 127 samples, 71 exceeded the
Environmental Protection Agency's health advisory level for atrazine and 44
were higher than EPA's proposed drinking water standard for alachlor.  EPA
has classified alachlor as a probable human carcinogen and atrazine as a
possible human carcinogen (Canada has banned alachlor).  The geological
survey's study was not designed to test drinking water, Goolsby noted,
although some of the sampling sites were up-stream of public water intakes.

     In addition to its unprecedented scope, the study was innovative
because it used a new enzyme-based immunoassay method for detecting
herbicide residues in water, Goolsby said.  The new method is much faster
and cheaper than the traditional gas chromotography detection technique,
and, if verified as accurate, could have a major impact on environmental
science, he said.  The immunoassay method has been used primarily in
medical research.  The USGS study team currently is analyzing a third
round of water samples collected in the late fall, when water flow
generally is lowest and streams are being fed largely by ground water.
Results from this round of testing are due this month.

BOOK DETAILS ISSUES OF
DISASTROUS AIR TOXICS RELEASES

     Noyes Data Corp. of Park Ridge, New Jersey, has published a manual
called Accidental Releases of Air Toxics that compiles "the technical
information that is necessary for developing approaches to preventing and
controlling accidental releases."  The 649-page volume offers a brief
history of toxic chemical re?leases, an overview of the accidental release
problem, methods commonly used in hazard identification and evaluation, and
a summary of the general principles of hazard control.

     The book, written by six analysts from the Radian Corp. of Austin,
Texas, also identifies primary industrial chemicals of concern and
discusses fundamental causes of toxic releases.

     A major section of the manual addresses "prevention technologies,"
with chapters on process design considerations, physical plant design
considerations, and protection technologies such as flares, scrubbers, and
enclosures.  A section on "mitigation measures" features reports on
emergency planning and training, facility layout, detection systems, vapor
dispersion modeling, meteorological instrumentation, and secondary
containment.

     "Costs of identification, evaluation, inspection, and control
technologies can be used to roughly estimate costs of various programs for
accidental release prevention and control by either regulatory agencies or
companies," the authors state in a chapter entitled "Cost Implications for
Policy Planning." The book presents data and methodologies "to provide
companies with a rough measure of cost impacts of various process control
options."

     Accidental Releases of Air Toxics is available from Noyes
Publications, Mill Road at Grand Ave., Park Ridge, N.J. 07656.  The cost is
$86.

COURT ORDERS TRIPLE DAMAGES
FOR CLEANUP OF PCB WASTES

     A North Carolina man and his son have been ordered by a federal judge
to pay the federal government three times its costs of cleaning up
polychlorinated biphenyl wastes at a Fayetteville site.

     The Environmental Protection Agency spent $268,000 from Superfund to
remove PCB wastes from a former transformer reclamation site owned by Dewey
Strother of Fayetteville.  A federal district court has ordered Strother
and his son Kenneth to pay $804,000 under Section 107 of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.

     In addition, the Strothers must pay a fine of $78,000, or three times
the $26,000 civil penalty assessed against them in 1984 for violating the
Toxic Substances Control Act.  The two men also must reimburse the
government three times all future cleanup costs at the site and three times
the government's legal costs, the Justice Department said.

STATE COURT THROWS OUT N.Y. RULE
ON POSTED PESTICIDE WARNINGS

     A controversial New York regulation that would require farms, hotels,
offices, residential buildings and restaurants to post notices before and
after pesticide use was rejected Dec. 21 by the Appellate Division of the
New York State Supreme Court.  Several groups representing the affected
industries sued the state over the proposed rule.

     The rule could not go into effect because the state Department of
Environmental Conservation had not not fully assessed the environmental
impact of the regulation, as required by law, the court said.  The court
also ruled that the DEC did not file the regulations on time.  Under the
decision, the department may have to repeat the public hearing process for
the regulation.

     State officials have not yet decided whether to appeal the decision to
New York's highest court, said R.W. Groneman, a DEC spokesman.  DEC did not
prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the rule because state
officials felt it would "have little or no adverse effect on the
environment."

     Agriculture groups, however, said the posting of signs might impede
farmers from using integrated pest management (IPM), which relies on the
quick and judicious use of chemicals.  Since the final version of the rules
would require only four hours' notice, instead of the 24-hour notice
originally proposed, DEC does not feel the law would impeded IPM, Groneman
said.

     But the court agreed with the farm groups.  "While it is true that DEC
may have considered the IPM program in promulgating the regulations, the
evidence in the record decisively demonstrates that the regulations would
have a major adverse impact on the IPM program, that DEC knew of this
evidence and that, therefore, an EIS was required to explore the entire
issue thoroughly," Justice Norman Harvey wrote in his opinion for the court
(his emphasis).

     DEC continues to support the concept behind the regulations, which
would require commercial establishments and farms to post notices informing
the public a few hours before pesticides are used and keep the notices
posted up to a full day after they are applied, Groneman said.  "The public
has a right to know about these dangerous chemicals that are, quite
frankly, used to kill things," he said, adding that this information can
mean "life or death" to allergic individuals.  Hotel and restaurant groups
had argued the signs would discourage business, but the state maintains the
public would quickly become acclimated to the notices, Groneman added.

THE UNITED STATES indicted 101 corporations and individuals for
environmental crimes in 1989, the Justice Department said last week.  This
is a slight decline in the number of indictments obtained in the previous
two years, however.  There were 127 indictments in 1987 and 124 in 1988,
the department said.  Government prosecutors negotiated guilty pleas or won
convictions in 107 cases.  The convictions and pleas resulted in individual
defendants being sentenced to a total of 37 years in prison.  The courts
assessed fines totaling $13 million.  The government has obtained
convictions or guilty pleas against 127 corporations and 305 individuals
since 1983.  The individuals have been sentenced to a total of 270 years in
prison, the department said.  It assessed criminal fines of more than $26
million since 1983, the first full year of operations for the Justice
Department's environmental crimes section.

discharged improperly treated wastewater into a creek 210 times, exceeding
its permit limits for iron, lead, cyanide, chromium and acute toxicity,
charged state environmental Commissioner Christopher Daggett.  The

permit limits or to direct its discharge" to the local sewerage plant, said
Eric Evenson, the department's acting director of water resources.  The
department had referred the allegations to the state's attorney general,
whose interest led EPC to start releasing the most toxic portion of its
waste stream into a mobile storage tank for disposal at a permitted
facility.  But the temporary measure was not enough to head off the
fine -- the second largest ever im?posed by the department.  EPC may request

allegations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that the
company's Palmerton, Pa., metal extracting operations violated OSHA's lead
standard and other safety and health requirements.  Under the agreement
reached last month, the company and the United Steelworkers of America
jointly will conduct a training program on lead hazards for all management
and hourly employees, OSHA said.  The  union will select a physician to
review the medical records of employees who may have been exposed to lead.
The company also must consult and cooperate with the union in revising the

controls to address issues raised in the citations.  The agreement includes
these allegedly "willful" violations:  over-exposures to lead; improper
respirator selections; lack of engineering controls for lead; defective
lead medical monitoring and removal programs; and failure to provide
protective clothing.  The company must correct cited violations by June 30.
OSHA defines a willful violation "as one in which an employer either knew
that a condition constituted a violation or was aware that a hazardous
condition existed and made no reasonable effort to correct it."  OSHA
originally proposed fining Zinc Corp.  $1.9 million last March for 295
alleged willful violations of the lead standard.

Technology (HCET) at Florida International University (FIU) is seeking 
qualified suppliers to conduct an engineering study for the comparative 
analysis of surface removal decontamination technologies for concrete 
floors. The study is being performed to support the U.S. Department of 
Energy. The study will be conducted at the campus of FIU in Miami, 
Florida. Each technology will be tested by removing one inch of 
concrete from a coated and a noncoated concrete floor. The operating 
time will provide sufficient time to collect the operational and safety 
information required to evaluate each technology. Additional data will 
be collected on the capital costs, maintenance costs, and equipment 
staging/destaging costs. The surrogate includes concrete pad twenty 
feet by forty feet surrounded by a six inch high dike. Half of this 
area (twenty feet by twenty feet) will be coated with epoxy urethane. 
The surrogate will not be radiologically contaminated.  The 
technologies for inclusion in the study are: ultra high pressure water 
(greater than or equal to 15,000 pounds per square inch (psi)), 
milling, scabbling, centrifugal shot blasting, and steel grit blasting. 
The qualified suppliers will be asked to optimize the operation of the 
technology as it is applied to each surrogate. The qualified firms 
shall have five years minimum experience in nuclear decontamination and 
two years minimum operations experience with the given technology. The 
qualified firms are to provide references of nuclear decontamination 
jobs completed. Qualified firms shall also state the maximum depth of 
concrete removal in a single application. Interested firms should send 
a Letter of Qualification stating how the firm meets the minimum 
requirements, including address, contact, telephone and fax numbers to

Poc Contact Carla Pickering, Purchasing Agent, (801) 524-3555, 
Technical Contact, Bob Norman (970) 248-0634 This procurement is a 
attempt to sole source to Lotek Engineering Inc. Lotek Engineering has 
developed a digitally encoded radio system that has the design features 
unavailable from other manufacturers. The encoding system use a pulse 
coded design that allows up to 100 tags to be used simultaneously per 
frequency. Under this system, qualification of codes by pulse width is 
no longer necessary, thus enhancing the ability to accurately identify 
each individual fish. The power savings inherent in this design is used 
for: higher peak outputs (thereby increasing range) and producing a 
smaller size tag with longer operational life. Using the smallest tag 
available (with maximum range of tag life) is essential when implanting 
these tags in endangered fish. Another advantage of this encoding 
design is the use of different pulse codes under one frequency 
eliminates sequential scanning of different frequencies; therefore, 
increasing accuracy by eliminating delays in scan time. The pulse coded 
radio system has features critical to the application at Redlands Fish 
Ladder. Lotek Engineering Inc., is the only manufacturer of this type 
of equipment. ITEM NO. 1. SRX_400*, Configuration #3C Telemetry

CANADA: OCCUPANT PROTECTION SYSTEMS The following notification 

CANADA: OCCUPANT PROTECTION SYSTEMS The following notification 
is being circulated in accordance with Article 10.6. G/TBT/Notif. 
95.354. 1. Member to Agreement notifying: CANADA. If applicable, 
name of local government involved (Articles 3.2 and 7.2): 2. Agency 
responsible: Department of Transport. 3. Notified under Article 
2.9.2. 4. Products covered (HS or CCCN where applicable, otherwise 
national tariff heading. ICS numbers may be provided in addition, 
where applicable): Occupant protection systems. 5. Title and number 
of pages of the notified document: Proposed Amendment to the Motor 
Vehicle Safety Regulations (pages 4131-4160). 6. Description of 
content: Modern technology offers two types of occupant restraint 
system: primary and supplemental. The manual three-point seat-belt 
system, which consists of a combined lap and shoulder belt anchored 
to the vehicle in three locations, offers primary protection in 
that it restrains the wearer and prevents the occupant from being 
ejected from the vehicle. Air bags, which are usually installed at 
both the driver and passenger seating positions and automatically 
deploy in the event of an accident, are designed to offer 
supplemental protection to the head, neck and chest. Manual 
seat-belt and air-bag systems are also classified as providing 
either active or passive protection because seat-belts must be 
engaged by the occupant while air bags inflate on their own. 
Research indicates that if certain design refinements made to 
occupant protection systems over the last decade were available on 
all vehicles, many of the head, chest, and abdominal injuries that 
occur on Canadian roadways could be avoided. (1) It is now possible 
to prevent the driver's head from hitting the steering assembly; to 
significantly reduce the force of head impacts with the A-pillars, 
dashboard, and windshield; and to minimize the chest and abdominal 
injuries caused by incorrectly positioned seat-belts. (2) Many 
currently available occupant restraint systems already offer such 
protection; however, in order to ensure that all seat-belt and 
air-bag systems provide the highest practicable margin of safety, 
it is necessary that the legislation governing these systems be 
kept current. 7. Objective and rationale: Protection of human 
safety. 8. Relevant documents: Canada Gazette, Part I, 2 December 
1995. 9. Proposed date of adoption and entry into force: 1 
September 1997. 10. Final date for comments: 1 March 1996. (363)

Du Pont enters military graphics market

     At a time when longtime defense contractors are rushing for
the Pentagon exit, one of America's biggest companies is knocking
on the front door.
     E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co. of Wilmington, Del., is
getting into the defense computer graphics business as part of
its effort in electronic imaging. The company had sales of almost
$33 billion last year, and profits of more than $2 billion.
     Very little of Du Pont's total sales come from the federal
marketplace. However, the huge company could eventually make a
splash in the defense computer graphics world.
     "We are the biggest electronic imaging firm in the world
today as a result of acquisitions," says Jim Kelley, Manager of
the Federal Systems Group of Du Pont's Electronic Imaging
Division.
     Kelley and his team of eight marketeers in Reston, Va., have
studied and canvassed the federal marketplace for the last year.
As yet, they have no defense contracts.
     They're not worried.
Management sets long-term goal
     "Our management has asked us to set up an office and
determine the possibilities," Kelley said. "They have not given
us a financial target.
     "We are still assessing the market."
     Du Pont's Electronic Imaging Division has 800 employees in
Wilmington. In addition, the division owns several other
companies, including CAMEX, a Boston-based company with products
in the newspaper publishing market, and ImagiTex, a New Hampshire
company that makes monochrome scanning systems.
     Du Pont and Fuji Photo of Japan jointly own Crosfield
Electronics, a British company in the field of color electronic
imaging.
     The company also owns most of the stock of benchMark
Technologies, a British company which supplies graphic
accelerators and other high-speed processing systems. Du Pont
changed benchMark's name to Du Pont Pixel Systems.
Graphics key in spy photos
     The Du Pont products form a complete product line in high-
end electronic imagery. The company is not interested in desktop
publishing, which is spreading like a lava flow throughout the
federal government.
     The federal government does little color printing. However,
color graphics computers are very useful in satellite photo
work, simulation and training.
     Kelley is optimistic about the prospects for using Du Pont
Pixel computers for processing color images as a part of larger
systems that work with spy photos.
     Du Pont's role in the field would be to sell the British
computers to systems integration companies in the federal color
graphics business.
     Kelley is optimistic about the intelligence community as a
market in part because it is not hampered by the restrictions
imposed on the rest of the government by Title 44, the basic law
of the Government Printing Office.
     Title 44 forces most federal agencies to go outside for
color image processing and printing. However, the Central
Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and other bodies
in the intelligence community are free to seek the best-quality,
frequently most expensive systems to manipulate color images.
     The Du Pont equipment is not cheap. Many of the products
cost more than $100,000 and go up to $250,000 or more.
     Kelley says he is confident that Du Pont's stature as a
wealthy company that can afford to support a long-term effort in
the field will help him sell computers.
     In a field where many companies are fast-moving,
entrepreneurial and innovative developers in a rapidly-changing
technology-driven market, Du Pont stands as a 500-lb. gorilla
that can afford to wait for profits. The staying power of the
company reassures customers who fear being abandoned by smaller
fry who might go under, Kelley said.
     One of the products in the Du Pont Pixel line is the GIP
graphics and image processing system. It is a series of board and
system level products for use in very high performance graphics
and image processing applications such as command and control.
     GIP offers multiple on-screen images, odd-sized and odd-
shaped windows, and a very large image memory of 640 megabytes.
It runs at 20 million instructions per second as a bit-slice
processor and uses an unusual 160 bit-microcode word.
     The machine could be used by the military as part of a
command and control system that would use digital map displays
with overlays that required rapid updating and extensive storage
and retrieval.

More computer spending waste found

     Billions of wasted dollars is all the Pentagon has to show
for many of its computer projects, according to the General
Accounting Office.
     The congressional watchdog agency blasted the Pentagon for
management bungling which led to design flaws, misjudgements in
requirements, and sloppy accounting.
     Computer spending waste has resulted in the government
lacking the internal control and accounting systems needed to run
programs and safeguard assets, GAO found.
     "Many of the weaknesses are long-standing and have resulted
in billions of dollars of losses and wasteful spending," the
agency said. "Major government scandals and system breakdowns
serve to reinforce the public's perception that the federal
government is poorly managed, with little or no control over its
activities.
     "Top level officials must provide leadership if this
situation is ever to change.
     For example, the Pentagon owns $29 billion of needless spare
parts because of poor inventory controls. That figure has
increased from $10 billion in 1980.
     The Pentagon has also botched its method of furnishing
equipment for use by contractors.
     The Army has no way of telling what happens to $2 billion of
government furnished material in the hands of contractors.
     "These control weaknesses offer the potential for fraud,
waste and abuse of government furnished materials," the agency
said. The Defense Dept. agreed with GAO.
     U.S. taxpayers may also have to give millions of dollars to
foreign governments because of foulups in the Foreign Military
Sales Trust fund. The Pentagon has known about the problem for 10
years but failed to solve it.
     After six years of fruitless efforts to clean up the mess in
the overseas sales program, the Pentagon took responsibility for
system development efforts away from the Defense Security
Assistance Agency and gave it to the Air Force.
     The agency's report on computer waste was titled "Financial
Integrity Act: Inadequate Controls Result in Ineffective Federal
Programs and Billions in Losses."

Slow memory bedevils optical computing

     NEW ORLEANSOptical computing, a promising new
defense technology that has yet to bear full fruit, apparently is
hampered by memory problems.
     "Holograms are still slow. That is one thing that will
either make or break optical computers in general," Mustafa
Abushagur, with the University of Alabama - Huntsville's
electrical and computer engineering department told a laser
conference here last week.
     But if the speed can be increased, optical memory offers
several advantages including higher storage density because laser
precision allows the optical bits to be much smaller. In
addition, optical recording is less sensitive to deterioration or
contamination and less susceptible to head crashing.
Japanese press technology
     Substituting for well known UAH optical computer expert
John Caulfield, who was ill, Abushagur told the LASERS' 89
conference here that the Japanese are working hard on optical
computing and the first applications have come from Japan. "They
are calling optics the technology of the 21st century," he said.
     Abushagur said optical computing in 1989 is comparable to
where electronic computing was in 1949, just before that
technology took off. "It's poorly developed, unreliable,
unstandardized and expensive." He said optics will not replace
electronics but rather complement it.
     He said optical computer researchers' immediate goal is to
make electronic computers faster -- to push the limits of
electronics. Other goals are to develop an optical supercomputer
and exploit the physical differences between optical and
electronic computers to make hybrid systems.
Hybrid computing seen
     Abushagur said near-term applications of optical computing
technology include optical data storage, local area networks, and
optical buses. The major mid-term application is development of
hybrid optical-electronic computers.
     In the long-term, researchers will have to design "new and
different architecture because optics are different and can't
have existing electronic architectures. You have to design and
think differently."
     Researchers are working on both distributed and
multiprocessor architectures.
     He said optical interconnections could range from
machine-to-machine to gate-to-gate and could include the
interconnection of machines, modules, backplanes, boards, chips
and gates. The use of holographic chip connections offers the
potential of changing the computer's architecture just by
changing the hologram connections. "It can be dynamically
changing and continue to function," he said.

Soviets seek software exports

     The Soviets are looking for ways to gain hard currency and
establish themselves as producers of quality software.
     The Space Research Institute of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences is marketing programs for calculating the non-perturbed
(Keplerian) or osculating perturbed motions of planets, moons,
and stars. The software runs under the MS-DOS operating system.
     Keplerian calculations of the motion of celestial bodies are
based on 17th century mathematics. Figuring the perturbed motions
of planets takes into account the complex gravitational effects
of other nearby planets and moons.
     Such software should be approached carefully, however. In
the 1988 Soviet mission to Phobos, a moon of Mars, software
problems cropped up. A ground controller sent the wrong command
to one of two probes; the spacecraft moved to a position from
which it could no longer be controlled.
     The Academy has used the programs to help in design,
navigation and dynamic calculation tasks for the Vega mission to
Halley's Comet and an X-ray emission experiment on the Mir space
station.
     The Space Research Institute also hawks a video data
processing package called SVIT which requires a patented display
terminal. The processor is used for standard image processing
jobs like filtering, quality control, statistical analysis,
segmentation, and classification. The institute received as many
as 300 orders for the system at the Scientific and Technological
Progress Exhibition in Moscow in 1988.
Siberians probe signal processing
     The Computing Center of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences offers the LIBRA-3 library of programs for
use in solving complex problems in mathematical interpolation,
and smoothing of functions of several variables on regular and
random grids, and for signal processing.
     Signal processing extremely important in military computing,
for target recognition and command and control tasks.
     LIBRA-3 is said to be fast because of recent mathematical
advances, and to be suited for many applications in the basic
sciences.
     LIBRA-3 has been used to reconstruct surfaces from
altimetric data, to deblur satellite imagery (smile, U.S.
sunbathers!), and in meteorology. Czechoslovakian, Bulgarian, and
French researchers already use the software package.
ICL to computerize Soviet merchantmen
     Despite their ability to develop some advanced software
packages, the Soviets still lack a broad enough hardware and
software base to meet their needs.
     Britain's ICL and the Central Scientific Research Institute
of the (vast) Merchant Fleet agreed in Dec. 1988 to form a joint
venture to computerize Soviet ships over a three-year period.
     ICL spokesperson Ken Howe in London said ICL will provide
kits that the Soviets will assemble into PCs in Leningrad. The
Leningrad factory, established together with Leningrad local
authorities, will also house software development teams.
     Service centers for the PCs and software will be established
in Vladivostok, Odessa, and Moscow.
     Shipboard computers and control technology will be installed
to run the ASU-Sudno (automated control and management system)
for approximately 600 vessels.
Technology advances but problems remain
     The Soviets have developed a new multiprocessor called the
PS 2100, which reportedly operates in the one billion operations
per second range.
     The new machine replaces the PS 2000, which runs at 200
million operations per second.
     While the new development could signal that Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's call for a revolution in information
technology is finally focusing Soviet efforts on the
supercomputer field.
     Mass production of computers in the country is, however,
still hampered by the traditional academic approach which leads
to mismatches between the intentions of designers and the needs
of computer users in the industrial sector of the Soviet planned
economy.

jamming enemy signals and foiling electronic attacks, has become
a multibillion-dollar contracting opportunity the past 40 years.
     But when war breaks out, such expensive equipment sometimes
goes by the boards.
     Panamanian fugitive Manuel Noriega tried to counter the
U.S. offensive against his cocaine-financed forces by issuing a
rallying cry on the radio.
     U.S. troops, seeking to counter Noriega's counteroffensive,
decided to disable the transmission equipment after he finished.
     Instead of turning on massive jammers, they simply blew up
the transmission equipment at the radio station east of Panama
City.
     The tactic squelched the former dictator's propaganda
without using complex computing equipment.
     Defense Sec. Richard Cheney said the station had not been
seized early in the Just Cause operation because U.S. planners
gave it a low priority.
     Generations of South American coup perpetrators have known
that taking over the telephone exchange and radio station, as
well as the army barracks and the airport, can give attackers
virtual control of a small country.

     TRW dials for dollars. Getting a requirements

     TRW dials for dollars. Getting a requirements
contract can be a mixed blessing. While the contract figures can
be big, the money doesn't roll in until customers in the military
actually order the equipment. The people who decide whether and
what to buy can be spread through out the Pentagon and reaching
them to urge them to buy can be a daunting task.
     Joseph Aro, manager of marketing for TRW's networks
division, has found a successful way to increase sales under the
ULANA contract. ULANA, which stands for Unified Local Area
Network Architecture, is a large Air Force contract for systems
to link computers in offices and other facilities.
     "Since June we have used telemarketing into the federal
government," Aro said. "We have identified 109 air bases
domestically.
     "We have a database of 20,000 names. Ten thousand of them
are 'qualified.'" Qualified names are people in the military whom
Aro's telemarketing team has talked to.
     Aro refers to the decision makers his telemarketing staff
reaches as "breathers," as compared to non-breathing fax machines
and wrong numbers.
     The telemarketing program appears to be increasing sales of
the TRW systems. Aro's group is shipping 1500 LAN cards per
month, he said.
     Aro said he expects the three-year buying window for the
contract will be extended by the government. The ULANA contract
was jointly awarded to TRW and EDS, the General Motors subsidiary
that was founded by Ross Perot, who since has left.
     TRW appears to be having more success in actually shipping
ULANA products than EDS.
     In addition to the outgoing telemarketing sales program, TRW
is using ingoing telephone lines to service ULANA customers.
Callers who cannot be helped by the customer service staff are
referred to an engineer.
     Aro's extensive contacts with military buyers of computers
lends weight to his assessment of their views of coming defense
cuts. He says the military is divided in two groups.
     One group fears the budget cuts. "The more skittish believe
anybody can lose their job. They think they might be driving a
truck (soon).
     "Others are charging ahead to get the job done."
     Managers of large defense computing projects, in particular,
are not worried, he added.
     "In hard times, the stronger companies can make it."
     TRW hopes to expand its LAN sales into the commercial
market. It is not a player in the commercial market now. But
corporate executives believe their quality equipment and
marketing skills will lead to profits in the non-military field.
     The founder and motive force behind the division is Edward
Simpson, who is the vice president and general manager of the
growing division. He holds a doctorate from MIT and spent 15
years in the Navy.

ARMY COMPLETES BRIDGE ACROSS SAVA RIVER

     The U.S. Army completed construction of a bridge across the
Sava River in Bosnia Sunday, opening the gateway for armored forces
to occupy northeastern Bosnia.
     Bad weather and flooding during the past week had bedeviled
Army engineers, who had initially planned to complete the bridge by
Christmas Day. The setbacks in crossing the river were frustrating
Army commanders, and leading to suggestions of a U.S. deployment
into Bosnia that was less than the swift show of force promised by
the Pentagon.
     By Sunday night, 148 vehicles and more than 500 soldiers had
crossed the river, including 12 70-ton Abrams tanks -- the first on
Bosnian soil -- and 41 Bradley Fighting Vehicles of the 1st
Squadron of the 1st Cavalry Regiment. The armored vehicles,
escorted by helicopters, rolled south into the strategic Posavina
corridor connecting the two large Serb-held portions of Bosnia.
     The Sava bridge is the link between U.S. supply bases in
Germany and the American headquarters of NATO in the northern
Bosnian town of Tuzla. Although some 1,500 soldiers and thousands
of tons of equipment had been flown into Tuzla, spanning the Sava
was key to bringing most of the 400 armored vehicles needed to
patrol the sector and to separate the warring factions.
     According to yesterday's edition of The Washington Post,
engineers will start work next week on a second bridge to permit
two-way traffic across the Sava.
     "This is one step. We have many more to go," said Brig. Gen.
James P. O'Neal, the assistant division commander. "Now comes the
real hard work in setting in motion the two bridges and keeping the
whole flow moving. This is the showcase, but it's just the front
end."

DEFENSE SECRETARY TO VISIT UKRAINE FOR DISARMAMENT DEMONSTRATION

     Defense Secretary William Perry will visit American troops in
Italy and Hungary today at the start of a week-long trip that will
take him to Bosnia, Ukraine and the Middle East.
     On Friday, he joins defense ministers Valery Shmarov of
Ukraine and Pavel Grachev of Russia in blowing up an SS-19
intercontinental missile silo at the former Soviet missile base at
Pervomaisk, Ukraine.
       The three will also hold talks which could include the rift
between Ukraine and Russia over control of the former Soviet Black
Sea fleet.
     It will be Perry's third trip to Pervomaisk, reports Reuters.
Since becoming secretary in 1994, he has made repeated visits to
Ukraine and other former Soviet nuclear states to encourage their
march toward non-nuclear status.
     "This visit is a truly historic occasion," a senior U.S.
defense official told reporters of the Ukraine meeting with Shmarov
and Grachev. He noted that both Russia and Ukraine--former Cold War
foes of NATO - were Bosnia peacekeepers and that the U.S. was
providing funds to help dismantle the missile base.
     The official estimated that 70 percent of the strategic
nuclear warheads in Ukraine have now been transferred to Russia and
that over two-thirds of the ICBM's in Ukraine have been removed
from their silos.
     The tripartite silo destruction is being funded by Nunn-Lugar
Threat Reduction Program funds, of which Ukraine has received
almost $350 million.

ADMIRAL ARLEIGH BURKE DIES

     Retired Adm. Arleigh Burke, former chief of naval operations
and military leader, died yesterday at age 94.
     Renowned for the speed of his Pacific destroyer squadron,
Burke served an unprecedented three terms as chief of naval
operations in a military career that spanned the ages of cavalry
horse and atomic bomb.
     The Associated Press notes that with the commissioning of the
USS Arleigh Burke in 1991, he became one of the few men to have a
Navy ship - and at the same time the Navy's most modern destroyer
class - named after him while still living.
     As President Eisenhower's naval operations chief Burke pushed
for new anti-submarine technology, development of Polaris missiles,
and building up allied navies, including Japan's.

PRESIDENT VETOES DEFENSE BILL, OBJECTS TO ABM LANGUAGE

     President Clinton vetoed a $265 billion defense bill last
Thursday, saying it would waste money on an unneeded missile
defense system.
     In his veto message, Clinton said he particularly objected to
an attempt in the bill by congressional Republicans to compel him
to build and deploy a national system of defenses against ballistic
missile attack by 2003.
     Clinton said building such a system now would violate the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia and harm arms control
efforts. The bill would have authorized $820 million in 1996 for
the national missile defense program, $450 million more than the
administration requested.
     At $265 billion, the measure is only slightly larger than last
year's defense bill. It is, however, $7 billion more than Clinton
requested.  Defense Secretary William Perry recommended the veto,
primarily because of what he considers the wrongheaded missile
defense provision.
     From the outset, Clinton opposed policy language in the bill
requiring the military to build a system designed to defend U.S.
territory against potential attack from missiles. He said it would
jeopardize continued Russian implementation of the START I nuclear
disarmament accord as well as Russian ratification of START II,
which has not been ratified by the U.S. Congress either.
     In announcing the veto, Clinton also issued an executive order
raising military pay by 2 percent.  The Associated Press reports he
also asked Congress to quickly pass legislation bringing the total
pay raise to 2.4 percent, the amount contained in the vetoed bill.

REJECTION OF COMMERCE SPENDING BILL PRESERVES SOME HOPE FOR ATP

     President Clinton emphatically vetoed a fiscal year 1996
funding bill [H.R. 2076] for the Commerce, State and Justice
Departments December 19, cheering supporters of the Commerce
Department programs like NIST's Advanced Technology Program (ATP)
which had been singled out for elimination by Republicans on
Capitol Hill.
     "The bill constitutes a short-sighted assault on the Commerce
Department's technology programs that work effectively with
business to expand our economy, help Americans compete in the
global marketplace, and create high-quality jobs," Clinton scolded
the House.  He added that he could not accept sharp cuts to
programs such as the NIST-administered Manufacturing Extension
Partnership.
     The veto of H.R. 2076 means Congress will have to reexamine
its plans to cut DOC's budget by some $600 million during the
fiscal year 1995.  It is unclear whether ATP will be restored as
part of the process, and if so, at what level.
     Because Republicans are using the government shutdown to
pressure the White House to accede to their budget-cutting plans,
it is unclear when NIST will receive additional funds.  If it does
continue to receive funds under another continuing resolution,
those would be at the more generous fiscal 1995 level, which
provides $340 million annually for ATP.  Yet three months after the
government's current fiscal year began October 1, today's edition
of Technology Transfer Week notes that NIST, like much of the rest
of the federal government, lack spending authority and remains
closed.

RUSSIA MISSES CFE TREATY DEADLINE

     Russia confirmed yesterday that it had failed to comply with a
New Year's deadline for destroying thousands of tanks and other
military hardware beyond the Ural Mountains as part of the 1990
Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.
     Gen. Dmitry Kharchenko told reporters Moscow wanted to push
the December 31, 1995 deadline back to the end of 1998.
     The delay was purely economic, said Gen. Kharchenko, who is
the army staff officer responsible for international military
cooperation.  "About 100 billion rubles ($20 million) in today's
money is needed to destroy the weapons transported beyond the
Urals," he said.
     Today's edition of The Washington Times reports Kharchenko
indicated that three other former Soviet republics also failed to
meet the CFE treaty commitment.

NAVY METAL-SPRAY PROCESS MAKES LARGE PARTS ON DEMAND

     The Navy Surface Warfare Center - Carderock Division (NSWC)
has developed a spray-forming process at its Annapolis, Md. lab
that may revolutionize metal-casting and forging and make possible
on-demand production of metal parts to near-net-shape tolerances
from computer design files.
     Originating at Britain's Osprey Metals Ltd., the process has
been improved by NSWC and given an international pedigree,
including a Swedish plant funded by the Defense Department and an
Ohio plant built by a German/Swedish team.
     NSWC originally sought the British process to make nickel
super alloy tubing for new submarines like the Seawolf.  But with
the Navy's traditional suppliers of large metal components
endangered by defense cuts, NSWC realized that the process could be
used rapidly to produce metal components on demand.
     NSWC's spray-forming work, funded by an "exploratory
development" core program, has cut pipe production costs 25 percent
and boosted product yields up to 25 percent.  Material properties
exceed those for casting processes and match those for much
costlier forging and powder-metallurgy products.  Today's edition
of Technology Transfer Week reports NSWC's work is funded by the
Pentagon's "foreign comparative test" program and that the center
is studying spray-formed large-diameter Inconel (iron-cobalt-
nickel) piping for use in the Navy's new Seawolf submarine.

TIME IS MONEY IN NAVY'S GBS EFFORT

     Navy officials are anxious to get permission to give Hughes
the go-ahead to upgrade three military satellites to broadcast
voice, data, and video communications and warn that the longer it
takes to get the effort underway the more expensive it will become.
     Hughes is currently under contract to build 10 Ultra High
Frequency Follow-On military communications satellites, but the
service recently decided to modify the last three so they have
direct broadcast satellite capability.
     Work on these three satellites - which are known as F8, F9,
and F10 - must be accomplished before February 1998 or the service
will be forced to renegotiate its contract with Lockheed Martin, at
an untold cost.  Lockheed Martin is currently under contract to
launch the satellites on its Atlas Centaur launch vehicle.
     "We have a window of opportunity to catch the three
satellites," Capt. Jim Loiselle, program manager for Navy
communications satellites said in a December 8 interview.
     The decision to pursue a GBS capability was prompted by a
warfighting need to have high bandwidth video and data
communications capability, but also by the desire of sailors to
have access to television broadcasts and other ties to the
mainland, according to Navy officials.
     Much of the Navy's GBS system will be based on Hughes'
commercially available DirecTV system, which has teleconferencing
and world-wide television broadcast capabilities.  The Navy system,
reports the most recent edition of C4I News, will be encrypted so
that sensitive information can be protected from potential
adversaries.

BMDO director's update BMDO focused on the road to the 
future  

     Editor's Note: On the occasion of BMD Monitor's 10th 
anniversary, the editor asked BMDO director, Lt. Gen. 
Malcolm O'Neill to write a guest column. He graciously 
agreed.
     Looking back a decade ago in the Strategic Defense 
Initiative Organization, O'Neill was deputy for Programs 
and Systems under the first SDIO Director, Lt. Gen. James 
Abrahamson. 
     Before his appointment as BMDO director in May 1993, 
O'Neill also served as SDIO, deputy director, and BMDO 
acting director.
     On behalf of the men and women of the Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization (BMDO) I would like to offer 
congratulations to the BMD Monitor on the occasion of its 
10th anniversary. Since its inception, BMD Monitor has 
provided its readers -- including myself -- with a host of 
useful information regarding BMD programs and policies. I 
wish you continued success.
     Ballistic missile defense programs have evolved and 
changed quite a bit since the first edition of BMD Monitor 
hit the street 10 years ago, [SDI Monitor, March 1986 -Ed.]  
but the basic philosophy has never strayed off course -- the 
development and deployment of systems necessary to 
protect against ballistic missile attack. 
     Ten years ago, we faced the threat posed by the very large 
strategic missile force deployed by the Soviet Union. Now, 
the Soviet Union no longer exists. Unfortunately, this threat 
was rapidly replaced by the continued proliferation of tactical 
ballistic missiles to other countries, some of whom are 
potentially hostile to the United States. These short range 
missiles -- as we saw during the Gulf War -- have become a 
very dangerous threat to our forces deployed abroad, and 
also to our friends and allies.
     The recently completed BMD Program Review, 
conducted by Paul Kaminski, the undersecretary of Defense 
for Acquisition and Technology, established specific 
guidance for the BMD program over the next several years 
and reaffirmed the Defense Department's fundamental 
priorities for missile defense. The first priority remains 
defense against theater ballistic missiles, a threat which is 
here and now. The next priority is to develop the capability 
that can be rapidly deployed to defend against missiles with 
the range to threaten the U.S. homeland. Finally, we will 
continue to develop a technology base to support both 
Theater Missile Defense (TMD) and National Missile 
Defense (NMD) as well as other advanced capabilities to 
round out the BMD Program.
     We are putting "rubber on the ramp" today, and will 
continue to do so in the future. With the continued fielding 
of the PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC) Guidance 
Enhanced Missile (GEM) system and an upgraded HAWK 
system to operational units this fiscal year, we will see a real 
improvement in our capability -- at a modest investment -- 
to defend against the short range ballistic missile threat 
exhibited by the SCUD and similar missiles.
     Just as importantly, we have deployed significant 
improvements to our ability to provide early warning 
information to U.S. forces overseas in the event of hostile 
missile launches directed against them. Last year, the Air 
Force activated the Attack and Launch Early Reporting to 
Theater (ALERT) squadron using the BMDO-developed 
TALON SHIELD system at Falcon AFB, Colorado. The 
Joint Tactical Ground System (JTAGS), also developed by 
BMDO is a complementary tactical mobile Defense Support 
Program (DSP) ground station for theater-wide use. Two 
prototypical units have been deployed by the Army in 
Germany and South Korea to support the warfighter, and 
five more units will be deployed in fiscal years 1996 and 
1997.
     With these near-term improvements in the field, we will 
continue our efforts to develop and deploy lower-tier 
systems for TMD, the PAC-3 and Navy Area Defense 
Systems. These systems will be highly effective against the 
threat posed by short-to-medium range ballistic missiles of 
the type under development by North Korea and other 
countries. 
     We intend to provide this defensive capability as quickly 
as possible, building on existing infrastructure and prior 
investments in ongoing programs. This includes expanding 
the capabilities of the PATRIOT and AEGIS/Standard 
Missile systems and adding funds to deal with cost increases 
and development delays. 
     We are also working closely with our allies to develop a 
concept for a cooperative effort for a Medium Extended Air 
Defense System (MEADS) to protect large, mobile military 
units in forward locations. A Memorandum of 
Understanding will be signed this month by the U.S., 
France, Germany and Italy to jointly execute a program 
definition and validation phase for MEADS. 
     A TMD priority is also the improvement of our Battle 
Management, Command, Control and Communications 
(BMC3) capability.
     In order to ensure funds were available in the near-term 
to support rapid production and delivery of PAC-3 and 
Navy Area Defense, as well as to find approximately $2 
billion for DoD recapitalization initiatives, the Theater High 
Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was reduced in 
scope, while maintaining focus on ensuring the User 
Operational Evaluation System (UOES) program was kept 
on track. 
     This will provide a system based on the THAAD UOES 
prototype, in lieu of the previously planned full-capability 
objective system. This will be more than UOES, a UOES-
plus system, with the upgrading of certain components, such 
as the infrared seeker, radar and BMC3. THAAD will 
achieve an initial UOES capability in fiscal year 1998, 
making the system available to an operational commander in 
a contingency.
     The Navy Theater-Wide system will receive an additional 
$600 million over the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), 
resulting in a more aggressive development effort and 
providing the necessary funds for definition of an optimal 
interceptor concept and a system technology demonstration.
     With regard to the future threat posed by ballistic missiles 
with the capability to reach the U.S. homeland, our goal is to 
position the U.S. to effectively respond to the threat as it 
emerges. The Program Review redirected our National 
Missile Defense (NMD) efforts from a technology readiness 
program to a deployment readiness program. 
     We are now focusing our efforts on a program referred 
to as "3+3," meaning a three year development and planning 
phase that, if necessary, could be followed by a three year 
system acquisition and deployment phase. During the three 
year development phase, BMDO and the Services will begin 
development and testing elements of an initial NMD system. 
Based on upon the ballistic missile threat, a decision will be 
made at the end of the three-year development and testing 
phase to determine if an NMD system is warranted. If so, an 
initial defensive capability could be deployed. 
     Based on this program, initial capability could be 
achieved in approximately six years, by the year 2003.
     Our technology development will also continue in order 
to meet critical requirements essential to maintaining our 
technological edge. Since nowhere else in the Department of 
Defense are these technology programs funded, the strategic 
investment of these programs in the BMD budget is critical 
to continued success and viability of the BMD program.
     Along with all the men and women of BMDO, the 
supporting Services and our contractors, I am dedicated to 
ensuring that we field improved missile defense systems as 
soon as possible to provide real protection for our forward 
deployed forces, friends and allies. We have made very 
strong progress in developing and acquiring improved 
systems, putting "rubber on the ramp," due to a very strong 
and enduring Executive-Legislative consensus on TMD.
     As many of BMD Monitor's readers may know, I intend 
to retire from the U.S. Army this year. It has been an honor 
and a privilege to serve as the leader of this vital DOD 
program. I'm sure the next Director of BMDO will read 
with great interest -- as I've always done -- the BMD 
Monitor during the future evolution of this vital national 
defense program.

Skipper wired backwards

     The final Bow Shock experiment failed because scientists 
wired a battery charger backwards.
     The joint U.S.-Russian Skipper Flight Experiment was 
launched Dec. 27, but the craft went dark after only a day 
(BMDM, 1/12).
     BMDO's Innovative Science and Technology Directorate 
funded the mission: about $7 million for the satellite and 
another $1 million for operations.
     Utah State University scientists had worked with Russian 
scientists to build the satellite, which was the last of three 
experiments to investigate the hock flow field in front of the 
satellite and collect information on ultraviolet emissions in 
orbit and high-velocity reentry in a 30 day mission.
     USU's main engineer for the mission, James Cantrell 
told the Utah Herald Journal the solar panels designed to 
recharge the satellite's battery had been connected backward. 
"They were hooked up in reverse polarity and had the effect 
of discharging the battery instead of charging it." 
     "It's always the simple stuff that kills you," he said. "It 
should have been caught in the design stage but wasn't."
     The United National Security Council demands Iraq 
allow "immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access" for 
U.N. inspectors, investigating suspected weapons sites. 
There has been five disputes in 10 days.
     "In all of these cases access was subsequently granted 
only after unacceptable delays," the council said. In a 
statement read at a formal meeting and approved by all 15 
members, the council said the delays "constitute clear 
violations by Iraq" of several post-Gulf War Security 
Council resolutions.
     Under Gulf War Security Council resolutions, Iraq is 
obligated to disclose and destroy all stocks and facilities 
relating to ballistic missile, nuclear, chemical, biological 
programs.
     Rolf Ekeus said the inspectors were searching for 
ballistic missile components and documents during the five 
inspections. Analysis continues, but Ekeus reported no 
dramatic discoveries.
     Weapons inspectors must certify Iraq has rid itself of all 
forbidden weapons.
       The first missile tests and show of force off Taiwan 
were a success, China's state news agency Xinhua said this 
week.
     A second series of exercises, that were to run through the 
presidential elections on Taiwan this weekend, are on hold 
due to bad weather.
     China is applying psychological pressure to halt any 
independence moves by Taiwan, which Beijing considers a 
renegade province. Taiwan denies it is seeking 
independence.
     Hong Kong's Beijing-financed Wen Wei Po quoted 
Chinese military experts as saying it would take just five or 
six hours for PLA troops to cross the 130-mile strait.
     U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry and other U.S. 
experts have said China does not have the capability to 
invade Taiwan.
     Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said tension 
with India is a threat to regional peace, citing India's planned 
development of medium- and long-range missiles.
     "Recently, the Indians test experimented a short-range 
missile and they are planning to develop medium- and long-
range missiles. If this happens, Pakistan
would be forced into positions that it does not wish to take," 
she said in an interview with Reuters Television in Jakarta 
during a three-day visit.
     The PM called on the international community to focus 
on the subcontinent and help the two countries sort out their 
disputes just as it had helped in the Middle East peace 
process, confronted South African apartheid and tried to ease
tension in Northern Ireland.
     She said India and Pakistan have large arsenals, but 
added that Pakistan was trying to prevent a major arms race 
in South Asia.
     Marking the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill's 
"iron curtain" speech at Westminster College, Mo., former 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported ballistic 
missile defenses.
     Thatcher said the world faces more complex dangers than 
it did a decade ago even though the Cold War is over.
     In her March 10 speech, titled "New Threats for Old," 
Thatcher said "because the risk of total nuclear annihilation 
has been removed, we in the West have lapsed into an 
alarming complacency about the risks that remain."
     Thatcher called for NATO cooperation against the nuclear 
threat posed by "rogue" states.
     "If America and its allies cannot deal with the problem 
directly by pre-emptive means, they must at least diminish 
the incentive for the Saddams, the Gadhafis and others to 
acquire new weapons in the first place," she said.
     "That means the West must install effective ballistic 
missile defense, which would protect us and our armed 
forces, reduce or even nullify the rogue state's arsenal and 
enable us to retaliate."
     Thatcher said NATO should implement the missile 
defense system, and should offer full membership to 
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
     "NATO provides the best available mechanism for 
coordinating the contribution of America's allies to global 
system of ballistic missile defense -- that is, one providing 
protection against missile attack from whatever source it 
comes," she said.
         When the "Iron Lady" was England's prime minister 
she was a strong supporter of former President Ronald 
Reagan's SDI program.
     U.N. and African officials said a treaty declaring Africa a 
nuclear weapons-free zone should prompt the Middle East 
to do the same.
     Signing of the African treaty is expected to begin April 
11. It had been negotiated between 1991 and 1995, and 28 
states must sign before it enters into force.
     Egypt's ambassador to the U.N., while in Geneva, said 
Israel must first sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
     Under the Treaty of Pelindaba, named after a nuclear site 
in South Africa, some 53 African states will pledge not to 
develop, stock or test any nuclear explosive device, dump 
imported radioactive waste or attack nuclear installations. 
     Foreign ministers from the five declared nuclear weapon 
states have been invited to the ceremony. They will be asked 
to sign a treaty protocol, pledging not to use or threaten to 
use a nuclear explosive device against any treaty party, or 
conduct underground test explosions in any territory situated 
within the African nuclear weapon-free zone.
     The African treaty follows similar nuclear-free pacts in 
Latin America (1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco) and the South 
Pacific (1986 Treaty of Rarotonga).
          Preparations have begun for International Atomic 
Energy Agency experts to conduct 18 months of 
investigations at the former French South Pacific nuclear test 
site of Mururoa on the impact of the tests on the 
environment.
     IAEA experts from 10 countries are due to begin the 
work in a few months.
     in the last 30 years there have been 141 explosions at the 
atoll, the final six concluded in January to an international 
outcry.
     Future tests will be done by computer simulation, and the 
test site will be dismantled.
     Environmental groups are concerned the tests may have 
contaminated the atolls and surrounding waters, cracking the 
atolls' basalt foundation to allow radioactivity to leak out.
     French authorities deny the tests caused any damage.

BMDO works the international BMD circuit

     The DoD's international Ballistic Missile Defense effort 
aims at increasing the effectiveness and compatibility of 
BMD programs and cutting their costs.
     BMDO is the lead agency and contributes funds to the 
international project, which includes U.S. allies and friends. 
     The international programs were discussed before 
Congress this month by BMDO director Lt. Gen. Malcolm 
O'Neill, during a separate briefing by a senior BMDO 
official and as contained in BMDO's 1995 Report to 
Congress.
     Some of the details are published below.
Israel pursues BMD program 
     Israel has been working with the United States on a 
BMD program centered around the Arrow missile.
     The Arrow/ACES program continues, while the Arrow 
Deployability Program (ADP), which would integrate the 
missile, launcher, radar and battle management into an 
Arrow Weapon System has been negotiated and is ready to 
be signed (BMDM, 3/8). 
     A user operational evaluation system-like Arrow system 
is projected for fielding in fiscal year 1998.
     The ADP involves $500 million over five years: $300 
million from Israel, $200 million from the United States.
     An Israeli Test Bed is also operational.
     Since 1994, BMDO and Israel have been working on 
Boost Phase Intercept (BPI). In fiscal year 1995, BMDO 
was looking at the Israel concept developed in FY 1994, 
using simulations and analysis to determine whether 
coalition force and Israeli concepts had anything in common. 
     A senior BMDO official said, at a recent briefing for 
defense reporters, that the BPI project is a $15 million to $20 
million program over about three years.
U.K. to complete BMD requirements this summer
     An 18-month "Pre-Feasibility Study," to define BMD 
requirements, is expected to be completed this year, 
probably in June, the BMDO official said. The study will be 
followed by a policy paper on missile defense.
     The United Kingdom has been working on cooperative 
R&D experiments and joint trials with BMDO.
     Also involved are exchanges of scientists and 
information.
     MEADS MOU expected this month
     The cooperative agreement among the United States, 
France, Germany and Italy on the Medium Air Defense 
System is expected this month, according to O'Neill's 
testimony before the House National Security Committee 
March 7.
     The Memorandum of Agreement will detail how the four 
nations will conduct MEADS' definition/validation phase of 
the program. 
     The Statement of Intent was signed in February 1995 for 
a medium-to-low-altitude point and limited area defense for 
the protection of maneuver forces against the threat of 
tactical ballistic missiles and air breathing targets, including 
cruise missiles (BMDM, 2/24/95).
Germany to buy Patriot upgrades
     Germany is also involved in the acquisition of Patriot 
Upgrades.
     An Extended Air Defense command and control 
compatibility agreement has been implemented, and an 
agreement on the Extended Air Defense Test Bed has been 
approved. 
     Germany will buy the equipment and software, all off-
the-shelf, and Army Space and Strategic Defense Command 
will install the test bed software. The test bed can be used as 
a common simulation tool in the Medium Air Defense 
System program. 
NATO looks at TMD
     NATO is looking at a number of TMD related issues. 
They include proliferation, active missile defense 
configurations and costs and battle management, command, 
control and communications requirements.
     A NATO working group, of eight nations, has been set 
up under the Conference of National Armaments Directors 
to uncover other TMD cooperative opportunities.
     The Netherlands is particularly interested in TMD, and is 
reviewing requirements to determine how Patriot, Standard 
Missile-2 Block IVA and Cooperative Engagement 
Capability might fit the country's needs.
Russia works on cooperative programs
     Russia is working on joint experiments with the United 
States, including the recent Skipper Bow Shock 
experimental satellite launched from Russia in December.
     A nonproliferation study, which explores areas of future 
cooperation, is expected to be conducted.  
     Another cooperative program is the joint Active 
Geophysical Rocket Experiment. It will investigate the 
effects of an explosive plasma jet on the ionosphere and 
evaluate vehicle environmental interactions.
     An experimental satellite program, the Russian-American 
Observation Stereo Satellites, has been in the works for 
some time (BMDM, 9/23/94). 
     French requirements include BMD
     Emerging requirements for France include BMD. 
     France is working with the United States on EAD 
Simulations and plume phenomenology. Its officials are 
considering agreements on reentry signature 
phenomenology and lethality.
     Army Space and Strategic Defense Command has 
presented the EAD Simulation to France, so its scientists 
can compare it with their own system. It could be used for 
simulated MEADS exercises and training.
     Japan studies BMD
     The United States and Japan are cooperating on a bilateral 
study of BMD, which examines options for defending Japan 
against regional missile threats.
     The Japanese-led study is expected to be completed this 
year. 
     Japan is upgrading systems to build a TMD capability. In 
1994 it started licensed production of PATRIOT PAC-2, 
received AEGIS destroyers.
     Japan also plans to buy four Airborne Warning and 
Control aircraft.

TMD Budget: getting programs operational 

     The BMDO fiscal year 1997 budget request reflects the 
recent restructuring from the BMD program review, 
emphasizing fielding near-term and core TMD programs.
     The program review reaffirmed TMD as the top priority: 
to defend against the existing short-to-medium range mis-
siles, followed by adding wide area defenses against the 
longer range missiles as the threat develops (BMDM, 2/23).
     The restructuring will make changes in the previous 
theater schedule. 
     In FY 1997, BMDO funding is split 74%, $2.063 billion 
for theater missile defense, 18%, $508 million for national 
missile defense, and 8%, $226 million for support 
technology.
     The Army will again consume 60% of the proposed FY 
1997 budget. The Navy gets 16%, the Air Force 5%, and 
other agencies 2%. BMDO's share is 17%.
     Responding to congressional questioning about his 
proposed budget March 7, BMDO boss Lt. Gen. Malcolm 
O'Neill said moving more money into the program would 
allow him to conduct more testing, He noted, however, 
additional money won't speed up all programs.
     The Patriot PAC-3 program, for instance, has "fact of 
life" problems, such as engineering, that money alone can't 
fix.
     O'Neill is also looking for ways that don't necessarily 
involve money to move the first unit equipped with the 
THAAD missile system back from the restructuring 
program date of 2006. 
     The date moved from 2002 to 2006 after the program 
review when nearly $2 billion was cut from the program. 
Putting money back in the program would allow a robust 
program shakedown sooner.
     At a background briefing for defense reporters March 11, 
a senior BMDO official said the Army is seeking ways to 
speed up the program, though there are no specifics as yet.
     The official said fielding the THAAD system will give 
the military the first capability to match the threat.

BMDO five-year plan shows restructuring 

     BMDO resources for the Future Years Defense 
Program, fiscal years 1997-2001, expects $10 billion for 
TMD, $2 billion for NMD and $1 billion for Support 
Technology.
     The change in resource allocation, as envisioned last year 
for FYs 1995-2001 and this year's plans for FYs 1997-
2001, is clear.

Washington Insider O'Neill: theater systems can't take 
NMD's role

     In his last appearance before the Senate Appropriations 
Defense subcommittee March 20, BMDO Director Lt. Gen. 
Malcolm O'Neill said theater systems such as THAAD and 
Aegis can't fulfill the national missile defense role, now.
     Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) asked O'Neill what could 
be done to protect Hawaii from the missile threat. 
     O'Neill said the Navy Aegis system cannot defend 
Alaska or Hawaii against missile attack. The incoming 
warhead would be travelling too fast. 
     He said the Aegis radar does not see far enough out, and 
a THAAD missile can not fly soon enough or high enough 
to intercept that kind of warhead.
     "We do not have enough warning assets to guard against 
rogue nation threats," O'Neill said, "If you wish to field 
strategic defense, from a maritime system, you will need to 
field new spaceborne sensors or airborne radar."
     On another subject, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said he 
planned to demand "a complete accounting, line-by-line, or 
all the funds you expend." Shelby said he had heard reports 
that BMDO appeared to be growing its own infrastructure at 
the expense of the services.
     This week high winds at altitude scrubbed a planned 
THAAD intercept test flight at White Sands Missile Range, 
N.M.
     A mid-February attempt was also scrubbed. 
     It is not the winds at ground level, but higher altitude 
winds up to 70,000 feet.
     If there are high winds at altitude, debris will stray from 
the range, causing safety problems.
     One of the problems encountered is that a shot can't be 
re-scheduled quickly since White Sands has a lot of on-
going activities. 
     The mobile tactical Defense Support Program ground 
station Joint Tactical Ground System (JTAGS) office signed 
the paperwork March 12 with Aerojet to exercise the 
production option.
     The Milestone III meeting was held Feb. 26 and the 
Program Executive Officer, Missile Defense, gave approval 
to proceed (BMDM, 1/26).
     The Army plans to buy three new JTAGS units and 
refurbish the two engineering and manufacturing 
development units. The first new unit will be delivered in 
October.
     The system is slated for fielding in fiscal year 1997.
     Two prototype units have been deployed by the Army; 
one in Germany and one in South Korea.  
     The U.S. military is on the verge of forming a "system of 
systems," able to see all relevant enemy assets on the 
battlefield, communicating this information almost instantly 
to combat units, and striking at these targets with 
unprecedented lethality. 
     That is one of the trends identified in "Strategic 
Assessment 1996: The Instruments of U.S. Power," the 
annual assessment done by the Institute of National Strategic 
Studies of the National Defense University.
     The assessment also said increased reliance on military 
and civilian information systems will require measures to 
protect these systems from attack.
     Another trend noted in the report is that cutting edge 
research is being done more by the private sector and less by 
the DoD. There will be an increasing need to adapt 
commercial developments to military systems.
     The assessment was prepared by a 20-member team of 
civilian and military fellows. It is described by DoD as an 
independent analysis.
     Among its main conclusions the report said DoD has a 
wider variety of tasks in the post-Cold War period, and is 
developing a broader range of instruments to manage them.
     Another conclusion was public pressure to balance the 
federal budget could push defense and national security 
spending below the levels projected by either the 
administration or Congress. Such a situation might limit the
United States' ability to continue to exert its influence and 
protect its interests around the world.

     "The Pentagon has taken a major step in reining in the 
run-away ballistic missile defense program that needlessly 
threatened future progress in strategic arms control," 
Spurgeon Keeny said.
     Keeny, president and executive director, The Arms 
Control Assn., said in an editorial advisory this week the 
BMD restructuring improves the chances that Russia will 
ratify START II and further reduce strategic nuclear 
arsenals.
     Keeny said the new TMD program is less threatening to 
Russia, and should help the United States get Russian 
agreement on a clarification of acceptable TMD parameters 
under the ABM Treaty.  
     Keeny said President Clinton must support the secretary 
of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff on the restructured 
program. 
     While Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., emphasizes experience 
and responsibility, Keeny said Dole "should not attack a step 
toward sanity in the ballistic misisle defense program in an 
effort to create a non-existent ballistic missile defense gap as 
a campaign issue."
     The House Appropriations Committee has added two 
seats, one Republican and one Democrat. That makes the 
partisan ratio 33-25.
     The addition of a New York Democrat, Jose Serrano, 
comes because Rep. Mike Parker, Miss., bolted to the 
Republican side last November.
     Serrano will be back in the seat he lost after Republican 
leaders reduced the Democratic seats to make the committee 
ratio reflect overall partisan House ratios.
     The House has adopted the State Dept. Authorization bill 
conference report, but the bill faces an uncertain future.
     The White House has said the president would veto the 
bill, out of strong disagreement over a provision to eliminate 
one of three independent foreign affairs agencies:  the Arms 
Control and Disarmament Agency, the Agency for 
International Development and the U.S. Information 
Agency.      The eliminated agency would be folded into the 
State Dept. But Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
Chairman Jesse Helms,' R-N.C., has proposal dumping all 
three agencies.
     Senate Democrats have said they might filibuster when 
the bill comes to the floor.     
     Ceremonies in Huntsville, Ala., last week marked the 
changeover from Brig. Gen. Richard Black to Col. (P) Dan 
Montgomery as Program Executive Office, Missile 
Defense.          
     Flags, bands and some 600 people attended, including 
BMDO Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill and Lt. Gen. Jay Garner, 
boss, Army Space and Strategic Defense Command.
          The 1996 BMDO program briefing to industry and 
government has been moved to April 9-10 at the State Dept. 
(BMDM, 3/8).
     Only those with a current Secret clearance may attend. 
According to the American Defense Preparedness Assn., 
which supports the briefing, the classification is "to allow 
briefer to share more details and sensitive aspects of the 
threat, program and future action visions."
     BMDO will provide a program review with presentations 
and discussions on timely, relevant activities affecting 
BMDO, the latest TMD initiatives, the current status of the 
NMD program and ABM treaty impacts/updates.
     Speakers include Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, 
Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology 
Paul Kaminski, and Air Force Gen. Joe Ralston, Vice 
Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
     There will also be a forecast of expected contract 
opportunities for the current and upcoming fiscal years.
     The conference is aimed at U.S. industry and government 
missile defense decision makers, scientists, and program 
planners in R&D, contracting, and marketing. 
     Small and disadvantaged businesses are also encouraged
to attend.

     Senate Republicans are raising the stakes on missile 
defense this election year.
     Majority leader and presidential candidate Bob Dole, R-
Kan., and 26 of his colleagues wrote President Clinton that 
"we will not hesitate to alter the budget request" to bring it in 
line with the Fiscal Year 1996 Defense authorization act 
provisions.
     The Senators cited their strong support of BMD and 
commitment to future funding of the Space and Missile 
Tracking System, THAAD and Navy Upper Tier.
     Their displeasure with the president's budget request 
comes in funding levels for THAAD and Navy Upper Tier, 
which they write are "insufficient."
     The March 7 letter was also signed by Strom Thurmond,

     The Union of Concerned Scientists continues to push the 
other side of the NMD issue.
     UCS said calls for the United States to get out of the 
ABM Treaty would shake U.S.-Russian relations, and 
impede arms control efforts such as strategic arms 
reduction.
     The UCS also said Republicans such as Rep. Curt 
Weldon, Pa., and Sen. Strom Thurmond, S.C., are trying to 
make missile defenses an election year issue.
     Last year UCS wrote to Congress that the push for a 
national missile defense is based on ideology not sound 
science or policy, and that efforts to resurrect NMD are 
"misguided and irresponsible."
          Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Norman Wood has been 
appointed president and CEO, Armed Forces 
Communications and Electronics Assn. effective April 1.
     Wood succeeds retired Adm. James Busey IV, who is 
retiring after more than three years as AFCEA president and 
CEO.
     Wood joins AFCEA from BDM Federal Inc., where he 
was senior vice president and general manager, responsible 
for management of national security and technology 
applications programs, resources and marketing, focusing 
on the intelligence community.
     A minimum sentence of 10 months in prison was 
imposed on two peace-activists for vandalizing Trident 
missile shells at a Lockheed Martin factory last August 
(BMDM, 8/11/95). 
     Federal district judge James Ware imposed sentence on 
Susan Crane and Steven Kelly, saying they had acted out of 
sincere beliefs, "but nevertheless, you violated the law."
     He urged them to "work with the law or try to change it."
     Crane and Kelly were convicted of conspiracy and 
vandalism after jumping a fence at Lockheed Missiles and 
Space in Sunnyvale, hammering two missile shells and 
splattering them with their own blood.
   Because they have spent seven months in custody after 
refusing bail, they will serve only three months in prison, 
then two years on probation.
   The Assistant U.S. Attorney said the sentence was lenient 
for the nearly $400,000 damage done to the missile shells.      
About 100 supporters packed the courtroom, singing "We 
Shall Overcome" before the hearing and giving the 
defendants a standing ovation afterward.
     The former KGB general who targeted U.S. rocket fuel 
formulas and his Cold War antagonist have gone 
Hollywood.
     Oleg Kalugin and former CIA director William Colby 
play themselves in a new interactive CD-ROM game, 
"Spycraft: The Great Game."
     In the game, a politician, vaguely resembling nationalist 
presidential candidate Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is shot in Red 
Square. Players have to figure out who did it
with help from Colby and Kalugin, who join forces to save 
civilization from the Russian mafia.
     To solve the case, players are shown a dazzling array of 
gizmos, including satellite imagery, sound detection devices 
and weaponry that would make James Bond's armorer 
envious.
     "We have many kinds of games used in the government 
for training and to stretch the minds a bit," said Colby. 
"Those games are normally strategic. This one is at the case 
officer level."
     Something new is that the Spycraft player can go on the 
Internet and access the graphic Web pages for the real CIA, 
FBI and other federal agencies, using Intelink, a fictional 
intelligence communications network that really goes online.
   Through the online feature, the game blends real world 
news reports with fictional scenarios in playing time that can 
last up to 40 hours. The game is out this month.
     The McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper-Experimental 
Advanced (DC-XA) rolled out of the Huntington Beach, 
Calif., site March 15.
     The next stop for the single-stage-to-orbit vehicle is 
White Sands Missile Range, N.M., where it will be prepped 
for flight tests that are to start in May.
     The prototype DC-X was developed under BMDO 
direction, and is now being developed under a cooperative 
agreement between NASA and McDonnell Douglas to 
demonstrate new technologies needed for a reliable, 
affordable reusable launch vehicle that could be operated 
commercially by American industry with NASA as one  of 
its customers. 
     DC-XA project manager Dan Dumbacher, NASA 
Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala., said "this is a 
radically different vehicle from the DC-X that flew last year... ." 
     The DC-XA will be the first rocket ever to fly with a  
composite hydrogen tank. The tank, built by McDonnell  
Douglas, is made of graphite-epoxy and is 1,200 pounds
lighter than the aluminum tank used in the DC-X. 
     The flight tests will demonstrate the hydrogen tank's 
performance as well as other new advanced technology 
components, including a Russian-built aluminum-lithium 
alloy liquid oxygen tank; a composite intertank to connect 
the hydrogen and oxygen tanks; and an auxiliary propulsion 
system consisting of a composite liquid hydrogen feedline, a 
composite liquid hydrogen valve and a liquid-to-gas 
conversion system in the flight reaction control system.
     Air Force Phillips Lab will manage flight test operations. 
     NASA's investment in the DC-XA program is $20 
million for hardware and $30 million for integration.  
     NASA's Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va., and 
Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif., also 
support DC-XA.

Ten years ago ... the more things change ...

     Saturday, March 23 is the 13th anniversary of President 
Ronald Reagan's "star wars" speech, which was the impetus 
for the Strategic Defense Initiative.
     Since then, SDIO was refocused from a strategic, space 
oriented organization to the BMDO, with its focus on theater 
missile defense. BMDO just finished refocusing the 
program.
     Some things never change -- the tug of war over the 
budget.
     In March 1986, SDIO was adjusting its fiscal year 1986 
budget to close the gap between the Reagan administration's 
$3.7 billion request and the final congressional appropriation 
of $2.75 billion. 
     Half the billion in cuts came from sensor experiments, 
delaying or cancelling a boost surveillance and tracking 
system demonstration as well as a comprehensive flight 
experiment for the space surveillance and tracking system.
     The FY 1987 budget request was $4.8 billion.
     The SDIO FYs 1986-1987 program emphasized the 
ground-based laser;  continued Kinetic Energy Weapons 
such as ERIS, HEDI; sensor technology and database 
collection experiments (not prototypes); architectural 
definitions of systems; battle management, command, 
control and communications, its impact on architectures and 
the national test bed; survivability and lethality experiments 
and interactive discrimination.
     SDIO's Innovative Science and Technology FY 1986 
funding was $98.6 million. For 1987, SDIO wanted to 
request about $140 million, a 42% increase.
     The hot topics in 1986 were advanced high-speed 
computing, sensing, discrimination and data processing, 
space science and experimentation, advanced space power 
experimentation, directed and kinetic energy concepts and 
materials structures and propellants.
     Deputy IS&T Director Dwight Dustin (now Assistant 
Deputy for Technology) said SDIO was interested in laser 
satellite networking and micro-refrigeration techniques for 
IR sensors, and might look at starting work on a boost phase 
discrimination technique, spotting hard bodies rather than 
plumes.
     Theater ballistic missile defense was one of the 
configurations being examined by SDIO's systems 
architecture study.
     SDIO officials said that while tactical missiles allow less 
warning time than ICBMs, their slower speeds would ease 
some of the requirements for intercept.
     Boost phase and midcourse ATBMD intercepts could be 
done by space-based components of an SDI-constellation.
     The American Defense Preparedness Assn. and SDIO 
presented the Homing Overlay Experiment with the 1986 
"strategic defense technical achievement."
     The award came at a black-tie commemoration of the 
third anniversary of President Reagan's March 23, 1983, 
speech that called for research on ballistic missile defense.
     Paul Nitze, special advisor to Reagan, cited the technical 
achievements of SDI as an opportunity to establish "a more 
stable form of deterrence for American and global security 
concerns."
     While the SDI was an open program, in January 1986 
things started to get tight - all SDIO visitors had to check in 
at a visitor control center to get badges if they wanted to visit 
SDIO officials at the downtown Washington offices.

Missile defense gets its own 'Skunk' worker

     Two-time Grammy winner Jeff "Skunk" Baxter has been 
tapped to lead a new Citizens Advisory Panel on Missile 
Defense.
     At a press conference held hot on the heels of budget 
testimony by BMDO director Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill 
March 7, Curt Weldon, R-Pa., Research and Development 
subcommittee chairman, announced Baxter will help 
organize the panel.
     Baxter, the former Doobie Brothers guitarist and founder 
of Steely Dan is a long-time friend and advisor to Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher, R-Calif.
     Weldon, flanked by (as was said, "there's Pink Floyd and 
the real") Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman, House 
National Security Committee, and missile defense supporter 
Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., said the panel will help educate 
people about America's vulnerabilities from missile attack 
and need for national missile defense. 
     The panel also will encourage members of Congress to 
hop on the missile bandwagon.
     "We need all the help we can get," Spence added.
     Baxter said his job is to bring together everyone who has 
anything to say about missile defense. Including those who 
tinker with technology in their workshops -- no just the big 
defense contractors.   
     Baxter said missile defense technology is available, and a 
national missile defense is affordable. The country can't 
afford to be without the protection, he added. 
     A deployed system also broadens the options for political 
leaders, he said.
     Baxter, who has 16 gold records and eight platinum, lives 
in Beverly Hills, and wrote the original main theme of 
"Beverly Hills, 90210," said his role as entertainer is double-
edged, and it attracts attention.
     "First of all, you're here," he told the room full of 
reporters, Capitol Hill staffers and others. He also noted that 
the music industry is very high-tech, involving computers, 
data storage and digital communications -- much of which 
evolved from the defense industry.
     He first became involved in missile defense because of 
his work on guitar design, through an SDIO project at 
Lawrence Livermore National Lab on microwave radar, now 
applied in guitar amplifiers. From his self-generated interest 
in missile defense issues, Baxter has written Op-Ed pieces 
and position papers on the ABM Treaty and NATO and 
lectured on "The Future of Ballistic Missile Defense.
     The missile panel is yet to become a formal entity. But 
Baxter said he envisions a "website" or clearing house for 
missile defense information available to members of 
congress and the public.

Woolsey, Perle, Krepon: don't scrap ABM Treaty yet 

     Testifying before the House National Security Committee 
March 14 several experts gave their views on missile 
defense and ABM Treaty pitfalls. But none called for the 
immediate dumping of the treaty by the United States.
      There were former CIA director R. James Woolsey, 
former assistant secretary of Defense for International 
Security Policy Richard Perle, and the president of the Henry 
L. Stimson Center Michael Krepon. All said the ABM 
Treaty could be revisited. 
     The hearing was part of the committee's effort to consider 
treaty issues as it weighs the president's fiscal year 1997 
budget request for ballistic missile defense.

Woolsey has reservations about ABM Treaty

     Woolsey said he would "defer" for now whether the 
United States should consider withdrawing from the treaty. 
     Woolsey said with a firm negotiating approach to the 
Russians and enough funding for BMD programs, "we 
should be able to accommodate our needs within the treaty 
for some time if it is appropriately interpreted and, possibly, 
modified."
     A cooperative approach of treaty modification and 
cooperative programs could be one way to go, he added.
     As part of this cooperative effort "we might be willing to 
supply the Russians, as well as other nations, with data from 
our space-enhanced sensors such as Brilliant Eyes," 
Woolsey added.

Perle: ABM question is one of policy, not law

     Richard Perle told the committee instead of negotiating 
limits on theater missile performance, the United States 
should simply state theater defenses are not covered under 
the ABM Treaty.
     Perle said if the Russians said the theater defense 
program violates the treaty they can file a complaint with the 
Standing Consultative Commission, while the United States 
continues developing TMD.
     It is a policy matter, not a legal issue, Perle said. The 
threat of a Soviet missile attack on the United States that the 
treaty is concerned with is now irrelevant, he added. Now 
the danger is in a theater missile acquisition or attack on 
deployed troops and allies.
     Perle urged congress to insist on revising the ABM 
Treaty under its own provisions, and "under no 
circumstances" limit the effective deployment of theater 
systems.

No compelling reason to dump the treaty

     Krepon said "the ballistic missile threat provides no 
compelling reason to trash President Nixon's handiwork.
     Krepon said the treaty should not be considered set in 
stone, but as a living document that can be amended.
     The treaty is a safety net for U.S.- Russian relations, 
Krepon said, for without it, tensions would continue, 
cooperation would be difficult, and START II Treaty arms 
reductions would become difficult.
     National Missile Defense, Krepon said, is the last line of 
defense. The front lines include global efforts such as 
counterproliferation, diplomacy and transparency, backed by 
conventional forces. The last line of defense is intercepting 
missiles and warheads in flight.
     Krepon urged congress to increase spending in other 
missile defense areas, noting "we are spending extremely 
large sums for the last fifteen minutes of the problem, while 
short-changing the front lines of defense against weapons of 
mass destruction."

Heritage Foundation team updates missile defense report

     Led by former SDIO Director Henry Cooper, the 
Heritage Foundation's Team B missile defense study squad 
has updated its 1995 report on the missile defense of the 
United States and its troops.
     The update of "Defending America: A Near- and Long-
Term Plan to Deploy Missile Defenses" (BMDM, 6/16/95) 
again calls for the United States to consider withdrawing 
from the ABM Treaty and adopting a two-tier, Theater 
Missile Defense (TMD)/National Missile Defense (NMD) 
plan by building sea- and space-based missile protections.
     As BMD Monitor went to press, legislation was expected 
to be filed on National Missile Defense and the ABM 
Treaty, March 21. 
     The top priority should be expanding Navy Upper Tier 
for deployment, beginning in 2000 as the earliest, for 
defense of the continental United States and deployed troops, 
the new report said.
     The differences between Team B's and the Clinton 
administration's views continue to be well defined. The 
update and the 1995 report concluded "the threat is clear, 
present and growing; and that it demands an urgent 
response."      The administration, however, does not believe 
the threat is imminent. Unclassified reports on the latest 
National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) suggest the threat is 
years away and there is sufficient time to build defenses 
before the threat materializes.
     The difference has caused Republicans to call the NIE 
"politicized."

Funding plan offered for FYs 1996-2001

     Team B offered their own funding recommendations for 
missile defense systems from fiscal Years 1996 through 
2001 (see chart above).
     Additional funds this year could be found by shifting 
NMD funds from ground-based to sea- and space-based 
programs. 

Update offers recommendations

     The update offers recommendations for Congress to 
consider as the fiscal year 1997 budget evolves on Capitol 
Hill:
     -- Review the administration's ballistic missile threat 
assessment and direct a more prudent approach to accelerate 
the development of appropriate responses.
     -- Review the ABM Treaty limits, and insist the most 
effective, affordable near-term defenses be developed 
without treaty constraints at an accelerated pace.
     -- Move the United States to withdraw from the ABM 
Treaty after six months notice.
     -- Redirect last year's consensus objective of deploying 
ground-based defenses for the United States by 2003 and 
focus on deploying of sea-based, wide-area defenses by 
2000 without ABM Treaty constraints.
     -- Direct the Air Force to accelerate Brilliant Eyes 
deployment, starting as early as 1999, develop follow-on 
space-based defenses for deployment early in the next 
decade, including kinetic energy interceptors and space-
based lasers.
     -- Direct the Army to focus on developing and deploying 
ground-based TMD to support U.S. troops and allies 
overseas, restore the $2 billion removed from THAAD, and 
make 2000 as the initial deployment date.
     -- Ensure BMDO develops an open, integrated 
architecture for battle management, command, control and 
communication.

Panel: appoint an intelligence systems architect at DoD

     A central office for providing national and tactical 
intelligence information to field commanders and solving 
associated problems should be established by the Pentagon.           
This recommendation is from The Commission on the 
Roles and Capabilities of the United States Intelligence 
Community.      
     The commission released its report March 1 in 
Washington, and briefed the president and other 
administration officials last week after a year-long effort to 
define intelligence area reforms and reorganization. 
     Commission staff member Douglas Horner discussed 
the report in a March 12 briefing sponsored by Open Source 
Solutions, Rosslyn, Va.
     The commission recommended DoD set an authority 
under DoD's assistant secretary of Defense, Command, 
Control Communications and Intelligence. The authority 
would cut across intelligence, surveillance and command, 
control and communications functions.
     The panel noted intelligence is useless if it doesn't get to 
military commanders in a form useful form for targeting 
and delivering precision weapons, for example.
     "It is imperative, therefore, that intelligence support to 
military operations be synchronized with global command, 
control and communications systems," the report said. 
     In its review, the commission found many areas of DoD 
are working the problems, but there is no central authority.
The authority would coordinate with groups to provide the 
recommendations and unified effort needed for combat.

DoD should snip overlaps

     The commission also recommended DoD examine the 
intelligence analytical and production organizations within 
the services and the Unified Commands to eliminate 
overlap.
     The commission expressed concern about the size of the 
organizations and "with what appears to be the tendency to 
exceed their core missions."
     The commission cited other issues associated with 
military intel budget decisions, compatibility, dissemination, 
and the growing pressures on tactical and national 
processing resources. 
     Satellite collection systems and precision weapon 
systems still need to be integrated, the report said, noting 
simulations to assess the performance and cost-effectiveness 
of intelligence capabilities are limited.
     A controversial recommendation puts DoD clandestine 
recruitment of human intelligence sources under the CIA.
Congress works on draft legislation     
     Senate Intelligence Oversight Committee Chairman 
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Vice Chairman Bob Kerrey, D-
Neb., are working the report's major recommendations into 
draft legislation (SI 593) to be marked up next month. 
     House Intel Chairman Larry Combest, R-Texas, is 
drafting related legislation (IC 21).      
     Overall the made three points: First, there is a need to 
integrate intelligence with the policy community. Second, 
intelligence agencies need to operate as a community. Third, 
intel agencies must be more efficient.

New aerostat CMD office takes off

     Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and 
Technology Paul Kaminski is slated April 4 to hear the plans 
for the new joint Aerostat Program Office for Cruise Missile 
Defense. 
     Meanwhile, the skeleton staff is working in assigned 
office space at the Army Space and Strategic Defense 
Command headquarters, Huntsville, Ala., which has 
operational control of the office.
     The staff is examining the lessons-learned and after 
action report on the performance of an aerostat that passed 
fire control info to a Marine Corps Hawk battalion in the 
recent Mountain Top experiment in Hawaii.
     While people tend to focus on the lighter-than-air tethered 
aerostat, the advanced sensors, which the aerostat will carry 
aloft, are the focus and more challenging part of project. The 
challenge includes detecting, tracking and relying accurate 
fire control info on land-attack cruise missiles. 
     The aerostat office may participate in Roving Sands '96, 
the annual joint air defense exercise held at Fort Bliss, Texas.

BMDO involved in CMD

     For more than a year, DoD has been discussing land-
attack cruise missile defense. However, BMDO has no 
formal tasking orders, a senior BMDO official told reporters 
March 11.
     Testifying before Congress March 7, BMDO director Lt. 
Gen. Malcolm O'Neill said many TMD sensors, battle 
management and weapons systems have an effective 
capability to counter the emerging land-attack cruise missile 
threat.
     The big picture, the system of systems command and 
control architecture, is being designed to be flexible so to 
accommodate cruise missile defense. 
     In particular, O'Neill said, Patriot PAC-3, Navy Area 
Defense and the Medium Extended Area Defense System 
operate in the same battlespace and will have "significant 
capability" against the threat.
     The National Missile Defense battle management, 
command, control and communication architecture will also 
be designed to promote compatibility and evolve into a 
common system for ballistic and cruise missile defense.
     O'Neill, before the House National Security Committee, 
and Kaminski, before the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, described other initiatives, including advanced 
technology sensors, upgrades to airborne platforms and the 
Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration of the 
aerostat sensor platform and interceptor upgrades, being 
worked outside of BMD. 

Inexpensive ways to solve the problem

     For defenders cruise missiles can cause more than 
headaches. The missiles fly below the coverage of surface-
based systems.
     But an Army official told BMD Monitor the new trick 
for combating cruise missiles involves elevating sensors, 
implementing the concept of Air-Directed Surface-to-Air 
Missiles. This means that an airborne sensor, hooked to an 
aerostat, provides sufficient fire control and update info to 
engage targets before ground-based systems detect them.
     Elevated sensors regain the battlespace lost by below 
surface system coverage due to the curvature of the Earth 
and terrain masking.
     The elevated sensors are expected to detect land-attack 
cruise missiles further out -- looking down over the terrain, 
picking up targets and relaying the information to surface-
based shooters.
     Sensor-carrying aerostats have advantages over Airborne 
Warning And Control (AWACS) and Joint Surveillance 
Target Attack Radar System aircraft (JSTARS) because the 
aircraft are performing other missions.
     JSTARS and AWACS add assets to missions, the Army 
official said, but are not as cost-effective as aerostats with 
sensors. Other solutions are not considered affordable at this 
time.
     In a Desert Shield environment, for instance, the official 
said, where there is limited activity for six months or more, 
an aerostat platform reduces the need for costly  fixed-wing 
aircraft. 
     Since the Army is concerned with a high operational 
tempo and maneuver issues, the elevated sensors can fill 
specific niches. Also such systems could be integrated with 
fixed-wing aircraft such as AWACS or JSTARS.
     The mix would come about as technology matures, the 
official said, and the architecture becomes integrated 
(BMDM, 2/9).

Technical sensor questions studied

     The technical work of the aerostatoffice centers on 
sensors, the official said. There is already a lot of 
information available on aerostats.
     The program office will determine payloads, flight 
requirements of up to 20,000 feet, range and visibility -- in 
determining the correct size of the aerostat.
     The office is considering mobility of the platform. The 
design of mooring systems is in its infancy, the official said, 
adding in the past there has been no requirement to develop 
mobile mooring systems.
     Analysis will examine the most cost-effective system.       
The details on how the sensor information will be integrated 
must be worked out, but the Army official said it is clear the 
platform must support joint forces.
     Other issues being examined include how the platform 
will fit into theater battle management, and what links will 
pass the information.
     Also under review is whether the information can be 
passed from the sensor directly to the shooter. 
     Other mission areas that the aerostat platform could 
address are being examined, but the primary focus is on 
detecting land-attack cruise missiles. 
Forget 'pop' goes the aerostat
     An aerostat is not as vulnerable as uspected, the official 
said. "While any system has vulnerabilities, people tend to 
believe that if they put a bullet in an aerostat it flies around 
like a birthday balloon and pops. But that's not so."
     It is extremely difficult to bring one down with bullets, he 
added. 
     And emissions from the sensors are no more vulnerable 
than those of other sensors, he added.
     The weather should not be a major concern since the 
aerostat is planned to fly at 15,000-20,000 feet altitude.

Dwindling BMDO technology program creates concern 

     BMDO's technology program is the seed for upgrades, 
sprouting new systems, but the agency is having a hard time 
nurturing the technology garden.
     During congressional testimony before congress this 
month, Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, BMDO's director, said 
demands on BMD resources and the number of 
congressional earmarks have risen. "I am concerned that 
because of this we have been forced to reduce our 
technology program."
     The Advanced Technology program is the third priority 
for BMDO behind Theater Missile Defense and National 
Missile Defense. The proposed fiscal year 1997 funding 
allocation is $184 million, or 6% of the BMDO budget. The 
missile defense program review allocates $1.2 billion from 
FY 1997-2001.
     O'Neill said past technology developments have made 
today's acquisition programs possible, citing the "hit-to-kill" 
technology used by the Patriot PAC-3 missile. It evolved 
from the SDIO Flexible Lightweight Agile Guidance 
Experiment of the mid-1980s.
     BMD program restructuring has squeezed the technology 
program. Under SDIO, nearly 90% of the program was 
geared to technology research. The push to acquisition and 
deployment pushed the research part of the budget below the 
15%-20% levels the services traditionally allocate to science 
and technology (BMDM, 3/10/95). 
     Of concern to BMDO managers is the ability to respond 
with new technology to fix system problems or for 
countermeasures.
     One committee member noted that last year the 
technology budget was considered "bare bones." This year 
O'Neill said Congress should think of the Advanced 
Technology program as a "strategic investment," which he 
considers critical to the continued success of the BMD 
program.
     O'Neill will provide a written response to the "how much 
do you need" questions from committee members.
Evolving threat guides the program
     He told the committee the pace and direction of the 
advanced technology program is directed at the threat. 
BMDO has identified the most critical technology 
requirements.
     More needs to be done, and could be done with added 
funding, O'Neill said. 
     He ran down a short-list of work that could be 
accomplished with additional money -- doing more on the 
space based-laser program, upgrading power radar 
transmit/receive modules, communicating with interceptors 
in flight over the horizon and advancing interceptor and 
propulsion technology.
     BMDO could also work with Australia on netting long- 
range sensors, a program that now lacks funds. 
     Unique requirements for component support to programs 
such as Patriot, Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, 
AEGIS, ground-based interceptor, ground-based radar and 
the Space and Missile Tracking System. They include:
     ** Sensor and seeker programs to improve range and 
resolution in the areas of: dim objects; low-noise, low-
vibration, 10-year life radiation tolerant; improved
tracking accuracy; countermeasures resistant; and solid-state 
radar modules.
     ** Interceptor components to develop light, fast, smart, 
highly capable long-range missiles that can find small, cold 
targets.
     ** Battle Management, Command, Control and 
Communication high-data and low-error component 
technologies for automated decision aids, data fusion, 
adaptive defense operations and secure communications.
     ** Phenomenology to determine how the threat, 
environment and defensive systems will behave and interact 
during engagement, involving such things as discrimination.
New options for the future
     The advanced concepts work in the technology program 
looks to the future TMD and NMD, creating new options 
such as:
     ** Directed-Energy Boost Phase Intercept -- high payoff 
leap-ahead technology vs. the evolved threat.
     ** Airborne Kinetic Energy Boost Phase Interceptor -- to 
defend against countermeasures and avoid collateral damage.
     ** Innovative Science & Technology and Small Business 
Innovative Research, to accelerate the application of 
breakthrough science.
     Developing technologies to meet these critical 
requirements is essential to maintain the program's 
technology edge, O'Neill said. DoD is not funding basic or 
component BMD technology anywhere else, he added.

Laboratory Notes Starfire Optical Range uses Comet as a 
target

     Air Force Phillips Lab Starfire Optical Range (SOR) will 
use its 3.5 meter telescope, the largest in the DoD, and Laser 
Guide Star technology to get images of Comet Hyakutake as 
it passes the Earth March 25.
     This is not just an astronomy exercise. SOR will use the 
comet as a moving target to further test the Laser Guide Star 
adaptive optics technology.
     The Lab plans to capture computerized photos of the
comet and put them on the Internet for astronomers and the 
general public. Almost immediately after being taken, 
photos will be available through the Internet at   
http://wwwsor.plk.af.mil\.
     Lab officials note weather conditions might prevent them 
from getting images. Phillips' lasers, computers and adaptive 
optics were linked to a 1.5-meter telescope and used to 
eliminate the distorting effects of the atmosphere.
     The Hyakutake Comet approaches Earth at about 36 
miles per second, nearly 130,000 miles per hour, passing us 
within 9.3 million miles.
     The Naval Research Lab's Naval Center for Space 
Technology has developed a mission planning and analysis 
tool for Earth-Orbiting Satellites.
     NRL engineers Jay Middour and Alan Hope and      
AlliedSignal engineer Steven McLaughlin turned the Orbit 
Analysis Tools Software (OATS) into a single integrated 
program that runs on a Mac.
     OATS version 4.0 uses numerical and graphical 
techniques to analyze and display Earth coverage data and 
has the ability to generate satellite ephemerides, using one of 
four orbit propagators.
     A copy of the user's manual for OATS and the OATS 
version 4.0 executable program and related files are available 
on internet via Internet at 
<<http://netmon.nrl.navy.mil/www/oats/oats_welcome.html
>>.
     Los Alamos National Lab offers direct access to near 
real-time data from its Array of Low Energy X-Ray 
Imaging Telescopes (ALEXIS) satellite through a new site 
on the World Wide Web.
     The Web site, <http://nis-www.lanl.gov/nis-
projects/alexis/> allows astronomers to check satellite data 
against observations from the ground.
     ALEXIS was launched nearly three years ago to survey 
the sky for bursts of extreme ultraviolet photons, called 
EUV transients. Scientists want to identify the sources of 
these bursts and learn more about them (SDI Monitor, 
5/7/93).
     The craft scans half the sky with its three paired sets of 
EUV telescopes, but it cannot locate any events with high- 
resolution. 
     Ground-based astronomers, including amateurs and 
students - can take part by looking for visual counterparts to 
the EUV transients seen by ALEXIS by comparing 
observations made at two different times.  
     Large telescopes, with their small fields of view, cannot 
scan a large enough piece of the sky fast enough to 
effectively observe transients seen by ALEXIS, but amateur 
equipment is well suited to the task.
     ALEXIS orbits about 500 miles above Earth, passing 
over Los Alamos four times a day, delivering its collected 
data to a computer at its ground station. The entire system is 
managed by about 10 people.
    The 240-pound, $20 million satellite includes six coffee-
can-sized EUV telescopes with curved multilayer coated 
mirrors that reflect and focus low-energy X-rays the way 
optical telescopes focus visible light (BMDM, 1/28/94).

Industry Review Raytheon to sell Xyplex subsidiary for 
$117.5M

     Raytheon has agreed to sell its Xyplex subsidiary for 
$117.5 million to Whittaker Corp., Simi Valley, Calif.
     When the deal is done Raytheon expects to have an 
ownership position in Whittaker just shy of 20%.
     Xyplex designs, makes, markets and supports solutions 
for distributed client/server Local Area Networks.
     Last year Xyplex's generated about $100 million in 
revenues.
     Raytheon doesn't expect the sale to have any impact on its 
1996 performance. 
     Lockheed Martin Chairman Dan Tellep was named 
California Manufacturer of the Year at a dinner sponsored 
by the California Manufacturers Association Monday night 
in Sacramento this week.
     Governor Pete Wilson presented Tellep with the award 
before  most of the state's top officials and some 100 
legislators.
      Wilson called Tellep "a leader of the state's business 
community and a vital contributor to the regional economy."
     "Under Dan's guidance, Lockheed Martin has 
repositioned itself  from  the Cold War to a leadership role in 
today's emerging new information markets," he said.
      Accepting the award, Tellep said that he was proud and  
appreciative in both a personal sense, having lived in
California for 45 years, and because Lockheed Martin 
continues to maintain a solid presence in the state.
     He noted that since the Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger 
and  the company's pending acquisition of parts of the Loral 
Corporation, Lockheed Martin will continue to be one of 
California's largest private employers.
     "It will probably surprise you to know that today just half  
of business is with the U.S. Department of Defense. We're 
doing more in a broad variety of high technology areas such 
as  information systems in a business that has played such a 
powerful role in California's economic growth.
     Tellep began his career in 1955 as a principal scientist for 
the X-17 missile reentry flight experiments at Lockheed 
Missiles & Space Company.
     At the end of last year, Tellep retired as an active 
employee of Lockheed Martin, but will remain chairman of 
the board through 1996.
      When Tellep retired as CEO, the company announced a 
$1 million endowment for the Daniel M. Tellep  
Distinguished Professorship in the College of Engineering at 
his alma mater, the University of California at Berkeley.
     The House Small Business Committee has discussed the 
future of the Small Business Innovation Research Program 
(SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer 
(STTR) Pilot Program.
     The STTR program will end September 30, unless 
Congress reauthorizes it. 
     During a March 6 hearing, committee members 
questioned the need for STTR, since it is similar to the SBIR 
program. Witnesses urged continuation of both programs, 
which they said were different but complimentary.
     Digital Systems Resources' president Richard Carroll 
said the programs have become "our best and most effective 
alternative in the era of a shrinking U.S. defense budget, 
which has had enormous negative impacts on high-tech 
small businesses."
     In fiscal year 1996, $980 million will be awarded to 
small businesses: $930 million via SBIR, $50 million under 
STTR.
     Thomas G. McInerney, a former Loral vice president and 
retired Air Force general, has been elected president and 
CEO of Business Executives for National Security.
     BENS is a national, nonpartisan organization of business 
and professional leaders. The organization works to engage 
the business community in defense security issues.
     McInerney plans to focus on innovative business 
solutions to improve defense security. 
     "We have too much `tail' and not enough `teeth,'" he said, 
adding "BENS is ideally qualified to help our military fix 
that."
     John Capellupo, president, McDonnell Douglas 
Aerospace, has been named this year's winner of the Navy 
League's Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz Award.
     Capellupo will receive the award at the Navy League's 
Sea-Air-Space Exposition April 3 in Washington.
     He is cited for outstanding contributions to the U.S. 
maritime force.
     Honeywell has signed a letter of intent to acquire Smiths 
Industries' fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) technology and 
products business.
     The acquisition will strengthen Honeywell's FOG 
technology and position it to extend its product offerings.
     Honeywell is a leading developer and maker of optical 
gyro-based products for military and aerospace applications, 
and is developing advanced FOG technology and products 
for new applications.
     Raytheon is negotiating with Army Missile Command 
for Patriot remote launch communications enhancement 
upgrades and long-lead parts and materials.
     The work will support a limited procurement authority 
for the incorporation of improved technology into the Patriot 
Air Defense System.
     Army Space and Strategic Defense Command spent $1.2 
billion on procurement in fiscal year 1995.
      Small disadvantaged business procurement awards 
accounted for $82 million, or 6.7% of the tab.

     Rep. Sonny Montgomery, R-Miss., congratulated 

     Rep. Sonny Montgomery, R-Miss., congratulated 
Lockheed-Martin board chairman Daniel Tellep, who was 
honored last week with the 1996 James Forrestal Memorial 
Award.
     Montgomery inserted Tellep's speech in the March 14 
Congressional Record. 
     Tellep noted his frustrations about defense, but said there 
was room for optimism: "Optimism that we may be on the 
threshold of arresting, if not reversing the protracted decline 
in defense budgets -- and the downsizing and force 
reductions."
     Tellep said now, with the fiscal year 1997 budget, is the 
time to stop the decline in defense; reverse the trend.
     To make it happen, Tellep said there are some immediate 
steps:
     ** Make a better case to the American people on the 
global nature of threats, emphasizing no defense exists 
against ballistic missile attack.
     ** Make defense an issue in the fiscal year 1997 budget 
cycle and the 1996 federal elections.
     ** Reestablish firewalls around the defense budget so it 
isn't a checkbook for the rest of the federal budget.
     ** Spend defense dollars more efficiently, continuing 
acquisition reform, improving the tooth-to-tail ratio and 
shedding excess depot capacity.
     The awards dinner was hosted by the National Security 
Industrial Assn. and the American Defense Preparedness 
Assn.
      A Rutgers University study says Los Angeles can cut 
defense industry losses by reorienting aerospace-related 
manufacturing and emphasizing employee retraining.
     University economists said the LA economy is still 
vulnerable, but ready to move on new initiatives and 
partnerships among private firms, public authorities and 
community and labor groups.
     The defense industry has been shrinking due to 
government cuts, leading to site shutdowns and moves.
     "Los Angeles is an ideal laboratory for experimenting 
with many of these technologies, and the delegation should 
push for links between new programs and conversion 
adjustment efforts," the study notes.
     The study says many defense companies have been able 
to move into other areas, taking their talent and technology 
with them. 
     The study also recommends Los Angeles expand long-
term retraining opportunities for laid-off workers, pooling 
resources, to keep engineering and skilled workers.
     The study notes nearly a third of those who have left 
aerospace since 1989 stopped looking for jobs, left the state 
or are unemployed.

COTS SYSTEMS MAY REPLACE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS IN BOSNIA

     U.S. military leaders are drafting a proposal to replace some of
their communications assets in Bosnia with commercial-off-the-shelf
equipment and services so crucial military resources can be freed up
for other potential operations, according to a senior American
military planner in Europe.
     "We would like to put more commercial equipment in place in order
to withdraw some of our tactical [communications] assets," Air Force
Brig. Gen. Buford "Randy" Witt, the U.S. European Command's director
of command, control, communications, and computer systems, told C4I
NEWS in a Jan. 8 telephone interview from Stuttgart, Germany. "We
would like to replace some units before the year is up."
      Equipment likely to be replaced by commercial industry includes
systems that offer long-haul connectivity between various
communications centers and computer terminals and networks, Witt said.
      NATO and Pentagon approval would then be necessary to go forward
with the effort. Funding will also have to be identified to support
contract awards.   
      The concept is driven by the fact that U.S. forces, while only
making up one-third of the 60,000 NATO peacekeepers, are providing the
bulk of the communications apparatus in Bosnia. And Witt contends that
at some point during the course of the year-long operation, those
assets may be required to support operations elsewhere. 
      "We are the only armed forces with enough equipment to do this,"
he said. "Only a few nations have satellite communications equipment
and assets. The U.S. is certainly the most dominant player. We have
the most infrastructure in place from a tactical standpoint."
      And much of EUCOM's communications assets have been supporting
operations in Bosnia for some time. Before the introduction of U.S.
ground troops in December, the U.S.'s communications infrastructure
was supporting United Nations peacekeepers in the region and was later
tailored for a possible U.S. intervention to withdraw those troops
should they be placed in jeopardy. That infrastructure is now
supporting U.S. and NATO troops on the ground, at sea, and in the air.
      "We have tied up a huge resource with this deployment," Witt
added. "I want to replace some of our military gear so that equipment
can be used elsewhere."
      Bringing in private contractors to alleviate the communications
burden placed on U.S. forces in Bosnia is not an entirely new idea.
Some commercial firms are already playing a part in supporting
Operation Joint Endeavor. 
      For example, the U.S. is already leasing bandwidth on the
commercial satellites of some Southeastern European countries and
plans to lease more as the operation progresses. Also, EUCOM plans to
award a contract in the near future for commercial telephone service
in-theater.
      "There are some [from the private sector] working for [EUCOM],
but they are not huge efforts," Witt said.  
      Before contracts would be awarded and commercial equipment
brought in to replace some of the military assets in Bosnia, Witt and
others must first ensure all necessary communications support is in
place.  
      Witt estimates that roughly 60 percent of the communications
equipment required to support the operation is Bosnia is in theater
and up and running, most notably high-frequency satellite links. "But
we're still deploying equipment," he said. "NATO said the total
deployment of [60,000] troops will take 60 days. The skeleton is down,
but the operating forces are just getting started. The remaining 40
percent will be for units in the field."

U.S. WANTS DBS DEMO IN BOSNIA

     U.S. commanders are anxiously awaiting the introduction of the
Direct Broadcast System (DBS) into Bosnia, hoping that its ability to
transmit large pieces of voice and video  communications will enhance
the C4I picture of Operation Joint Endeavor.
     The Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Defense Information
Systems Agency have received Pentagon approval to pursue DBS as part
of an advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD), with Bosnia as
a potential laboratory, according to Air Force Brig. Gen. Buford
"Randy" Witt, the European Command's director of command, control,
communications, and computers systems. 
     DBS would rely on commercial communications satellites to
transmit scores of information to warfighters on the ground and at
sea. 
     The Navy is currently pursuing such a capability--called the
Global Broadcast System--but a DBS ACTD "offers the potential of
fuzing [the system] into the force more rapidly," Witt said in an
interview with C4I NEWS. 
     The desire for DBS "is driven by the need to better manage and
move information to people in the field, rather than headquarters,"
Witt said. Its application in Bosnia "is more than promising."
     Before the ACTD gets going, however, DoD must identify additional
resources, Witt added.

IMPROVED TARGETING COULD SAVE DOD MILLIONS, ANALYSIS SUGGESTS       

      By improving the ability of military forces to locate and
identify enemy targets the Defense Department could drastically
improve attack operations while allowing it to scale back plans for
expensive buys of precision munitions and high performance aircraft,
Air Force officials have learned from a recent analysis.
      A cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA) recently
completed for the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System
(Joint STARS) has led service officials to conclude the Pentagon would
be wise to pursue more systems like the Northrop Grumman-developed
long-range, air-to-ground surveillance and battle management system. 
      By investing in such advanced sensors, operations such as bombing
sorties could be significantly improved and much-needed dollars saved
over the long term by leveraging more information rather than more
hardware, Air Force officials believe.
      
  ...Results May Boost C2 Investment

      "The results say improve target acquisition," an Air Force
official said of the COEA. "In other words, if [Joint STARS] gives a
quantum improvement [in lethality], it's natural to assume in other
sensor areas it would be the same."
      "This [analysis] might have a significant affect on command and
control investment in the future," the official said.
      Joint STARS provides commanders with real-time information on the
whereabouts of enemy ground targets. The system is currently
completing its operational test and evaluation while deployed in
support of the NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia (Defense Daily,
Dec. 22, 1995). 
      Joint STARS consists of a modified Boeing E-8 aircraft and
ground-based terminals and is slated for full rate production in FY
'96.
      The COEA results suggest that improvements in DoD's command and
control architecture can introduce as equal an improvement in
lethality as new precision munitions and aircraft, service officials
said.
      Moreover, if Air Force fighters can destroy an enemy target with
two "shots" instead of four, for example, some aircraft can be freed
up to kill additional targets, one service official observed. In other
words, "the current [Air Force] force structure is adequate, and we
don't have to buy more [fighters]" if the right investments are made,
the official said.
      "We don't need 40 fighter wings, but need to invest more in our
architecture."

PENTAGON RESTORES MOST OF ARMY'S SINCGARS FUNDING       

     Late last month the Pentagon's leadership heeded the Army's cries
over the past few months and agreed to restore nearly all of the
service's funding request for the Single Channel Ground and Airborne
Radio System (SINCGARS) in the next two fiscal years, according to DoD
officials and budget documents.
        The service is now set to accelerate fielding of an improved
version of the primary tactical radio system and believes it can
retain two prime contractors and continue to keep costs down. General
Dynamics and ITT  compete annually for SINCGARS production and are
both working on the SINCGARS System Improvement Program (SIP).
        In early December, Deputy Defense Secretary John White restored
the $92.8 million in FY '97 money DoD Comptroller John Hamre
recommended be cut last November. However, until last week, the Army
was set to lose all of its $298 million request for FY '98.
        In program budget decision (PBD) 731 on Dec. 28, White restored
$267.9 million in FY '98, $30 million less than the Army was looking
for. The decision came after continued Army assertions that the FY '98
cut would put the program and force readiness in jeopardy.
        Although the Army won't be able to buy as many radios in FY '98
as originally intended, service officials are confident the program is
out of the woods.                      
        "We see that as a pretty fair cut," an Army budget official
said of the $30 million FY '98 decrement. "We made our case and got
most of what we asked for." 
        Budget requests are made for two fiscal years at once, but
Congress appropriates funding for only one year at a time. This year
the Pentagon is at a disadvantage going into its final budget
deliberations because without a federal budget for FY '96 it lacks a
funding baseline for FY '97 to work against. Without a federal budget
soon, the FY '97 request will likely be delayed beyond the statutory
deadline for being submitted to Congress. 
        The comptroller's original recommendation to cut FY '97 and FY
'98 SINCGARS money was based on the belief that the Army planned to
use the resources to outfit the National Guard with the primary
command and control system used by infantry, armor, artillery and
aviation units. But, the argument went, the National Guard has no
warfighting mission, does not require SINCGARS, and should make do
with its older VRC-12 series radios.
        But the Army, in an appeal to Hamre's recommendations in
November, said it plans to field the SINCGARS SIP radio to first-to-
fight units and that the National Guard will benefit only by receiving
those SINCGARS already fielded and set to be replaced by the SIP
radios. The appeal by Neil Ginnetti, principal deputy assistant
secretary of the Army, prompted White to approve the FY '97 request in
December. But the Army's continued fight led to White's decision last
week to approve FY '98 funding as well.
        Last fall the Army decided to accelerate the SINCGARS program
in an effort to field the required 225,000 radios as quickly as
possible and save nearly $500 million over the future years defense
plan by buying out the program in three years instead of eight. The
Army plans to apply those cost savings to other areas.
        The accelerated plan calls for $283 million in FY '97, $298
million in FY '98, and $15 million in FY '99 and FY '00, according to
internal Army documents.

TRW NABS DESKTOP TELECONFERENCING CONTRACT

        TRW's  attempts at applying its commercial technologies to
military needs is continuing to pay off, with the company announcing
its receipt of a contract award last week from the Army Communications
and Electronics Command for a desktop video teleconferencing system
(DVTS).
        The five-year, $11.4 million contract will allow DoD personnel
throughout the world to conduct "face to face" meetings without
leaving their offices, the company in a statement.
        Commercial off-the-shelf equipment upgrades will be installed
on existing Army computers, providing state-of-the-art performance at
a significant cost savings. The system also promises to save time and
money by reducing the need 
for military officials to travel to meetings.
        "This contract represents the largest single commitment of any
agency to make desktop video teleconferencing an integral part of the
workplace's communications backbone, said Fred Reinhardt, TRW program
manager. "The Army's vision for this system is the scaffolding to the
future, in terms of meeting our military's challenge to do more with
less."
        DVTS is a spin-off from an inventory control program TRW was
asked to do for the Air Force's B-2 bomber effort, according to a
company official. 
        The company official said TRW is currently negotiating with the
other military services for the introduction of DVTS. One in
particular is interested in the system for its telemedicine
capabilities, he said.
        TRW is teamed with AT&T on the Army contract and lower tier
partners will provide other services.
        Initial installation has already begun and will continue
through 1997, with options to extend installation another year.
Maintenance support will be performed during the remaining three years
of the contract.

IN BATTLE FOR SCARCE DOLLARS, C4I EMERGING AS HEAVYWEIGHT

     With the Soviet threat fading into memory, a quick glance at how
the United States has changed its national security posture over the
past six years leaves little doubt that domestic concerns increasingly
command the attention of American leaders and any attempt at
justifying the bloated defense budgets of yore would be viewed as an
effort in futility.
      But from a closer look at how America goes about the business of
defending itself these days emerges the maxim that "the more you know
the better." And despite what threats may arise, the Clinton White
House and the Republican-led Congress appear to agree at least on one
thing: that U.S. military forces must be equipped with the latest
advances in communications technologies to ensure they remain relevant
in international security affairs.
      In fact, spending on command, control, communications, computers,
and intelligence (C4I) programs is one of a few areas of the defense
budget that has remained stable over the past few years and is even
expected to grow in real terms, defense experts tell C4I News John
Pike, a defense analyst with the Federation of American Scientists,
believes overall defense spending will fall victim to the budget ax as
more and more discretionary spending is identified to balance the
federal budget. 
      But C4I programs "will probably be less affected in the sense
that if you look around DoD and ask yourself which programs have a
story to tell and are telling it well, the answer is C4I," Pike said.
In other words, "it's not that hard to make the case as to why these
programs are important." 
      All the military services are involved in highly visible attempts
at folding advanced communications technology into their warfighting
plans. For example there are Army's battlefield digitization effort,
or Force XXI, the Navy's "Copernicus Forward" plan, and the Joint
Staff-sponsored "C4I for the Warrior" philosophy.
      "I can't think of any program that has that type of explanation
going on," Pike said. "There are more slogans than all other DoD
programs put together."  
      "All things considered, C4I programs are in reasonably good
shape" as future defense budgets are formulated, Pike said.
      Besides, numerous sources have pointed out, C4I programs are not
politically controversial as funding for the Air Force's B-2 bomber
and missile defense spending.           
      Steve Olson of Hughes Aircraft , who heads the Electronics
Industries Association's annual 10-year forecast of defense spending,
believes the C4I market will remain "relatively flat" in the near
future, "but the government will buy more C4I stuff than it ever has
before."
      Olson believes spending in this area may not increase in real
terms in large part because the military services are relying on more
and more commercial products and systems to meet their needs, thus
keeping costs down. "They will be paying less for more," he said.
      Olson contends that small, rather than big ticket items will be a
Pentagon focus in information systems acquisition and spending on the
operation and maintenance of such systems will also increase. Systems
which enhance the ability of the services to communicate with each
other in joint operations will also be high on the Pentagon's priority
list, he believes.
      But despite what programs budget officials and analyst believe
C4I money should be spent on, it's clear that the interests of defense
companies lies in the investment in information technologies.
      "The overall budget will fall but C4I will, in proportion, remain
stable because the technology revolution necessitates maintaining that
spending level," Tom Moore, a defense analyst at the Heritage
Foundation, contends. "In general, C4I spending will probably remain
constant."                        
      "I don't know anybody that would object to" such spending, added
former Pentagon official and Brookings Institution analyst Larry Korb.

C4I DRIVES BUYOUTS, ANALYST SAYS

     The recent spate of defense industry consolidations demonstrates
the widespread belief that C4I spending is on firm footing in a period
of reduced defense budgets, according to a leading market analyst.
     According to James Schwendenger, of Los Angeles-based Deloitte &
Touche Consulting Group, the decisions by Lockheed Martin to purchase
Loral's  defense business and Northrop Grumman's  expected buyout of
Westinghouse's  defense and electronics division were driven in part
by the desire to cement a position in the C4I and defense electronics
markets.
     Both defense giants currently have limited involvement in these
growth areas and "have been looking for an opportunity to acquire
businesses to allow them to get involved," Schwendenger told C4I NEWS
last week.
     Schwendenger estimates that Northrop Grumman's C4I business will
increase from roughly 10-15 percent to 30 percent if its acquisition
of Westinghouse goes forward. "It put them on the [C4I] map."
     Moreover, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are currently
heavily rooted in airframe production, the future of which is
uncertain. "Will Northrop Grumman make fighters in 2020?" Schwendenger
asks. "That's questionable."
     But the technology boom in communications and electronics, on the
other hand, has a bright future, he said.

SBIRS IDENTIFIED AS POSSIBLE BOSNIA BILLPAYER

    The Air Force's Space-Based Infrared    System (SBIRS) has been
identified by DoD   Comptroller John Hamre as a possible billpayer for     
U.S. operations in Bosnia. In a recision list drafted last month,
Hamre recommended Deputy Defense Secretary that John White cut $135
million in FY '96 funds from the demonstration/validation program. The
Clinton administration asked Congress for $130.7 million for SBIRS
development in FY '96, but lawmakers appropriated $230.7 million. Like
a myriad of other programs boosted by the Republican-led Congress,
SBIRS is on the table to offset what Pentagon budget officials believe
will be a more than $2 billion bill for the U.S. peacekeeping effort.

JWID '95 GUIDE TO BEST COMMUNICATIONS IN BOSNIA

    Pentagon leaders holding discussions on how to best outfit U.S.
forces in Bosnia with communications systems are using the results of
the Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration '95--held last fall--
to identify the best solution, according to DoD officials. Due to the
impressive performance during the exercise, Pentagon leaders are
considering deploying several emerging communications to the Balkans.
Candidates for Bosnia use include he Global Command and Control
System, the Collaborative Contingency Targeting system, which will
help solve targeting problems encountered by pilots, the
Communications on Operational Modeling, Planning, and Simulation
Strategy, a training tool aimed at improving air mission plans, and
the Global Broadcast System.

THAAD PM CONSIDERS REPLACING JTIDS IN GROUND STATIONS

    Officials in the Army's Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
program office would like to replace the Joint Tactical Information
Distribution System as the primary radio for the missile defense
platform's ground station, according to service officials and
documents. In its stead, they believe the Secure Packet Radio,
manufactured by ESCO Electronics subsidiary Hazeltine will provide
enough throughput to meet program requirements. Army leaders, however,
are unconvinced such a change is necessary and have asked THAAD
officials to justify their request.

CLINTON SIGNS INTELLIGENCE BILL

    President Clinton signed the FY '96 Intelligence Bill earlier this
month, providing funding for the likes of the Central Intelligence
Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, and
Defense Intelligence Agency. The bill, which is classified, is
estimated to contain just under $30 billion in budget authority.The
congressional intelligence panels have been grappling over the past
months on whether funding for NRO satellites should be shifted from
ongoing larger satellite systems to fund smaller, cheaper satellites.
Lawmakers were said to have reached a compromise on the issue in the
final bill.

DEUTCH WANTS LARGER ROLE IN DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

    CIA Director John Deutch believes he should play a larger role in
defense intelligence matters, such as having the authority to approve
DoD intelligence appointments, and an important voice in defense
budget planning. Testifying before the House Select Committee on
Intelligence, the former deputy defense secretary also said he thinks
the creation of a director of national intelligence is unnecessary, as
some current and former intelligence officials have suggested. The
hearing was the sixth and last held by the House panel on how to shape
the intelligence community to best meet the needs of the 21st century.

FIRST MESSAGE SENT USING MILSTAR CROSSLINK ANTENNAE

    The Air Force's Milstar satellite transmitted its first message
using its crosslink antennae late last month, according to prime
contractor Lockheed Martin. The message was uplinked to Milstar
satellite one, which relayed the information to Milstar satellite two
with the crosslink antennae on the spacecraft. The transmission was
then downlinked to the U.S. Pacific Command, Camp Smith, Hawaii, and
the U.S. Atlantic Command, Norfolk, Va. It marked the first time 
a communications signal has been transmitted over such a long distance
through more than one satellite without the use of ground relay
stations.

MILITARY, COMMERCIAL SATELLITES SHOULDER LARGE BURDEN IN BOSNIA

    Space-based assets, many owned and operated by commercial entities,
are playing a vital role in the NATO peacekeeping operation in 
Bosnia, according to an Air Force official. A mixed bag of commercial
and military satellites are being used for a variety of applications,
including communications and reconnaissance, Maj. Gen. David Vesely,
commander of the 14th Air Force, told reporters last month. Heavy
demands on the military's satellites during Desert Storm demonstrated
the need for more bandwidth during large-scale operations and since
then DoD has begun to exploit the capabilities of commercial
satellites through leasing arrangements, especially for high data rate
transmissions.

    Pentagon acquisition chief Paul Kaminski in December authorized the
pursuit of a close range unmanned aerial vehicle as an advanced
concept technology demonstration (ACTD) in December, after the Army
and Navy agreed on system requirements. In a Dec. 21 memo, Kaminski
called for the demonstration of the joint tactical UAV--formerly
called Maneuver--to last 18 months, with an eventual system cost not
to exceed $300,000, and a range of 200 kilometers. The demonstration
will also include some pre-planned product improvements and be
launched from both land and sea. A draft request for proposals for the
program is expected shortly, according officials in the Navy-led Joint
Program Office.

Clinton vetoes DOD authorization, VA-HUD

     President Clinton last month vetoed a pair of bills 
that include stipulations for environmental cleanup.
     On Dec. 28, the president vetoed the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, 
which approves funding levels and provides 
guidance for the Defense Dept.'s cleanup programs. 
Clinton cited the bill's direction to "slow the pace of 
[DOD's] environmental cleanup efforts" among his 
reasons for the rejection.
     H.R. 1530 would have set a spending ceiling this 
fiscal year for DOD's Defense Environmental 
Restoration Account (DERA) at $1.422 billion -- 
$200 million less than Clinton requested.
     Also for DERA, Congress said it expected 
DOD's environmental security program to reduce 
funding for administrative, support, studies, and 
investigations to 20% of total funding by FY 1997.
     The bill also directed DOD to report by April 1 
on progress made in reducing spending on 
administration and studies and on actions it plans to 
further reduce spending.
     Clinton also vetoed the VA-HUD and 
Independent Agencies Appropriations bill, Dec. 18.
     That bill -- which funds EPA Superfund -- 
returns to conference, where it probably will gather 
dust until the administration and congressional 
Republicans can compromise on a balanced budget 
for the next several years.

**Hundreds of contract Superfund workers sent 
home

     Clinton cited cuts to environmental programs as 
one of his reasons for vetoing the $80.6 billion 
appropriations bill, which included $1.163 billion for 
Superfund, almost $400 million less than he 
requested.
     "We cut low-priority EPA items," said Sen. Kit 
Bond, R-Mo., who chaired the conference 
committee. "We've done as good a job as possible 
under the circumstances."
     The VA-HUD and Independent Agencies bill 
would have provided $5.7 billion for EPA in FY 
1996, which began Oct. 1.
     Superfund had continued relatively unscathed, 
due to a surplus in the trust fund. But because of the 
government shutdown, EPA stopped work at 609 
Superfund sites -- all but those of highest priority -- 
on Wednesday.

Division Profile
Downsized SWD should weather div. cut well

     DALLAS -- Set up in 1937 to design and build 
flood-control and hydropower reservoirs, the Corps' 
Southwestern Div. now logs mileage daily down all 
the Corps' major avenues: environmental 
stewardship, HTRW cleanup, military construction, 
disaster relief, and work for other federal agencies.
     Southwestern Div. covers 18% of the nation's 
landmass (see maps on p.3) and 28% of the land the 
Corps regards as its own. More than 15% of the 
nation's waterborne commerce plies SWD's 
waterways, particularly along its 426 miles of the 
Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The division operates 
18 hydropower projects and 98 lakes.
     The division office here provides oversight to five 
districts: Albuquerque, Fort Worth (CR, 11/24/95), 
Tulsa (CR, 2/17/95), Galveston (CR, 12/8/95), and 
Little Rock (CR, 2/3/95).
     SWD does design and construction at 10 active 
Army and 14 active Air Force installations. It 
manages HTRW cleanup at various Air Force and 
Army installations and for the Dept. of Energy at the 
Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas.
     The Dallas office estimates SWD's military 
programs are worth $961 million. In fiscal year 
1995, it spent $384.8 million of the $465 million 
made available for its civil works.
     Some careful reprogramming enabled mission 
execution in civil works during FY 1995 came in at 
greater than 100% of what Dallas scheduled.

*****
Southwestern Div. Program Execution, FY 1995 (in 
millions)
Category     Scheduled     Expended
Operations and maintenance     $237.5     $236.7
Construction, general          $104.2     $108.3
General investigation           $15.4     $14.1

     "You can reprogram monies to another 
authorized project in civil works," explained Acting 
Chief of Civil Programs Jerry Penland, "but you 
can't do it on the military side - not even from one 
project to another at the same installation."
     Penland, who spent 10 years in military-project 
planning with Transatlantic Programs Center, said 
SWD plans to get its civil carryover down to zero by 
FY 1998.

**Division twice escaped death sentence

     The division has 219 full-time equivalencies -- 
184 at the Federal Building in Dallas, 28 at the SWD 
lab on Cass St. in Dallas, and seven more in 
reservoir control. The division already downsized 
because of anticipated restructuring in the 1991 and 
1992 plans, which were rejected by Congress, and 
hasn't built back up. Programs Management Director 
Ed Cohn doesn't anticipate any layoffs, as the Corps 
continues to downsize.
     The 1991 restructuring plan would have closed 
the division office in Dallas and sent most of its 
districts and work to a new South Central Div. in 
Vicksburg, Miss., with the rest going to a new 
Southwest Div. in San Francisco. The 1992 plan also 
would have closed the Dallas office.
     "The flags were supposed to go up on the new 
divisions in February of '93," said Paul Robinson, 
acting director of Engineering and Technical 
Services. "And that didn't happen."
     At the time SWD had a military program worth 
more than $1 billion and a civil-works program 
worth more than $400 million. Combined with 
Lower Mississippi Valley Div.'s civil-works 
program of more than $1 billion, and allowing for 
Albuquerque Dist.'s move to the West, the new 
South Central Div. would have had a total program 
worth more than $2 billion.
     Now the brass in Dallas thinks the division is safe 
because, unlike LMVD or North Central Div. (two 
primarily civil-works divisions), SWD is top heavy 
with no major Corps mission. 
     Fort Worth Dist. has about a $300 million annual 
military program. Galveston has a vibrant civil 
program. 
     And Tulsa Dist., which would have closed under 
the 1991 restructuring plan, today is robust as 
SWD's HTRW design district. The division's 
HTRW program -- just $12 million in 1990 -- 
jumped to nearly $110 million in FY 1995. Tulsa 
has two Total Environmental Restoration Contracts, 
which together are worth more than $500 million.  

**Each district has its niche

     Albuquerque Dist.'s workload has held steady 
because of its commitment to family housing.
     "That's unique to them," said Louis Carr, SWD's 
acting director of Construction/Operations Div. 
"They were able to go out and develop the 
relationship with the Air Force that enabled them to 
become the designer for Air Force family housing."
     Good thing. Albuquerque does far more work for 
the Air Force than for the Army.
     "The selling point," said Robinson, "was the 
design/build approach. They streamlined that process 
for family housing."
     Tulsa Dist. is unique for combining engineering 
and construction in the same division. It looks as 
though base closings and realignments designated in 
this year's round will bring $220 million of work to 
four sites in Tulsa Dist.
     "We're waiting for the [specific assignments 
from] BRAC '95 to get finalized," said Aldo 
Brazzale, chief of Military and HTRW Programs 
Division in Programs Management. "And there is 
some BRAC '95 work in Tulsa's area, based on what 
is in the BRAC '95 program. We don't know yet 
how much of that will come to pass, but there's 
some work at McAlester [Army Ammunition Plant, 
Okla.], some work at Tinker [AFB, Okla.], for 
instance."
     Little Rock Dist. is becoming what the Corps 
thinks of as a mature district. Nearly all of its civil-
works appropriations go toward operating and 
maintaining its projects. Indeed, the Corps' civil-
works side as a whole seems headed in that 
direction, toward merely operating its projects.
     Even so, Fort Chaffee, Ark., should get about 
$25 million of environmental-restoration work in 
either fiscal year 1996 or 1997.

PK wins $16M for smolt-monitoring works

     PK Contractors won a $16.02 million Portland 
Dist. contract, Dec. 13, to build a juvenile-fish 
sampling and monitoring facility at John Day Dam 
on the Columbia River.
     The Spokane, Wash., company beat out 
Humphrey Construction, Woodinville, Wash., 
which bid $16.85 million; Harcon Inc., also of 
Spokane, which bid $17.85 million; Haskell 
Construction, Bellingham, Wash., $19.2 million; and 
Abhe and Svoboda Inc., Prior Lake, Minn., which 
bid $24.46 million.
     The government estimated the job, which is part 
of the Corps' Columbia River Fish Mitigation 
Program, at $17.04 million.
     PK went right to work, starting construction late 
last month on the elevated, three-part, fish-passage 
system that will extend more than 2,400 feet. The 
apparatus will include adult holding and sampling 
areas and expand juvenile-fish monitoring 
capabilities at John Day. It should be ready by 
summer of 1997.
     Once the facility comes on line, biologists from 
the Corps, the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
and other fishery agencies will monitor and sample 
the fish, and analyze the data on-site. Biologists will 
tag the fish and release them back into the Columbia, 
downstream of the powerhouse.
     The Corps will operate the facility.
     Biologists will do a variety of research "relevant 
to all migrating species" at John Day, said Portland 
Dist. Spokeswoman Dawn Edwards. 
     "Radio-tracking and hydro-acoustics will tell us 
where the fish are approaching the project," added 
Project Manager Stuart Stanger.
     Biologists will use the survival data to assist in-
season and long-term management of the river 
system.
      The fish-passage system will have a 1,200-foot-
long, five-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep chute extending 
along the Oregon shoreline from the powerhouse to 
a dewatering building, which will be 100 feet long by 
40 feet wide.
     A funnel effect will direct the juveniles to the 
dewatering building. From there, they will travel 
about 1,200 feet through a transport flume to the 
sampling and monitoring building. A computerized 
monitoring system then will determine survival rates 
and travel times by analyzing passive-integrated-
transponder (PIT) tags placed in the fish at various 
hatchery and upriver capture locations.
     Interested subcontractors should call PK Project 
Manager Brent Ridge at 360-779-9341 or PK's 
Spokane office at 509-536-7503.

ORD to help clean acid-mine drainage

     CINCINNATI -- The Ohio River Div. is offering 
to help states and organizations clean up rivers and 
streams that have become acidic due to discharges 
from coal mines.
     Division Program Manager Debby Chenoweth 
and Environmental Engineer Bob Hahn discussed 
ways to work with the Corps at a Mine Drainage 
Workshop here sponsored by the Terrene Institute. 
The workshop drew nearly 150 people: federal 
officials from the Corps, EPA, the Office of Surface 
Mining, and the Dept. of Agriculture; state officials; 
activists looking for ways to restore streams; and 
mining-company representatives.
     Chenoweth said the Corps could help 
environmental groups, states, and other federal 
agencies. However, she discouraged the idea that the 
Corps had limitless resources. West Virginia Dept. 
of Environmental Protection Director Eli McCoy 
had earlier described the Corps as the "Daddy 
Warbucks" of government agencies.
     Because the areas in the eastern United States 
contaminated by acid-mine drainage "almost exactly 
parallel Ohio River Div.'s boundaries," Chenoweth 
noted, ORD districts -- Pittsburgh, Huntington, 
Louisville, and Nashville -- might be further along 
than others with these programs.
     Many workshop speakers mentioned the Corps 
as a source of funding for combating acid-mine 
drainage. Office of Surface Mining Director Robert 
Uram said states could match their "abandoned mine 
lands" funds, which are used to reclaim old mine 
sites, with Corps funds. An official in charge of 
coordinating USDA's natural resources conservation 
service suggested tapping Corps funding because 
acid-mine drainage affects water-resource 
management.
      Hahn outlined four Corps programs, which 
could be used.
     * Authorized Corps projects have two key 
advantages: the Corps supplies half the funding and 
manages the program from design through 
operation. However, with these projects customers 
must lobby their congressional leaders as they have 
to survive the congressional budget battles.
     * The Support for Others program requires less 
time and money, Hahn said, plus the customer can 
set a project's scope. However, the Corps provides 
no money and only limited manpower for such 
projects.
     * If a customer wants a lot of Corps funding, 
Hahn added, it could show the quality of its 
watershed affects a Corps project as outlined in the 
Section 1135 environmental-restoration program. 
Restoration jobs have difficulty fitting the strict 
limitations of scope and location, but if the job falls 
into this category it can receive 75% of its money 
from the Corps.
     * Finally, the Corps will provide half of the 
money states need for watershed-restoration 
planning. However, this planning assistance program 
has a limited budget and will not pay for the actual 
work of putting concrete in the ground or 
establishing wetlands.
     "We don't have any specific amount of money set 
aside," Chenoweth said, but interested states and 
organizations need to get in line as soon as possible 
to get Corps feasibility studies started for their 
projects. Feasibility studies generally take about a 
year.
     Hahn reminded the workshop that the Corps also 
provides technical assistance -- on regulations, 
federal and state programs, geology, hydrology, 
meteorology, and consultation -- at no cost. He urged 
people to contact a Corps office.
     "We're eager to help," Hahn said.
     As examples of projects using Corps funds and 
technical assistance, Chenoweth mentioned two in 
Ohio: a $400,000 project at Wills Creek, where fly 
ash will be used to treat acid-mine drainage, and a $4 
million project at Piedmont Lake.

**Problem requires long trip to recovery

     Acid-mine drainage contributes to water pollution 
where old underground and surface coal mines were 
abandoned before federal regulations required mine 
operators to reclaim the properties.
     Many streams in Appalachian coal fields suffer 
from acid-mine drainage. When sulphur-bearing 
rock meets oxygen, it can create an acid that is 
carried into nearby streams by surface runoff or 
groundwater. The acid leaches heavy metals from the 
earth and lowers the pH of the streams.
     Correcting the problem requires expensive 
techniques. Physical measures include filling an 
underground mine with fly ash, building concrete 
dikes to contain groundwater, and establishing 
wetlands to serve as a natural filter. Restoration 
projects also use chemical measures, such as  
administering alkaline materials to a stream through 
"doser" silos or piles dumped along its banks to 
bring the water up to a neutral pH level.
     For more information on the ORD acid-mine 
drainage programs call Chenoweth at 513-684-6038 
or Hahn at -6201.

BRAC shuts down -- perhaps till 2001

     The Base Closure and Realignment Commission 
(BRAC), the independent agency Congress created 
to insulate elected officials from shutting down 
excess military capacity remaining after the Cold 
War, closed itself last week, after shuttering 243 
domestic military bases since 1988.
     "We saved the taxpayers over $5 billion a year for 
the next four years, and we did it for under $13 
million," said Charles Smith, the last executive 
director of BRAC.
     Former BRAC Chairman Alan Dixon, who 
presided over the fourth round of BRAC last year, 
sometimes found himself confronted by parents 
holding the children they said would starve if bases 
near their homes closed.
     Because the 20% of domestic bases closing down 
still leaves slack in the military infrastructure, 
Dixon's commission recommended a fifth round of 
BRAC -- but not until 2001.
     Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who helped write the 
legislation creating the commission, said shrinking 
Defense budgets could mean pressure to close more 
bases will come sooner, and from the military 
services: "They don't enjoy it, either. But when it's 
either that or not modernize, it makes a difference."
     Before Congress's Office of Technology 
Assessment closed in September, it observed that 
base closures usually occur in areas that can absorb 
the job loss and usually make available valuable real 
estate.

Renovation, CTR, Wainwright OK'd

     When the Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal 
year 1996 became law on Dec 1., it cleared money 
for three Corps projects whose appropriations were 
in doubt.
     It finalized the conference agreement to give the 
Pentagon Renovation $108.02 million for FY 1996 
(CR, 9/29/95) and to consolidate renovation funding 
in the "Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide" 
account.
     It funded the Cooperative Threat Reduction 
(CTR) program, which gives a lot of work to 
Transatlantic Programs Center, at $300 million for 
FY 1996 -- $71 million below the president's 
request. CTR aims to reduce the nuclear threat in the 
former Soviet Union, in part through incentives such 
as building housing for retired military officers.
     Also, House and Senate conferees put $8 million 
toward emergency repairs at the Fort Wainwright 
Central Heat and Power Plant, in Anchorage, Alaska. 
That makes money available for Sol. DACA85-95-
B-0031 (CR, 8/18/95).

From the PENTAGON
FY '91 DOD BUDGET AUTHORITY AT $295 BILLION

      The FY '91 Department of Defense (051 function) budget
authority figure is set at about $295 billion, congressional
sources tell Defense Industry Report. The President tentatively
approved an FY '91 DoD budget outlay figure of $292.15 billion
last week.  The FY '91 (050) (DoD and Department of Energy)
outlays are around $301 billion, while the budget authority is
around $307 billion.  DoD ended up with a budget authority of
$292 billion in fiscal 1990, with outlays of $287 billion.

STREAMLINING TO SAVE DOD $39 BILLION THROUGH FY '95

     Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney announced last week that
$39 billion will be saved in the Department of Defense budget
between FY '91 and FY '95 through management streamlining as a
result of the Defense Management Report (DMR).

Cheney said $2.3 billion will be saved in FY '91, which is
included in the four year savings.  He said that in FY '91,
16,000 military and civilian personnel and 42,000 personnel
through FY '95 will be trimmed from the logistics and management
work force of 580,000.  Cheney said these cut backs were
efficiency-related cutbacks and not a part of force structure
included in the FY '91 budget.

Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood said most of the
personnel cutbacks will be absorbed through the DoD's normal
attrition rate, which he said is much higher than the total to be
trimmed.

Atwood said the Pentagon is implementing major cultural changes
in the way DoD is run and the way its purchasing system works.
The Administration's legislative policy will be developed by the
Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

The DMR was issued in July 1989 after President Bush directed
Cheney to devise and implement the recommendations of the Packard
Commission to improve defense acquisition, and better manage DoD.

A legislative task force under the direction of the legislative
counsel and former Secretary of the Army, Jack Marsh, reviewed
existing statutes and recommended changes that improve DoD
efficiency. The task force recommended that following areas be
improved: production, acquisition and logistics; military and
civilian personnel; environment; and department finances.
    The report also calls for the overhaul of the "statutory
framework for DoD acquisition."  Strengthening of the defense
industrial base, improved observance of ethical standards in
government and industry, and improving defense management were
outlined by Atwood as essential to the successful "cultural
changes" necessary for the success of the management overhaul.

To strengthen the industrial base, Under Secretary of Defense
(Acquisition) John Betti said during an informal meeting with the
press, that the Pentagon must create incentives and eliminate
"disincentives" for industry to invest in new facilities and
equipment as well as research and development.  Betti said the
process should be made easier for industry and the DoD.

Atwood outlined the following points that would improve defense
management:
  *  Reducing overhead while maintaining military strength;
  *  enhancing weapon systems program performance;
  *  reinvigorating the planning and budget process;
  *  reducing micromanagement;
  *  strengthening the defense industrial base;
  *  and improving observance of ethical standards in government
        and industry.

Betti told reporters that one way to tighten the acquisition
process is to keep disciplined milestones.  He said many problems
have occurred as a result of concurrency.  Under the new
streamlined system programs with problems would not be allowed to
proceed, or in essence postponed, until the problems are cleared
up.  Betti said that because there was a need for certain
programs, most would not be terminated, but in a case where the
need for a troubled program changes, termination may be
justified.

Betti said the most difficult issues will be those problem-
plagued programs already in the system. "We had to figure out a
way of not throwing the baby out with the bath water," Betti
said.  He said if the program was not brought on track it would
prove to be a greater problem "as it heads farther down stream.
That's just management, but if circumstances warrant it, we'll
terminate it."

AF SEES NEARLY $11 BILLION IN DMR CUTS FROM FY 1991-95

     Air Force Secretary Donald Rice said last week that the
service is projecting more than $10 billion in cuts from
acquisition and logistics for FY 1991-95, in line with the
Administration's Defense Management Review (DMR), and a further
$1.7 billion cut from Air Force-wide operational and training
initiatives.

Overall DMR savings for the service would come to about $10.9
billion in cuts over the five year period and would entail the
loss of 14,600 civilian personnel and 8,800 military posts (these
figures do not include civilianization of military support
positions).  Total cuts for FY '91 would amount to $950 million,
and the loss of 8,300 civilian and 5,150 military personnel.

Major changes the Air Force intends to make include: Cutting
$9.15 billion over the five year period ($750 million for FY `91)
from the acquisition command services (AF Systems Command,
Logistics Command, and Communications Command) to streamline the
acquisition process--this includes cutting 14,400 civilian and
4,300 military personnel; cutting $1.750 billion ($200 million
from FY `91) from operational and training programs--including
200 civilian and 4,500 military personnel.

The service also plans to institute a three-level chain that
provides a "direct line of command for major acquisition programs
from the assistant secretary of the Air Force to six newly
created program executive officers (PEOs)," and developing career
military and civilian acquisition officers through training and
education.

DOD INSPECTOR GENERAL ENDORSES DMR

      Defense Department Inspector General Susan J. Crawford said
recently that she fully backs the initiatives contained in the
Defense Management Review, released last week, as a logical
extension of the Packard Commission Report and Goldwater-Nichols
Reorganization Act as important steps to streamline and promote
efficiency in the Pentagon acquisitions process.

At the same time, she said, "we need to dispel any notion" that
tough Pentagon auditing and accounting practices in any way make
private business dealings with the Pentagon unprofitable "We have
not lost a proper sense of perspective."

Pushing for "aggressive ethics training,"  Crawford said there is
a need to "clarify rules to" the defense contracting community.
She made note of her office's role in reversing "the perception
of fraud" within the Pentagon.   Calling the DoD audit community
a "leading force" in acquisition reform, she emphasized that the
IG is "clearly concerned" about safeguarding the public trust
from fraud and abuse.  * * * * * * * * * *

DOD TO MEET WITH CONGRESS ON BLUEPRINT FOR DMR

     The Defense Department has agreed to hold an "acquisition
summit" with defense leaders of Congress  "to work on concrete
steps" to implement the recommendations of the new Defense
Management Report and to develop "a scorecard to measure
effectiveness," Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) of the House Armed
Services Committee reported last week.
Aspin said the DMR "offers no blueprint for implementation.
The acquisition summit was requested [possibly for late this
month] by eight members of Congress, including the Democratic and
Republican leaders of the two Armed Services Committees.  In a
January 9 letter to Defense Secretary Cheney, the eight urged "an
informal dialogue between the executive and legislative branches
to foster a more collegial approach for implementing acquisition
reform." Objective: "To organize in a bipartisan manner a
specific strategy for implementation," including: Defining a list
of specific improvements in acquisition that implements the
letter and spirit of the Packard initiatives; creating a
scorecard that measures progress in implementing the Packard
changes. The objective is to develop "an expectation or a
standard that is agreed to at the beginning for measuring the
status of implementation.  This scorecard could be the basis for
informal efforts to monitor and measure progress."

A-12 COST AND THE NAVY'S FIVE-YEAR AIRCRAFT PLAN

     A serious flap is now brewing over the cost of the Navy's
classified A-12 Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program,
following revelations last year of the much-higher-than-expected
costs for the classified B-2 bomber, which has put the number of
bombers to be procured in question, and of the Air Force Advanced
Tactical Fighter, which led one committee to attempt to zero the
program.

An indication that the cost of the A-12 would be $96 million per
copy was first reported last Wednesday by the Philadelphia
Inquirer.

The source was the just-released transcript of hearings by the
House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee last year, and the
following question submitted for the record by a committee
member:

"The January 1989 [Reagan Administration] budget [for fiscal
1990] included A-12 production through fiscal year 1994 of 106
aircraft for $10.2 billion.

Under the original budget profile, the Navy's medium attack force
would have been 75 percent A-12s and 25 percent A-6Es well beyond
the year 2000. How many A-6E aircraft will still be operating in
the year 2005 based on the amended [Bush Administration] budget
plans?"

The Navy responded that its desire is that "there will be no
active operational A-6E aircraft operating in fiscal year 2005.
The President's budget includes A-12 procurement" [deleted].

The Pentagon is declining comment on the matter, with some
officials quoted as saying that the number is in error.

OT&E TO ISSUE CAS/BAI AIRCRAFT FLY-OFF TEST PLAN APRIL 1

     The director of Operational Test and Evaluation will be
issuing a test plan for the Close Air Support (CAS)/Battlefield
Air Interdiction (BAI) aircraft fly-off around April 1 and a
Defense Acquisition Board review of the plan will follow shortly
after, an Air Force official told Defense Industry Report last
week.

The aircraft to be studied at the request of Congress are a
CAS/BAI modified F-16, the F/A-18, a modified A-10, the AV-8B
Harrier and the YA-7F (A-7 upgrade).  The A-10 Thunderbolt II can
no longer effectively carry out it CAS/BAI mission and the Air
Force has openly supported an A-16, a modified F-16.

The Air Force official said he does not anticipate any changes in
the CAS/BAI direction in 1991, but declined to comment on FY '91
CAS/BAI funding levels.  The Air Force allocated $56.8 million
for RDT&E in FY '90 for 146 CAS modified Block 30 F-16s, $20
million for 225 modified A-10s and a prototype program for two
YA-7F planes at a cost of $97.2 million over FY '89-90.

CODSIA REVIEWING OMB RESTRICTIONS ON LOBBYING

     An ad hoc task group of the Council of Defense and Space
Industry Associations (CODSIA) is currently reviewing Interim
Final Guidelines issued by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) on December 20 concerning new restrictions on lobbying
activities and may issue a response to the government asking for
clarification on some of the guidelines, industry sources tell
Defense Industry Report.

The impetus for the new restrictions stems from legislation
sponsored by Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) last year which prohibits
the use of appropriated funds for lobbying. An OMB source said
last month that the Office had decided that "all levels of
subcontractors would be held accountable" under the lobbying
restrictions.

According to one industry source, there are a number of areas of
concern in the OMB guidelines but "depending on how the language
is interpreted, there may be no problems." He noted that the ad
hoc group "has to narrow down the troublesome issues in the
guidelines, agree on them, and keep them to significant areas."

One area he pointed to that may contain problems is the "question
of allowability of costs for full-time employees engaged in
certain activities." He described these costs as either direct or
indirect and associated with a particular contract. "We want more
clarity in these regulations. We need to know the parameters of
the playing field."

Industry's comments to OMB must be submitted by February 18.

V-22 SUPPORTER BEGIN EFFORT TO COUNTER TERMINATION

    Congressional supporters of the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft
program will begin informal meetings this week to formulate
strategy in light of the Administration's attempt to terminate
the controversial program again in the FY '91 defense budget,
congressional supporters of the program told Defense Industry
Report last week.

"We need to sit down and form a grand strategy," a source said
recently. "This is not the final decision (the Administrations
budget). The final decision is to be made by Congress."

Last year the Administration unsuccessfully attempted to kill the
V-22 but proponents eventually won $255 million for R&D,
retaining the project another year.  Sources also said the
termination of the V-22 could have a negative effect on the
Army's LHX helicopter program, with V-22 backers retaliating
against the LHX.
"Initially there were major fights over the LHX," the source
said. "I thought they (Congress) might have cut it last year.
Right now it is birdseed (inexpensive), but when it gets to
procurement it's going to be a big ticket program. That is when
it will have trouble."

The real fight over the LHX is expected in FY '92, when the up to
$180 billion in DoD budget cuts are to be effected.

CBO LIST OF POSSIBLE $18.5 BILLION IN DOD CUTS

     The Congressional Budget Office, in warning last week of an
$11.4 billion shortfall in funding for 30 tactical
missiles/torpedoes in the Five-Year Defense Plan [not including
the proposed $140-$180 billion in cuts to the FYDP], listed as
one option, cancellation or deferral of seven programs, which it
said would save $18.5 billion in the FYDP which could be used to
make up the missile shortfalls They are:

     *  F-l5: cancel remaining procurement.  Saving: $4.2
billion.
     *  AV-8B: cancel procurement. Saving: $1.2 billion.
     *  F-16: slow buy to 72 per year. Saving: $3.5 billion.
     *  SSN-688: cancel final submarine. Saving: $800 million.
     *  DDG-51: slow procurement to 3 per year. Saving: $6.4
billion.
     *  ADATS: cancel. Saving: $1.6 billion.
     *  Bradley Fighting Vehicle: slow procurement to 420 a year.

NAVY P-7 PROGRAM MAY BE ON TERMINATION LIST IN FY '91

     Faced with $180 billion in potential Department of Defense
cuts between 1992-'94, the Navy's $7.9 billion P-7 advanced anti-
submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft program could be terminated in
the FY '91 budget because of design problems and scheduling
delays, Navy and congressional sources tell Defense Industry
Report.

However, Lockheed Spokesman Jim Ragsdale said that although
errors in the full-scale engineering development stage has cost
Lockheed $300 million in a fourth quarter 1989 write-off, the
delay has not cost the Navy additional money. Ragsdale said he
has heard nothing of the Navy terminating the P-7 program.

Lockheed won the contract for the P-7 as a follow-on to the P-3
ASW aircraft. It said that the basic body of the aircraft would
be the same, according to sources. Ragsdale said that following
specific tests during the full-scale engineering development
stage "We found it wasn't as possible to have commonality between
parts." That had an effect on scheduling and sources say it
required a redesigned aircraft "from the ground up."

Ragsdale could not say how long the delay would be, but said
Lockheed would formulate a detailed reassessment in the near
future.

Lockheed defeated Boeing and McDonnell Douglas to develop a Long
Range Air Anti-submarine Warfare Capability Aircraft (LRAACA) in
Oct. 1988. The other contractors had proposed building a LRAACA
from existing planes.

The Navy originally planned to procure 125 P-7s at a flyaway cost
of $39.1 million in then-year dollars.

MISSILE FUNDING COULD BE CUT DISPROPORTIONATELY--CBO

     Funding for missiles over the next five years may be cut by
disproportionately large amounts based on past practices, leaving
the services with less than adequate stocks of modern munitions,
according to a new study (*) released by the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO).

The actual amount requested for munitions in 1990 was reduced by
42 percent from the previous Administration's 1990 estimate, CBO
said.

To meet requirements set by the services for 30 modern missiles
would require nearly $11.4 billion in additional funding over the
five-year level proposed by the Bush Administration, the report
said.  The 1990 Bush defense budget, which is what the CBO study
is based on, called for a ten percent cut in overall funding for
conventional munitions.

Over the next five years, between 1990 and 1994, the
Administration had planned to spend $9.1 billion on munitions
programs that have initial funding (either for procurement or
development) included in the initial 1990-1991 budget request.

These included: Follow-on to Lance $.8 billion (R&D); Non-Line-
of-Sight $1.6 billion (procurement and R&D); Advanced Antitank
Weapon System $2 billion (procurement and R&D); ASAT $1.4 billion
(R&D); Navy Joint Standoff Weapon System $.2 billion (R&D); Sea
Lance $1.2 billion (procurement and R&D); Air Force Joint
Standoff Weapon $.3 billion (R&D); Short-Range Attack Missile-
Strategic $1.3 billion (procurement and R&D); Short-Range Attack
Missile-Tactical $.3 billion (R&D).

B-2 TO UNDERGO STRUCTURAL CHANGES

     An auto-pilot system and computer software are being
integrated into the B-2 Stealth Bomber along with structural
changes to increase load-bearing and speed capabilities during
its five month lay-up period, Air Force officials told Defense
Industry Report last week.

One official said that the auto-pilot, which was planned early
on, was not integrated earlier because the package had not
arrived in time.  He also said the software will be used in the
B-2's sophisticated computer system auto-pilot.
Sources said the structural changes are necessary to prepared the
aircraft for the Radar Cross Section (RCS) or Low Observable (LO)
testing to take place in the Phase II test period.  Sources told
Defense Industry Report that new bolts are being installed on the
wings of the stealthy aircraft to improve its load-bearing
capabilities. They also said that "a couple" RCS profiles will be
flown in Phase I, which are practice runs for the aircraft to
prepare for Phase II. Specifics on RCS testing are classified.

Overall, 13 B-2s will be built with the second bomber expected in
April.  Sources say six of the first 13 are delegated for testing
and three of those six are in the final stages of construction.

The first two planes are for testing all aspects of the plane,
while the remaining test planes handle load bearing tests, flight
control regression testing (which tests the integrating of the
auto-pilot and software in the aircraft), and radar cross section
testing.

GEC AVIONICS PLANS 700 DEFENSE JOB CUT

    Faced with a decline in defense export orders, Britain's GEC
Avionics, which supplies equipment to the U.S. Air Force, plans a
cut of 700 employees over the next two years.  GEC says the
reduction reflects a decline in the current export program and is

FIVE F-16S DELIVERED TO SINGAPORE

     Singapore took delivery this week of the first five of eight
F-16 fighters on order from the U.S.  The aircraft were ordered
in 1985 under a package that included training of 100 F-16
Singapore pilots at Luke Air Base, Arizona.  The three remaining
fighters will be delivered by the end of this month.

YF-23 MAY FLY IN FEBRUARY

      The Northrop/McDonnell Douglas Advanced Tactical Fighter
(ATF) team will probably conduct its first flight test on the
YF-23 prototype in February, sources tell us.  The
Lockheed-Boeing-General Dynamics team could not be reached for
comment as to its schedule.

The first of two prototypes was delivered to the Air Force in
October and the second is "in a very advanced stage of
construction," a source said.

Sources said the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas twin-engine
"stealthy" prototypes are not in "flying wing" form like the B-2
bomber, but more like a conventional fighter.  Both have
virtually identical airframes, but the second plane may have more
advanced avionics, according to sources.  The Air Force has not
released photos of the plane.

One plane will be powered by new twin Pratt & Whitney F-119
engines, which are capable of cruising at supersonic speeds
without afterburners, according to an industry source.  This
makes the engines fuel efficient and less visible to infrared
sensors.  The F-119 is also capable of thrust vectoring, or
thrust manipulation, the source said.

The other will use twin General Electric F-120 engines, which are
derivatives of the GE F-110.  The engine will have thrust
vectoring nozzles that allow the engine thrust to be manipulated
in similar fashion to the Harrier fighter, but a source said it
will not hover.       * * * * * * * * * *

GE-SANDERS DELIVER INEWS ADM FOR YF-22

     The Sanders-General Electric INEWS team said last week that
it has delivered its initial Advanced Development Model (ADM) of
the advanced electronic warfare system to the Lockheed/
Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 team competing for the Advanced
Tactical Fighter (ATF).

[The teams of Sanders-GE and TRW-Westinghouse were selected for
Phase IB Dem/Val of INEWS in l986. The two teams were awarded $70
million increments 16 months ago for development of INEWS for ATF
and ATA, with work to be completed by December l990.]

The joint Air Force/Navy INEWS (Integrated Electronic Warfare
System) program is developing advanced modular electronic warfare
technology for the ATF and for avionics "upgrades" of the Navy's
A-12 Advanced Tactical Aircraft and existing platforms.

The ADM, which includes radar warning, electronic support
measures, and missile warning functions, will be used to
demonstrate overall avionics integration and sensor fusion and
will support avionics integration and testing of the Lockheed
team's ground-based laboratory and avionics flying laboratory.

According to Sanders, the ADM demonstrates advanced multi-
spectral sensor integration and common integrated processing,
improved direction finding and emitter identification accuracy
while operating in a high density signal environment.  It employs
real-time embedded Ada software hosted on the YF-22's common
integrated processor.

Lockheed Sanders President John Kreick said that testing of the
ADM, which will be used to determine the INEWS full-scale
development configuration, will "lessen the system integration
challenges encountered in some other recent EW programs,"
including processing architecture, total avionics integration,
radio frequency compatibility and software risk management.

Sanders will deliver a second ADM next month, which will undergo
range and receiver density testing and integration with other ATF
avionics at the YF-22 team's laboratory in Fort Worth.  A
spokesman declined further comment on the INEWS schedule.

MARTIN SAYS NEW TADS/PNVS COATING WILL SAVE $27.9 MILLION

  Martin Marietta said last week that a new long-life optical
coating it has developed for the TADS/PNVS night vision system
for the Apache helicopter will save the Army $27.9 million in
maintenance and spare parts costs over three years.

The new hard carbon coating is designed to last the 20-plus years
life of the aircraft and night vision system. The previous
coating, thorium fluoride, protects the windows for three years.
The new coating will be applied to the 161 new TADS/PNVS systems
on order and to 584 previously delivered units when their
original lens coating wears out.

JSTARS TO BEGIN FULL FUNCTIONALITY TESTING THIS YEAR

      The Air Force/Army Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar
System (JSTARS) is expected to become fully functional late this
year as the full-scale development (FSD) program moves toward its
conclusion, Grumman officials told Defense Industry Report last
week.

Meanwhile, in light of events in Eastern Europe Grumman is
assessing the feasibility of using the long-range surveillance
and battle management system for monitoring Warsaw Pact forces in
a future post-INF environment.

Once the program moves into phase eight, or full functionality,
JSTARS' phased-array radar antenna will be able to perform all of
its operational requirements, including synthetic aperture
functions.  This summer, the two 707 test aircraft will be turned
over to the Air Force and Army for operational test and
evaluation, which may last as long as 12 months.  An early 1991
contract award is anticipated; the Air Force plans to procure 22
JSTARS aircraft at a cost of $6.6 billion (including R&D);
another $1.1 billion will be spent for construction of 100 ground
stations.  JSTARS is slated for a 1997 deployment.

Although the primary focus of JSTARS has been and remains the
monitoring rear of echelon Warsaw Pact forces on the Central
European battlefield, "the Air Force and we see its efficacy as a
warning and verification instrument as we proceed to Open Skies
agreements and things of that sort," the officials said.


Grumman is also looking at the use of JSTARS in special
operations, low intensity conflict (SOLIC) scenarios and drug
intervention, officials said.  Senior Army TRADOC officials were
briefed on these areas late last month and showed interest,
although they said a great deal of analysis would have to be done
on the service's future roles prior to committing to JSTARS,
Grumman noted.  In addition, representatives of Central Command
recently made presentations at an industry forum which detailed
the potential application of JSTARS technology for supporting
SOLIC.  "I think what we are seeing is that the services are
looking at additional applications of systems, due to budgetary
constraints and the changing threat, which they did not look at
before," one Grumman official said.

SWEDEN LOOKS AT PRODUCING BATTLE TANK

     Sweden is continuing to study various tank design concepts
in the hopes of producing its own Main Battle Tank, the MBT-2000,
for service into the next century, Swedish officials tell Defense
Industry Report.  Swedish industry officials also tell us the
system may hit the international market after domestic
deployment.

The officials said a variety of options are on the drawing board
for a system to defeat all vehicles in its class as well as
future designs.  Sweden is also considering installation of a 140
mm high velocity penetrating projectile cannon.
The Swedish Defense Ministry, however, has not ruled out the
possibility of procuring the system from a foreign supplier.
Several U.S. and European models are being considered for the
role, including the M1A2, the German Leopard II, the British
Challenger II and the French Le Clerc.

Another option the nation is holding open is the off-the-shelf
purchase of all components  from another country to that meet the
specifications to produce a domestic design.  Officials of the
Swedish companies Bofors and Hagglunds said last week that they
could produce a an MBT-2000 protoype by 1995.

ARMY TO DEVELOP FUTURISTIC BODY ARMOR FOR SOLDIERS

      The Army is looking to develop a Soldier Integrated
Protective Ensemble (SIPE) as a "head to toe" state of the art
fighting system that would improve the survivability of soldiers
in a battlefield environment.

The SIPE demonstration would culminate with the field use of the
system in the third quarter of FY '92, prior to full-scale
development.  SIPE consists of three major subsystems: Headgear,
which would provide complete head, face, neck and eye ballistic
protection, soldier-to-soldier short and long range
communication, aural protection, vision enhancement/remote weapon
sight helmet-mounted display and laser eye protection;
Microclimatic Conditioning, which is a power source that
currently does not exist, but a generator/alternator design is
being sought driven by a Stirling cycle engine; and an integrated
modular Advanced Clothing System that will comprise handwear,
footwear, load bearing equipment, and a body protective system.

The system would protect against environmental, ballistic, flame,
thermal, chemical/biological, detection and directed energy.
Approximately 12-36 prototypes are expected for field
demonstration.

AUSTRALIA BEGINS CONSTRUCTION OF NEW SUBMARINES

   Australia's new conventional submarine program is running on
schedule and on budget, with the first hull sections of the six
new vessels now being joined, Australian defense officials tell
Defense Industry Report.  Funding for procuring the new system is
$3.221 billion in current dollars.

"Construction is underway (and) most of the hardware has already
been manufactured," the official said. "Now we have the usual
challenge of putting together all of the software packages."
Other than that, he said "the program has gone along happily
meeting all milestones...It's the only one in the world that's on
time and on cost."

The first model of the conventional submarine--based on Sweden's
Kockums Type 471 series--is slated for delivery to the Royal
Australian Navy (RAN) in January 1995 to replace the current
fleet of Oberon Class subs.  The contract, awarded to the
Australian Submarine Corp. Ltd., includes options for production
of two additional vessels, plus support equipment.

LACE/UVPI/ABE & RME SET FOR FEBRUARY LAUNCH

     Four space-based experiments to be conducted for the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) are set to be launched
together from Cape Canaveral early next month aboard a McDonnell
Douglas Delta II rocket.  This mission will also be the first
commercial launch of McDac's Delta II.

The experiments are the Low-Power Atmospheric Compensation
Experiment (LACE), the Ultraviolet Plume Instrument (UVPI), the
Army Background Experiment (ABE) and the Relay Mirror Experiment
(RME).  Two of the experiments, LACE and UVPI were developed at
the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) LACE will be the 79th NRL
satellite to be launched.

The LACE experiment consists chiefly of the 1400 kg LACE
satellite and several ground stations that will be used to
determine how well the atmospheric distortion of laser beams can
be corrected.  The propagation of laser beams through the
atmosphere and the principle of thermal blooming is one of the
most difficult challenges facing directed energy weapons
research.  By being a target for lasers, LACE will measure the
work on the problem.

The satellite contains more than 200 sensors that are able to
measure laser beam intensity.  There are three different sensor
arrays to measure different types of laser emission.  They are
visible band control wave (85 sensors), infrared continuous wave
(40 sensors) and pulsed lasers that emit in the near UV, visible
and shortwave IR (85 sensors).  The LACE target array is four
meters by four meters.

The satellite will be placed in an orbit 295 nautical miles above
the Earth and, since it will pass over the Air Force Maui Optical
Station (AMOS) at least once every 24 hours, it will allow for
laser experiments to be conducted daily.

DAB rules against Navy control of ASAT

     The Defense Acquisition Board has decided against Navy
control of the anti-satellite program despite Navy protestations
that a sea-based system will best serve the ASAT cause.
     In their review, the board rejected a Navy request to
transfer the ASAT program from Army's Strategic Defense Command
to the Navy's Strategic Systems Program Office.
     The Army is interested in developing a land-based ASAT that
could eventually be upgraded to sea duty. But the Navy wanted to
focus exclusively on the sea-based system, a move that many
suspect weighted the DAB review in the Army's favor.
     A request for proposals is expected sometime in January,
although a specific date has not been established. Judging by the
returns, the Army will borrow from technology based upon the
exoatmospheric re-entry interceptor system being developed under
the auspices of the Strategic Defense Initiative.
     Defense analysts believe the DAB's close-door review should
put an emphatic end to the Navy's insistent demands to head the
program, an issue that has left the program without a clear
operational objective until now.

     The Navy has awarded Raytheon Company a $273.7 million

     The Navy has awarded Raytheon Company a $273.7 million
contract for limited production of the Relocatable Over-the-
Horizon Radar (ROTHR). The decision comes following a
pronouncement by the U.S. Navy Space and Naval Warfare Systems
Command that the company's prototype ROTHR has passed all
operational test and evaluation protocols.
     ROTHR is designed to provide early warning of enemy attacks
by aircraft and ships against U.S. Navy battle groups. With a
operating arc of more than 60 degrees, ROTHR can detect targets
at a range of up to 1,800 miles. OTH radars operate by bouncing
radio waves off the Earth's ionosphere which bounces the waves
back to Earth.
     The first production system will be deployed in Virginia to
replace the prototype (on its way to Amchitka, Alaska) and
provide coverage of the Caribbean. The second unit will take up
residence on the island of Guam. The Navy has not specified the
eventual destination of the third radar.
     Raytheon received the production award in 1984 and has since
instituted over 495,000 lines of software code into the system.
Except for the radar's massive antennas, all of ROTHR is
transportable.

Corporate survival posture for 1990's: proactive

     There are two types of defense company staring into the
proverbial budget abyss of the 1990s: one which resigns itself to
a fiscally austere future like a deer frozen in the headlights
of some unavoidable disaster; and one that consolidates its
resources and aggressively seeks out new contracts, creating a
need where before there was none.
     NEWS ANALYSIS
     In a series of interviews conducted during the previous two
weeks, C3I Report has learned most contractors are
steering clear of window ledges and are focusing instead on areas
of growth, belt-tightening and resource consolidation.
     For example, TRW's Joseph Aro says the Information Network
Div. for which he works has four telemarketers making 1,200
outbound calls a week in an attempt to solicit new customers for
his company's products.
     A source with Lockheed Corp. suggests the company's decision
to integrate two of its subsidiaries -- Lockheed Electronics Co.
(LEC) with Sanders Associates -- is an indication that the
company is actively seeking the means to trim the fat and "do
what we do best." Lockheed laid off 1,000 of LEC's employees and
moved its operations into Sanders' Nashua, N.H. complex.
     Chrysler Corp. has placed its defense electronics operations
on the block in order to focus exclusively on the competitive
automobile market.
     Northrop Corp. announced plans to sell its spacious
headquarters building in Century City, Los Angeles. "In order to
reduce our debt, we're actively looking at the sale of our non-
operating assets," says Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio.
     The prime contractor for the B-2 is not the only military
aircraft maker to suddenly enter the real estate market. In
early December F-14 producer Grumman Corp. announced plans to
redevelop half its 500-acre Long Island property into a hotel,
shopping mall and office complexes.
     In each of these instances, company officers evaluated their
specific strengths and weaknesses and acted.
     "You've got to be proactive in the current environment,"
says TRW's Aro. "There are a lot of companies that are sitting
out there wringing their hands. That's not our approach."
Creating a market
     As marketing manager for TRW's networks division, Aro
focuses almost exclusively on the Unified Local Area Network
Architecture or ULANA contract, an Air Force system designed to
link military computers with one another. Aro is convinced his
office's aggressive telemarketing efforts are paying off. He said
market conditions for TRW's ULANA products is stronger than that
of Electronic Data Systems, the other prime contractor for ULANA.
     There is a lesson in all this, says Aro. "The more skittish
[contractors] believe anybody can lose their job. They think they
might be driving a truck soon.
     "Others," says Aro, "are charging ahead to get the job
done."

FAA-DOD controversy threatens GPS

     Just when you thought it was safe to go back out on the
water, the system that promises to get you to your destination
and back is again embroiled in bitter controversy.
     A number of aviation groups have complained to Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney and Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner that the Defense Dept. is blocking civil use of the
Pentagon's much-heralded Global Positioning System (GPS).
     GPS is a constellation of two dozen satellites, some of
which are already in orbit, intended to provide extremely
accurate navigation information to aircraft, ships, vehicles and
ground forces around the world.
     The Soviet Union has a similar system called GLONASS. The
Federal Aviation Administration hopes a single receiver can be
built to receive both GPS and GLONASS signals. If satellites are
to become the sole means of navigation, then neither the U.S. nor
Soviet system has enough satellites to provide the required
accuracy. But together they can do it.
     A letter sent to Skinner and Cheney Dec. 13 warns that
unnamed organizations within DOD may now be seeking to subvert
that goal. The unnamed organizations are accused of renewing the
issue of whether GPS data ought to be available to the civil
community, and issuing concerns about technology transfer.
     The on-again off-again GPS controversy is indicative of many
such instances when military and civilian protocols clash. In one
corner stands the Pentagon, ever-wary of the Soviet Union and any
technology transfers that might make their job more difficult. In
the other stands the FAA and related groups interested in
improving civilian navigation. Most years such a clash would have
resulted in a Pentagon victory. But recent developments and the
pervading atmosphere of glasnost may result in a darkhorse
victory.
Increased accuracy for DOD users
     Original plans were to offer a degraded, less accurate level
of GPS navigation for the civil community, while DOD users
would get the more accurate signals. Thus, an enemy could
navigate accurately enough for civil transportation, but could
not use GPS data to guide weapons.
     The current controversy over GPS access stems from an FAA
initiative to coordinate U.S. and Soviet tests of a joint
GPS/GLONASS receiver. FAA officials say the satellite navigation
program follows the terms of a bilateral transportation
cooperation agreement signed at the 1988 Moscow summit.
     The test program was proposed last spring in a joint U.S.-
Soviet working paper presented in Paris at the International
Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) future air navigation system
committee.  An agency of the United Nations, ICAO would use test
results to certify a GPS/GLONASS system as a reliable means of
navigation for international air travel.
     The U.S. and Soviet navigation systems could be augmented
and would form the foundation for a global navigation satellite
system (GNSS). This global system also could employ
geosynchronous calibration transmitters launched by other
nations.
     The multi-national GNSS would be less dependent on the whims
of either superpower. A U.S. aviation expert says this redundancy
is especially important for non-aligned countries who don't want
a navigation system that relies on the whims of a single
superpower.
     Under the plan proposed to ICAO, the U.S. and USSR
separately would build and test civil GPS/GLONASS receivers. FAA
officials say the programs would be done in parallel. Since
sales of civil GPS receivers are permitted under existing export
control regulations, FAA officials say there wouldn't be any need
to transfer hardware or technology. "We've had no difficulty
with the [DOD] tech transfer folks," one said.
     To aid the U.S. test program, FAA would like the Soviets to
provide a civil GLONASS receiver for study. This shouldn't be too
difficult, since Glavkosmos, the Soviet space marketing agency,
has already printed glossy brochures for its "Shkiper" receiver.
     The U.S. dual receiver would be built by M.I.T. Lincoln
Laboratories. The system, which could be modeled on one already
tested by Magnavox, would use orbital elements and time messages
transmitted by GPS and GLONASS satellites to calculate the
position and velocity of an aircraft.
     FAA officials say the two sides would only collaborate at
the end of the test program, sharing results of their navigation
tests. If each side's dual receiver is sufficiently accurate, the
two superpowers could propose ICAO adoption of GNSS.
Divergent views emerge -- again
     Although GPS and GLONASS travel in similar, semisynchronous
orbits, the two systems are not identical. A total of 21 primary
GPS and three spare satellites orbit in six planes, while 24
GLONASS spacecraft occupy three planes. The constellations also
use different formats to transmit position and time information.
     Several FAA officials have indicated they have no intention
of promoting a merger of GPS and GLONASS technology.
"`Commonality' is a trigger word that sets off alarms in the
Pentagon," one said. FAA officials say they won't sign any
agreement that would require DOD to change the way it operates
GPS satellites or its military receivers.
     Until recently, FAA's civil navigation initiative didn't
face any DOD opposition. An agency official said the GNSS joint
working paper was cleared with the Pentagon's C3I office.
     But FAA plans to proceed with the bilateral test program
were stalled when DOD's space operations policy office raised
objections to the effort. This opposition prevented FAA from
starting detailed discussions with their Soviet counterparts last
fall.
     The FAA is hoping to get back on track once the dust clears
from the DOD infighting. One FAA official says the problem may
stem from the space policy office's unfamiliarity with civil
aviation.
     Said one exasperated FAA official, "We are looking forward
to the day when we can work directly with [DOD's] C3I office
again. There's a real misunderstanding of what we're trying to
do [with space ops]."
     FAA's frustration is compounded by DOD's vagueness over
operating policies for GPS. In addition to encrypting the more
highly accurate navigation data for DOD users and providing
civilians with the less reliable data, DOD also reserves the
right to scramble GPS's second channel to frustrate enemy
attempts to spoof military receivers. While civil users could
still navigate with one channel, it would further degrade
navigational accuracy.
     The opening paragraph of the letter to Cheney and Skinner
states: "In 1983 President Reagan made the momentous decision to
make the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite navigation
system, developed by the U.S. Defense Department, available to
the world and to offer an accuracy of navigation which would not
compromise U.S. defense needs."
     Pentagon space ops officials, however, offer a different
interpretation, arguing that the "momentous decision" actually
alluded to a remark made by Reagan spokesman Larry Speakes at a
press conference.
     "If the Soviets are going to use our data for military
purposes, we are stupid. And if they are going to use it to
compete against us in the commercial market, we are still
stupid," a Pentagon officer said.
     He further accused the FAA of violating a written agreement
with the Pentagon barring even the discussion of sensitive
technology in the GPS system, let alone suggesting the
possibility of sharing it with the Soviets.
     "They agreed not to approach that topic, and have abandoned
it," he said.
Is GPS a navigational Everyman?
     The letter was sent to Cheney and Skinner by former FAA
chiefs Donald Engen, Najeeb Halaby, and Lynn Helms. It is also
signed by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the Air
Line Pilots Association, the Airport Operators Council
International, the Air Transport Association, and the National
Business Aircraft Association. It was sent to the media by the
Airport Operators Council International. Questions to that group
were referred to the FAA.
     Another bone of contention within the Pentagon is whether
geoid data should be shared with the Soviets. Geoidal data
describes the absolute shape of world in computer language where
the potential for gravity is considered a constant at any point.
This is the manner in which satellites view the Earth. Many
believe the United States boasts a much more accurate geoidal map
of the world and are reluctant to share this information with the
Soviets. (C3I Report 9/18/89).
     The DOD official said the root issue is whether GPS will
serve as the only navigational system for both military and
civilian users. The military, he noted, won't stand for it. The
FAA is seen at the Pentagon as wanting GPS to replace everything
else: VOR navigation (which makes up the current airway system),
NDB navigation (used in the middle of the century) and LORAN C
navigation.
     There is also mistrust over whether the FAA would simply
hand actual components to the Soviets, rather than data the
Soviets could use to develop their own components for GPS
receivers. The United States has built a GLONASS receiver using
Soviet data.
     Civil aviation experts point to the voluntary submission of
GLONASS information to the U.S. as a testament to the Soviet's
commitment to a joint program. This reversal, which occurred in
early 1988, followed years of Soviet stonewalling on discussing
any details of its system.
     If DOD blocks civil use of GPS, it will be a blow to work
already in progress for use of the system on airplanes and ships.
Officials of the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics said
they were informed of the controversy by AOCI, but will continue
their work. RTCA is a federal advisory group charged with setting
technical standards for receivers that can use both the U.S. and
Soviet satellite navigation systems. Work is already completed on
systems standards for GPS use by the civil sector.
     Work is also in progress on operations performance standards
for aircraft systems, and should be completed by the end of 1990.
There is also work in progress on integrating the Soviet system
with GPS, enabling aircraft to navigate solely with GPS, GLONASS
or both.
     If the Pentagon can be convinced to allow civil use of GPS
for aircraft, separation standards could be reduced safely,
allowing more aircraft to use trans-Atlantic routes at one time.
     An RTCA official said a receiver for the Soviet system has
been built under an FAA contract to Mitre, Bedford, Mass.
     And the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime has a group
formed to advise the federal government on standards for GPS
systems aboard ships.
TAKE OUT QUOTE: "We are looking forward to the day when we can
work directly with [DOD's] C3I office again. There's a real
misunderstanding of what we're trying to do [with space ops]." --
 FAA official on GPS turmoil.

Milstar: all wired and nothing to control

     With little fanfare, the Air Force quietly installed a huge
control room for Milstar communications satellites.
     Located in Air Force Space Command's Consolidated Space
Operations Center (CSOC), the Milstar control room is now in the
final stages of installation at Falcon AFB, Colo.
     Formally known as Mission Control Center 3, the Milstar
control room will be able to handle an operational constellation
of 10 extremely high frequency communications satellites. During
a crisis or war, the Falcon center could control satellites
through fixed and mobile ground stations.
     Although MCC-3's IBM 3090 computers are nearly hooked up and
ready to run, the control center won't do much satellite
controlling for the next two or three years. A continuing series
of technical problems and funding cuts will delay the launch of
the first Milstar satellite until at least 1992.
     Until the first Milstar flies, SSD plans to use the center
for software development and training. This debugging period will
be an unaccustomed luxury for SSD, which is three years behind
schedule on three other Falcon control centers.
     SSD plans to turn over its first CSOC center to Space
Command this month. The MCC-1A center controls Navstar
navigational satellites. MCC-1B, which controls meteorological
and missile warning satellites, will be turned over in January.
An MCC-2 control room for four communications satellite systems
will be operational late next year.

Cash-strapped Navy seeking softer deals

     Declining funding has forced the Navy to get tougher 
with environmental regulators in cleanup agreement 
negotiations.
     However, the Navy is discovering it's too late to back out 
of agreements already made.
     In a recent guidance for active-base cleanups, the Navy's 
assistant secretary for installations and environment said, 
"enforceable milestones in negotiated legal agreements must 
fit within budget and FYDP [five-year defense plan] 
controls."
     The assistant secretary, Robert Pirie, added all new 
agreements must provide for "'rolling milestones' 
established in the light of relative risk and budget 
considerations." Under this approach cleanup deadlines only 
will become enforceable in the year Congress funds the 
cleanup work.
     Pirie also urged the Navy to revisit existing legal 
agreements with environmental regulators. The agreements 
should be, "if legally possible, amended to reflect funding 
controls and risk management factors."
     However, the Navy will have to buck environmental 
regulators to avoid busting its budget plan, contended a 
briefing at a recent Navy environmental meeting.
     The plan calls for the Navy to spend $1.5 billion over the 
next five years, with 53% going to the Naval Facilities 
Engineering Command's West Coast organizations, 28% to 
NAVFAC's Atlantic Div., 12% to the Southern Div. and 7% 
to the Pacific Div.
     Last year NAVFAC field divisions arranged meetings 
with eight Environmental Protection Agency regions, 14 
states and Guam. In the meetings, the NAVFAC officials 
sought to reach a consensus on renegotiating cleanup 
agreements so the Navy can win regulatory approval without 
overspending.
     But the regulators declined to renegotiate, saying the 
Navy must start asking Congress for all the money it needs 
to protect human health and the environment. Typically, the 
Defense Dept.'s comptroller cuts service cleanup requests 
before they get to Congress.
     On the East Coast, EPA officials stressed the need for 
the Navy to tell Congress how much it really needs. They 
also questioned why so much of the spending is planned for 
the West Coast.
     On the West Coast, EPA officials flatly declined to 
negotiate extensions, and said the plan lacked enough money 
even for the priority projects.
     California and Washington refused to renegotiate. So did 
Florida, though other southern states said they might be 
willing to talk about it.
     "There will be ramifications" if the Navy adheres to its 
spending plan without renegotiating agreements, the briefing 
stated. The Navy is likely to attract heavy enforcement 
activity, including stipulated penalties, hazardous-waste 
orders, fines and penalties, lawsuits against the commanding 
officers of installations and citizen suits against the Navy and 
the environmental regulators.

Corps to incinerate Weldon Springs soil

     The head of the Environmental Protection Agency has 
allowed an Army incineration job in Missouri to proceed by 
freeing it from tough state permitting requirements.
     The Army Corps of Engineers Kansas City Dist. is 
closer to burning explosives-laced soil at the Army's 
Weldon Springs Ordnance Works, Mo., now that EPA 
Administrator Carol Browner has overruled state 
environmental regulators.
     The corps proposed to excavate approximately 30,000 
cubic yards of TNT and DNT contaminated soil and 
materials for incineration in a mobile on-site rotary kiln 
incinerator at a cost of $22 million to $27 million.
     Before the design contractor, IT Corp. of Irvine, Calif., 
could finish the 95% design phase of the Weldon Springs 
cleanup project, the Missouri Dept. of Natural Resources 
demanded the corps get a Resource Conservation and 
Recovery Act (RCRA) permit. The corps wanted to proceed 
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which doesn't 
require permits.
     Browner, who is the final arbiter of disputes among 
parties to the site's cleanup agreement, ruled that CERCLA 
should trump RCRA because the treatment will take place 
on a listed Superfund site. In such cases, the Superfund law 
requires projects to meet the substantive requirements of 
permits without actually getting the permits.
     The Weldon Springs Ordnance Works is divided into 
two main sites -- the ordnance works and the chemical plant 
area used by the Energy Dept. during the Cold War. DOE 
will cleanup its area separately.
     The Army is left to cleanup an area of soil contaminated 
with TNT and DNT covering more than 100 isolated 
locations. There is also a 16 mile-long contaminated wooden 
pipeline to be excavated and cleaned up.
     Under the corps' proposed plan, the Army will excavate 
and incinerate contaminated soil. The resulting ash, after 
sampling and testing, will be backfilled on site.
     Ash with high lead levels and soils contaminated with 
lead will be stabilized and placed in a hazardous waste 
landfill.
     Through an agreement between the Army and DOE, the 
Army will dispose of its waste in a DOE planned landfill 
which is expected to be built in 1998. In the meantime, the 
Army waste will be stored on-site.
     Although it would be easier to build the incinerator near 
the entrance to the ordnance works property, the Army, after 
receiving comments on its proposal, agreed to site the 
incinerator in a remote area away from residences and 
schools.
     The Army expects that the incinerator will be dismantled 
and removed as soon as the contaminated soil and wooden 
pipeline have been treated, the plan said.
     The corps is waiting to retrieve the money for the cleanup 
project from a general fund in its Formerly Used Defense 
Sites program before issuing a solicitation for the incinerator 
and soil excavation project. 
     Work at the site will include excavation, demolition, 
upgrading infrastructure and wood shredding.
     Tom Lorenz, the EPA project manager for the site, said a 
final decision to clean up the site will be signed in the next 
few months. After that, the corps has 15 months to begin 
remediation.
     For more information, call Tom Lorenz of the EPA at 
913-551-7292; Steve Iverson, project manager with the 
corps at 816-426-2671; or Chris Davidson with the state at 
314-751-3176.

Tooele locals press for emergency equipment

     Local officials are trying to prevent startup of the 
chemical weapons incinerator at Tooele Army Depot in Utah 
until they get enough money to deal with any accidental 
release of chemical agents.
     All three county commissioners and the heads of other 
agencies are asking the state to hold off on permitting trial 
burns to force the Army to come up with at least another $5 
million to complete their emergency response preparations.
     Officials say funding so far has been piecemeal, leaving 
the county with only a third of a communications system 
and no equipped and trained response team.
     "Our concern is that they're going to start incinerating 
weapons before we are ready," explains Tooele County 
Commissioner Lois McArthur.
     But the state solid and hazardous waste division says the 
trial burns are allowed under the original permit issued in 
1989, even though the Army still needs to submit 
modifications for division approval. The division considers 
emergency response a political issue outside its realm.
     Raymond Duda, a division staff engineer, says he can't 
understand why it's so important to have the emergency 
equipment now when the county has been living with the 
chemical arms for years. The depot has 42% of the nation's 
chemical weapons stockpile, much of it in 80-year-old 
containers that are getting leaky.
     County officials say national policy requires the 
community to be prepared and that the Army has not come 
forth to pay for it.
     "As I understand it, the county has an obligation to be 
prepared for anything that comes off base," says 
Commissioner McArthur. "If it's on base, the Army takes 
care of it."
     According to Kari Sagers, county emergency 
management director, the Army has provided about $8 
million since 1989, "a little bit at a time." In 1993, she says, 
the Army proposed spreading funding for the 
communications system over three years because of a tight 
budget, but the county got only the first year.
     "Now we have only a third of a communications system 
with sites but no generators," says Sagers.  "If we need to 
use a station we have to send somebody up with a portable 
unit."
     She estimates that between $5 million and $8 million is 
needed just for the rest of the critical items.
     Tooele County in western Utah is a sparsely populated 
area with about 18,000 residents in the town of Tooele 10 
miles from the incinerator site and about 8,000 in Grantsville 
20 miles away. Another 800 live in Rush Valley which is 
only a few miles from the site.

Group blasts Army over depleted uranium

     An environmental group this week urged the Army to 
stop using depleted uranium bullets and armor, and clean up 
what it has used, citing the Army's own environment, safety 
and health study.
     The Military Toxics Project based in Norway, Maine, 
obtained a copy of the study, a technical report by the Army 
Environmental Policy Institute in Atlanta, even though it 
said the Army refused to release it.
     The study analyzed the potential dangers of depleted 
uranium in the production, testing and fielding of weapon 
systems, focusing on the Operation Desert Storm battlefield.
     Depleted uranium is a byproduct of the nuclear weapons 
program's efforts to extract the fissile isotope U-235 from 
uranium ore for use in weapons. 
     The Army uses depleted uranium for tank destroying 
bullets because it's plentiful, it's twice as dense as lead, it 
catches fire when it hits, and it tends to fragment and 
ricochet or turn to dust after entering enemy tanks.
     The depleted uranium produces 0.4 microCuries/gram of 
radiation, about 60% of the 0.7 uC/g that emanates from 
uranium ore. Inhaled, it can lodge in the lungs, where its 
alpha radiation can slowly cause damage. Ingested, it 
concentrates in the kidneys, where it is toxic at low 
concentrations, as well as in the liver and bones.
     Uranium oxides are very water soluble and mobile in 
soil, although anaerobic conditions or decayed plant matter 
can stall them. Soil cleanup standards are 35 
picoCuries/gram  averaged over 100 square meters, and 100 
pCi/gram per square meter.
     The Army reported some remediation of depleted 
uranium bullets at domestic firing ranges. However, 
typically only half of the rounds fired are recovered at Yuma 
Proving Grounds, Ariz., and just 21% at more densely 
vegetated Jefferson Proving Grounds, Ind., and Aberdeen 
Proving Grounds, Md.
     Generally, the bullets, contaminated soil and other 
materials are handled as low-level radioactive waste and sent 
to Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensed sites for 
disposal.
     The report said the Army faces no requirement to remove 
the estimated 14,000 rounds of depleted uranium that litter 
Operation Desert Shield practice ranges in Saudi Arabia and 
the Desert Storm battlefield. "Remediation of battlefields is 
not historically the responsibility of the victor," the report 
said. "This task typically belongs to the indigenous 
population." Even so, the United States and its allies spent 
hundreds of millions of dollars removing unexploded 
ordnance and mines from the Desert Storm battlefield.
     The report appraised several cleanup technologies. It also 
urged the Army to pursue plans to recycle used depleted 
uranium bullets and related waste, as well as to promote the 
use of catch boxes on firing ranges. It also urged the Army 
to provide more funding for depleted uranium waste 
disposal. And it suggested the Army prepare a 
programmatic "life-cycle environmental document" or 
environmental impact statement to serve as an umbrella 
environmental planning document.
     The study's lead author was Stephen Shelton, a civil 
engineering professor with the University of New Mexico.

Hanford solicitation modified

     The Energy Dept.'s Richland (Wash.) Operations Office 
has modified its request for proposals for the Project 
Hanford Management Contract based on some 2,000 
comments to last year's draft RFP.
     The department took extra steps, it said, to make sure all 
offerors "have an equal opportunity to be selected even if 
they have no past DOE experience." For example, the 
technical and management criteria stress that it doesn't matter 
whether the contractor has worked at Hanford or any DOE 
site.
     DOE said it added a section on outcomes and success 
criteria after several commenters asked what DOE wants 
that's different from the "old way" of doing business.
     DOE said the statement of work was strengthened to 
define the site cleanup effort as a project, just as "in 
commercial project management." Other changes include 
more detail on the tank waste cleanup, on the relationships 
with other prime contractors, and on the transition period 
work scope.
     DOE reduced the infrastructure scope of work and 
recommended bidding it out on a fixed or fixed-unit price 
basis.
     The final RFP emphasizes cost reduction, including 
aggressive make-or-buy analysis.
     DOE plans to "privatize" treatment of high-level tank 
waste by paying a fee for treatment service to a contractor 
that raises its own capital to build the treatment facilities. 
However, the department is reserving the right, if it decides 
against privatizing, to ask the Hanford management 
contractor to handle the job instead.

Contractor roles detailed

     The Project Hanford Management Contractor is to 
assume its full duties by Oct. 1, 1996 -- six months before 
the March 31, 1997, expiration of the recently extended 
contract with incumbent Westinghouse Hanford Co.
     DOE said it plans to terminate the Westinghouse contract 
early, as well as direct Westinghouse to terminate its 
subcontracts with ICF Kaiser and Boeing Computer 
Services.
     Bechtel's cleanup contract will remain separate. It runs 
through 1999, with an option for three more years.
     DOE said MACTEC, its general support service 
contractor for the site, might face a conflict of interest if it's 
on a team that wins the contract.
     Every year, starting this Dec. 1, the contractor is to give 
DOE an "Advanced Acquisition Plan" that details the next 
two years of subcontracting plans.
     To keep major subcontracts on their toes, they are limited 
to two years with three option years.
     The standard industrial classification code is 8744, 
facilities support management services, with a small 
business size standard of $5 million average annual revenues 
or 500 employees.

Written proposals stressed

     Richland decided against the strictly oral proposal process 
used for the recent Savannah River re-compete, although 
oral presentations will have a role.
     A pre-proposal conference is set for Jan. 23, with site 
tours on Jan. 24 and 25.
     Written proposals are due March 15. Oral presentations 
will follow within a week. Selection will be based mainly on 
the written proposals, with the orals used to evaluate the 
technical knowledge, understanding, leadership, 
appropriateness and ability to work together of the offeror's 
key personnel.
     Offerors will propose three fee arrangements, assuming: 
they draw money as needed from the federal treasury via a 
letter-of-credit; they use their own money, then file invoices 
to get reimbursed every seven days; or they get reimbursed

DRMS offers cheap way to dispose of waste

     The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service wants 
your hazardous waste -- and is willing to accept the liabilities 
that go with it.
     DRMS, a defense agency headquartered in Battle Creek, 
Mich., wants the military services to come to it for disposal 
of hazardous waste from their installations.
     Paul Mank of DRMS told the American Defense 
Preparedness Assn.'s Hazardous Material and Waste 
Management conference in Alexandria, Va., this week that 
DRMS will dispose of hazardous waste at no cost to the 
customer and will take on all liabilities and fines associated 
with waste disposal.
     DRMS can remove hazardous waste pretty cheaply, too, 
Mank told the conference. DRMS disposal cost/lb. has 
declined 37% since 1992:

Fiscal year                    1992     1993     1994     1995
waste (in millions of lbs.)     247      285      350      332
cost (in million of dollars)   $128     $136     $137     $107
cost/lb                        $.51     $.44     $.39     $.32

     DRMS also takes on all liability involved in waste 
disposal, "keeping you out of trouble," Mank said. He said 
DRMS assumes liability for all actions under the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Toxic 
Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 
(CERCLA) -- even though CERCLA liability reaches waste 
generators, such as the installations that give DRMS their 
waste.
     "We spent $25 million on CERCLA cleanup costs alone 
in the late 1980s," Mank said, adding that DRMS takes care 
of all fines also.
     DRMS offers several basic services as well as some 
extras, Mank said.
     Basic services include: offering regional DOD contracts; 
waste-code pricing system; tracking/payment at disposal; 
Milsbills accounting; industry knowledge and contacts; and 
pricing for accelerated removals.
     Other work, such as tank and oil waste separator 
cleanups, waste characterization and recycling/reclamation, 
are extra services DRMS is doing on a more regular basis, 
Mank said.

DRMS contracts for disposal

     DRMS has long-term and short-term contracts with 
hazardous-waste companies to remove hazardous waste 
frequently enough so that installations don't have to get 
storage permits, said Thomas Wallenfang of DRMS' 
hazardous contracts division.
     DRMS has about 90 long-term RCRA contracts, 
including five for polychlorinated biphenyl waste and 
another five for compressed gas cylinders, as well as 
emergency contracts as needed.
     Long-term contracts are usually for 12 months to 18 
months with one- to three-year options, Wallenfang said. 
Each contract is tailored to each specific Defense Dept. 
customer, he added.
     Key DRMS contracting contacts for pre-award 
information are:
     ** DRMS (East) -- Ron Bayes, 616-961-7132
     ** DRMS (West) -- Barbara Heffner, 616-961-7136
     ** DRMS Chief - Tom Wallenfang, 616-961-7129
     Contacts for post-award information are:
     ** DRMS (East) - Ethel Carter, 614-962-6501
     ** DRMS (West) -- Ernie Bertagnolli, 801-399-7821
     ** DRMS Chief - Steve Sprague, 616-961-7107.

Remedial action contracts capacity remains

     The Naval Facilities Engineering Command still has 
plenty of contracting capacity -- more than $1.7 billion -- left 
in its remedial action contracts (RACs).
     The NAVFAC divisions and field activities awarded nine 
RACs worth more than $75 million. None of the bigger 
RACs have even come close to reaching contracting 
capacity. Only one has surpassed the $100 million mark.
     Eight other RACs were awarded in the early 1990s worth 
between $10 million and $40 million. NAVFAC officials in 
Port Hueneme, Calif., awarded these contracts in 1991 and 
1992 for specific contaminants such as polychlorinated 
biphenyl and petroleum, oil and lubricant waste. These 
contracts have been fully obligated.

Air Force looking for options

     The Air Force is looking for non-toxic, more efficient 
ways to deice its airfields and aircraft.
     Lt. Col. Robert Wallett, director of environment for the 
Air Force's civil engineer, told the American Defense 
Preparedness Assn. Hazardous Material and Waste 
Management conference in Alexandria, Va., this week that 
the Air Force needs alternatives to ethylene glycol and 
propylene glycol for deicing.
     The Air Force is prohibited from using ethylene glycol 
for deicing because of its toxicity, Wallett said. He added 
that propylene glycol, although widely used, isn't very 
effective.
     The Defense Dept. is required by executive order to 
reduce its toxic releases by 50% by 1999. 
     The Air Force is already making strides in that area, 
Wallett said.
     The Air Force has reduced its ozone depleting substances 
purchases by 78.1% over the past three years, Wallett told 
the conference. Its hazardous waste disposal numbers have 
also dropped by 33%, he added.
      Wallett said the Air Force is looking into alternatives to 
other toxic substances the services uses for daily activities. 
The major thrust areas include: cleaning and degreasing; 
plating and surface finishing; nonchrome conversion 
coating; paint stripping; painting and coating materials; 
painting and coating processes; fire suppression; elimination 
of toxic materials; hazardous and toxic wastes; and volatile 
organic compounds.
     The Wright Laboratory in Ohio is performing research in 
these and other areas, Wallett said, adding that industry 
support is needed.

IG describes recent findings

     The Energy Dept.'s inspector general has issued a 
summary of its audits, inspections and investigations 
completed in the six months ending Sept. 30, 1995. Here are 
highlights of reports not previously digested in Defense 
Cleanup.
     ** An M&O contractor used only $1.6 million of the 
$8.4 million DOE Dept. had approved for merit pay 
increases. DOE gives this contractor incentives for reducing 
costs, but shouldn't for withholding pay, the IG said (No. 
S93IS046).
     ** DOE suspended a small, disadvantaged business 
from its vendor list after an IG investigation. The 
investigation followed a complaint that a procurement 
official with an M&O contractor was steering business to 
the company employing his wife.
     The IG found the contractor had given the company 
$594,000 of work, and the M&O contracting officer had 
requested 226 orders for additional purchases to be awarded 
the company. The official said he and his wife had been 
friends with the company's owner for 10 years (No. 
I92OR002).
     ** IG investigators found invoices showing a DOE 
subcontractor employee had sold 10.5 tons of DOE's copper 
pipe to a scrap dealer for more than $25,000 in cash.
     In subsequent investigations, the IG found the employee 
and two others had been removing truckloads of copper pipe 
and fittings from a salvage area.
     The subcontractor, which was demolishing the K-25 
cooling tower at DOE's Oak Ridge, Tenn., site, suspended 
the workers.
      DOE agreed with IG recommendations to: add 
procedures to prevent such thefts; survey all recovered 
metals for radiation; recoup $19,000 from the subcontractor; 
and hold the prime contractor more accountable (No. 
I95OR029).
     The IG also issued a number of audit reports during the 
six months ending Sept. 30, 1995. Here are two highlights:
     ** The IG questioned $1.59 million of costs incurred by 
Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Corp. 
during cleanup of DOE's Fernald, Ohio, site from Sept. 1, 
1992, to Sept. 30, 1993 (No. ER-C-95-03).
     ** On June 16, 1995, the IG reviewed the status of 
efforts to improve management information systems for 
environmental compliance activities (No. CR-L-95-21).
     Call 202-586-2744 to leave voice-mail requests for 
reports, or fax requests to 202-586-3636. Be sure to give the 
report number. For more information, call Wilma Slaughter,

DOE drafts Mound offer

     Next week, the Energy Dept.'s Miamisburg (Ohio) Area 
Office plans to announce a draft request for proposals for a 
contract to phase out operations and clean up the 
department's Mound Plant in Miamisburg.
     The announcement will appear in the Commerce 
Business Daily.
     Contractors have grown increasingly interested in this 
procurement. One source said the major players include ICF 
Kaiser, Teledyne Brown, Morrison Knudsen, Jacobs 
Engineering Group, OHM, Parsons, Fluor and Babcock & 
Wilcox.
     EG&G Mound Applied Technologies told DOE last 
May it would not pursue a planned two-year extension of its 
contract to run the site, which expires this Sept. 30.
     DOE officials realized they needed to act quickly to hire a 
successor, but first they had to develop a contracting strategy 
and address stakeholder concerns. The department is 
considering exercising a contract clause allowing it to 
unilaterally extend EG&G's contract by a year while it 
proceeds with the procurement (Defense Cleanup, 6/2/95, 
10/20/95, 11/17/95).
     DOE has developed a plan to accelerate the site's cleanup 
by spending less money faster. DOE plans to close out the 
site in 13 years for just $1.1 billion instead of taking 30 
years and $2.2 billion (Defense Cleanup, 6/2/95).
     The contacts for the draft RFP are Barry Kain, 513-865-
3843, and Erma Brown, 513-865-3030.

Army spurned sludge burning

     The Army incinerated liquids from the Rocky Mountain 
Arsenal's Basin F, not sludge as reported in the Dec. 15, 
1995, issue of Defense Cleanup.
     The Army gathered the Denver site's Basin F sludge into 
a waste pile and capped it. Later, the Environmental 
Protection Agency urged the Army to thermally desorb 
contamination from the piled sludge and incinerate the off-
gas. However, the Army instead has proposed to landfill the 
material (Defense Cleanup, 11/17/95).

Kaho'olawe effort delayed

     Difficulties coordinating all the players have delayed the 
solicitation for cleanup of Kaho'olawe Island in Hawaii.
     The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific Div. 
expected to issue a draft solicitation last Nov. 30. Now the 
draft isn't likely to hit the streets until late this month or early 
next.
     Last year, the Navy transferred the island to the state. 
However, the Navy, which used the island as a bombing 
range for 50 years, must now restore it. But that involves 
coordinating several Navy organizations, state officials, 
representatives of native Hawaiians, the Air Force and the 
Army Corps of Engineers.

Hanford improvements touted

     The Energy Dept. says contract reform is making a big 
difference at Westinghouse Hanford Co.'s Solid Waste 
Disposal Div.
     A year ago, DOE subjected the Hanford, Wash., 
operation to a new contract that contains no award fee, sets 
specific objectives, and has penalties for missing them. The 
division has since cut costs by nearly $20 million, while 
beating deadlines and safety goals.
     Meanwhile, long-range, cost-cutting efforts have reduced 
disposal costs from $80/cubic foot of low-level waste in 
1992 to $20.
     And the average time to process waste acceptance papers 
is down from 60 days to six.

     David Asiello, the Pollution Prevention Branch chief in 
the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, prepared a 
presentation about the program to a meeting of Navy 
environmental managers. However, the Nov. 14-16 meeting 
in San Diego was cut short by a federal furlough.
     The Navy created the centrally managed and funded 
effort to meet new pollution prevention requirements from 
executive orders 12856 and 12873. Procurement is through 
the Naval Air Warfare Center in Lakehurst, N.J., and the 
Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center in Port 
Hueneme, Calif.
     Here's the funding profile in millions of dollars:

Procurement     FY94     FY95     FY96     FY97
Programmed       1.9     19.0     13.8     19.1
Obligated        1.9     16.9     0.0     0.0

     This year the Lakehurst center plans to buy aqueous parts 
washers, a hydraulic purifier, a particle counter, glovebox 
plastic media blasters, paint gun washers, a 55-gallon drum 
crusher, a halon 1301 recycling unit and a glycol recycler.
     The Port Hueneme center plans to buy 23 items, 
including a mobile reuse center, a solvent still, a sludge 
dewatering system, a vacuum blast machine, a dry ice 
blasting unit, a closed loop wash rack, an oil recovery unit, 
an oil filter sensor and a portable sand blasting recycler.
     The effort is run by a steering committee chaired by 
Asiello, 703-602-5334, and Dan Glass, 703-602-4497. 
Procurement contacts are Jill MacIntyre at Lakehurst, 808-
323-1108, and Rick Gardner at Port Hueneme, 805-982-
3686. The committee includes representatives of each of the 
Navy's major commands.

Navy sorts out conversion programs

     The Navy wants to bring some coherence to its
disparate defense conversion efforts.
     To do that, the service is considering appointing a
conversion czar or creating a new office, said Rear Adm.
Mark Peleaz, who has just begun working in his new
position as chief of naval research. He heads the Office of
Naval Research (ONR). The person placed in charge of
defense conversion should have real decision-making
authority, he said. "Defense conversion needs a clear
leadership position."
     A central office could help the Navy better
communicate technology transfer opportunities, Peleaz
told Defense Conversion. "Our job is to communicate
what we have," he said. "We need to understand where
things are available commercially and how to make
technology transfer easier."
     The Navy could have a better idea on how to
proceed later this week when it receives recommendations
from the Naval Research Advisory Committee Panel on
Defense Conversion. The panel met late last month at
ONR in Arlington, Va., to hear industry recommendations
and find out about technology programs in civilian
agencies. The panel is made up of industry, university and
Navy executives.
     Interestingly, there were no presentations of Air
Force technology transfer programs, even through one
Navy presenter praised the Air Force for its centralized
approach.
     A central focus of the meeting was preserving the
shipbuilding industrial base. Rear Adm. John Shipway,
the Navy's program executive officer for submarines, said
the Navy has two options for preserving the industrial base
-- continued low-rate production, or letting the industry go
cold and rebuilding it later when it is needed.
     Shipway said many of the 200 companies the Navy
recently surveyed are getting out of the ship business.
     But a program designed to save some of those
companies lacks broad-based support. The Advanced
Research Projects Agency's (ARPA) shipbuilding
initiative was expected to help American shipyards carve
out a few percentage points in the world market. The
program focuses on methods of increasing productivity in
American shipyards.
     The initiative's director Charles Stuart complained
there is little support for the program in the Clinton
administration. "We need leadership. Someone has to
believe that it is important," he said.
     Stuart added industry support also is needed. "We
have to do the initiative in a way that gets industry
interested," he said. The program wants to get shipbuilders
involved in making tankers and container ships in the
commercial market but that might not be so easy. After
visiting ARPA this spring, the chairman of the Marine
Machinery Assn., Jack Janetatos said he doubted the
initiative would benefit his members. "It came through
quite clearly at the meeting that the only projects to be
funded will be those proposed by shipyards," Janetatos
wrote in a letter to the association's members.
     Nevertheless, Stuart expects $15 million of the $500
million TRP program to be set aside for the shipbuilding
initiative. The money will be used to support the
development of a vacation cruise ship, he said.

Navy hawks programs

     While all the planning is going on, ONR and the
Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC), Patuxent River, Md.,
have been seeking industry partners as evidenced by their
presence at last month's AFCEA TechNet 1993
conference and exhibition in Washington.
     At TechNet representatives from ONR's science and
technology directorates were short on specifics for the
allocation of more than $1 billion for this fiscal year.
     However, they did outline several programs for
teaming and Cooperative Research and Development
Agreements (CRADAs) that cover:

     **  computers - high-performance and
microprocessors for communications, improved
hardware, architecture and network design;
     **  software - distributed systems, databases,
artificial intelligence and neural networks;
     **  sensors - advanced radar and sonar, thermal
imagers and infrared search and tracking systems;
     **  propulsion - aircraft turbine and hypersonic
systems and associated electronics;
     **  materials; and
     **  batteries.

     For more information call ONR's domestic
technology transfer staff at 703-696-4448/5031.
     Companies concerned with aircraft platforms should
call Fred Liguori of the Lakehurst NAWC facility at 908-
323-2842.
     The NAWC lab in Warminster, Pa., deals in
research and development, including materials, sensors,
unmanned air vehicles and electronic warfare capabilities.
Call 215-441-1143. Avionics manufacturers should call
Larry Halbig at 317-353-3838 with NAWC, Indianapolis.
     Test and evaluation, simulation and instrumentation
are conducted at the Patuxent River facility. Call Daniel

Perry tells industry to stop procrastinating

     Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry told
business leaders to accept that the defense downturn is not
temporary and begin taking action before its too late.
     "The greatest enemy of the businessman is hope,"
he told a group of defense contractors at an Association of
Unmanned Vehicle Systems convention last week.
     "Hope sustains your belief that next year will be
better, that today's slump is a temporary downturn, that the
market will recover and you can avoid making the hard
decisions with which you are confronted," Perry added.
"That false hope, which encouraged you to delay these
hard decisions, can be the downfall of your business," he
said.
     It has been difficult for companies to make
decisions because they have not known what the Pentagon
is going to do from one year to the next. He said in the
past the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) has been
based more on fantasy than fact. The Bottom-Up Review,
due to be released this month, will provide a more realistic
basis for future year planning, he added.
     At a hearing before the House Armed Services
military acquisition subcommittee late last month, Perry
fielded specific questions on DOD's defense conversion
plans. Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., complained that
funding for the dual-use Technology Reinvestment Project
(TRP) will drop 30% in FY 1994. "I want it maintained at
the highest level possible," he said.
     Perry responded that the rationale for reducing the
funding was that several TRP projects awarded in FY
1993 will be on-going in FY 1994. However, Perry said,
"if we get several thousand proposals we will want to
revaluate the resources."
     DOD might have to do that in light of all the interest
the program is generating. Dr. John Gudas, a member of
the government council which oversees the TRP, told
Defense Conversion he expects to see thousands of
proposals come pouring in by the July 23 deadline. He
said the council still believes it can process all the
proposals in time for contract awards in the fall. Gudas is
also an official at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.
     At the hearing, Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
complained that major defense companies feel left out of
the TRP. Perry acknowledged that the TRP is directed to
subsystems developers, which are often medium-sized
companies. The TRP "is not directed at large systems
integrators," he said.
     Perry noted a portion of TRP funding will go
directly to the Commerce and Labor Depts. This year, the
money was placed in the DOD budget and transferred to
the other agencies.

Milspec under attack from all sides

     Military specifications are under increasing attack
from industry and the Defense Dept. and odds are there
will be substantial changes to DOD's acquisition rules in
the coming months.
     At least that's what Deputy Defense Secretary
William Perry told the House Armed Services military
acquisition subcommittee late last month.
     Perry wants Congress to allow DOD to buy
commercial products without all the Pentagon paperwork
now required. "We spend billions of dollars on purely
commercial products," he said. "We will need legislation"
to change the system "and will ask for it in a month or so."
     Perry said DOD is proposing three to five pilot
programs to streamline acquisition. The Pentagon will
propose the acquisition changes later this month, he said.
     The pilot programs will allow contractors to bypass
milspecs and other regulations for contracts valued under
$100,000. The purpose of the pilot program is two-fold.
"It gives us psychological momentum and gets us moving
on real programs using commercial acquisition procedures
while Congress is making the legislative changes," he said.
     "We will seek a waiver from Congress on the
legislative procedures we find most onerous," Perry said at
a separate meeting of industry executives in Washington
last week. "We have legislative authority already to specify
the programs and particular laws which we must waive,"
he added.
     For years DOD has promised to revise acquisition
rules, but Perry said it's different this time. For one, there
is a greater necessity to change. The dramatic decline in the
budget encourages reform, he said.
     "I have leadership from the top urging me to do this
and I have a team underneath me who believe in reform
and are dedicated and committed to pursuing it," he said.
     Frustration over milspec has reached the boiling
point for Willis Willoughby, the Navy's director of
product integrity. "Milspec is a piece of trash, but you can't
kill it," he said, speaking at an industry meeting at the
Office of Naval Research in Arlington, Va., recently.
     Willoughby stressed something has to be done with
milspec procurement requirements because there is
nothing in them that deals with design or manufacturing
issues.
     Willoughby said he tried to get around milspec
regulations recently, but was shot down by higher
authority. In March, he sent a memo to 200 contractors
telling them they could start using ISO 9000 standards or
the equivalent American National Standards. Shortly
thereafter, the Office of the Secretary of Defense told all
contractors to stop using ISO 9000.
     "DOD immediately sent out a letter saying we didn't
have the authority to do it." Willoughby described DOD's
attitude as, "you have to come to the great Guru and see
what we tell you to do.
     "People don't want to upset their fiefdoms by
changing milspec. If you try to bring about any change
they will circle your wagon every time. I tried to do the
same thing years ago," he added.
     Martin Bollinger, a vice president of Booz Allen &
Hamilton, said DOD could cut its $30 billion in
acquisition overhead costs by adopting commercial
practices.
     Bollinger agreed with Willoughby saying "the TQM
mentality makes the situations worse. TQM calls for
continuous incremental change. What's needed is a one-
step function."

Some changes in place now

     While milspec reform is going on, DOD has
already loosened some requirements for developing dual-
use technologies under independent research and
development (IR&D) money. DOD sent a letter to the
Council of Defense and Space Industry Associations this
spring, explaining the changes.
     Specifically, section 802 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 made
significant changes. The legislation eliminated most of the
detailed administrative procedures DOD had in place to
limit IR&D costs. Under section 802, IR&D costs are
allowable as indirect expenses on contracts. Cost
limitations apply to major contractors during a three-year
transition from FY 1993 to FY 1995.
     Allowable IR&D costs are limited to projects that
are of potential interest to DOD, including activities to
increase the development and promotion of efficient and
effective application of dual-use technologies.

Hard bargains found at air show

     PARIS -- The Paris Air Show was the site of hard
trading between western companies and the Former Soviet
Union (FSU).
      Pratt & Whitney Canada announced at the show
that it is selling civil gas turbines in the former Soviet
Union. Pratt will operate a joint venture out of St.
Petersburg. The joint venture company will attempt to
become the leading supplier of small gas turbine engines
for civil applications in the FSU, said George David,
president of United Technologies Corp., Pratt's parent
company.
     Although the deal looks close to even-handed, the
devil is in the details, with Pratt holding a decisive 51% in
the new company, called Pratt & Whitney/Klimov Ltd.
     For Western companies, Russia and Eastern Europe
offer highly skilled workers at bargain basement prices:
Fairchild CEO Carl Albert said LET, which has a joint
venture with Fairchild, has a work force that was "superior
to most manufacturers, including Fairchild's." One Eastern
European executive was even more blunt: "We have cheap
labor and cheap resources."
     But another Russian executive said the infusion of
Western currency will turn Russia around, making it not
just a low-cost labor seller like many Asian countries, but
a good customer as well.

Conversion roundup Sub finds civilian mission

     A Navy submarine will take civilian scientists on an
arctic expedition under the polar icecap this summer.
     The program is a joint effort between the
commander of Submarine Forces Atlantic, the U.S. Arctic
Submarine Laboratory, the U.S. Arctic Research
Commission, and the University National Oceanographic
Laboratory System.
     During the 19-day cruise, scientists will study
biological, physical and chemical oceanography, ice
dynamics, geology and atmospheric sciences.
     Only a nuclear submarine can make the trip swiftly
and explore large areas.
     "A nuclear submarine is specifically equipped for
science. It would be one of the most important new tools
for U.S. scientists in the 21st Century," said Marcus
Langseth with the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of
Columbia University.
     He is chairman of the organizing committee. The
cruise is made possible by a $3 million appropriation in
the Pentagon budget to explore the possibilities of Navy-
supported scientific research.

PENTAGON APPROVES TACTICAL UAV DEMONSTRATOR

       The Pentagon has decided to rapidly introduce a close-range
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to the military services by pursuing
development and production through an advanced concept technology
demonstration (ACTD), DoD said Dec. 22.
       Pentagon acquisition chief Paul Kaminski formally approved the
concept in a Dec. 21 memo that calls for the demonstration of a
tactical UAV system within 18 months, as well as a pre-planned product
improvement (P3I) to build upon air vehicle capabilities. 
       Kaminski's approval came on the heels of an agreement brokered
by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in mid-December between
the Army and Navy over divergent system requirements (Defense Daily,
Dec. 18, 1995).
       The original suggestion to scrap the traditional acquisition
process in lieu of an accelerated plan came last July after a year-
long delay in releasing a request for proposals (RFP).
       Formerly known as the Maneuver variant, the Tactical UAV
(TUAV) ACTD will include the procurement of six complete systems, two
Mobile Maintenance Facilities (MMFs), and eight attrition air vehicles
and Modular Mission Payloads (MMPs), according to Kaminski's memo.
       Moreover, the TUAV "should have a maximum projected cost of
$350,000 for the 33rd air vehicle and sensor," Kaminski stipulates.
"The TUAV selected for award should also have a maximum projected cost
of $300,000 for the 100th air vehicle and sensor." 
       The system is envisioned to have a range of 200 kilometers, be
able to fly for three to four hours, and be launched from land or sea.
       Officials in the Navy-led UAV Joint Program Office are anxious
to release a draft RFP for the TUAV ACTD as early as next week. A
final RFP is expected by the end of the month. Proposals are due
around March 11 and a final contract award should be made on
"reasonably quick order," JPO spokesman Ray Colemon said yesterday.
       But the final RFP, and subsequent contract award, may not come
so soon, despite the level of importance the Army and Navy have
ascribed to the tactical UAV mission, military and industry officials
contend. 
       For example, Kaminski has directed several things be completed
first to ensure a successful ACTD is pursued. The TUAV program manager
has been directed to develop an ACTD management plan which will
include TUAV life cycle costs, logistics support, manpower, training,
and transition to production. The program manager has yet to be
selected, Colemon said.
       The question of how best to transition from an ACTD to full
production--if such a decision is made--has plagued ACTDs in the past
and in this case has been a concern of Kaminski's. 
       Pentagon officials are grappling with the production issue
with another UAV program that was developed and built as an ACTD, the
Tier II Predator. The Predator ACTD, which ends in June, has been
hailed as a success for its quick development and its deployment last
year in support of NATO forces in Bosnia.
       An Integrated Product Team, which will evaluate the TUAV's
military utility, supportability, and producibility, is also being
established under Kaminski's orders.
       And lastly, the director of the Defense Airborne
Reconnaissance Office has been tasked to "develop a ground reception,
processing, and control system architecture and a schedule for
achieving interoperability with other UAVs, collection systems, and
command, control, communications, computers, intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance systems," Kaminski's memo states. 
       One industry official also foresees industry competitors
having difficulty meeting the requirements of the forthcoming RFP
quickly. He points out that the ACTD requirements are significantly
different than the original Maneuver UAV program. In particular, the
range now called for is almost four times greater than in the original
program, which called for between 30 and 50 kilometers. "[Industry]
can't add weight or fuel [to go that distance] without re-engineering
the whole thing," the industry official said. 
       According to military and industry UAV officials, the
potential competitors for the TUAV ACTD contract include Westinghouse,
Textron, Alliant Techsystems, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon , a Boeing-
General Atomics team, and interested Canadian and German firms. 
       Kaminski is expected to decide soon on the fate of another UAV
program, the Hunter short-range UAV. The Joint Staff recommended
terminating the TRW -developed system late last year after numerous
air vehicle crashes and programmatic blunders. 
       According to officials familiar with the discussions, some of
the seven Hunter systems resulting from the existing production
contract, including 56 air vehicles, will divvied up among operational
Army units--and perhaps even the Marine Corps--over the next few
months. But no additional vehicles will be built.
       Some of the vehicles are likely to be put in storage, as the
Joint Staff recommended, an Army official said.

AMERICAN PUBLIC SUPPORTS DEFENSE BUT FAVORS CUTS, POLL FINDS

       Most Americans support a strong national defense, but favor a
budget much lower than the present level of defense spending,
according to a Dec. 19 study conducted by the Program on International
Policy Attitudes (PIPA).
       A modest majority of Americans support significant cuts in the
defense budget and want defense spending to be "on the table" in the
effort to balance the budget, PIPA says.
       In addition, PIPA says that Americans overwhelmingly oppose
the $7 billion addition to the defense budget and that most Americans
want to see more emphasis on multi-lateral approaches to dealing with
problems of security to relieve the U.S. of its "world policeman"
role.
       The study was based on a nationwide poll of 1,207 adults
conducted last Nov. 18-25, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percent to 4 percent. PIPA is a joint program of the Center for
International Security Studies at the University of Maryland and the
Center for Study of Policy Attitudes. 
       Asked whether U.S. defense spending is more or less than it
needs to be, 53 percent said it is more, 32 percent said it is less,
and 10 percent said it's about right.
       If the government were to make deep cuts in defense spending,
it appears that the public would support them, the study concludes.
When asked to "imagine that the president and Congress decided to cut
defense spending by 20 percent," 56 percent said they would support
this move, while 39 percent said they would not.
       When it was specified that the money would be directed to
improving education, fighting crime and cutting the deficit, support
for defense cuts was even higher--72 percent supported a cut of 20
percent, with only 23 percent opposed.
       Also, 63 percent of those polled agreed with the argument that
U.S. defense spending "has weakened the U.S. economy and given some
allies an economic edge." They agree with the statement, "it is time
for the U.S. to cut back its defense spending and make its economy
more competitive."
       This feeling, PIPA says, is not offset by concern for
preserving jobs, a familiar argument used by lawmakers and defense
leaders. Only 43 percent agreed with the argument that defense
spending should not be cut because "many people will lose their jobs
when bases are closed and factories are shut down." Furthermore, 67
percent agreed that "it does not make sense to keep spending money on
defense to keep jobs."

CACI PAYS $8 MILLION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS FIRM

       CACI International Inc. bought IMS Technologies Inc. for $6.5
million in cash, the companies said yesterday. 
       The transaction also calls for the payment of consulting fees
of $1.5 million over three years to four of IMS's founders. 
       IMS, a management information systems company, generates about
$21 million in revenue each year. The company specializes in re-
engineering, telecommunications, multi-media data management, mission
support and full systems life cycle management. Additionally, the
company provides a wide range of computer services including
consulting programming, communications design and installation,
software development and systems integration. 
       Clients of IMS include the Navy and the Justice Department.
       The sale is a good move for CACI because it will allow CACI,
an information technology products company, to grow, CACI's chairman
and CEO Jack London said. The company plans further acquisitions later
this year, he added. 
       "The addition of IMS is a continuation of our business plan
calling for synergistic, anti-dilative niche acquisitions," London
said. "Along with Automated Sciences Group, Inc. in September 1995,
this is our second acquisition this year. We will now be looking for
additional deals in the back half of our fiscal year [ending June
30]."

AIR FORCE TO MERGE C4, INFO MANAGEMENT BRANCHES

       The Air Force will merge its information management branch
with its command, control, communications, and computers (C4) branch,
the service's secretary said recently.
       The merger will take place early this year and the new branch
will be called "communications and information," according to a Dec.
29 statement by Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall.
       A general officer steering group recommended the two areas be
put together after a month long series of studies and analysis.
       "The Air Force recognizes the inseparable relationship between
effective information management and communications and computer
technology," the statement said. "The combination of these disciplines
into a single functional area will guarantee that the vision the Air
Force has for information dominance will be met." Some 85,000 people
in both C4 and information management branches will be affected by the
change. Officers and enlisted members in both branches will receive
additional training, but enlisted people will continue testing for
promotions in their current Air Force specialty.

AIR FORCE TO DELIVER REAL-TIME THREAT DATA TO COCKPIT

       The Air Force has introduced a miniaturized, high frequency
receiver capable of providing combat aircraft with near real-time
threat information, according to the service.
       Developed at the Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB,
Mass., the Multi-mission Advanced Tactical Terminal (MATT) can deliver
over-the-horizon threat data by using national intelligence satellites
as early warning sensors, says John Kasianowicz, program manager in
ESC's Intelligence and Information Warfare Systems program office. 
       "Our pilots can now go virtually anywhere in the world and
know exactly where a threat is before on-board sensors are engaged,"
he said. The fighter aircraft equipped with MATT receive encrypted
digital information from national intelligence sources. The
information is relayed by satellite and distributed through various
military correlation centers.
       During recent field tests, the system demonstrated its ability
to deliver updated situational awareness and allow aircrews to avoid
threats that may not have been known during mission planning, the Air
Force says.
       The MATT system is a seven by nine-inch unit about two feet
deep, and is designed to fit in the avionics compartment of tactical
fighter aircraft. 
       The Air Force has entered in to a Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement with production contractor AlliedSignal
Communications Systems, Inc., for engineering support for future
improvements to the MATT system.
       Each MATT unit is expected to cost $150,000 and the initial
production run calls for 120 systems.

ARMY IMPLEMENTS CHANGES IN CIVILIAN ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT

       The Army Acquisition Corps is implementing changes in the
management of senior civilians to improve the quality and
professionalism of its acquisition work force, the Army says in a news
release.
       The initiative was undertaken at the recommendation of an
internal study. Under the new policy, "top level acquisition corps
managers can expect change-of-assignment moves and board selections
for promotions, much like their military counterparts," according to
the Army's Dec. 22 statement. 
       The Army is setting up a support structure to help guide
civilians in their careers. Functional assignment officers will guide
employees in their careers and facilitate assignments that aid in
training and career development.
       Civilians who want to advance will be required to be
generalists instead of specialists. To this end, the Army plans to
require these civilians to rotate assignments every five years.

STUDY SEES 50 PERCENT GROWTH IN U.S. EW MARKET BY 2001

       The U.S. electronic warfare (EW) market projects U.S. sales
will grow from $1 billion last year to $1.45 billion by 2001,
according to a new study by the market research firm Frost & Sullivan.
       The study says the market will decline slightly to $946
million in 1997  but rebound later in the decade when programs
completing development move into production.
       F&S says in U.S. Electronic Warfare Market that rotary-wing
aircraft equipment will rise from 13 percent of total EW market
revenues in 1995 to 20 percent in 2001 while the market for
fighter/attack aircraft equipment will dip from 72 to 61 percent in
the same period.
       The study says the EW market has shifted from single-service
sales toward greater coordination between the services and adds that
DoD is encouraging U.S. suppliers to reach overseas for technology
partners to lower development costs and enhanced interoperability in
systems.

VIDEO SYSTEM GIVES NORAD 'CRITICAL' CAPABILITY

       A $16 million system to transmit video images has been
designated fully operational and fielded by the Air Force to link all
work center in the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)
Cheyenne Mountain Complex, the Air Force said.
       The Video Distribution Subsystem (VDS), developed by the
Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB, Mass., receives real-time
video and audio signals from more than 80 intelligence and news
sources worldwide and distributes them to 17 different workstations at
the complex, according to an Air Force statement. "VDS greatly
enhances the mission effectiveness of the entire Cheyenne Mountain
Complex by linking all the work centers with mission critical
information sources," said Col. Robert Latiff, Cheyenne Mountain
Complex System Program Director at ESC.

BATTELLE FORECASTS SMALL INCREASE IN U.S. R&D SPENDING IN '96

       The federal government will decrease spending on research and
development (R&D) this year but that decline will more than be made up
by increased investment in R&D by U.S. companies, according to the
annual Battelle/"R&D Magazine" forecast.
       Overall, U.S. R&D spending will increase to about $174
billion, 1.7 percent more than the $171 billion the National Science
Foundation estimates was spent last year, Battelle said yesterday.
Battelle says that the period of stagnating U.S. R&D spending in the
early 1990s is ending and that the near future should see increased
spending.
       "Despite the fact that industry and the federal government are
doing battle with their respective budgets and changes are being
forced by major trends in the global economy, the commitment to
today's research, is critical to tomorrow's economic strength," Jules
Duga, Battelle research scientist and the forecasts principal author,
said.
       Battelle, based in Columbus, Ohio, is a non-profit research
firm which works for government and industry clients.
       Among the study's predictions for 1996 are: federal R&D
spending will drop to $60.6 billion, about a half-percent less than
1995; industry will increase R&D spending 3 percent to $104.6 billion;
the remaining $8.8 billion in spending will be made up by universities
and non-profit groups; private industry will increasingly look for
opportunities to outsource internal R&D functions; an increasing share
of U.S. industry's R&D will be performed off-shore, primarily in
facilities owned by the same industry; and the government's efforts at
budget cutting combined with changes in the national science policy
will affect federal R&D support and the federal laboratories.

DEFENSE BRIEFS

The Air Force and Navy's Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) program
won the Air Force Association's 1995 Outstanding Achievement Award for
Acquisition Reform for 1995, the Air Force said late last month. The
JDAM program office also won an Air Force "Lightening Bolt" award, an
award named after a new Air Force initiative to streamline and shorten
the service's acquisition cycle.

A Russian Molniya rocket launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome last
Wednesday carried a secondary space science payload funded by the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. The payload, dubbed
Skipper, is a U.S.-Russian university collaborative effort. The
experiment will provide data to enable scientists to develop a better
understanding of the atmospheric interactions with a spacecraft
"skipping" through the upper layers of the earth's atmosphere.  

The Air Force/Army Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System flew
its first operational mission over Bosnia as part of Operation Joint
Endeavor on Dec. 29, Air Force officials said. The E-8 aircraft and
associated ground stations provided real-time wide area surveillance
and targeting information for U.S. troops.

An Indian remote sensing satellite, IRS-1C, was successfully launched
from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhastan atop a Russian Molniya rocket
last Thursday. The 1,250-kilogram satellite, designed and built by the
Indian Space Research Organization, "will be the most advanced non-
military remote sensing satellite in the world," according to Arturo
Silvestrini, president and CEO of EOSAT, the U.S.-based company that
has exclusive distribution rights to IRS-1C data outside of India. The
satellite features high spatial and spectral resolution and will be
used for a variety of applications, including natural resource
management, environmental monitoring, and disaster management.

McDonnell Douglas  successfully launched NASA's X-ray Timing Explorer
(XTE) atop a Delta II rocket on Saturday at 8:48 a.m. EST. The launch,
which took place from Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida, was the
seventh attempt to place the $197 million spacecraft in orbit.
Previous lift-offs were thwarted by weather conditions and a stuck
liquid oxygen value on the Delta booster. The XTE spacecraft will
gather data about X-ray-emitting objects, including stars, galaxies,
stellar systems, and galaxy cores.

McDonnell Douglas [MD] has contracted with the Satellite
Communications Div. of Motorola for the launching of 15 additional
satellites in the IRIDIUM global wireless telecommunications network.
The deal provides for five launches of the Delta II rocket, each
carrying three satellites. The launches, slated to begin in April 1998
and continue through July 2000, will take place from Vandenberg AFB,
Calif. The 15 satellites will be used in the IRIDIUM system's
operations and maintenance phase. MDC will also launch 40 of the
IRIDIUM satellites that constitute the initial deployment of the
system. The first of those launches are set for this fall.

Teledyne Inc. bought the European-based Stellram Group, manufacturers
of high-precision milling, boring, and drilling systems, for an
undisclosed price yesterday. Stellram will be added to the Cutting
Tools business unit of Teledyne's Advanced Materials company.

McDONNELL DOUGLAS/KOREA INITIATE KFP NEGOTIATIONS

     McDonnell Douglas and Korean defense and industry officials
have begun negotiations, through the Pentagon's Defense Security
Assistance Agency (DSAA), to work out the details of the
increasingly controversial Korean Fighter Program (KFP), a
McDonnell Douglas official tells DEFENSE MARKETING INTERNATIONAL.
     A spokesman for Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), one of the most
outspoken opponents of this deal and the recent FSX agreement
with Japan, added that the deal will probably be finalized within
three to four months, after which Dixon will seek a General
Accounting Office review of the program before Congress considers
any alterations to the arrangement.
     The talks--which will focus mainly on offsets, a
congressional source told DEFENSE MARKETING INTERNATIONAL last
week--come three weeks after Korea chose to purchase 120
McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 fighters to serve as its air force's
frontline aircraft to counter North Korea's newest aircraft, the
Soviet MiG-29 Fulcrum.  General Dynamics' cheaper F-16 was the
alternative, but was rejected in favor of the F/A-18's more
advanced avionics and "superior...two-engine safety and maritime
capability."
     A Korean aerospace industry source said recently that the
decision may have also hinged on the fact that beyond-visual-
range missiles are not standard items on the F-16's combat suite.
The Korean air force currently has 36 F-16s in its inventory.

Deal To Hinge On Quality, Not Percentage Of Offsets

     Congress, meanwhile, has already stated it will not allow
the deal to go through unless Korea and McDonnell Douglas can
prove that America's industrial base is not harmed and that U.S.
offsets negotiated are no more than 30 percent of the deal's
total cost.  Opponents are also worried over the possible
transfer of sensitive technology to Korea, which will also
receive guidance from McDonnell Douglas on creating an indigenous
aerospace industry.
     American industry officials in Korea, however, say that the
country will not receive any technology that it does not have.
Additionally, they add that while Korea will learn to build
advanced aircraft, the nation's aerospace industry is barely in
its infancy and is years away from being able to design and build
a simple aircraft, and decades away from be able to design, build
and produce an indigenous fighter.
     Even so, congressional sources told us that 30 percent
offsets may not be allowed depending on what specifically they
will involve.  The Dixon spokesman said, "We have to see what
exactly is entailed in that 30 percent requirement."  The staffer
added "we have to see the notification from the White House that
the deal was signed and the details of the agreement."
     He noted that in 1988, Congress passed a resolution that
allows U.S. subcontractors on international projects to address
the administration if company officials see the agreement or its
offsets as harmful. "If we're giving up technical data that one
of the U.S. subcontractors either owns or has rights to, or which
would adversely affect that company, they can bring this to
Commerce or DoD...," the aid said.

Special Supplement On European Integration Included
With This Issue For Regular Subscribers

     An industry source recently confirmed for DEFENSE MARKETING
INTERNATIONAL that the deal may not come down to the percentage
of offsets, but the "quality of those offsets."  The official
said that high offsets involving the purchase of low or medium
technology items, or non-technology items, such as agriculture
equipment, would be seen as more favorable by Congress than a
deal requiring the purchase or sale of advanced and high-tech
aerospace systems.
     A Korean government official said the aircraft will cost
about $35 million a copy, putting the total cost of the program
somewhere between $3.4 and $4 billion, not including additional
support equipment and spares.  The first is slated for delivery
to Korea in 1993.

GERMAN/U.K. DEFENSE MINISTERS TO MEET ON EFA RADAR

     British Defense Minister Tom King and West German Defense
Minister Dr. Gerhard Stoltenberg have scheduled a meeting during
the next three weeks in which they will discuss ongoing political
problems with the radar system for the European Fighter Aircraft
(EFA), the director for EFA marketing at British Aerospace
headquarters said in an interview with DEFENSE MARKETING
INTERNATIONAL.
     Ned Frith added that the problem has been dramatically
overstated by industry and the press, and that the program will
come down to either utilizing a common radar, or having each
program nation independently install a system it prefers.  "It
would be nice if there were a common radar," he said.  "But it
may very well be that there will not be a common system."
     The competing systems are GEC Avionics (U.K.) teamed with
AEG (Germany) on the MSD-200--favored by Germany, and Ferranti's
ECR-90--favored by Britain, Spain and Italy.  [EFA fly-away cost
is currently put between $17 and $20 million per copy.]
     As far as program milestones go, he said that the radar
situation has not affected the development schedule of the
fighter.  "You don't need a radar to develop carbon composite
wings or body panels, or engines, or landing gear."  Eight EFA
prototypes are slated to be constructed by the mid-1990s, of
which three fuselages are nearly complete (see below).
     The defense ministers are also expected to address problems
related to workshare.  Work distribution for the fighter is 33
percent each for Germany (MBB) and Britain (BAe), 21 percent for
Italy (Aeritalia), and 13 percent for Spain (Casa).  Frith said
that although the development phase of the program is fully
funded by all governments, the levels are unequal.  However,
according to the original MOU (signed in 1988), all countries
involved are to aid in development in all of the aircraft's
systems--the cost of which may prevent the smaller nations from
being fully involved.  "But that is pretty close to being
solved," Frith said.

Fuselages To Be Tested This Spring

     The forward fuselages for the first two European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA) prototypes are under construction at British
Aerospace's Warton Airfield, England, in preparation for ground
and flight tests to be conducted later this spring, Frith said.
     The first body section, designated P.01, will be completed
this spring and fitted with electronic and hydraulic systems
before being shipped to Messerschmidt Boelkow Blohm (MBB) in West
Germany for final aircraft assembly.  The second fuselage,
designated P.02 and being developed strictly for ground testing,
is now being fitted with a cockpit for pilot simulations and
testing of cockpit controls and systems.  It is also being fitted
with the Crew Escape Unit (CEU), which will also undergo ground
systems tests.  BAe said that 12 more fuselages are planned in
the next few years to support EFA's ground and flight test
programs.

THOMSON-CSF TAKES FORMAL CONTROL OF PHILIPS DIVISIONS

     Thomson-CSF (France)--having signed a formal agreement to
transfer controlling interest in Philips' (the Netherlands)
defense electronics businesses over to the French giant--plans to
incorporate the new division, and two other recently purchased
European interests, into a new holding company called Thomson-TRT
Defense.
     Company officials said last week the sale, agreed to in
principle last August, entails to transfer of 80 percent interest
in the Philips subsidiary Hollandse Signaalapparaten B.V. to
Thomson.  That company currently develops and produces aircraft
radar fire control systems, military telecommunications
equipment, and command and control systems for the Netherlands
navy, air force and army.  The world's leading command and
control systems exporter, Signaalapparaten's 1988 sales (most
recent data) totaled over $469.974 million. Company officials
reiterated that "the increasing costs of developing and producing
defense equipment and the pressure on defense budgets,
particularly in Europe, make cooperation necessary
for...governments and companies.

Plans To Create New French Electronics Firm

     Also under the deal, Thomson acquired 49 percent of Philips'
Belgium subsidiary, MBLE, which has activities in military
telecommunications, airborne radar systems, and munition
electronics.  MBLE's sales in 1988 totaled over $26.110 million.
Having already acquired 99 percent of the defense operations of
France's TRT corp., Thomson plans to bring the three separate
businesses together as Thomson-TRT Defense--a deal that was
finalized on Jan. 8, company representatives said.
     TRT, a company with annual sales of more than $208.877
million in 1988, develops and manufactures opto-electronic
systems, munition electronics, and radio navigation and
communication equipment.
     All three divisions had total sales in 1988 of over $700
million.

     *GEC AVIONICS PLANS 700 DEFENSE JOB CUT.  Faced with a
decline in defense export orders, Britain's GEC Avionics, which
supplies equipment to the U.S. Air Force, plans a cut of 700
employees over the next two years.  GEC says the reduction
reflects a decline in the current export program and is not a
reflection of concern for the future of the defense business.  It
added, however, that it will reassess the situation in 1992 for a
possible reversal of the current downtrend.  GEC Avionics is part
of the GEC Marconi defense group and is heavily engaged in the
defense export market.

     *BAE CONTINUES WORKER SUSPENSIONS.    British Aerospace has
suspended without pay another 70 workers who refused to cross the
picket lines in the strike for shorter working hours, in addition
to the 286 workers suspended earlier this week for the same
reason.  The union is striking BAe plants at Preston, Chester and
Kingston upon Thames even after the company has offered to reduce
the work week to 37 hours if the workers will return to work
before the start of negotiations.

FRENCH MOD SEEKS NEARLY 4 PERCENT INCREASE IN 1990 BUDGET

     France's Ministry of Defense is seeking a 3.88 percent
increase for its 1990 defense budget, up from $31.30 billion in
1989, to $32.487 billion in 1990.  However, the budget is still a
bill and is under parliamentary review.
     Under the new figures, procurement funding for the country's
services is as follows: Army, $4.031 billion (23 percent); Navy,
$4.117 billion (23.5 percent); Air Force, $4.305 billion (24.5
percent); and $5.060 billion for the Gendarmerie and common
forces (29 percent).
     General funding for total French defense expenditures breaks
down as follows: Research and Development, $5.266 billion (30.13
percent); equipment and ammunition, $8.370 billion (47.75
percent); Infrastructure, $1.561 billion (8.89 percent);
personnel, $360.206 million (2.04 percent); maintenance, $1.955
billion (11.20 percent).
     The main programs each service is working on includes:
Continued procurement of 46 advanced AMX Leclerc tanks, 284
armored vehicles, and 17 multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS);
Continued refits to the navy's fleet of nuclear ballistic missile
submarines, a refit of the Crusader to fill the sea air defense
role until the Rafale comes on line in the mid-1990s and
continued work on the Rafale; and continued procurement of Mirage
2000s and development of the Rafale advanced fighter for the air
force.

U.K. SEEKS NEARLY 5 PERCENT INCREASE IN DEFENSE FOR 1990

     Britain is seeking a 4.8 percent increase in its defense
budget for 1990, up from $32.666 current billions in 1989, to
$34.243 billion this fiscal year.  A top Ministry of Defense
official tells DEFENSE MARKETING INTERNATIONAL that the 1990
figure is only an MoD projection and that the exact figure (which
is classified) will not be released until the bill reaches
Parliament this spring.
     Broken down by force structure, funding for general programs
is as follows: strategic nuclear force, $1.794 billion; general
navy combat forces, $3.746 billion; European theatre ground
forces, $5.351 billion; army combat forces, $283.266 million; air
force general forces, $5.477 billion.  Research and Development
for current programs, $3.683 billion; training, $2.109 billion;
general equipment support, $1.637 billion; other support, $6.704
billion.
     The MoD has also projected (in current billions) an
approximate 5 percent increase for the 1990-91 budget, or $36.023
billion, and just over a four percent increase for the 1991-92
budget, or $37.57 billion.
     For 1990, continuing navy procurements include another
Trafalgar class nuclear submarine.  That order was initiated in
May 1979.  Since then, the MoD has placed "three in service; the
latest, HMS Trenchant, entered service in February (1989).  The
fourth, HMS Talent, is planned to enter service this year."  Four
conventionally-powered submarines also came into service
throughout 1989.  Additionally, the Navy is currently holding
competitions for another batch of Type 23 frigates for service
into the next century and adds that further orders for the newest
Harrier, the Sea Harrier, will be placed with British Aerospace,
the prime contractor.
     The army brought a sixth Challenger battle tank regiment
into service in 1989, and plans to bring a seventh this year.
Additionally, the Army says, "The Chieftain tank must be replaced
as soon as practicable, and Vickers defense systems have been
given the opportunity to show that they can deliver Challenger 2
Mk 2 to specifications, time and cost."  The Army is currently
funding the demonstration phase, which ends this September.
Future plans include development of the high-velocity Rapier 2000
tactical surface-to-air missile, which will form the bases of a
third air defense regiment.  New systems slated to come on line
in the early 1990s include: the Multiple Launch Rocket System
(MLRS); the Phoenix remotely piloted vehicle, and the Challenger
armored repair and recovery vehicle.
     The air force brought its first squadron of Harrier GR5s
into service last year, and have an order in place for delivery
of 26 Tornado GR1s to offset peacetime cuts.  The service also
brought its first Tristar air tanker into service.  Development
of the European Fighter Aircraft--the first three fuselages of
which are now under final construction for testing later this
spring--is under way.  A top BAe source in the U.K. told DEFENSE
MARKETING INTERNATIONAL last week that British defense minister
Tom King and West German defense minister Dr. Gerhard Stoltenberg
have planned a meeting within the next two or three weeks to
discuss which radar system to use.
     Regarding government-funded general research, the MoD
states, "we plan to spend $727 million on defense research...It
is our aim gradually to reduce spending on government-funded
defense research...and will pursue collaborative opportunities
vigorously."

INDUSTRY & TECHNOLOGY DEPT. WOULD REPLACE COMMERCE DEPT.

     A new piece of legislation facing Congress when it returns
Jan. 23 would abolish the U.S. Department of Commerce and replace
it with a new Department of Industry and Technology.  The stated
aim of the bill, sponsored by Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), "will be
to enhance American competitiveness and marry commercial
promotion activities--both domestic and international--with
technology development activities," Glenn said.

Creates New Civilian Technology Agency

     The legislation would also create a new agency modeled on
the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
The Advanced Civilian Technology Agency (ACTA) is envisioned as
providing seed money for specific high-risk, long-term, high-
impact areas of generic technology development not being pursued
by the private sector.
     According to Glenn, the ACTA would provide funding on a
cost-sharing basis with industry and be able to recover its cost
share from profitable projects.  He said the current Sematech
program is a good example of the type of project ACTA would fund.
Other technologies mentioned by Glenn include high-definition
imaging systems, biotechnology and superconductivity.

Elevates Technology And Economics To NSC Level

     In an effort to increase the influence of economic and trade
issues in national security matters, the Glenn bill (S 1978),
known as the Trade and Technology Promotion Act, would place the
secretaries of Industry and Technology and the Treasury as well
as the U.S. Trade Representative on the National Security Council
(NSC).
     The senator cites three years of negotiations between the
United States and Japan on the FSX coproduction agreement
"without significant input" from the Secretary of Commerce or the
U.S. Trade Representative as a reason for adding these officials
to the membership of the NSC.
     Glenn introduced the bill the last day Congress was in
session before the holiday break.  It has thus far not been
assigned to a committee and there is no set timetable for action.
This is at least the second time he has introduced such
legislation.  The new bill, he said, has significant changes over
previous bills.

U.S. LIKELY TO EASE HIGH-TECH TRADE WITH EASTERN EUROPE

     Export barriers between the United States and the Eastern
European nations of Poland and Hungary will be dismantled "to the
degree that it does not affect our national security," according
to Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.  "We're willing to do
it with them because they have told us they will protect us and
give us the opportunity to review what they're doing with the
high-tech items."  Observers say the first such exports would
most likely be advanced computer and telecommunications systems.
     Mosbacher was not so free with the Soviet Union.  Mosbacher
said more caution will be demonstrated before making it easer to
trade high-technology items with the Soviets.  He noted the
Soviets are still a threat and that it will take awhile before
the United States is willing to give it similar permission.
"Eventually they may be included," he said, "but not yet."
     Relaxation of export restrictions could open up a multi-
million dollar export market for U.S. companies that are
currently restricted from exporting much of what they do best.
     Such a change will depend not just on the United States
reworking its regulations but an agreement by the 17 member
nations that make up the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral
Export Controls (COCOM) that governs what technologies are
permitted to be sold to Eastern Bloc nations.  However, reaching
an agreement is expected to be easy since the United States
traditionally seeks the most stringent controls.

SDI FY 91 REQUEST TO BE LESS SUBSTANTIAL THAN PLANNED

     The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) will expect to get
less funding in FY 1991 for its research effort to defend against
ballistic missiles than was planned even a year ago.  However, it
has not yet been worked out in Pentagon budget meetings exactly
how much to request when the budget goes to Congress later this
month.
     SDI Organization Director, Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan, said
there is no direct answer to the question of how much he'll
request in FY 1991.  "We were planning a substantial increase,"
Monahan told DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY NEWS, but noted that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney has given word out for cuts everywhere so
that an increase in SDI funding for FY 1991 "may not be that
much."  When pushed for a range, Monahan said, "We don't know if
we're going for $4.6 billion or $5.1 billion."  He said it is
still being worked out.
     Any of those figures would be a decline.  The last Reagan
budget anticipated seeking $6.7 billion in SDI funding for the
next fiscal year.

Phase One Deployment Still Possible

     Nevertheless, Monahan said a Phase I Strategic Defense
System (SDS) could still be deployed "in the late 1990s."  "We
have the technology," he said.  However, to do so would require
budget increases on the order of 25 percent per year after the
decision is made.  President Bush said over the summer that he
wanted to make such a decision in four years.  However, Monahan
said with the current budget trend "you're talking about some
extension of that time."

FY 1990 Cuts To Slip Near & Far Term Projects

     Of more immediate importance, Monahan said the cuts to the
SDI program made necessary by the magnitude of the congressional
reductions to the FY 1990 budget request were "balanced."  That
balancing act means that there has been "a slip in near-term and
a slip in far-term systems," Monahan said.  He would not be more
specific regarding the FY '90 restructurings.  Plans within the
organization call for making the changes public in early January.

Maintains Need For SDI And A Version Of An LPS

     Despite the changes taking place in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, Monahan stressed that the mission SDI is to fulfill
still exists.  With its move to more mobile missiles and other
enhancements of its strategic nuclear offensive forces, Monahan
noted, "the ability of the Soviet Union has actually increased"
in recent years.  In fact, he pointed out, some people argue that
strategic defenses make even more sense in the event of massive
reductions--such as a 50 percent reduction in warheads by both
the United States and the Soviet Union--because such reductions
would place a limit on how much has to be defended against.
     Monahan came down in favor of a Limited Protection System
(LPS) to defend against Third World or accidental launches, but
stressed the need for any LPS to be part of the Phase I Strategic
Defense System now in the Demonstration/ Validation phase.  With
the possibility of 20 nations having ballistic missiles by the
turn of the century, Monahan said defense against such missiles
is probably one of the best arguments to date for an SDS.
     But he also made it clear that he favors a space-based
system because it can defend against any warhead launched at
anybody from anywhere in the world.  The ground-based
interceptors currently being pushed by others in the defense
community for a more near-term LPS, he said, are limited to
protecting the continental United States, would protect against a
much more limited threat, and may worry U.S. allies if it looks
like the United States and the Soviet Union are going to decide
to defend only themselves.

U.S. SEEKS FUNDS FOR ATOM SMASHER PROJECT

     The United States, because of recent budget constraints, has
inquired about Japanese financial support for the construction of
the Superconducting Supercollider (SSC) which is due to be
completed at an underground site in Texas by 1996.  The SSC,
which will be the largest Particle Accelerator in the world when
it is completed, will be 26 kilometers in circumference.  It is
being developed to further understand the origins of matter,
which it accomplishes by accelerating subatomic particles to
tremendous speeds and then smashing these particles together to
examine the residue that is produced.  The United States is
asking Japan to fund $1 billion of the proposed $4.4 billion
project.  The United States also asked Canada, Italy, South Korea
and India to help fund the project.  India has offered $5
million.  Japanese participation seems unlikely since the mood in
Congress does not support such cooperation at this time.

HONEYWELL DEMONSTRATES OPTICAL INTERCONNECTS

     Honeywell and Thinking Machines Corp. have successfully
demonstrated the world's first optical interconnects inside a
commercial parallel processor.  The demonstration was conducted
by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and was
monitored by Naval Air Systems Command.
     The test was conducted on a processor known as the
Connection Machine. This computer was modified by Honeywell to
replace the existing backplane wiring with the new optical
interconnects.  Where in the past the old wiring consisted of
1,000 wires, the new interconnects require only two.  Sources at
Honeywell state that the new interconnects will make it possible
to have larger, more powerful machines.  They also said this type
of configuration will enhance the abilities of machines to
perform simulation faster than before. The interconnect consists
of two 400 Mbps (megabits/second) optical fibers with
transmitter/receiver modules.  The total package is a 16,000-
processor demonstration system.  Sources at Honeywell said that
they will develop an enhanced version of the optical interconnect
board.  The new version will operate at 1.1 Gbps
(gigabits/second) with a sixfold reduction in size and an
eightfold reduction in power dissipation.  Honeywell believes
that this is possible by using custom gallium arsenide and
silicon integrated circuits and multichip packaging.

     The new optical interconnects have tremendous potential in
the area of defense.  They will make it possible to incorporate
new types of technologies that will lead to increases in
performance capabilities while at the same time enhancing
survivability.  These enhanced modules are scheduled for
demonstration in the first quarter of 1990.

U.S. R&D SPENDING SEEN RISING 4.8% TO $138.7 BILLION IN '90

     Expenditures in the United States for research and
development totaled $132.4 billion in 1989 and will increase 4.8
percent to $138.7 billion in 1990, according to the annual R&D
forecast of Battelle.  U.S. R&D spending totaled $125 billion in
1988.  The real increase in 1990 is estimated at 2.1%, versus the
10-year average of 3.1%, Battelle said.
     The forecast points out that increases in defense spending
are directed at tactical programs and advanced technology
development, as well as manufacturing technology, while the R&D
budget for strategic programs and the expansion of the technology
base show small decreases.  Battelle said it continues to expect
a slowing rate of growth in defense and total government R&D.

DAB EXPECTED TO APPROVE KE ASAT DEM/VAL IN NEXT FEW WEEKS

     The Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) is expected to discuss
and approve kinetic energy (KE) anti-satellite (ASAT) program
demonstration/validation in the next few weeks, an Air Force
official told DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY NEWS.
     Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition) John A. Betti "is
holding a tight line" and the Air Force "would not bring the
program before DAB if it thought it wasn't ready," the official
said.  He also said KE ASAT would not be fully operational for
another five to six years partly because of money problems.
     Also being studied for ASAT is Directed Energy Weapons, or
lasers, but the source said technology and funding limits their
usefulness in the near-term. DAB recently accepted the Army's
ground basing mode for KE ASAT and gave the Army the lead service
responsibility for developing a national ASAT capability (DTN,
Dec. 19, 1989).

ASAT RFP Seen In Mid-January

     Meanwhile, no time is being wasted on moving forward with
the ASAT program.  The ASAT Joint Program Office will release the
final RFP for a kinetic energy ASAT weapon system on or about
Jan. 15.  The RFP will address dem/val and tactical system
design.  Funding for the ASAT will support a scaled down option.

AIR FORCE SAID TO EYE ADDED DELAY FOR ATF: Need For More Data And
Easing Of Tensions Cited

by Timothy McCune
Air Force proponents of making the Advance Tactical Fighter (ATF)
program "truly competitive" are advocating further delays in the
program to give the service more information about competing
prototypes, according to a congressional source.

"There are internal rumblings that if you really wanted to do the
program right and make it a true competition, some further
extension might not be a bad idea, from a public policy point of
view," said the congressional source, who asked not to be named.
To pay for an extended demonstration/validation (dem/val) of the
ATF, the Air Force would have to cut its budget in other areas,
the source said.

A former Air Force official familiar with the program said there
is a "high probability" the service will delay the ATF selection
up to another year in order to gather data.

"There will always be things they'll find during the test program
that they'll want to go back and explore, which means test more
and fly more," the former official said.

The proposed delays in the ATF program come on the heels of a
six-month extension in the dem/val phase of the program announced
by the Air Force in October. This part of the program, now
scheduled to end in July, is to evaluate prototypes that have
only minimum capability. Then, the Air Force will choose one
contractor team to enter the full-scale development phase.

Air Force officials are under pressure to produce a new fighter
that is a significant improvement over current planes because the
ATF likely will be in service well into the next century, the
former official said. Diminished tensions in Europe also could
allow the U.S. to take its time with the ATF, he said.

"Is that extra six months or a year going to give us a lot more
confidence, or even help us fix some things up front that should
be redesigned? It would be hard to argue against it," the former
official said. "There is a legitimate reality that a lot of
things can be changed without a great degree of immediate risk."

At press time, the Air Force had not responded to inquiries by
Defense Week on possible extensions of the ATF dem/val phase.

The $64-billion ATF program pits a team of Northrop Corp. and
McDonnell Douglas Corp. against a team of Lockheed Corp., General
Dynamics Corp. and Boeing Co., each producing two prototypes to
be evaluated by the Air Force and the Navy. The Navy is a junior
partner in the Air Force-led program, but might drop out in order
to divert funds to other programs, according to Navy and
congressional sources.

The Northrop team already has one prototype completed, while the
Lockheed team is still assembling its first ATF entrant,
according to officials of the company.

Even if the two teams deliver approximately equal amounts of test
data to the Air Force during the ATF competition, there would be
little prototype flying time, "and you'd be betting a lot on
whose paper you believe," the congressional source said.

But little would be gained from extending the dem/val phase if
additional money isn't provided, according to the former Air
Force official. After the Air Force extended the program in
October, Northrop and McDonnell Douglas officials wrote to Air
Force Secretary Donald Rice saying they were cutting back company
spending on the program to the minimum required by the contract
because their resources were already stretched too thin.

"It's not only unfair, but also unrealistic to expect the
companies to increase what they're spending on the program," the
former Air Force official said.

Changes to the ATF program also could lead to severe controversy
when the Air Force selects the winning team, the former Air Force
official said.  Selecting Lockheed's plane over Northrop's would
lead to charges that the Air Force broke its own rules by
extending the contest and unfairly favored Lockheed, according to
the former Air Force official.

"[The Northrop team] will be very upset if they don't win the
competition because they felt they were ready to go and were on
schedule. The extension will provide an advantage to the other
team, because eventually they'll catch up," said the former Air
Force official.

PARIS WILL SHY AWAY FROM MULTI-NATION ARMS PROJECTS

by Timothy McCune
PARIS--Stung by the recent failure of two high-profile
transatlantic arms programs, French officials have redrawn plans
for future joint weapons ventures. Officials said France will
shun large, multinational development efforts in favor of
bilateral agreements.

France will seek bilateral agreements, primarily with the U.S.
and Great Britain, and limit other efforts to "three or four
partners," according to Philippe Roger, the second-ranking
Defense Ministry official on western alliance arms cooperation.

Large scale codevelopment failures with the Modular Stand-Off
Weapon (MSOW) and the Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile
(ASRAAM) mean that France should "draw lessons for the future"
and avoid similar efforts, Roger said.

"There should be no bitterness about that, but...in any
cooperation where there are more than three or four equal
partners in the development, it's an illusion to think that it
will work," Roger said.

The MSOW program began in 1987 and was to be a family of air-to-
ground weapons using common components. The program included the
U.S., France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada and Spain. The U.S.
and Great Britain withdrew in September from the program citing
budget shortfalls and differing national strategies.

ASRAAM, which was to replace the Sidewinder missile, was started
in 1982 with the U.S., France, West Germany and Norway. France
and the U.S. pulled out of the program, and when West Germany
withdrew from ASRAAM in late July, the program was considered to
be defunct.

"We can have a nucleus of three, or at the most four, equal
partners to do the development and other nations to participate
later in the production. Statistically, [large efforts] don't
work, so we have to concentrate on more efficient ways," Roger
said.

The importance of the shift in French plans is heightened by an
easing of tensions in Europe. Shrinking defense budgets in Europe
mean cooperative agreements will become even more important for
officials in allied capitals, Roger said. There will be "a kind
of quality escalation, since disarmament is only concerning
numbers," he said.

"I think the recent upheavals should encourage prudent military
planners [in France] to get even closer to the United States than
we were before," Roger said. He said his government will meet
"early this year" with U.S. acquisition representatives to
discuss joint ventures.

"What we are not satisfied with is that there are no bilateral
codevelopment agreements with the U.S. It is nonsense, because
for many, many years France has had the second biggest [research
and development] military budget in the alliance. It's going to
be even more so in the future," Roger said.

Roger said government officials will be less willing to OK large
development expenditures for programs that will produce fewer
weapons. "For us that means more R and D cooperation and more
buying systems off the shelf, which is the ultimate way to not
spend too much on R and D," Roger said.

Franco-American attempts to sell off-the-shelf weapons to each
other also have had their high-profile failures. The French
navy's desire to buy McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 fighters was
thwarted recently when French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement opted to modernize existing aircraft while awaiting
the French Rafale.

The decision came two years after a French-designed candidate for
the U.S. Army's forward area air defense system (FAADS) was
rejected by the Pentagon.

Roger said these decisions showed that buying large foreign-built
systems "flies in the face of established powers of each
country," and a more practical approach to cooperation is to
cross-market subsystems rather than big-ticket items.

The French official said there "has been some mixing of
commercial interests with military interests" by the U.S. to
avoid competition with French companies. "We find it difficult to
understand sometimes why the United States uses technology
restrictions against us and not the Warsaw Pact," he said.

There are significant obstacles to overcome in promoting greater
weapons trade between the U.S. and France, Roger said. Currently,
the U.S. only spends 1 percent of its defense budget abroad, with
France only spending 4 percent outside the country. "We are
slightly better than you are, but there's room for improvement in
both countries.

U.S. `BACK TO THE FUTURE' IN PANAMA

by Tony Capaccio
Although resistance was stiffer than expected, Operation "Just
Cause"--the U.S. invasion of Panama--was a less difficult
military operation than it might have been. Sound planning and
tactics honed by repeated dry runs apparently paid off in at
least two vital areas: communications and urban armor warfare,
according to officials.

The Panama operation made use of knowledge gained from a series
of little known Joint Chiefs of Staff-run surprise exercises
designed to test the communication links between Washington and
commanders in the field.

Analysts have said the U.S. invasion in Panama represents a peak
at the military's future "low-intensity conflict" role in an era
largely devoid of East-West tension. But in an unnoticed irony,
the U.S. carried out the Panamanian intervention with World War
II-era urban warfare techniques.

Concerning communications, the task was made a little easier
because Panama Defense Force (PDF) troops failed to use
electronic jamming devices to disrupt the extensive U.S. UHF, VHF
and satellite communications (SATCOM) network, said a Pentagon
official involved in the planning.

But even if the PDF had the capability to shoot down satellites
"we still could have communicated," the official said. He labeled
SATCOM devices as the workhorse of Just Cause.

And while at least 23 U.S. soldiers and several hundred PDF
soldiers and civilians were killed in fighting, the toll would
have been much higher had not light infantry and their armor
counterparts worked effectively in tandem, said Lt. Col. James
Grazioplene, the commander of the invasion's main armor unit.

The lessons of Panama are destined to be pored over and cited by
Army officials as a model of how the service will fight in future
Third World conflicts.

The unit, the 3rd Battalion, 73rd Armor Regiment, is the nation's
only readily deployable light armor unit. It is equipped with 54
Vietnam-era Sheridan tanks, 12 of which were deployed in Panama.

The unit since 1988 has been refining the arcane art of mobile
urban warfare, said Grazioplene in an interview. But the training
had a unique twist: "We had to go back and dust off field manuals
from the Korean War," for tactical advice on how to fight with
infantry, he said.

The unit also relied in part on a 1949 armor study conducted on
combined infantry-armor tactics used in the 1944 battle of the
Huertgen Forest. The dearth of contemporary doctrine prompted the
unit to begin crafting a new joint light armor/light infantry
doctrine, he said.

By the time U.S. troops descended on Panama, they had a network
of SATCOM channels at their disposal, said the Pentagon official.
The network allowed troops to communicate with their U.S. base
headquarters, the Southern Command in Panama, and if need be, the
National Military Command Center at the Pentagon.

Virtually every unit ranging from the Navy SEALS who landed early
to snatch Gen. Manuel Noriega to the 7th Light Infantry Division
soldiers were equipped with SATCOM units.

The channels were available because Pentagon communications
experts, including the Defense Communications Agency, were given
"sufficient time" to do the technical work necessary to open
them, the official said.

"Just Cause" planners allowed for enough time to open adequate
SATCOM channels because they had uncovered glitches during a
series of so-called "no-notice" communications exercises
conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff since 1984, the official
said.

"What we the operations community did was look at the objective,
which was to take out the PDF in the main, i.e. in Panama City,
and then take out all places we said were nerve centers of the
whole thing," the official said.

Although the PDF had electronic jammers, "we just didn't feel
they had the kind of sophisticated equipment," that could cause
great problems, the official said. "They could have interfered
with us but not for long," because U.S. troops were poised to
destroy the sites if necessary, he said.

"The whole damn thing was pretty orderly," said the official of
the communications procedures implemented for "Just Cause."

Likewise, based at least on early field reports, Army armor and
light infantry appeared to work well together, Grazioplene said.
The tactics employed on the streets of Panama City were standard
doctrine practiced in World War II and Korea, he said.

There was no way last week to independently verify the Army's
account. Attempts to interview soldiers who fought in Ranger
units in Panama were unsuccessful. The soldiers said the Army had
instructed them not to talk to reporters.

The tactics, glimpsed by millions of television viewers, were
designed to use infantry to protect the lightly armored Sheridans
from hand-held anti-tank weapons, such as the RPG-18, which the
PDF was known to have. Unlike most tanks, the Sheridan, has very
light armor protection and shields itself through a combination
of speed and infantry tactics.

"We've being doing that for the past year," Grazioplene said of
the tactics. "We've been revising ways to use tanks in tandem
with dismounted instruments (infantry) in small formations."

Another concern was that the Sheridans might have had to battle
PDF armored vehicles such as the V-150 and V-300. For those
encounters, the Sheridans were armed with two Shillelagh antitank
missiles, he said. But the tanks did not engage any enemy
vehicles in fire fights.

Ironically for the 3rd Battalion, the Panama invasion took place
in the middle of a debate within the Army over what vehicle
should replace the Sheridan. Among the candidates the Army is
eyeing for the role is a version of the Marine Corps Light
Armored Vehicle that was also deployed to Panama.

In fact, one major meeting of general officers had been scheduled
to discuss the issue in the Pentagon on Dec. 21 but it meeting
was abruptly canceled.

HILL PANEL IRKED BY TIGHT-LIPPED FOUR-STAR

by David J. Lynch
Members of a key congressional subcommittee last year blistered
the commander of the U.S. Space Command for refusing to respond
to detailed questions about a troubled $1.3 billion modernization
program in the nation's early warning command post, according to
a recently declassified transcript of the hearing.

Gen. John Piotrowski, the head of the Space Command, told
lawmakers they should ask Air Force procurement officials about
the programs, aimed at upgrading Cheyenne Mountain's antiquated
computer and communication gear. The mountain houses the
military's main command post for receiving warning of a nuclear
attack.

Piotrowski's stance annoyed members of the House defense
appropriations subcommittee already upset over reports that the
upgrade would be several years late and millions of dollars over
budget. The clash occured at a Feb. 9, 1989 hearing. The
committee recently released an excised transcript.

At issue were the Communications System Segment Replacement
(CSSR) and the Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC)
modernization. According to the committee, SPADOC is $147 million
over budget and may be up to seven years late once installed.
Officials have been unable to hook up the CSSR, parts of which
have been delivered, because of incompatible wiring. It is
expected to be four years late.

After Piotrowski, who will operate the new systems once
installed, repeatedly parried questions on their status, Rep.
John Murtha (D-Pa.), the subcommittee chairman, exploded:
"General, this is unacceptable...You just say everything is fine.
You won't answer a question unless we absolutely identify what is
wrong because you don't want to take a chance on telling us
something that maybe we should know."

"...I don't know what to say other than acquisition is not a
CINC's responsibility," Piotrowski said. "Unified commanders are
not involved in the acquisition process. The services are."
Earlier, Piotrowski had noted it could be illegal for him, as an
operational commander, to work directly with contractors.

One month later, when top Air Force officials testified before
the panel, the lawmakers' irritation was clear. "We did not get
satisfactory answers from Gen. Pietrowski," Murtha told the Air
Force witnesses.

"We did not get what we considered to be informative answers when
we made an effort to talk to the CINC," added McDade. "...You
cannot expect us to invest taxpayers' dollars in what appears to
be a tangled web. We need to find out what is going on."

After responding to questions, John Welch, the assistant
secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, suggested the
committee hold a separate four- to eight-hour session to discuss
the Cheyenne Mountain programs.

On May 16, Piotrowski reappeared before the committee,
accompanied by Lt. Gen. Donald Kutyna, the comander of the Air
Force Space Command, which oversees development of the new
computer and communication gear.

Kutyna said the Air Force had cracked down on the contractors
involved, GTE Corp. and Ford Aerospace Corp. "I have gone
individually to the contractors and told them they are in
trouble. I have leverage with those contractors becaue we have
many, many other contracts they are competing for," Kutyna said.

Kutyna also said top Ford Aerospace officials had met with him
and Piotrowski to discuss the SPADOC program. Ford also dropped
TRW Inc. as its major subcontractor on the effort, a move the Air
Force applauded. "Ford did not put their best people on this
project. They have gotten rid of TRW--so I think we will have
these things in hand, but there will be problems that pop up,"
Kutyna said.

"I appreciate what has happened since we met with Gen. Piotrowski
last time," Murtha said.

MARINES WORK HILL ON OSPREY'S BEHALF

by Eric Rosenberg
Marine Corps officials and their congressional allies have agreed
upon a strategy to save the V-22 tiltrotor in the face of an
expected recommendation to kill the program by an independent
study group, according to industry and  congressional sources.

Under the plan, Congress would divert fiscal 1991 money earmarked
for CH-53E and H-60 helicopter buys to the V-22, said sources. In
fiscal 1992, when the Osprey will move from development to the
more expensive production phase, the strategy calls for Congress
to divert money from a service life extension program on the CH-
46 helicopter to the V-22.

More than $1 billion would be shifted to the Osprey, which has
considerable support on all four defense panels, particularly the
House and Senate defense appropriations panels. The links between
Marine officials and key lawmakers are close and extensive.
Marine aviation chief Lt. Gen. Charles Pittman frequently
consults by telephone with Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.), an ex-Marine
and chairman of the defense appropriations panel, on Osprey
strategy, congressional sources said.

The unusual plan, which circumvents a Pentagon edict to await the
outcome of the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) study, has
its roots in other than parochial congressional concerns. The
plan was hatched by lawmakers incensed by what they considered a
double-cross by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney last month when he
withdrew unspent V-22 procurement money, said sources.

For the Marines, the V-22 is the number one weapon priority in
which they have already invested billions of dollars. Officials
are reluctant to concede the Osprey's demise, said sources.

When members of the four congressional defense panels and top-
level Pentagon officials sat down last fall to hammer out a
compromise on controversial program terminations in the fiscal
1990 budget, they agreed the think tank study would determine the
Osprey's fate.

IDA's cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA), is
being conducted by the independent Institute for Defense Analysis
in Alexandria, Va., and is due this spring. Congress asked for a
study examining all V-22 alternatives, including a variety of
existing helicopters.

The compromise agreement turned out to be the calm before the
storm. Citing fiscal responsibility, Deputy Defense Secretary
Donald Atwood last month withheld all unobligated fiscal 1989 V-
22 long lead procurement funds--about $260 million--with the
effect of terminating all production contracts between Osprey
producer Bell Helicopter Textron Inc./Boeing Co. and its
subcontractors.

"...[T]he Administration reached a firm decision not to procure
the V-22 Osprey aircraft. Given that decision, it seems fiscally
prudent to terminate the V-22 procurement contracts," according
to an internal Pentagon memo written by Cheney assistant David
Addington. His Nov. 30 memo served as the basis for Atwood's
Dec. 1 decision, said congressional and industry sources.

"Cheney has lost a lot of friends on the Hill," said one staffer,
echoing the sentiments of several others. "It'll be tough to
trust him in the future."

Osprey proponents on Capitol Hill cried foul. Without the long-
lead money and without the subcontractors in place, the V-22's
cost would jump nearly $1 billion, almost certainly ensuring that
the IDA study will side with a helicopter to perform the medium
lift, troop-carrying missions, they claimed.

Pentagon officials tried to ease tensions with congressional
Osprey supporters by asserting the Atwood move didn't foreclose
IDA's options.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.), who
supported Cheney's decision to terminate the program, concurred.
"Your decision to hold unobligated FY89 V-22 procurement funds in
abeyance until further legislative action is taken will maintain
congressional options to make a V-22 production decision next
year," Aspin wrote Atwood on Dec. 22.

But an internal Pentagon memo suggests the Pentagon has no
intention of procuring the V-22 even if the IDA study recommends
the Osprey to perform the medium-lift and troop carrying
missions.

In an internal Dec. 15 Pentagon memo from the director of land
warfare to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition John
Betti: "The V-22 COEA requested by Congress will have `emerging
results' by April 90 with a final report out by the end of June.
This effort, however, will not affect the SECDEF's decision since
the affordability and priority issues for a new production start
will probably again prevail."

The IDA study has become somewhat of a joke to V-22 supporters,
who now believe backroom deal-making and bulldozing the
opposition are the only ways to save their pet project. "We're
ready for a fight, and it will mean a fist fight," said one
Pentagon V-22 proponent.

ARMY, AIR FORCE MAP OUT NEW BATTLE PLANS

by Tony Capaccio
The Army and Air Force last month agreed to a new blueprint on
how to fight in so-called Third World low intensity conflicts
(LIC) that makes clear military options should be subordinate to
political operations.

But the document also stresses that should force be employed it
is "vital" it be minimal to reduce casualties and property
losses.

The blueprint, approved Dec. 4 by respective service chiefs of
staff Army Gen. Carl Vuono and Air Force Gen. Larry Welch,
"explains the subtle yet critical differences between LIC and
other conventional operations."

"Military leaders have two distinct yet related sets of
responsibilities in the LIC environment," said the document,
formally called Field Manual 100-20. "First is their traditional
responsibility to their military mission and their troops. But in
addition to simply capturing ground or destroying the enemy, they
must also exercise a constructive influence to achieve larger
political and psychological objectives," it said.

Although many of the manual's arcane principles were played out
by U.S. forces in Panama, one official stressed last week that
few if any troops would have been familiar with its maxims. The
blueprint will not be formally printed until June. Defense Week
obtained a bootleg copy after Army and Air Force officials
refused to release it.

At least one principle critical to using troops in Third World
battles--exercising restraint in the use of force in urban
settings--was repeatedly practiced, said Army sources.

According to the field manual: "Use of the minimum essential
force to minimize the loss of life and destruction to property is
vital. This requires detailed planning, coordination and
control."

How closely that tenet was applied in Panama remains in question.
Hundreds of Panamanian civilians were killed in the U.S. invasion
and some neighborhoods were heavily damaged in the initial
fighting.

But Army officials last week also pointed to what they said were
examples of restraint. Among them were the use of Air Force AC-
130 gunships and Army AH-64 Apaches to attack targets that
traditionally would have required more indiscriminate artillery
fire.

Army officials also highlighted three examples in which U.S.
troops opted for minimal force to take out enemy troops.

"When you're trying to win hearts and minds its the thing you
want to do," said one official.

An official pointed out that an 82nd Airborne Division sniper
killed with a single shot a Pamana Defense Forces (PDF) sniper in
an adjacent building hundreds of yards away. An official pointed
out that instead of the surgical shot, the sniper's lare could
have been riddled with M-60 machine gun fire.

In a second example, troops of the 193rd Infantry Brigade who
assaulted a nearby PDF building refrained from firing at one
Panamanian monument--the large granite mausoleum of former
strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos, which was situated directly in the
line of attack on a golf course fairway. In dry runs of the
assault, conducted in the days before the invasion, troops were
drilled to avoid an obstacle representing the mausoleum.

And finally, although it was also situated in a location where
heavy fighting took place, a nativity scene in the courtyard of
Manuel Noriega's Commandancia was unscratched even though the
surrounding area was pockmarked with bullet holes.

The field manual also contained a marked departure from the Cold
War years when virtually every Third World conflict was cast by
U.S. policymakers as Soviet-instigated. "The Soviets are not
responsible for all conflicts in the world," the document said.
But, it reminded readers, "they can and do exploit otherwise
internal conflicts to implement their global strategy." In fact,
according to the document, "the threat to the United States in
LIC is the exploitation of instability by groups opposed to U.S.
goals."

In addition, the field manual also highlighted the role of
special operations forces. Besides planning and conducting
insurgency and counterinsurgency, direct action, reconnaissance
and counterterrorism, commando troops "provide senior decision
makers with options for discriminate engagement, precluding the
need to employ large, conventional combat formations."

MARINE AIR BOSS EYES OSPREY STUDY

Lt. Gen. Charles Pittman is the Marine Corps deputy chief of
staff for aviation. After taking over as the service's top
aviation planner in 1988, Pittman is presiding over what many
consider the most dynamic period in Marine aviation history.

Pittman was responsible for shepherding the controversial V-22
Osprey through the Pentagon and Congress when Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney tried to terminate the multi-billion dollar program
last year. Officials credit Pittman with helping convince
Congress to put the program back into the budget and with
formulating internal Pentagon strategy to reinstate the tilt-
rotor in the five-year plan.

Much of Pittman's time is spent developing long-range plans to
help make the Marines lighter and better equipped. As Marine
aviation chief, he is responsible for ensuring the Marines have
plenty of modern aircraft into the next century--a high wire act
at best given tight budgets and the relative low priority Marine
programs get with the Navy.

Pittman was recently interviewed by Defense Week reporter Eric
Rosenberg.

DEFENSE WEEK: First, can you describe the Marine Corps air wing
of the next century, what it will look like, what sorts of
aircraft and missiles you are looking toward?

PITTMAN:  With peace breaking out all over the world, which we
applaud, assuming that continues, we would see a significantly
different requirement for most of the armed forces. However, for
the Marine Corps which has been involved in expeditionary forces
which can handle a full spectrum of conflict, from low intensity
conflict to general war, we won't see any major changes in our
philosophy or where we want to go. We believe that we need a
force projection capability for the United States and that's what
we try to be.

As a Navy force we can be sea-based, we can be land-based, we go
by air to get where we want to go. We can pre-position equipment
on MPSs [maritime prepositioning ships] that can be moved around
the world. The mission of the Marine Corps we don't see changing
significantly. However, our equipment must be modernized as we
enter the 21st century.

So we would see such things as more VSTOL [vertical short takeoff
and landing] aircraft. We're looking at an advanced short takeoff
and vertical landing aircraft, an ASTOVL we call it, which will
replace all of our fighter and attack aircraft...If we have an
ASTOVL we'll be able to go anywhere. But we do need the
supersonic capability, if we want to have a fighter aircraft.
This will also have the best characteristics for the attack role,
which the AV-8B Harrier now performs. Early in the 21st century,
let's say 2010 or shortly thereafter, we hope to have an ASTOVL
for these missions...This may or not be feasible given the budget
situation of today...We just have to see how the budgets come
out and how much priority that has...

DW:      You testified last spring on Capitol Hill...about the
next-generation aircraft the Marines are interested in. The A-12
came up in the discussion. You said the Marines don't want it and
were not committed to it. It sounded as if the F/A-18 will
perform that attack role in the near-term instead of the A-12.

PITTMAN: Yes, that's what I said, and that's the way we see it at
this point in time. The A-12, of course, has not flown yet,
although it's under development and is going very well. We
believe that the A-12 for our particular mission wasn't quite
suitable. First of all, it is designed to be a stealthy aircraft,
which we appreciate and would like. It's designed to handle long-
range missions. We may not need to go that far, not that we
couldn't be assigned a mission like that. But basically, we buy
our aircraft primarily to support our ground forces. Our ground
forces hopefully will not be deployed that far away from our
aviation element. Certainly, if we have our ASTOVL aircraft we
won't have to worry about that.

So the price to get that kind of range from the A-12 may be more
than you want to pay. We believe that the A-12 will be
considerably more expensive than the F/A-18. Now, the F/A-18 that
I described in that testimony was the two-seat model, the "D"
model. There are several concepts of that, one would be a
straight "D" model which we are procuring at this time which has
night attack, under the weather capability, nowhere near the
capability of the A-12 for long-range penetration or attack.

However, what the F/A-18 does give us is the ability to operate
just as well under the weather and with much more speed and
survivability in a close air support environment...

DW:      Are you interested in the so-called Hornet 2000 concept, an
advanced F/A-18 with extended range? Do you need the extended
range if you're fighting close in?

PITTMAN: We're really interested in that. We would like to have a
little more range on the F/A-18. The Navy is particularly
interested in extending the Hornet's range. One of the
shortcomings of the F/A-18 is that it doesn't have the time-on-
station or the ability to stay up with the rest of the forces.
They've got to be refueled in the air or come back early...So we
support the requirement for additional range because you can
convert range into time-on-station which is important to us in
the close air support or air patrol roles.

DW:      Getting back to the Marine air wing of the future, what other
aircraft do you want in addition to ASTOVL?

PITTMAN: It depends where you lay down in the 21st century. Right
now given the current events, it looks like the Marine Corps
would have a mix of some kinds of helicopters. We're not sure
which. We're looking very carefully at what that might be. One of
them, of course, would be the CH-53E which currently is in
production, and we hope to continue that for the next several
years as we fill out our heavy-lift forces. We may be buying more
than we anticipated to replace the V-22 capability, which now is
out of the picture as far as we're concerned officially.

The alternative that would be in that helicopter mix is something
being reviewed by the secretary of defense and his study group
over at the Institute for Defense Analysis. We are doing our own
analysis now, trying to get ahead of the game because we believe
we have to get started right away if we're going to reduce force
levels out in 1994-1995 timeframe. And if we're going to have an
airframe by then, we must start development immediately and
procurement within a year or two. So we are looking at several
alternatives very hard.

First is the Sikorsky Blackhawk, either the current model or the
stretch model which will allow us to carry more Marines
internally which is what we really need. That's the only
shortcoming we've seen so far in the Blackhawk...We're also
looking at we call the "Son of the CH-46," either a
remanufactured CH-46 or some new aircraft as well, kind of like
the F-14D program...

DW:      What's the timeframe for the Marine helicopter study?

PITTMAN: We need to know where we want to go by early spring, and
we're getting a lot of cost estimates in right now. We're working
in conjunction with the IDA study group to make sure they aren't
studying one thing and we're studying something else and we get
some divergent answer and present the secretary of defense with
another dilemma.

I'm not trying to preempt them either. We've got to make sure our
numbers are in agreement or we know why we disagree.

DW:      The IDA study you're talking about is the tiltrotor
alternatives study Congress mandated this year.

PITTMAN: It's the one that studies the V-22. And of course we're
very interested in that. There are groups within the Marine Corps
that still believe the V-22 provided the least cost alternative
over time. Now, if you look at it per year in the near-term,
obviously it will cost more because you're buying a brand new
aircraft with a lot of capability. On the other hand, if you look
over the life cycle cost of things, it varies. That's what we're
trying to get a handle on for the secretary of defense. It may
turn out that we can't afford that kind of investment up front
even if it saves us money.

DW:      Secretary Cheney recently decided to reprogram unspent
fiscal 1989 long lead V-22 funds. If cost is a major
consideration in the IDA study, and you take away the long lead
procurement money, doesn't that have the effect of pushing costs
up, effectively ruling out the possibility that IDA will conclude
that the V-22 is the cheaper medium-lift alternative?

PITTMAN: Of course, it's a concern. But then you have to
understand the Department of Defense position. Secretary Cheney
has said he's decided not to procure the V-22. It would be poor
business to hold on to the procurement money that would buy the
aircraft he said he wasn't going to buy. He has said he will
continue the R&D program, which he is doing. So I think he's
between a rock and a hard place at this particular point in time.

On the other hand, the Congress was very specific in that they
wanted to look at this again in the future and kind of hold that
money for that purpose. So you could say, yes, it worries me,
certainly. If for some reason the secretary were to have enough
information to convince him to change his mind, then, yes it will
cost more money [to procure Ospreys]. I think the $1.3 billion
figure in the papers is high...

DW:      Cheney took away about $200 million in fiscal 1989
advance procurement money. Can't Bell-Boeing put that toward the
program themselves?

PITTMAN: Well, I think the companies already have a lot at
risk...Putting that $200 million or $100 million for that matter
of the corporations' money into the program with the hopes that
someone will change their mind is a hell of a gamble.

DW:      Since the V-22 flight program has progressed, has there
been interest from other nations to get on board the effort?

PITTMAN: Yes, more from the commercial aspects than from the
combat aspects. They're all watching it. Nobody wants to help us
pay the bill, so they are all waiting until we do the expensive
part...

INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL PITTMAN, Continued

DW:      Can you describe some of the goals in the Marine Air/Ground
Task Force Master Plan?

PITTMAN: The master plan is designed to look out to the 21st
century and see what kind of force we want to have. There are
several goals that we have in mind. We must lighten up. That's
not to be confused with the light Army divisions...We're looking
at lighter, more effective weapons, longer range weapons...We want
to lighten up the load of things that we have to bring with us.

In addition to lightening up, we've got to be able to fight under
all conditions, we've go to be able to fight in the night better.
We're talking about night vision sighting, night targeting
equipment. We've got to have laser range finders...We need a
faster helicopter-type force, a tiltrotor force. I believe the
tiltrotor will come if the V-22 is canceled. But we still need
the speed, range, the capability of a tiltrotor force if we're
going to survive against modern weapons...

DW:      So you are indeed looking post-V-22. Tiltrotor still is
in your consciousness.

PITTMAN: It's within the reach of mankind, and if it is we're
going to go for it. Now, maybe not the United States first, maybe
somebody else will lead. Someone will hire these engineers to put
all this together and they'll build if for the Japanese or the
Germans or somebody...It's got to go sooner or later...

PLANS TO ARM BASE WORKERS FLAWED

by Timothy McCune
Air Force plans to arm personnel at military bases in response to
terrorist attacks or other emergencies are inadequate despite a
four-year long effort to correct security problems, according to
an internal audit.

The Air Force Audit Agency report, completed in July, evaluated
the U.S. Air Force War and Mobilization Plan, which includes a
blueprint for base protection during emergencies. The report was
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.

The report found the service hadn't established policies or
procedures to arm base police personnel who normally don't carry
guns. The service hadn't identified base personnel who could be
armed if there were an emergency, the report said. The review
included installations in Germany, Spain, the Philippines, Korea
and the U.S.

"...[T]he Air Force had not established a standard overall policy
for training, equipping, and arming non-security police personnel
who are deployable or assigned to installations in potentially
hostile areas," the report said.

"As a result, commanders may not have adequate numbers of
weapons-qualified personnel or weapons to protect and defend
their installations," the report said.

In addition, the contingency plans for the Air Force bases didn't
include how critical areas, such as communications centers, would
be protected by base personnel, the report said. The problem was
exacerbated because authority for arming base personnel is "fragmented
throughout several regulations with no single authoritative
source to guide commanders in developing...programs," the report
said.

These problems exist despite an announcement in August 1985 that
the service's plans and operations office would develop the
necessary plans, the report said. A proposed policy was issued in
1988, but has not been approved, the report said.

The report warned that putting the proposed plan into effect
might take several years because of funding shortages.

NAVY SHRPLY REJECTS DINGELL'S BAIL-OUT CHARGE

by Eric Rosenberg
The Navy late last month sharply rejected congressional charges
the service paid up to a $90 million bail out to faltering
shipbuilder Bath Iron Works Corp. to ensure the first DDG-51
Arleigh Burke class destroyer would be built.

"To characterize the settlement of a justifiable contract change
as a `bailout' is at best misleading," Navy Secretary Lawrence
Garrett said in a Dec. 22 letter to Rep. Charles Bennett
(D-Fla.), the chairman of the House Armed Services seapower
subcommittee. Bennett released the letter four days later.

The charges were leveled against the Navy in early December by
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee. Dingell said the first DDG-
51-class ship under construction at Bath was at least 18 months
behind schedule because of significant changes to the design the
Navy requested.

Due to the cost-sharing arrangement between Bath and the service,
which required the company to pay for much of the development,
Bath was in serious financial trouble and threatened to shut down
the yard, Dingell said. As a result, the Navy paid the yard
between $75 million and $90 million to continue work. Dingell
labeled the additional government money a "bailout."

"We do not know the basis of the $75 million to $90 million
figures quoted by Congressman Dingell," Garrett wrote.

"The Navy paid the shipyard an additional $34.7 million because
the service requested changes to the design beyond the intent of
the original contract," Garrett wrote. However, "the contract
modification did not turn a $41.4 million loss into a $11.4
million profit," as Dingell alleged, the Navy secretary wrote.

The Navy negotiated further contract adjustments with Bath
because of the added requirement to reduce the radar cross
section of the 8,315 ton, all-steel ship, Garrett wrote. "This
risk sharing is consistent with current Navy policy for reducing
cost risk to contractor for combatant lead ship construction," he
wrote.

The Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers will rely on
the complex Aegis anti-air warfare system to track and shoot down
enemy targets. The destroyer program is valued at $33 billion.
Bath is producing the first ship and Litton Industries/Ingalls
Shipbuilding the second.

Garrett's response was met with a rebuke from congressional
critics. "It's a fact-free analysis," said one staffer. "It's all
platitudes about the ship and not much beyond that."

A key point of contention between the Navy and Dingell is whether
the ship's design can be manipulated to elude enemy radar. In a
December letter to Bennett, Dingell said, "According to the radar
experts we have consulted, nothing can be done to reduce this
ship's radar signature enough to make any practical difference in
the range at which it could be detected by an airborne radar."

Said Garrett: "Congressman Dingell's radar experts are
incorrect." Garrett didn't explain how the massive ship can be
constructed to avoid enemy radar. Much of the information
relative to radar cross section is classified, he wrote.

Though the delivery date has been rescheduled twice because of
"unforseen design, engineering and production issues," Bath will
deliver the lead ship within the $1.2 billion cost goal and by
February 1991, Garrett wrote.

"The Navy is confident that these issues are behind us, and that
the DDG-51 will deliver to its present schedule," he wrote.

Meanwhile, Bennett, a longtime DDG-51 proponent, plans hearings
on the issue Jan. 24.

DIA COMPLAINED AFTER KRINGS LET PRESS SEE SOVIET PLANES

By David J. Lynch
A 1988 public display of Soviet aircraft acquired by the Pentagon
for U.S. weapons tests later drew vigorous complaints from
intelligence officials worried the publicity would scare off
potential sources of East Bloc arms.

In September 1988, several Soviet fighters and helicopters along
with some Chinese radar gear were exercised as the Mobile
Integrated Threat Test (MITT) at Kirtland air base in New Mexico.
In a novel approach, the Pentagon obtained the Soviet equipment
through a private company called C3P Inc., which had purchased
them on the open market.

U.S. intelligence agencies acquire similar gear through
clandestine sources. But MITT's organizer, Jack Krings, then
director of operational testing for the Pentagon, said that
equipment is kept under wraps and is unavailable for weapons
tests.

After the 1988 demonstration, Defense Intelligence Agency
officials complained to officials in Krings' office and the
Pentagon public affairs shop that press reports had violated
security rules and spooked potential sources, according to
recently declassified congressional testimony.

"There was controversy...The DIA people went through the
overhead," said a former Pentagon official.

In an April 26, 1989 closed door appearance, Krings was grilled
by the House defense appropriations subcommittee on whether the
press coverage had been OK'd by top Pentagon officials. The
committee recently released an edited transcript of the hearing.
Krings defended the program, saying it had been approved by the
secretary of defense.

Lawmakers cited the DIA objections to an `Aviation Week' article
about the program to acquire on the open market outdated Soviet
fighters and choppers.

According to several internal memos cited by Rep. Bob Livingston
(R-La.), Pentagon officials felt Krings had endangered future
clandestine acquisitions. "The public commentary concerning
Foreign Commercial Purchasing serves to cause disruption and
termination of intelligence sources...The publicity has also
caused claimed diminished availability with corresponding price
increases," the memo said.

One Defense Intelligence Agency official called Carl Pflock, an
aide to Krings, to complain. "I informed Mr. Pflock that it was
one of the most irresponsible articles I had seen...I called
everyone who could remotely have cleared the article. There were
no admissions," said a second memo. And a Pentagon public affairs
official noted receipt of "an absolutely irate call from DIA in
the wake of the Aviation Week piece."

But documents Krings provided for the hearing record, including
an official Pentagon "blue-top" press release, indicated the
event had been coordinated through official channels.

In fact, MITT had been cleared at the highest levels of the
Pentagon, according to Krings. In a telephone interview last
week, he said he had personally discussed the project with then-
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and his deputy William Taft
IV. "There's no question it was all totally approved," Krings
said.

The publicity did prompt a change in the status of the Pentagon's
contracts with C3P. An April 3, 1989 Pentagon inspector general
report found the security classification of the firm's contracts
had been downgraded after the MITT unveiling. "The rationale for
the action was the extensive press coverage authorized by
[Krings]. The government had not disclosed nor exposed the
sources of its purchases, so there was no reason for keep the
contracts classified," the report said. The report also noted
that Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a frequent Krings critic,
wrote the IG expressing concern about the publicity.

Krings said some intelligence officials objected to MITT because
the commercial purchasing program threatened their monopoly on
Soviet equipment. "What we were finding out was you could go out
and buy commercially what they were getting using clandestine
means," Krings said. The commercial buys also were cheaper, he
added.

Some subcommittee members criticized the purchase of outdated
Soviet fighters, including MiG-15s. But Krings said even
antiquated Soviet equipment was valuable to the test program.
First, such gear was relatively cheap compared to the cost of
modifying old U.S. planes to serve as test targets. (A MiG-21
could be bought for $500,000. Modifying an F-4 cost $2 million,
Krings said.)

And some older Soviet systems, particularly communications
systems, have a "unique resistance to sophisticated" U.S. systems
that should be tested before turning up in combat, he added.

Krings also said there is a profit motive behind some of the
opposition to the open market purchases. On some classified test
programs, especially involving simulators, he said there is
little competition and relatively high profits for a few firms.

WHISTLEBLOWER'S SUB CHARGES `WITHOUT BASIS'

by Tony Capaccio
The Pentagon inspector general has concluded allegations from a
former Navy electronics technician who charged serious safety
problems with several SSN 688-class submarines "are without
basis."

The investigation focused on allegations by former Navy
technician Joseph Richards of Lyme, Conn., that sonar and
electronic warfare equipment towed behind one of the Los Angeles-
class subs could foul the ship's propeller.

Richards also contended he was fired from his Navy job at the
Supervisor of Shipbuilding (SUPSHIP), Groton, Conn., after
pointing out the potential problems.

Richards fingered twin towed array cables of passive sonar
equipment that are reeled out by a submarine from its stern, much
like a fishing line, and retrieved through an intricate system of
curved stowage tubes.

Richards claimed the internal diameter of the stowage tubes on at
least 11 SSN-688s made by the Electric Boat Division of the
General Dynamics Corp. was too narrow and could jam the array
during retrieval operations, possibly fouling the cable in the
submarine's propeller.

But the investigation, requested by Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-
Calif.), failed to substantiate either claim. "We concluded that
Mr. Richards' allegation of serious technical and safety problems
in SSN-688 class submarine towed array handling systems installed
on board submarines built by Electric Boat are without basis,"
the Dec. 15 report said.

A Boxer aide said the report "spoke for itself."

Neither could the inspector general prove Richards' firing could
be linked to his complaints. Richards was fired for
insubordination at about the same time he registered the safety
complaints.

But the IG concluded, "Mr. Richards did not suffer reprisal. We
found no genuine nexus between Mr. Richards' disclosures and his
reprimand and subsequent removal from the federal service."

Richards, who has not found full-time work since his 1988 firing,
last week called the report a "complete whitewash." Although he
had not yet read the entire report by press time, Richards said:
"Based on my knowledge of the IG, it's a white wash. The Navy has
not taken safety seriously. They'll lose a 688 submarine."

Richards said the Navy lieutenant commander in charge of
investigating his safety allegations only met with him once
during the five-month probe. "The lieutenant commander wants to
be a commander," Richards said. "He didn't want to take on the
Navy."

But the IG's conclusion about the alleged safety problems were
based on a review of ten years of incident, or casualty, reports
and seven years worth of submarine maintenance records.

Navy records indicated that although Electric Boat did
manufacture some stowage tubes that had narrower diameters than
required, "all delivered submarines have met the acceptance
criteria in use," the report said.

While noting that over the last decade one SSN-688 submarine
experienced a "serious jamming" of a towed array, the report said
"no serious systemic problem with jammed arrays exists." Three
other minor problems reported "do not constitute a trend," the
report said,

Richards alleged that a deployed array could tangle in a
submarine's propeller if it jammed while being retrieved during a
risky emergency maneuver called a "crashback."

The IG report, however, dismissed that notion: "Were an array or
cable to come into contact with a turning propeller, it would be
easily severed. Submarine propellers are turned with a power
equivalent to several tens of thousands of horsepower. In
comparison with this power, the breaking strength of towed arrays
and cables is negligible."

WAIVER FIX SEEN NEEDED

by Timothy McCune
Air Force officials who sign off on changes to contracts when
weapons systems fail to meet specifications often don't require
companies to compensate the service for the deficiencies,
according to a service investigation.

Service officials often failed to arrange for compensation for
these waivers and deviations even though "equitable price
reduction or other consideration," is required by federal
regulation, according to an Air Force Audit Agency review
completed in April. The report of the investigation was recently
released to Defense Week under the Freedom of Information Act.

The Air Force Systems Command each year approves more than 1,000
major waivers and deviations on major weapons systems, the report
said. The terms refer to variations from contract specifications
that must be approved by government program officers. Waivers are
approvals after items are manufactured, and deviations are
approvals before items are built.

The investigation also found that Air Force procedures did not
ensure contractors completed corrective actions included in
waiver and deviation agreements.

In 54 cases of waivers or deviations included in the review the
agency found that in 17 cases--35 percent of the sample--the Air
Force didn't receive money contractors should have paid because
of substandard performance.

This happened because program offices didn't perform an
assessment of the contracts, or only did a "minimal review" in 12
of the cases included in the investigation, the report said.

In one example, a contracting office withheld $5.6 million after
approving two waivers. The audit agency criticized the program
office for releasing all of the money after the contractor took
corrective action even though the government had spent $3.1
million to deal with the deficiencies.

"...[P]rocedures for reviewing, determining, and obtaining
equitable consideration for major waivers and deviations were not
adequately and consistently applied," the report said.

The Air Force often has to approve waivers and deviations to
weapons systems to avoid disrupting the program schedules.

TROUBLES MAKE CUTS LIKELY FOR SQQ-89I

by Eric Rosenberg
Navy officials are considering significant reductions in a major
antisubmarine warfare program because of its high cost and
technical problems, according to congressional and Pentagon
sources.

One of the Navy's planned front-line defenses against enemy subs,
the SQQ-89I, is in for deep cuts when the Pentagon's top-level
program review panel, the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB),
assesses the program in April, said congressional and Pentagon
sources.

The SQQ-89I is a derivative of the SQQ-89 currently in service.
The systems process data from towed sonar arrays, hull-mounted
sonars and aircraft sensors. Two contractor teams--one led by
General Electric Co. and another led by Westinghouse Corp.--are
developing competing SQQ-89I designs. The SQQ-89I is one of the
Navy's most secret programs.

The full-scale development review was set for this past fall, but
DAB members delayed it until Navy planners could put together a
more realistic plan that took into account technology setbacks
and cuts in Navy force structure, according to Pentagon
officials.

The program's survival is threatened by ever-shrinking Navy budgets
as well as technology snags that could lead to a possible three-
to five-year slip in the delivery of the first system to Navy
ships, according to a congressional staffer.

Originally, the Navy wanted to put the SQQ-89I on several types
of Navy warships, including Aegis ships, Perry-class frigates,
and other vessels carrying the basic SQQ-89 system. Now it
appears that the Navy will drop the frigates and others from
their ambitious procurement plans, said sources.

"We want to make sure we have the right program to execute," said
one Pentagon official. "We're looking at several different ways
of doing things...we're in the process of restructuring," the
source said.

GE had no comment by press time. Westinghouse spokesman James
Reinhard said he was not aware of any problems with the program.
In a written response to queries, the Navy said "everything is on
schedule" with the SQQ-89I.

If the effort is scaled back, the entire program may be in
jeopardy, said Pentagon and industry sources. It could be more
cost-effective to upgrade the existing GE manufactured SQQ-89s
than to sink money into the improved version, said sources.

"It's always an option to cancel the program, but it isn't
likely," said one Pentagon official familiar with the program.
The Navy needs the program to help combat the new generation of
quiet Soviet attack submarines, said sources.

ARMY SUFFERS TRIM IN FINAL BUDGET

by Tony Capaccio
Pentagon officials have approved a $75.8 billion budget for the
Army in fiscal year 1991 which represents about a $7 billion cut
from the service's original request, according to Pentagon
sources.

The Pentagon won't formally release the budget for several weeks
and Army spokesmen have repeatedly declined to discuss budget
figures.

About $4 billion was cut from individual programs. Army budget
writers also assumed savings of an additional $2.6 billion from
reforms associated with the Defense Management Review, according
to service sources. The budget as approved December 15th cuts
10,000 civilians and 40,000 active duty soldiers.

Only one major system was killed in the 1991 budget, the NATO
cooperative program to produce a 155mm anti-armor, fire-and-
forget artillery shell called the autonomous precision guided
munition (APGM). The United States led an eight-nation effort to
develop the weapon, which was in the midst of a three-year
feasibility phase.

A similar NATO cooperative program to build a terminally guided
warhead for the Multiple Launch Rocket System escaped the fiscal
1991 budget axe when Pentagon officials reversed a decision to
delete the program's fiscal 1990-1992 money.

The 1991 budget reduced the Army's tank program request by $522.3
million and eliminated a Marine Corps purchase of 255 M1A1 tanks.
But the Army will receive $256 million to build 163 M1A1 and 62
second generation M1A2 tanks before closing down its two tank
production plants.

Among the smaller programs trimmed in the budget was the MK-19
grenade launcher, a weapon once described as a cornerstone of
21st century Army small arms but which instead has been plagued
by quality control problems at the SACO Defense Inc. plant where
it is produced.

The Army offered to kill the MK-19 program and save $39 million,
but was overruled by Pentagon officials who decided to bankroll
4,500 of the weapons instead of the 5,001 the Army once said it
required.

One of the few winners in the Army budget was the Pentagon's
anti-satellite weapon. The Army recently won oversight
responsibility over the program from the Navy. Pentagon officials
have added $79 million to the 1991 program that allows the Army
to fund two contractors in a demonstration/validation phase.

GOLD-PLATED:

Next time you're near Marquette, Michigan, try and book a room in
K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base's V.I.P. quarters. Among the
amenities: 24-karat gold-plated bathroom fixtures and custom-
carved oak and brass doors.

Those aren't the usual digs at U.S. military bases. As a result,
the expense--particularly the $3,000 tab for the toilet trinkets--
caught the eye of congressional watchdogs. In a recently
released House Armed Services Committee hearing transcript, the
Air Force was asked to justify the lavish 1988 rehab at Sawyer in
light of cuts in flying hours for service pilots.

"While we cannot justify some of the expenditures, we view this
as an isolated incident and not indicative of the Air Force way
of conducting business," the Air Force wrote the committee.
"...The project could have been more effectively and economically
managed."

Capt. Paul Bicking, a base spokesman, said officials wanted gold-
or brass-colored fixtures to replace green chrome accoutrements.
The official who approved the purchase of the gold fixtures
selected them from a catalog without consulting a price list, he
said. "They found one that looked right. It turned out to be 24-
karat gold," Bicking said.

Base officials have instituted new policies to prevent a
recurrence of the "administrative error" that led to the mini-
scandal, Bicking said.

No word on whether the V.I.P. bathroom was equipped with one of
those $6,000 toilet seats.

GAG ME:

The Navy can't take just a little dissension. It seems quite a
few service officials haven't been toeing the Navy party line
when it comes to dealing with Congress. And what with the 1991
budget about to be unveiled, and all the expected cuts and
controversy contained therein, top-level Navy swabbies are hoping
to ensure that the monolith is well in place.

Head swabbie and Chief of Naval Operations, Carlisle Trost
recently dispatched an "Administrative Message," a.k.a. gag
order, to Navy flag officers and unit commanders.

"As available funding among programs becomes more intense, it is
absolutely critical that the department speak with a single voice
when communicating with Congress," the December order said. "In
this time of austere budgets, it is more important than ever that
we preserve our credibility with Congress. This can only be
accomplished if our representations of Navy policy are accurate
and consistent," the CNO wrote.

From now on, if a Navy official is contacted directly by a
staffer or lawmaker, the service official can respond only if the
question is of "a nonpolicy nature." Otherwise, all congressional
requests for info must be routed through the Navy comptroller or
office of legislative affairs, Trost tells his underlings.

But the CNO wants everyone to know the order isn't meant to
restrict the flow of information to the legislative branch. As
Nixon said, we could do that, but it would be wrong.

"This guidance should not be construed to interfere with, or
limit, the right of department personnel to communicate in their
individual capacity with members of Congress to the extent such
communication is protected by law or regulation," Trost wrote.

Where is George Orwell when you need him?

WHO'S CALLING?

One of most infamous little stories in the annals of recent
military history involves the soldier in Grenada who supposedly
used a commercial credit card to call Fort Bragg to order an air
strike. The call was purportedly placed because military
communications between Army troops on the ground and Navy units
off shore was so poor.

But the story, however colorful, always has had its detractors.
Special Operations Command commandant Gen. James Lindsay is the
most recent official to debunk the story.

Lindsay told a closed session of the House defense appropriations
subcommitee in March that when he was commander of the 18th
Airborne Corps he tried to pin down the truth. "One popular
anecdote was that a telephone credit card call was made to call
in an air strike," Lindsay said in recently declassified
testimony. "Our research revealed no such incident occurred."

for a five-day stay to research new developments in Soviet-
American relations.

Lambeth, a tactical airpower expert and veteran civilian pilot,

THOMSON-CSF GETS RADAR

Thomson-CSF, Inc., announced it signed a contract to supply an
experimental mode S and monopulse secondary radar station for the
French Air Navigation Department (STNA).

The contract is part of the STNA's program to modernize France's
coverage in secondary radar, the company said. This second radar
station supplied by Thomson is part of the STNA's plan to
gradually install 19 RSM 970 monopulse radar systems and then
transform the stations into mode S. Mode S is an aircraft
"selective addressing interrogation" system.

"Fully compatible with existing radar stations, the system's
advanced operational performance relies on the precision of the
monopulse technique. The number of aircraft interrogations is
reduced through very precise positioning and identification of
aircraft," Thomson said.

US FY96 DEFENSE BUDGET
FEATURES, CONTROVERSIES, AND A VETO THAT STANDS

     Some aspects of the new $275 billion FY96 defense
budget include:
  *  $159 million for six F-16C/Ds and $311 million for six
F-15Es (planes President Clinton did not want) to keep the
assembly lines open and provide spare aircraft to replace
those expected to be lost in accidents through 2005.
  *  New supercomputers, engines for new LPD-17 amphibious
ships, and auxiliary power units for New Attack Submarines
can only be purchased from US manufacturers.
  *  60 more UH60 Blackhawk helicopters (the Army needs 700)
over 5 years and the upgrade of AH64 helicopters and M1A2
tanks.
  *  $100 million to modify 20 Navy EA-6B jammer aircraft to
support Air Force operations.
  *  $827 million to start building a third Seawolf, half of
what President Clinton asked for. However, it provided $1.3
billion for an LHD-7 and $974 million for an LPD-17,
amphibious ships Clinton did not want.
  *  Development of a missile defense system by 2003.
President Clinton is concerned that the Russian parliament
might consider the mere plan an "anticipatory breech" of the
ABM treaty.
     The House approved the bill 267-149 on 15 Dec. The
Senate approved it 51-43 on 19 Dec and sent it to the White
House. President Clinton vetoed the bill on 28 Dec, citing
the missile defense provisions and a new rule that would
have required Congressional approval to keep troops deployed
for 45 days. President Clinton did not mention the B-2
bomber funding in his veto message, but did note that the
bill would force the discharge of HIV-positive soldiers and
block access to abortions overseas. The House tried (and
failed) to override the veto on 3 Jan.

FIFTH FRENCH NUCLEAR TEST SPARKS OUTRAGE
COURT REFUSES TO RETURN CONFISCATED GREENPEACE SHIPS

     France set off its fifth nuclear test on Mururoa Atoll
at 0930 local time on 28 Dec. The blast was equal to 30KT.
This touched off another round of world-wide condemnation,
which France dismissed.
     A French court on Tahiti ruled on 5 Dec that the
confiscated ships Rainbow Warrior II and Greenpeace (along
with a helicopter and several small boats) had been seized
legally and would not be returned to their owner
(Greenpeace). Greenpeace said it would appeal. France
announced on 6 Dec that it would cut the series short at six
tests to be completed by February. Greenpeace, Australia,
and New Zealand demanded that the halt be imposed effective
immediately. The UN voted 85-18 on 12 Dec to condemn the
French and Chinese nuclear tests and demand the immediate
end to all testing. Another 43 nations abstained and 31 did
not vote.
     Panama demanded an explanation of two French military
airlift flights which landed in Panama to refuel on 19 July
and 2 Aug en route to Mururoa. As this was just before the
tests began, Panama is concerned that the planes might have
carried nuclear weapons in violation of the 1977 accords
with the US.

RIFLES OVER BENGAL:
A MYSTERIOUS ARMS SHIPMENT FALLS INTO THE INDIAN NIGHT

     A mysterious aircraft dropped at least three packages
of weapons over the Purulia district of West Bengal (in
eastern India) on 17 Dec. Troops fanned out to search local
villages and recovered 231 Russian AK-47 assault rifles (and
Chinese AK-56 copies), 17,000 rounds of ammunition, ten
rocket launchers, 80 anti-tank rockets, eight 9mm pistols
with holsters, manuals, and hundreds of rifle cleaning kits.
There are radical guerrilla groups in several surrounding
areas, but none are known to operate in Purulia. (One
radical group, the Ananda Margis or Pleasure Seekers, have
an estate nearby, but their last armed resistance was 30
years ago. Police arrested 11 members of that group.) The
crates were addressed to the commander of a Bangladeshi
military base across the border, but this was thought to be
a deception effort. Curiously, India's air defense radar
system was not operating on the night of the air drop, and
the Indian government ordered a review of air security.
     Indian fighters forced an An-26 air transport
registered in Hong Kong with a crew of five Latvians and one
Briton to land in Bombay on 23 Dec (after Indian
intelligence identified it). Police said the crew had
confessed to deliberately dropping the weapons. A New
Zealander originally part of the crew, Kim Davy, was being
sought after he eluded Indian police. Two New Delhi
businessmen were arrested in the case.
     Another air transport was forced to land in New Delhi
on 24 Dec, and its crew of nine was arrested as India
increased its monitoring of civilian air traffic. India said
that Pakistan had been involved in the episode, but the
Pakistanis said this charge was a smokescreen.

AND NOW, THE MiG-1.42 MULTI-FUNCTION INTERCEPTOR

     The first flight of the new MiG-1.42 MFI
(multi-function interceptor) is to take place early this
year at Ramenskoye. The twin-engine aircraft is thought to
be unusually maneuverable as it has fly-by-wire and 16
control surfaces (including canards and a twin tail). It is
designed to compete (both in combat and the export market)
with the F-22, Eurofighter-2000, and Dassault Rafale (three
fighters that are not in the same class by any means). The
MiG-1.42 has supersonic cruise capability and is partly
stealthy. Even if flight tests are successful, it will not
enter service until sometime after 2000.

1995: A BETTER YEAR FOR JOURNALISTS

     A total of 50 reporters, editors, and journalists were
killed in the line of duty during 1995, less than half of
the total of 103 who died on duty in 1994 and the lowest
since 1988. Of the 50, 22 were killed in Algeria (almost all
by the radical Islamic fundamentalists), five in Russia
(including Chechnya), four in Brazil, three in ethnic strife
in Burundi, and three in Sri Lanka (in combat or terrorist
assassinations). Two were killed in Tadjikhistan and two in
Colombia. One reporter was killed in each of the following:
Angola, Somalia, Tunisia, Croatia, Azerbaijan, Britain,
Mexico, Canada, and India.

THE ITALIAN ARMORED CORPS IS REORGANIZED FOR NEW VEHICLES

     Italy plans to reorganize its Army. The new structure
will include two tank and three mechanized brigades as the
only "all tracked vehicles" brigades. These units will share
120 refitted Leopard-1A5 and 200 new Ariete tanks. (The
first Ariete was delivered on 1 Dec.) About 500 new Dardo
VCC-80 infantry fighting vehicles armed with a 25mm cannon
and two TOW missiles each are to be purchased to outfit
these units. (The first 150 of these were ordered this
year.)
     The Ariete Tank Brigade will be assigned to the British
3rd Division, while the new Italian 3rd Division will
include the Legnano and Friuli mechanized brigades and a
Portuguese parachute brigade. The Garibaldi mechanized
brigade will be formed as an all-volunteer unit for "out of
area" missions. The Italians have also ordered 250 Puma 4x4
armored cars for use by the Folgore parachute brigade and
some cavalry regiments; the other cavalry units will make do
with the Veltro armored truck.

FOUR STEPS TO EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP

     Four steps to becoming an effective leader:
  *  Exemplify professionalism and ethics, including
integrity, devotion to duty, and selfless service. Undertake
every mission with enthusiasm.
  *  Communicate with soldiers. This includes developing the
skills to tell soldiers what is expected of them and
learning to listen to what soldiers are telling you. Reading
body language to determine if the soldier actually
understands and will perform the task he says he understands
and will perform is a key tool.
  *  Build cohesive teams. It is easier to control a group
of teams trained to work together than to control a horde of
individuals. Teams must be built horizontally so that team
members can take care of each other and solve many small
problems without bothering their commanders. But teams must
also be built vertically so that they trust their commanders
and believe they will take care of and support them.
  *  Provide purpose and direction by first creating a
vision of what the unit is to be, then by establishing goals
that will bring about that vision. A series of objectives
must be established leading the unit to each goal.

O'GRADY RESCUE WAS ONE MISSILE AWAY FROM DISASTER
IF "JOINTNESS" IS GOING TO WORK,
IT NEEDS TRAINING NOT LIP SERVICE

     According to an analysis in Armed Forces Journal
International, the Marine effort to rescue downed pilot
Scott O'Grady was not performed with the best equipment for
the mission and the personnel did not have the best training
available. Some key points:
  *  The CH-53E helicopters used for over-water rescue were
inadequate to the mission over Bosnia because their flare
systems could only distract the oldest versions of the SA-7.
(Fortunately, the two missiles fired at the rescue aircraft
were of this ancient type.) The Air Force MH-60K Pave Hawk
rescue helicopters have more extensive jamming and decoy
systems and could have evaded shots by SA-16s or Stingers.
If there had been one modern shoulder-fired missile along
the flight path, the US would have been dealing with the
death or capture of 30 Marines. The MH-60K is fitted with
jungle-penetrating rescue gear that the CH-53E (expected to
operate over the ocean) does not have.
  *  The rescue force could have been fitted with Ranger
Body Armor able to stop 7.62mm AK47 rounds. Instead, they
wore flak jackets able to stop only grenade fragments. One
concealed Serbian rifleman willing to take his chances with
the Cobras could have caused many casualties with one burst.
  *  The Marines had night vision devices in case the rescue
lasted into the hours of darkness, but did not have night
weapons sights. This equipment is in the US inventory but is
not issued to rescue teams.
  *  The Marines on the rescue team could have been issued
Tactical Load-Bearing Vests which double as a rescue
harness, allowing a few soldiers left behind to be quickly
rescued by dropping them a rope. Instead, they relied on
being dropped rescue harnesses they would have had to take
time to put on before they could be lifted out.
  *  The Army insists on training at least one man in ten
(and strives to do better than that) in emergency medical
procedures that could save the life of a gravely-wounded
man. The Marines do not have a parallel training program and
rely on the one medic in every 40-man platoon, although all
Marines (indeed all US service personnel) get at least
rudimentary first aid training.
  *  The Marine rescue team relied on stretchers to carry
wounded men (these were not actually needed) instead of more
efficient collapsible litters used by the Army Special
Forces.
  *  Few if any Marines (other than pilots) take the
Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape class taught at
Fort Bragg, NC. Army and Air Force rescue teams are given
this training. (The Marines assume that their Force Recon
training adequately covers this specialized subject, and
could be partly right.)
     [The O'Grady rescue might be regarded as the final
endorsement -- or condemnation -- of the concept of
"jointness". The Marine unit was given pilot rescue as an
additional duty because there were not enough specialized
Air Force rescue units in the theater, clearly what
"jointness" is all about. The Marines had never been
provided the specialized equipment, aircraft, and training
for the rescue mission, and the fact that it worked was due
as much to their attempts to make up this training on their
own as it was to their good fortune in the actual event.
Jointness is going to require dollars for tools and
training, not just lip service, if it is going to work.]

MILITARY SPACE: TITAN-4, ISRAELI ASTRONAUTS, SKIPPER

     A TITAN-4 booster carried a spy satellite from
Vandenburg into a polar orbit on 5 Dec. It was the fourth
Titan-4 launch of 1995 and the first from Vandenburg in two
years.
     ISRAEL: The US agreed to train Israeli astronauts for a
future space shuttle mission.
     SKIPPER is a 550-pound US satellite launched by a
Russian SL-6 booster on 28 Dec, which also carried the
Indian IRS-C spy satellite. Skipper is to be used by the
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to test aerobraking
and the performance of reentry vehicles.

ADVANCED AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS: SUPER STEALTH, PREDATOR DRONES
DELAYED IN RETURN TO BOSNIAN SKIES, TUAV, MIG-AT TRAINER

     SUPER STEALTH: The Air Force plans to ask for a series
of improvements to its F-117 stealth strike fighters to
improve their jamming and communications gear and allow them
to carry more types of weapons (small bombs, stand-off
weapons, adverse-weather-guided weapons, JDAM, JSOW). The
final design was tested (in computer simulations) against a
2010 Syria air defense network including SA-10s,
Mirage-2000s, MiG-29s, and Su-27s.
     PREDATOR drones will begin operating from a base in
Hungary to fly over Bosnia in mid-March. (The Army wanted
them in operation on 1 Jan.) The drones will be operated by
the Air Force.
     TUAV: The Pentagon has accelerated plans to field a
smaller "Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" with a range of
120 miles and an endurance of 3-4 hours, operating from land
bases or ships. The Pentagon wants 32 drones (to start with)
at a third of a million dollars each.
     MiG-AT: The new Advanced Trainer by MiG is to start
flight tests on 20 Jan at Ramenskoye. Russia plans to buy
250-300 trainers (either ATs or the competing Yak design) to
replace its L-29 and L-39 fleets; India and Uzbekhistan have
already signed options on the plane. MiG thinks the global
market is about 1,200 aircraft. The plane will use Larzac
engines developed in cooperation with the Western engine
companies Snecma and Turbomeca.

THEATER HIGH ALTITUDE AREA DEFENSE MISSILE

     A test of the Theater High Altitude Area Defense
missile on 13 Dec failed to strike the Storm target missile.
The THAAD weapon was off course when it came into engagement
range. While it maneuvered toward the target, it ran out of
fuel before reaching an intercept course.
     The Army expects to form two THAAD battalions, starting
in 2002 with both operational by 2005. Each will have four
batteries, and each battery will have nine launchers and a
total of 136 troops. One battery (B-1/6) and a battalion
headquarters was activated last June for the test program.

ARMORED VEHICLE UPDATE: LONG RANGE GUNNERY CANNOT BE TRAINED
WITH THE CURRENT AMMUNITION, IRAN REFITS T-55s, LAV-105 GONE

     LONG RANGE GUNNERY is a key skill that the US Army tank
corps needs, but the existing M865PIP training ammunition
was designed to lose velocity quickly for use on restricted
training ranges and, hence, is too inaccurate at long range
to be used in training to engage targets beyond 2,500m. The
Army needs to train for gunnery to 3,000m and to train one
or two "sniper tanks" per company to shoot accurately to
4,000m.
     IRAN has refitted some Iraqi T-55s captured during the
1980-88 war as Safir-74 (Messenger of God 74) tanks with
"major improvements in engine power, transmission system,
firepower, and an internal fire extinguisher".
     LAV-105: The US Marines have finally given up trying to
buy 150 LAV-105 tank destroyer/assault guns, but did
complete the development objectives of the program. The
three prototypes logged 24,000 miles and fired 2,400 main
gun rounds.

ESPIONAGE: POLLARD, BRITAIN, UKRAINE, FRANCE

     POLLARD: Israel announced on 21 Nov that it would give
Israeli citizenship to convicted spy Jonathan Pollard.
Pollard, who gave US intelligence (including that received
from friendly Arab nations) to Israel, has completed 10
years of his sentence and is now eligible for parole.
     BRITAIN announced that Stephen Lander would succeed
Stella Rimington as head of the MI5 counter-intelligence
agency.
     UKRAINE expelled two Polish priests for espionage and
other activities in the ethnic-Polish regions of western
Ukraine. In order to avoid an incident, the two were simply
sent home instead of arrested and placed on trial.
     FRANCE jailed Algerian Joseph Karon for passing
military electronics secrets to Moscow for money between
1989 and 1992.

TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER; ILLEGAL ARMS SALES
SHIPMENTS TO LIBYA; NEW TECHNOLOGY CONTROL DEAL

     ITALY: Customs police seized ten tons of spare parts
for combat aircraft (mostly for MiGs) hours before they were
to be sent to Libya (by a ship with documents claiming it
was going elsewhere).
     WASSENAAR ARRANGEMENT: Officials from 28 countries (the
16 NATO countries, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the
Czech Republic, Austria, Australia, Japan, Finland, Ireland,
New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland) signed an agreement on
a new international technology export control system on 19
Dec. The Wassenaar Arrangement took two years to negotiate
and replaces the defunct Cold War control group known as
COCOM.
     LIBYA: Scottish businessman David McKeeve was charged
in Boston (US) on 19 Dec with trying to export $250,000
worth of computers to Libya.

RUSSIA AND THE FORMER USSR: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: While the final results of the elections (158
seats for the communists, 91 for Zhirinovski's nationalists,
55 for Chernomyrdin's Our Home party, and 44 for the
reformist Yabloko group) would not be known for another
week, the result was clear enough. The government said that
the stronger communist delegation would not cause changes in
policy. (No major parties would ally with the communists.)
Thirty-nine parties (which won a total of 50.3% of the vote)
had failed to meet the threshold of 5% to win seats on the
"party list" half of parliament, but many of them won a few
seats in local constituencies. [The parliamentary elections
were, in the final analysis, of little real importance.
Everyone was maneuvering for the decisive presidential
elections in June.] NATO said the Russian elections would
not affect its expansion plans.
     Chechnya: Russian heavy artillery and Grad missile
launchers pounded Gudermes, the second-largest city in
Chechnya, which had been seized by rebels a week earlier.
[Russian troops had repeatedly announced that the city had
been cleared, but apparently managed to discover more rebels
each time.]
  *  20 Dec: Rutskoi and Lebed charged that the election
commission had conspired to keep their parties from scoring
5% of the vote.
     Chechnya: Refugees from Gudermes said the town had been
subjected to the worst shelling in a year of war. There was
hand-to-hand fighting in the streets. Rebel commander Akhmed
Zakayev told Russian television that the Russian guns and
rockets had destroyed half of the town but he planned to
hold the city.
     Ukraine and the G7 nations signed a $2.3 billion deal
to close the Chernobyl reactor by the year 2000.
     Belarussian President Lukashenko named Valentin Agolets
to head the Interior (police) Ministry and Vladimir
Matskevich to head the National Security Service
(intelligence).
  *  21 Dec: Shipyard workers in Polyarny would not allow a
nuclear submarine they had just repaired leave because the
government had not paid them since August.
     Aslan Maskhadov, overall military commander of the
Chechen rebel forces, ordered his troops out of Gudermes to
spare further civilian casualties and damage to the
buildings. About 150 soldiers had been killed and 150 more
wounded in a week of fighting. Other rebels captured
Achkhoi-Martin.
  *  22 Dec: Chechen rebels still held key buildings in
Gudermes. Russian troops moved in to besiege the town,
holding off on a full-scale assault to avoid causing massive
civilian casualties.
  *  23 Dec: Chechnya: Russian troops recaptured the
Gudermes train station, where 70 Russian security troops had
been under siege.
  *  24 Dec:  Russian troops secured Gudermes.
     Moldova: The rebellious ethnic-Russian Dnestr region
held its own parliamentary elections in defiance of the
Moldovan government. In a referendum, 82% voted to declare
the Dnestr Republic a sovereign and independent state and
apply for CIS membership separately from Moldova.
     Tadjikhistan: Russian border guards killed 65 Tajik
rebels trying to infiltrate the border from Afghanistan.
     Kirghizstan held the first multi-party presidential
elections in its history. President Akayev won easily (71%)
over two rival candidates. International observers said the
vote had been fair but questioned the exclusion of three
stronger opposition candidates on technicalities.
  *  25 Dec: Civilians began moving back into Gudermes.
  *  26 Dec: Yeltsin left the sanatorium for his country
home. His first act was to create a new Council on Foreign
Policy which will report directly and only to him and not to
parliament.
     Doku Zavgayev, the puppet Russian governor of Chechnya,
said the election had given him a mandate to make peace.
Russia denied that General Shkirko had said that 267
civilians had been killed in Gudermes.
  *  27 Dec: Border guards commander Andrei Nikolayev said
he needed more money to seal the borders against drug
smugglers, arms merchants, and trespassers. He received less
than half of the $2.6 million he asked for.
  *  28 Dec: There was furious maneuvering by presidential
candidates. None of the top candidates can hope for 50% of
the first ballot, forcing a run-off. [The problem is that
three factions -- communist, nationalist, and
reformist -- will be fighting for the two places on the
run-off ballot.]
     Chechnya: Rebel and Russian troops clashed at
Achkhoi-Martin.
  *  29 Dec: Zhirinovsky demanded three cabinet posts and
the speakership of the Duma as his price to support the
Yeltsin government.
     A terrorist bomb in Grozny killed one and injured 14.

YUGOSLAVIA: CIVIL WAR: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: A US Air Force C-17 delivered the first M109
self-propelled howitzer into Tuzla. Due to a new radar
system, the airport was fully operational despite snow and
fog. Troops of the 3/325 Parachute Battalion were deployed
around the airfield. [The 1st US Brigade is to be deployed
in Posavina-Brcko-Gradacac. The 2nd US Brigade will deploy
in Zvornik-Olovo-Tuzla. The Russians will cover east of
Brcko and Zvornik. Most troops will arrive by Route Arizona,
Orasje-Loncari-Cerik-Tuzla. US supplies will come in by
Route Michigan from Samac and Gradacac to Tuzla.] The US
Army pontoon bridge over the Sava was still not complete,
and seven trainloads of US Army equipment were clustered at
the crossing area. British LtGen Sir Michael Walker arrived
in Sarajevo to command the NATO Rapid Reaction Corps, the
ground component of IFOR. British LtGen Rupert Smith,
commander of the UN forces, left Sarajevo the next day. The
US sharply rebuked Belgrade for suggesting that the Moslems
slaughtered at Srebrenica had been murdered by other Moslem
factions and said it would block Belgrade's attempts to
rejoin the UN until it cooperated with the investigation.
Belgrade authorized NATO to cross its territory to support
the peacekeeping operation. A spokesman for UNSG Ghali said
that the UN troops in Bosnia were not sent there to stop a
war but were now being blamed for a lack of peace. The OSCE
selected US diplomat Robert Frowick to head the civilian
aspects of the Dayton Accords. [This appointment was forced
through by the US over the opposition of France, which
demanded that the job go to a European.] US envoy Holbooke
acknowledged that US troops might have to disarm Bosnian
Serb units by force.
     Montenegro said it would not recognize Croatia until it
gave up the Prevlaka Peninsula. [Montenegro expects to
eventually absorb the southeastern Bosnian Serbs, and wants
Prevlaka.]
  *  20 Dec: NATO took control of the Bosnian peacekeeping
mission from the UN. Many troops that had been on duty with
the UN transferred to NATO command, repainting their
vehicles and exchanging white or blue UN headgear for green
caps and helmets. To enforce its status, NATO began
dismantling roadblocks and moving troops into areas the
warring factions had prohibited the UN from entering. US
Major General Nash (commander, 1st Armored Division) drove
to meet Brigadier General O'Neal (head of his supply lines)
on a road that the Serbs had blocked for years. (Nash was
escorted by a Danish tank platoon.) Nash met with Bosnian
Serb General Simic and Bosnian (Moslem) 2nd Corps Commander
Brigadier General Sead Delic at different times. An armored
British patrol (30 vehicles of the Light Dragoons) bulldozed
aside a Serbian roadblock near Krupa and headed for Banja
Luka. US helicopter pilots were warned the Islamic and other
spies in Hungary would be watching their operations. Serbs
in Sarajevo declared the NATO troops to be an army of
occupation.
     The UN Security Council told UNSG Ghali to assemble a
peacekeeping force "able to defense itself" for Eastern
Slavonia and named US diplomat Jacques Klein (a Major
General in the Air Force Reserve) to head it.
  *  21 Dec: The UN Security Council demanded that the Serbs
allow international investigators access to all grave sites
and prisoners in their territory. The Security Council also
approved a 1,700-man international police force for Bosnia
which will be used to recruit and train a new local police
force. The US held talks with Turkey on setting up a
training program for the Bosnian (Moslem) Army. A Brigade of
the Russian 98th Parachute Division under General Alexander
Bespalov was in final training at Kostroma. The
international donors conference came up with $500 million to
start the rebuilding process in Bosnia. IFOR leased a hotel
in Ilidza from the Serbs to use as the ground force
headquarters. The Moslem government complained that IFOR
should have leased the building from it rather than the
Serbs, but IFOR said that as the Serbs presently controlled
Ilidza there was no real option but to lease it from them.
NATO shut down Operation Deny Flight over Bosnia. The OSCE
named Swiss diplomat Gret Haller as human rights envoy.
Russian General Staskov met with Bosnian Serb General Mladic
in Pale. [This was disturbing. Staskov is technically part
of IFOR, which is technically not supposed to meet with
indicted war criminals.]
  *  22 Dec: The Moslem government formally ended the state
of war. The Moslem government issued a statement promising
safety for the Sarajevan Serbs, but they remained skeptical
of coming under Moslem control. Many continued digging up
graveyards to move the remains to Serbian-held areas to the
east. Sarajevan Serb leaders were actually blocking roads
and stalling permits to keep people from leaving the city.
President Clinton and Senator Dole maneuvered over who would
visit the troops in Bosnia and when. (Both wanted to go as
soon as possible, but the Army wants to delay this for
weeks.) US troops went on alert when no one told them it was
the day for the Danish tank unit's target practice. Unknown
gunmen fired at two NATO aircraft involved in aid
operations.
     UNSG Ghali criticized Croatia for doing too little to
stop the killing of Krajina Serb civilians and the arson of
their homes after the Croats overran the area last fall.
Ghali particularly noted that Croat troops did not bury
Serbian dead reported by UN inspection teams and had not
turned over registrations for 750 new graves. The Security
Council demanded that Croatia drop its 27 Dec deadline for
Krajina Serbs to return to the area to reclaim their
property.
  *  23 Dec: British Light Dragoons were manning an outpost
near Banja Luka and said they had been welcomed by the
Serbs.
  *  24 Dec: Unable to get the pontoon bridge built across
the Sava (which was in full flood and wider than expected),
US Army engineers used some of the pontoons to set up a
ferry to move a few vehicles across the river each day. Two
British soldiers were slightly wounded by a land mine.
Moslem and Serb troops gave up their most exposed positions
in Sarajevo. Celebratory firing by Bosnians greeted peace
and the Christmas holidays. Serb and Moslem units exchanged
200 prisoners. The first US combat helicopters (three
Apaches and five Blackhawks) flew from Hungary into Tuzla.
  *  25 Dec: Sarajevo held the first peaceful Christmas
since 1992 as the Serbs and Moslems continued moving out of
frontline positions. US Navy SEAL frogmen checked the
bridging site on the Sava River for obstacles. A British
soldier committed suicide in Sarajevo. Bosnian Croat gunners
fired on a British helicopter near Jajce; it was not hit.
This was the fifth such incident, and NATO said that such
fire was "undisciplined and unacceptable". A US helicopter
made an emergency landing in Serb territory due to
transmission problems; it was recovered without incident.
  *  26 Dec: NATO reported no armed resistance to its
mission or its "go anywhere" mandate. The ferry carried six
Bradley scout vehicles of the 1/1 Cavalry into Bosnia, the
first armor to cross the Sava. Admiral Smith met Bosnian
Serb parliamentary president Momcilo Krajisnik in Pale. The
Serbs said they wanted to delay the handover of Sarajevo
suburbs to the Moslems; Admiral Smith (allowed by the
accords to grant such a delay) said a polite "no" but
indicated he might review the situation later if there was
good reason to. (The Moslems quickly expressed "deep
disappointment" with this answer.) US helicopters noted that
they were being "painted" by Hungarian air defense (not fire
control) radars when flying over Hungary and Croatia; this
was not regarded as a problem.
  *  27 Dec: The Serbs and Moslems had pulled back from
their front line position in Sarajevo. A platoon of Bradley
fighting vehicles was manning "Checkpoint Assassin" five
miles south of the Sava. General Nash held a meeting with
local Serb, Croat, and Moslem commanders at Porebrice to
establish rules and convince them to start removing mines.
The US agreed to send two artillery-locating radar sets into
Sarajevo to replace five Dutch and British radars being
moved west. In a month, French radars will replace the
Americans (two French radars are there now). Helicopters had
to rescue French troops at Mostar after a dam collapsed and
flooded their camp. Spanish troops completed a patrol
through Croat, Serb, and Moslem territory around Mostar,
entering areas previously banned to UN forces.
  *  28 Dec: The rising Sava River flooded out the US Army
camp north of the bridging site. The Army took over the
local ferry, shutting down civilian traffic across the
river. A detachment of US troops landed in Belgrade and
drove (in trucks and humvees) to Tuzla across the Drina
River bridge without incident. [These were the first NATO
troops to ever enter Serbia.] The Serbs complained that
most of the reconstruction aid was going into Moslem and
Croat areas. Bad weather stopped Italian troops from
deploying to Bosnia. The US suspended its sanctions on
Serbia and Montenegro.
  *  29 Dec: The Army sent heavy Chinook helicopters to
carry pontoons into the middle of the Sava River, speeding
up the bridge-building process. President Clinton arranged
to visit Bosnia in early January. A French plane landed in
Mostar, the first plane to land there since 1992.
     Despite UN warnings, NATO commander Joulwan ruled out
sending US troops into Eastern Slavonia, saying his forces
were totally committed with the Bosnia mission and he had
none to spare for Croatia.
  *  30 Dec: US Army Specialist Martin John Begosh became
the first US casualty when his humvee drove over a mine; he
survived with minor injuries. [The patrol thought it was
moving up a main road, but quickly found the road overgrown
with brush, indicating no one had used it in years. The men
on the patrol admitted that this should have been enough to
warn them to turn back.] Ukraine made a last-minute decision
to keep its 550 troops in Bosnia at its own expense in order
to enhance its international prestige. Several of Karadzic's
close political allies resigned from the Bosnian Serb
parliament as he steadily lost his grip on power. US Navy
technicians began operating an entertainment radio station
in Tuzla.
  *  31 Dec: US engineers finally completed the floating
ribbon bridge over the Sava River, and a column of US tanks
and armored vehicles from the 1/1 Cavalry began pouring
south. (The center section of the bridge is removed each day
to allow barges to move along the river. The bridge includes
85 floating segments, each 22 feet or 7m long. The total
span of 600m is longer than the 400m pontoon bridge at
Remagen in 1945. It actually includes a 373m span over the
river and a 225m span over a lagoon on the north bank.)
Bosnian Serbs in Banja Luka were increasingly unhappy with
their government  in Pale, which appeared to have no time
for anyone but the Serbs in the Sarajevo suburbs. The first
German military cargo ship arrived in Sibenik. Nervous NATO
troops watched as Bosnians of all factions celebrated the
new year with a fusillade of gunfire.

NORTHERN IRELAND: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     Sinn Fein chairman McLaughlin said that peace was
slipping from the grasp of leaders in Northern Ireland
because of British intransigence.
     Five former IRA members, all linked in some way to the
drug trade, were murdered in Ulster during December. The
previously unknown group Direct Action Against Drugs claimed
credit, but the British insisted it was the IRA. [The
British also did not regard these killings, as a violation
of the ceasefire.] The murders cast a shadow over the peace
process, and the British cancelled plans to give 10 IRA
prisoners early release. PM Majors said it was laughable for
Sinn Fein to continue claiming that it and the IRA were
totally separate organizations.
     On 20 Dec, senior British and Irish officials met for
the first time with a leader of an Ulster political party
(the moderate Alliance Party).

PERSIAN GULF: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  18 Dec: Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmad
al-Sabah (who had held the post for 30 years) offered to
resign after foreign policy differences with Emir Jaber
al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who then convinced him to stay on the
job. (The Foreign Minister wants to restore relations with
countries that supported Iraq during the Gulf War; the Emir
does not.)
  *  20 Dec: The IAEA said that documents turned over
recently by Iraq listed equipment used in pre-war nuclear
weapons programs that had been hidden or taken to other
locations. The IAEA said that these items might have to be
found and destroyed to meet the requirements of the UN
sanctions. Iraq pledged to cooperate and said it was still
considering a UN resolution allowing limited oil sales to
fund relief programs. President Clinton said he was ready to
talk to Iran but that relations could not be normalized
until Iran stops supporting terrorist and subversive groups.
  *  21 Dec: UN arms inspector Ekeus displayed a gyroscope
recovered from the Tigris River which showed Iraq was still
trying to secretly build large ballistic missiles. King
Hussein of Jordan warned that Iraq was close to the point of
collapse. Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad al-Thani, deposed as emir
of Qatar by his own son while on a trip to Europe, visited
the neighboring UAE in a move widely thought to start a
campaign to return to power.
  *  22 Dec: The Iranian opposition group Mujahideen Khalq
accused Iranians of attacking one of their bases near
Baghdad with an 81mm mortar. Iran dismissed new US
sanctions, saying the world would ignore them.
  *  23 Dec: Iran began a three-day naval exercise in the
Gulf.
  *  24 Dec: Iraqi Air Force Captain Asaad Rahdi Shadwan (a
recent defector) told Kuwaiti authorities that Iraq had
moved "eight batteries of Scud missiles" to a secret
underground storage facility 23km north of Basra last May.
(Under the UN resolutions, Iraq is prohibited from owning
Scuds or deploying any missiles south of the 32nd parallel.)
An Iraqi Air Force Major flew an Allouette helicopter (tail
number 1037) to Arbil and defected. Iran said the allocation
by the US Congress of funds for covert operations was
"outright terrorism". The Iranians complained about this for
a week, protesting in the UN and threatening to match the
funds with their own campaign against the US.
  *  26 Dec: Jordan seized a shipment of "highly dangerous
acids and chemicals" which had been hidden inside a shipment
of medicine being sent into Iraq. The Kuwaiti parliament
ratified the UN Convention Against Torture. France pledged
to send 70,000 troops and 320 combat aircraft to the UAE if
it was threatened. [A similar deal with the British is
stalled because the British refuse to put their troops under
UAE law when deployed in that country as the French did. The
defense pacts are intended to promote chances of arms sales
to the UAE and other Gulf states.]
  *  28 Dec: Iraq tightened its border with Jordan after
moves by the Jordanian government against Saddam. Iran and
Russia signed a 10-year agreement to cooperate on military
and energy matters. The UN said it would reduce the
peacekeeping force in Kuwait because of a lack of funding.
  *  29 Dec: The six GCC states, plus Egypt and Syria,
issued a statement backing the UAE claim to Abu Musa and the
Tumb Islands; Iran called the statement "devisive".
  *  30 Dec: Iraq signed a deal to provide oil to Jordan.
Iraq doubled the cost of draft deferments to $800 (at the
black market rate).

TURKEY, THE KURDS, AND THE FLAME OF ISLAM
EVENTS 1-31 DEC 95

     PKK leader Ocalon announced a ceasefire inside Turkey
on 11 Dec through the new elections and called on the Turks
to observe it. Turkey said his offer could not be taken
seriously and continued its campaign of counter-insurgency
operations. The EU approved the long-delayed customs union
with Turkey on 13 Dec, but it did PM Ciller little good in
the elections.
     Turkey held its new elections on 24 Dec. The Islamist
Welfare Party won the most seats (21.13% and 159 seats) but
not enough to take power as no major parties would ally with
them. The opposition-conservative Motherland Party won
19.66% (134 seats) while Prime Minister Ciller's True Path
Party won 19.37% (133 seats). The conservatives ruled out
any alliance with the Welfare Party, but negotiations to
find a working coalition could take weeks. The Kurdish
People's Democracy Party won only 4.17% of the votes; having
failed to draw 5%, it was awarded no seats in parliament.

FIGHTING IN LEBANON: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     While the usual ambushes, shelling, roadside bombs, and
night raids continued in southern Lebanon, events of late
December were dominated by the Israeli-Syrian peace talks in
Maryland. Syrian President Assad said on 19 Dec that he
wanted the fighting to end, but only as part of an overall
settlement. Hezbollah fired a series of Katyusha rockets
into northern Israel on 29-30 Dec specifically to disrupt
the peace talks; one struck a house, but no one was injured.
Israel said it knew that not everything Hezbollah did was
with Syrian permission, but that it also knew the Syrians
could stop the Hezbollah attacks if it chose to do so.
     During a firefight on 29 Dec, Israeli tanks fired "bee
hive" flechette rounds (each loaded with thousands of steel
darts) into the village of Qabrikha, killing one man. The UN
says that such ammunition violates the 1949 Geneva
Convention on humane weapons, but the ammunition is in the
US inventory.

Security forces killed 28 rebels in six operations during

time a bomb in a cafe wounded 23 civilians. Militants
continued terrorist attacks, killing pesants, teachers,
policemen, and journalists. Zeroual named Ahmed Ouyahia as
the youngest prime minister in Algerian history on 31 Dec.

ISRAEL AND THE SEARCH FOR PEACE: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said
that Israeli settlers would have to leave the Golan to
achieve peace with Syria. Syria said it was premature to
hold a summit between President Assad and PM Peres.
  *  20 Dec: Arafat gave his personal support to the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks to be held in Washington on 27
Dec. Israel announced that in order to reduce tensions,
Israeli Jews would not be allowed into the
Palestinian-controlled town of Bethlehem starting the next
day. [This was intended to allow the locals, 40% of whom are
Palestinian Christians, to celebrate Christmas without
conflict.] The Palestinian police said the five Abu Nidal
commandoes captured while trying to assassinate Arafat had
been linked to Iran. [Iran denied any involvement.] Israeli
police said they had arrested 15 members of a Hamas cell in
Tulkarm that had planned a series of suicide bomb attacks on
Israelis. Israel banned seven US Jewish radicals from
entering the country or claiming citizenship.
  *  21 Dec: Israeli troops left Bethlehem. Four days of
PLO-Hamas talks in Cairo had deadlocked. Hamas said it would
not take part in the elections but would do nothing to stop
them. It refused, however, to abandon violent attacks on
Israelis. Ariel Sharon decided not to challenge Benjamin
Netanyahu for leadership of the Likud Party. The 13 banks in
the self-rule area were transferred to control of the
Palestinian Interim Self-Governing Authority (PISGA).
  *  22 Dec: Peres said Israel would "give up the atom"
[i.e., its nuclear weapons] once regional peace was
established. Jewish militant groups were reportedly hatching
new plots to kill Peres since the assassination of Rabin had
accelerated, rather than stopped, the peace process. [They
might have done "better" by killing Arafat or Hussein, as
that would have provoked war.]
  *  23 Dec: Syrian President Assad, visiting Egypt for
one-day talks, said he wanted to speed up the peace process.
Samiha Khalil, a 72-year-old Palestinian rights activist,
became the only opponent for Arafat in the presidential
race. Deodorus I, the Greek Orthodox patriarch of the Holy
Land, signed over custody of the Christian churches in
Bethlehem to Arafat. [Moslem Caliph Omar had signed those
same churches, or at least churches on the same sites, over
to Patriarch Sophronius in 638AD. The symbolic return of
control supposedly strengthens Arafat's position in
demanding control over East Jerusalem, as it shows he can be
trusted to protect the shrines of another faith.]
  *  24 Dec: The Israeli High Court of Justice banned the
Shin Bet security service from using physical force during
interrogations. Arafat condemned Hamas for boycotting the
elections. Israeli officials were surprised at the optimism
shown by Assad but said the extent of its withdrawal from
Golan and remaining security provisions was dependent on the
extent of the peace Syria offered. Israeli Foreign Minister
Barak said it was time for Gulf and Maghreb Arab states to
make peace with Israel. [Those states have always insisted
that Israel must make peace with all of its neighbors first.
Barak was hoping for more pressure on Syria.] Palestinian
gunmen wounded an Israeli soldier on the Gaza border. A
group of radical Israeli settlers "just happened" to decide
to visit the tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem to pray, knowing
that the Israeli troops guarding the "border" of the
self-rule zone would not allow them into the city. They then
flooded the Internet with stories about how Israeli soldiers
had enforced anti-Jewish racism.
     An Israeli court-martial sentenced 31 paratroopers to
56 days in jail for abandoning their post on the northern
border for less than an hour on 21 Dec. The men felt that
their new commander was not competent and said he did not
take the advice they had offered. When the dispute reached
an impasse after four months of arguing, some members of the
company walked out of their post, then returned when they
had cooled down. They could have been sentenced to 15 years
in prison. It was the first mass desertion in the history of
the Israeli Army.
  *  25 Dec: Peres survived two no-confidence motions
against returning the Golan to Syria. Seven hundred
candidates had registered for the 83 seats on the
Palestinian council. Interior Security Minister Moshe Shahal
expressed concern that Russian organized crime groups had
moved into Israel and were trying to work their way inside
the political system.
  *  26 Dec: Syria announced a team of very low-level
diplomats for the Washington talks and said it would not
discuss terrorist attacks against Israeli troops in Lebanon.
Israel regarded both moves as disappointing. Palestinian
police began assembling in villages near Hebron. Samiha
Khalil pledged to annul the Oslo self-rule accords and seek
a better deal  if elected.
  *  27 Dec: New Israeli-Syrian talks opened at the scenic
Wye Plantation conference center on Maryland's Eastern
Shore. Israel said that the main issue was security; Syria
said its negotiators were told to be flexible. Israeli
troops turned Ramallah over to the PISGA. Arafat's Fatah
faction had posted 70 candidates for the elections, but
dozens of Fatah members who did not approve of the list
registered as independents. Fatah warned them to pull out of
the elections or face party discipline. Palestinian police
arrested an editor of the large al-Quds newspaper for
failing to print a favorable article about Arafat on the
front page. The editor said there were already four
favorable articles about Arafat on the front page; he was
released on the 31st. Israel said it would free 1,000
Palestinian prisoners in the next week. A US court ordered
Arafat to give a deposition in the Achille Lauro case or the
PLO would be held liable for the hijacking. Arafat refused
and said that a splinter faction had conducted the operation
without his knowledge or consent.
  *  28 Dec: Arafat increased the Palestinian Council to 87
seats (after getting Israeli approval for 89).
  *  30 Dec: Israel said the new talks with Syria were
positive; Syria said they were "still just exploratory".
Several Hamas members registered as independent candidates
for election.
  *  31 Dec: Israel admitted for the first time that its
Mossad agents had murdered a Moroccan man in Norway in 1973
after mistaking him for  a Palestinian terrorist they were
sent to kill.

SRI LANKA: THE WAR IN THE EAST: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: The government ordered an end to the ban on
local press reporting of military operations at midnight on
the 20th, and said that the ban had been necessary to stop a
disinformation campaign that would have disrupted the
successful assault on Jaffna. The Tamil Tiger (LTTE) rebels
said that the Army had blocked all traffic in and out of
Batticaloa, but the Army denied this. A new Army operation
was trying to cut another route into Jaffna through
rebel-held areas, including the villages of Tolapuram,
Moolai, Thunavy, Sandilipay, and Vadukkodai.
  *  20 Dec: Troops held Jaffna City but could barely move
because of the thousands of mines the LTTE rebels had left
there. Thousands of booby traps had been left behind in
books, toys, cooking implements, and other articles likely
to be picked up. Many of the mines are linked to large
charges in adjacent buildings. These conditions were making
it impossible for civilians to return to their homes. Army
troops destroyed two rebel boats trying to infiltrate the
Jaffna Peninsula.
     At least 500 well-trained LTTE rebels were confirmed to
be in two camps in the Vakarai and Verugal areas south of
Trincomalee. The Vakarai camp, headquarters of rebel general
Karikalan, had increased its operations, including a new
satellite dish and radio antenna array. The Sea Tigers had
shifted their equipment and operations to the Verugal base.
  *  21 Dec: The Army said that the refugees would return to
Jaffna by April. The rebels, under heavy pressure from the
refugees within their lines, were allowing people not of
military age to leave.
  *  23 Dec: LTTE rebels from the Vakari base attacked an
Army detachment 10km south of Valachchenai (in Batticaloa
district). The savage fighting left 33 soldiers and 60
rebels dead.
  *  27 Dec: Army troops killed 15 rebels that tried to raid
Putur (a town on the Jaffna Peninsula). Thailand said it had
found no evidence to support Sri Lankan charges that LTTE
rebels were operating from a remote island in the Andaman
chain.
  *  28 Dec: Sri Lankan police opened their first station in
Jaffna in 10 years. LTTE rebels had begun mailing letter
bombs to government and Army officials in Batticaloa.
  *  30 Dec: The LTTE said it was ready to resume peace
talks if the Army pulled out of Jaffna. The government
refused.
  *  31 Dec: LTTE leader Prabhakaran asked the leaders of
the Indian state of Tamil Nadu to support the rebel
struggle.

INDIA, PAKISTAN, KASHMIR, AND NUCLEAR THREATS
EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     Pakistan said on 20 Dec that it would not allow India
to gain an edge if it provokes an arms race in ballistic
missiles. Pakistan said it had made "a breakthrough in
nuclear technology" but was opposed to nuclear weapons
tests. Pakistan said any attempt by India to develop nuclear
missiles would be met "with an equal response" and called on
major powers to stop any Indian nuclear test. [The point of
such a test would be to verify that a new weapons design,
perhaps one suited to a missile warhead, would actually
work. The only Indian nuclear weapons test, in 1974, was of
an aircraft bomb.]
     India finally admitted that a botched commando raid on
al-Faran on 6 Dec had failed to rescue the four Western
hostages. Al-Faran insisted that three of them had been
killed and the other had fled into the night, but India said
police informers had spotted the men alive on 23 Dec.

PHILIPPINES: TERROR STALKS MANILLA: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     The Moslem terrorist group Abu Sayyaf and the communist
Alex Boncayao Brigade death squad continued to threaten a
campaign of death in Manilla, dismissing the declaration by
President Ramos that tighter security would stop such
attacks. Police and soldiers in the south went on "double
red alert" against expected attacks by Abu Sayyaf. On 31
Dec, police arrested nine more foreign Moslem extremists who
had entered the country to mount terrorist attacks.

NORTH KOREA FACES FAMINE: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     The UN wailed daily that North Korea faced famine and
starvation due to the destruction of crops and damage to
fields by the floods of last summer. The world, however,
showed little interest in helping the reclusive communist
state, which had brought most of its problems on itself and
which could solve its own problems by simply demobilizing
half of its vast war machine. The World Food Program was
forced to shut down its office in Pyongyang because no one
would donate food or funding. Even the release of five South
Korean fishermen arrested last May brought no aid. South
Korea said it would consider sending rice only if it
controlled the distribution, as the last rice shipment went
to feed the North Korean Army that threatens South Korea.
     There were frequent reports of "unusual military
movements" by North Korean troops just above the DMZ.
     Former South Korean Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh
Tae-woo were indicted on 21 Dec for masterminding the 1979
coup.

     There were a handful of scattered skirmishes with the
Khmer Rouge rebels, but the largest one (an attack on Poipet
on Christmas day) left only eight dead. The government
continued the conspiracy trial of Prince Sirivudh in
absentia. The government said new currency would be printed
locally to boost confidence in the economy.

AFGHANISTAN: AND THE ROCKETS' RED GLARE...
EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: Taleban fired 58 rockets into Kabul. Rabbani's
government complained that Islamic aid agencies were
ignoring the half-million starving people in Kabul. In an
attack at dusk, Taleban seized the Gardanak Hills near
Charasiyab.
  *  20 Dec: Rabbani's troops, supported by air strikes,
counter-attacked into the Gardanak Hills. Taleban fired
rockets into Kabul.
  *  21 Dec: Taleban fired 12 rockets into Kabul. Dostam
said he had rejected Iranian pressure to join the Rabbani
government alliance.
  *  22 Dec: Taleban fired 17 rockets into Kabul in two
volleys. The Afghan government denied any involvement in the
campaign of terrorist bombings in northern Pakistan.
  *  23 Dec: Taleban fired 9 rockets into Kabul, aiming for
the Presidential palace. Taleban opened a road for convoys
to reach the city, but fighting in the area forced the
trucks to turn back.
  *  24 Dec: Taleban fired 12 rockets into Kabul. Pakistan
accused the Afghan consul-general in Peshawar of spying and
ordered him out of the country in 48 hours.
  *  27 Dec: Taleban fired eight rockets into Kabul.
  *  28 Dec: Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev postponed a
trip to negotiate the release of seven Russian airmen

HAITI: WHAT DID PREVAL WIN?: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     The Haitian Election Commission certified on 23 Dec
that Rene Preval had won 89% of the vote, but opposition
candidates claimed that the lackluster turnout of 25% meant
that 80% of Haitians "had not voted for Preval" and
presumably did not want him as president. Two of Aristide's
bodyguards were murdered on 24 Dec by gunmen the police
linked to FRAPH militias. The US insisted that its troops
would leave as scheduled on 29 Feb.

COLOMBIA: DRUGS AND REBELS: EVENTS 1-31 DEC 95

  *  5 Dec: Colombia said it had forced down and destroyed
four suspected drug-running planes over the last six weeks.
The Supreme Court ruled that following military orders could
not be used as a defense for committing murder and torture.
  *  8 Dec: British Staff Sergeant Timothy Cowley, kidnapped
119 days earlier by FARC rebels, was freed by a police
commando raid. The government ordered the arrest of a former
colonel and two soldiers for a 1991 massacre of 17 peasants.
  *  13 Dec: The Colombian Senate approved a controversial
new law that would make it harder to convict drug barons of
"illegal enrichment". The US warned Colombia that next year
it would be much more difficult to receive certification of
anti-drug performance, without which aid would be cut off.
President Samper said he would not resume extradition of
criminals to other countries.
  *  14 Dec: The investigating committee refused to indict
President Samper of knowingly accepting drug money in his
campaign due to lack of evidence. The US State Department
criticized the decision, resulting in a sharp protest from
Colombia. Samper said that the US should give him a vote of
confidence, not criticize him for being innocent.
  *  18 Dec: Anti-drug Czar Gabriel de Vega Pinzon resigned,
saying his mission had been accomplished. About 30 ELN
rebels attacked a Venezuelan border post in a raid possibly
intended as a reprisal for a Venezuelan campaign against
them.
  *  19 Dec: Police grounded 20 planes in the eastern plains
in a massive crackdown on drug smuggling.
  *  20 Dec: An American Airlines plane with 165 people on
board crashed into a mountain near Cali. While there was no
indication of rebel sabotage, the destruction of a radar
station by rebels in 1991 had made the mountain passes
dangerous to fly through at night. (The replacement radar
has been sitting in its crate for three years for fear that
it will be blown up as soon as it is installed.)
  *  26 Dec: Rebels attacked Une, only 25 miles from Bogata.
Colombia said the guerrilla war had cost $12.5 billion since
1990, including $6.8 billion in lost productivity and $3.4
billion in direct military costs.
  *  27 Dec: The government began peace talks with the small
Jaime Bateman Canon Front rebel group. The group had broken
away from the M19 rebel group when it gave up armed
resistance in 1990. Some of the 24 legislators suspected of
taking drug money contributions in their campaigns were
considering resignation in exchange for charges being
dismissed.
  *  28 Dec: The Army said it had killed 657 rebels and
captured 3,284 during 1995.
  *  29 Dec: Ten policemen were killed when 100 FARC rebels
attacked Achi. Uruguay discovered a Cali Cartel base used to
ship drugs into Europe.

PERU: ONCE MORE INTO THE HUALLAGA: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     Army troops pushed once more into the Shining Path
stronghold of the upper Huallaga Valley, fighting a sharp
action on 16 Dec and pursuing the fleeing rebels into the
jungle.
     The US approved the sale of Israeli-built Kfir fighters
(with US engines) to Ecuador, sparking outrage in Lima. Peru
withdrew its ambassador to the US for consultations and said
the move would provoke a regional arms race. Ecuadorean and
Peruvian troops briefly skirmished along the Pastaza River
on 28 Dec; Peru cancelled New Year's leave for troops in the
area.
     President Fujimori said Peru had burned 30 metric tons
of cocaine and other drugs during 1995, a new record. (Only
11 tons was burned in 1994, 9.3 in 1993, 7.7 in 1992, and
6.2 in 1991.)

MEXICO: PRESSURE WITHOUT CONFLICT: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     Army troops moved toward rebel bastions in
mid-December, but withdrew without conflict when
pro-Zapatista civilians blocked the road into Oventic. [The
rebels planned to hold their second anniversary celebration
there; the Army wanted to disrupt the celebration by
attending uninvited but showed no intent to start shooting.]
The Army swore to "maintain vigilance" and withdrew.
     The US Drug Enforcement Administration said on 19 Dec
that Mexican drug gangs might replace the devastated Cali
Cartel as the primary source of cocaine for the US.

SOMALIA: PRESSURING AND POSTURING: EVENTS 1-31 DEC 95

  *  5 Dec: An envoy from opponents of Aidid asked Egypt and
the Arab League to stop Libyan support for Aidid. Fighting
broke out in Mogadishu between two sub-groups of the Habre
Gedir clan.
  *  6 Dec: Fighting broke out in Baidoa between the forces
of Aidid and the local Rahanwein clan.
  *  9 Dec: Relief groups warned that if the factions
continued to threaten their workers it would be impossible
to continue aid.
  *  10 Dec: Fighting broke out in Kismayu between Aidid's
vice president Mohamed Haji Aden and warlord Hersi Morgan.
  *  18 Dec: The radio station linked to Ali Mahdi reported
that journalists who wrote "unholy propaganda" in future
would be executed or have their hands amputated.
  *  26 Dec: Marco Lorenzetti, an Italian aid worker
kidnapped on the 18th, was released when Aidid ordered the
gang who had taken him hostage to turn him over.
Technically, Aidid "arrested and deported" Lorenzetti for
entering the country without a valid visa issued by the
"legal government" [i.e., by Aidid]. This political fiction
allowed Aidid to do a good deed for the Italians and
reinforce his dubious claim to power.

SUDAN "CANNOT FIND" MUBARAK ASSASSINS: EVENTS 1-31 DEC 95

  *  5 Dec: Sudan ended its ban on relief flights to the
rebel-held south, except to flights from Uganda (which Sudan
suspects is supporting the rebels with weapons and
munitions). Ugandan President Museveni said he would start
sending commando raids into Sudan if the Sudanese did not
stop supporting the Lord's Resistance Army's attacks on
Uganda.
  *  8 Dec: Sudan said its Army had killed 263 Ugandan
troops fighting alongside the SPLA rebels. (Uganda and the
SPLA maintain that no Ugandan soldiers have been in Sudan.)
  *  10 Dec: Sudan expelled 50 Ethiopian refugees for
subversive activities.
  *  11 Dec: Sudan called for Kuwait to normalize relations
[and resume foreign aid] cut off when Sudan supported Iraq
in the Gulf War.
  *  13 Dec: Sudan said that 70,000 Sudanese workers had
already returned from Libya and the other 230,000 would
return by February. [Sudan did not say where it will find
jobs for them.]
  *  18 Dec: Sudanese military President al-Bashir said that
he had brought the current presidents of Ethiopia and
Eritrea into power and that they had since turned against
him. Al-Bashir said that he would soon teach them "an
unforgettable lesson" for their treachery.
  *  19 Dec: The OAU called on Sudan to hand over to Egypt
the three men involved in the attempt to assassinate
Mubarak. Sudan continues to insist that it cannot locate the
men and assumes that they never entered Sudan or did so and
then left.
  *  20 Dec: Kenya asked Egypt to provide intelligence data
on camps inside Sudan harboring dissidents from many
countries, including Egypt, Morocco, Kenya, Nigeria, and
others. [The Kenyans were clearly not challenging the claim
that camps were present but simply wanted more information
in order to assess the threat posed by whatever training was
going on there.]
  *  21 Dec: Ethiopia asked the UN Security Council to force
Sudan to hand over the three men involved in the attempt to
assassinate Mubarak.
  *  29 Dec: Sudan authorized the OAU to send a fact-finding
team to investigate charges of terrorist bases in Sudan.

refugees in Sudan.

wing of ULIMO forced peacekeepers to pull out of Tubmanburg.
After three of the peacekeepers were killed by the militias,
ECOMOG sent tanks and self-propelled artillery to pound the
town. The battle raged until New Year's eve.

RWANDA: REPATRIATION GETS SERIOUS: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: Vice President (also Major General, also rebel
leader) Paul Kagame defended the expulsion of 43 aid
agencies because they had refused to cooperate with the
government. He said that the international community
"promises a lot, does very little, and wants our government
to solve all our complicated problems". UNSG Ghali said that
if the refugee problem is not solved, Rwanda could return to
genocide. Rwanda said this statement did not help rebuild
confidence in its government.
  *  20 Dec: Rwanda and Zaire agreed to work together to
speed up the voluntary return of one million refugees from
Zaire. UN High Commissioner Ogata pledged to do more to
repatriate them.
  *  21 Dec: The Tanzanian government ordered all refugees
in the country to return to their camps by the end of
December or face involuntary deportation. The UN said it
needed $288 million in aid for refugees from Rwanda and
Zaire.
  *  25 Dec: Six Zairean soldiers and several civilians were
killed in violence at the Goma refugee camp after a mob
killed a Zairean colonel and his troops went on a rampage.
  *  29 Dec: Zaire arrested eight prominent Rwandan Hutus
who had been hiding in refugee camps at Goma after being
accused of genocide and war crimes by the new Rwandan
government. The eight had been trying to prevent inhabitants
of the camps from going back to Rwanda.
  *  30 Dec: Gunmen shot and killed a bodyguard of exiled
Hutu millionaire Felicien Kabuga in Nairobi after he refused
to take them to Kabuga himself. Kabuga, who is very high on
the list of people Rwanda wants to prosecute (he owned the
radio station which issued the original call for genocide),
said this was part of a Tutsis plot to assassinate him.

of grenade attacks on foreign medical relief stations around
the capital. Canadian diplomat Marc Faguy was named as the

SOUTH AFRICA: BLOODY NATAL: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     Political violence between ANC and Zulu-Inkatha groups
in Natal Province (and particularly in the Kwazulu homeland
area) continued. On Christmas Day, Zulu warriors used the
classic "impi" envelopment tactics to surround a village
that was the stronghold of pro-ANC activists, killing 16
people and burning 80 homes. Human rights groups noted that
the average number of people killed in political violence
had fallen from 223 per month in 1994 to 97 per month in
1995.
     Inkatha reduced its demands for a provincial court,
militia, and justice system to "aspirations subject to
international mediation". The move, on 11 Dec, allowed
Inkatha to return to the constitutional drafting committee,
but the ANC said that the new proposal still amounted to
independence for KwaZulu.
     The UN excused South Africa from paying the $93 million
in dues it did not pay during the 20 years when its
membership was suspended.
     Rampant crime had forced dozens of neighborhoods and
business districts to form or hire vigilante groups for
security.

UNITED STATES: III CORPS, TERRORISM BILL, START-2 TREATY

     THE US ARMY has made III Corps (Fort Hood) responsible
for any war in Korea rather than the West Coast-based I
Corps. One scenario provides that the first III Corps units
to deploy would be the helicopter and artillery brigades as
these could provide key support to units already in Korea
and are easier to airlift than armored forces. In such a
contingency, the 13th Corps Support Command at Fort Hood
would manage the US end of the "air bridge" taking supplies
into Korea. That could create the first "intercontinental
corps" with its forward tactical HQ in Korea and its rear
logistical HQ in Texas.
     CONGRESS delayed action until sometime in 1996 on the
Clinton Administration's anti-terrorist bill because a broad
range of critics (liberal and conservative) fear it gives
the government entirely too much power. The bill had already
been rewritten to remove a controversial expansion to
wiretap authorizations.
     The US Senate agreed on 22 Dec not to try to amend the
START-2 Treaty before a final vote, but the vote itself was
delayed while waiting for resolution of the budget crisis.

UNITED NATIONS: CHILDREN'S WAR EMERGENCY PROPOSAL

     UNICEF (the Children's Emergency Fund and one of the
UN's success stories) celebrated its 50th anniversary on 11
Dec by announcing a plan to protect children from war. It
called for the minimum age for soldiers to be raised from 15
to 18, a ban on land mines, a "child impact assessment"
before any future sanctions are imposed, demilitarized zones
where women and children can take refuge during a war,
protection against sexual violence, resources for the
healing of emotional wounds, and medical support for
children during wartime.

EUROPE: NATO, BELGIUM, BRITAIN, CANADA, CYPRUS, CZECH REP.,
ESTONIA, FRANCE, CORSICA, GERMANY, HUNGARY, ITALY,
MACEDONIA, POLAND, ROMANIA, SPAIN

     NATO: France renewed an old idea on 19 Dec, calling for
a formal European voice within NATO. The US (supported by
Britain) has always resisted such an idea since a European
consensus (assuming that was possible) would tie the hands
of the US (which wants to control NATO). France also wants a
separate military command for the WEU, but Britain and the
US says this would simply duplicate NATO.
     BELGIUM: Separatist rivalries burst into flames on 19
Dec when the Flemish CVP party chairman declared that his
party would not allow Belgium to be "fed by Flanders and
milked by Wallonia". [Belgium includes both French- and
Dutch-speaking provinces that have grown increasingly tired
of being in the same country over the last two decades.]
     BRITAIN: British defense contractors complained to
Parliament that the steadily-increasing cooperation between
German and French arms makers could eventually reduce the
British arms industry to irrelevancy. British industry wants
to see the new European Armaments Agency used to build
cooperation between all of the European states rather than
its current role of cutting costs on previously-agreed
projects.
     CANADA: Prime Minister Chretien named LtGen Edouard
Jean Boyle to be Chief of the Defense Staff. He will be
promoted to full (four-star) general.
     CYPRUS said on 29 Dec that it would take legal action
against Turkey if it violates the ban on trade with the
Turkish Cypriot enclave attached to its new EU trade
agreement.
     CZECH REPUBLIC: Parliament stopped plans to modernize a
number of T-72 tanks and 24 MiG-21 fighters, ordering the
military to study financial and industrial aspects of the
deal. Local industry complained that there was too much
money going to foreign companies for things that could be
made at home.
     ESTONIA finally ratified (20 Dec) the agreements with
Moscow (signed a year earlier) covering the withdrawal of
Russian troops (long since completed) and the status of
retired Russian soldiers in the country. This cleared an
obstacle to improved relations with Russia.
     FRANCE will unilaterally keep its border controls in
place rather than ending them under the Schengen Convention.
Under that agreement, seven countries (France, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Germany, and
Belgium) were to end their internal border controls but
maintain external controls. France said that the other six
nations had failed to keep drug smugglers, terrorists, and
illegal immigrants out.
     A separatist bomb hit a public building in Corsica on
18 Dec; another destroyed three floors of a tax office in
Bastia on 24 Dec. Another bomb hit a tax office in Ajaccio
on 25 Dec. The hardline Historical Wing of the Corsican
National Liberation Front claimed both attacks. Yet another
bomb damaged a government office in Porto Vecchio on the
26th. Two more bombs exploded in Ajaccio on the 31st.
     GERMANY is investigating whether Iranian Minister of
Internal Security Ali Fallahiyan was involved in the 1992
murder of four Iranian dissidents in Berlin. Iran denied the
charge.
     HUNGARY has signed an economic cooperation agreement
with Sweden which includes studying the possible purchase of
the JAS-39 Gryphon (Gripen) fighter. This would be the first
export sale for the Gryphon.
     ITALY will try six executives of the Agusta helicopter
company for bribing government officials to secure a $500
million helicopter contract.
     MACEDONIA and Greece reached an agreement settling a
three-decade-old dispute on use of the waters of the Mesta
River on 22 Dec. Another agreement opened three new border
crossing stations to facilitate trade.
     POLAND: Less than a week before turning over power to
his rival Kwasniewski, President Walesa announced (19 Dec)
that the interior ministry had discovered that previous
President Oleksy (just selected as prime minister) was a
Russian spy. (Russia and Polish intelligence denied this,
and Poland's chief military prosecutor said there was not
even enough evidence to justify an investigation. The
documents did indicate that at least one Russian agent
considered Oleksy a "source" but that could mean anything.)
     ROMANIA: President Iliescu denied charges from an
investigative panel that he had hijacked the 1989 revolution
in order to seize power for himself and a group of
ex-communists.
     SPAIN's conservative Popular Party, which expects to
win the March elections, said it would adopt a tougher line
on forcing the return of Gibraltar to Spanish control.

MIDDLE EAST: EGYPT, LIBYA, MOROCCO, TUNISIA, YEMEN

     EGYPT: Eight hundred policemen stormed an island in
Assiut Province and burned 15 acres of poppy fields on 25
Dec. While police regularly burn such fields, this was one
of the largest such operations in recent memory.
     LIBYA: The US called (21 Dec) for stronger UN sanctions
"possibly including an oil embargo" against Libya to force
it to turn over the two men suspected of blowing up Pan Am
103. [Italy, Germany, and Spain depend on Libya for
high-quality crude oil and would suffer major economic
disruption from a Libyan oil embargo.] On the same day, the
Senate added tougher sanctions on Libya to a bill toughening
the sanctions on Iran. Gadhafy ordered defenses increased on
25 Dec to stop an expected surprise attack by US forces
based in Tunisia or Egypt.
     MOROCCO objected strongly when Algeria (which has
harbored the Polisario rebels) used its position as rotating
chairman of the Arab Maghreb Union to campaign against the
new voter registration rules for the former Spanish Sahara.
     Polisario complained that UNSG Ghali had virtually
endorsed the Moroccan version of the voter registration
rules for the referendum in the former Spanish Sahara.
     TUNISIA has opened a duty-free zone in Zarzis that
effectively gives Libya a gateway to international trade
evading the UN sanctions.
     YEMEN began the trial of a group of Islamic
fundamentalists on 17 Dec for a clash last fall in which
Three policemen were killed and 10 wounded. Of the 21 on
trial, nine are not in custody. The group had attacked a
wedding where (in contravention of strict Islamic custom)
the men in one room were able to hear the women in another
room singing. When police tried to arrest the group, a
firefight broke out.

ASIA AND THE PACIFIC: BANGLADESH, CHINA, HONG KONG,
INDONESIA, PAKISTAN, TAIWAN, TIMOR

     BANGLADESH: Violent strikes against Prime Minister
Khaleda continued, leaving hundreds injured. Tribal students
linked to the Shanti Bahini rebels in the Chittagong Hill
Tracts rioted on 21 Dec, leaving 60 injured. The US
ambassador arranged a meeting between rival party leaders on
24 Dec, the first such mediation in over a year. Police had
seized 500 weapons and arrested 5000 people in a
pre-election crackdown. Most of the organized crime gangs
had eluded arrest, however.
     CHINA declared (21 Dec) that the US media coverage of
it was "unfair and threatens to further damage relations".
China said that the US media focused on human rights, labor
camps, forced abortions, and military threats to its
neighbors instead of "the really big stories" of rural
elections, imposition of a five-day work week, and other
reforms. China issued a report on 27 Dec praising itself for
human rights advances. China arrested dozens of Beijing city
officials in late December as part of a widespread web of
corruption. The officials were known as "the princelings"
because they were children or other relatives of the party
elite.
     HONG KONG: China named a 150-member Preparatory
Committee to guide the government after the shift to Chinese
rule, but not a single member came from the Democratic
Party, the largest political party in Hong Kong.
     INDONESIA: Britain said on 19 Dec it would proceed with
the sale of 24 Hawk light attack trainers to Indonesia as it
was convinced they would not be used against rebels on
Sumatra, Timor, or Irian Jaya.
     PAKISTAN: Britain, France, Italy, and Saudi Arabia
closed their consulates in Karachi on 19 Dec due to concerns
over continued ethnic violence there. A car bomb killed 33
people in Peshawar on 22 Dec; Afghan groups were thought to
be involved. Seven Islamic religious parties called for a
nationwide strike against PM Bhutto's "incompetence and
corruption". Opposition parties demanded the removal of the
Sindh provincial government (made up by Bhutto's party)
because it could not end violence in Karachi.
     TAIWAN is interested in buying two used Dutch
submarines. Taiwan denied a report that it would develop its
own medium-range ballistic missile. President Lee said on 31
Dec that he wanted reunification with China but Taiwan must
"walk tall" and seek its own diplomatic status until that
time comes.
     TIMOR: After another wave of Timorese youth stormed
into foreign embassies in Jakarta demanding asylum,
Indonesia increased security around the diplomatic quarter.
Indonesia said on 25 Dec that it would take steps to crush
the rebellion on Timor but would not send more troops.
Simbolan said on 28 Dec that the Fretilin rebels on Timor
numbered 202 people with 94 weapons and had split into
several rival factions. Indonesia said it had spent $832
million on development projects in Timor over the last 20
years and the people had nothing to revolt about. Indonesia
continued its policy of deporting foreign reporters, aid
workers, and human rights activists who "caused trouble" on
Timor.

AFRICA: ERITREA, GAMBIA, NIGERIA

     ERITREA released the 196 Yemeni soldiers (and 17
civilians) captured during the battle of the Hanish Island
to the Red Cross; they were flown home on 30 Dec. Yemen
rejected an Eritrean offer to withdraw its troops from
Greater Hanish if Yemen withdrew its troops from the other
island.
     GAMBIA: Captain Sannah Sabally, a member of the 1994
coup, was sentenced to nine years in prison for trying to
kill Junta leader Captain Yahya Jammeh.
     NIGERIA: Police blocked a pro-democracy rally scheduled
for the 19th. The US Bishop's conference urged a ban on
non-humanitarian US aid to Nigeria. The British Commonwealth
sent a team on a fact-finding mission to Nigeria; the
Nigerian government welcomed the team but said it must
respond to charges that it was unfair to suspend Nigeria's
Commonwealth membership. Nigeria filed its claim to the
oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula (disputed with Cameroon) with the
World Court on 21 Dec. The UN General Assembly condemned
Nigeria on 22 Dec. General Abache ruled out any idea of
reinstating the annulled 1993 elections.

LATIN AMERICA: ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHILE, PANAMA, VENEZUELA

     ARGENTINA: The Argentine Army is so short of cash it is
leasing a barracks to be used as a supermarket for $101,000
per month.
     BRAZIL: Human Rights Watch  and Amnesty International
said there had been progress in Brazil during 1995 but
abuses by police and soldiers continued.
     CHILE: General Pinochet said he would remain head of
the Chilean military until tensions with the civilian
government eased.
     PANAMA: President Ernesto Perez Balladares fired
National Police commandeer Oswaldo Fernandez on 19 Dec and
replaced him with National Security Chief Jose Luis Sosa
after reports of an impending coup.
     VENEZUELA: Francisco Arias Cardenas, mastermind of the
4 Feb 92 military coup, won election as the governor of the
oil-rich Zulia state on 11 Dec.

PENA TO MAKE MAJOR `ITS' STRATEGY ANNOUNCEMENT

     At our deadline, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena was to
make a major intelligent transportation systems (ITS) announcement
regarding ITS deployment strategy and goals at the Transportation
Research Board annual meeting here.
     However, because of blizzard conditions on the East Coast, Pena's
speech was delayed until after our deadline.  Look for full coverage
in the next issue of GLOBAL POSITIONING & NAVIGATION NEWS.
     The ITS industry received a financial boost late last year by
Congress in the form of $223 million in 1996 funding (GPNN, Nov. 30,
1995, p. 1).  Of the $223 million, nearly $110 million in new ITS
funding was set aside by Congress.  Approximately $113 million was
targeted for ITS through the "1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation
Act."
     Last year, there were concerns, because of budget constraints,
that ITS funding would be "zeroed" out by the Republican majority.

ROCKWELL NAMES PATHMASTER MARKETING PARTNERS

     To extinguish persisting rumors that it may not be committing to
vehicle navigation markets, Rockwell Automotive Electronics recently
signed multi-year contracts with Directional Technologies and Entronix
International Inc. for nationwide distribution and service for
Rockwell's GPS-based PathMaster vehicle navigation unit.
     "We feel we have the best vehicle navigation system in the
industry.  Now we believe we have the best distribution and service,"
said Roger Stevens, Rockwell Automotive Electronics general manager. 
The announcement came at the recent trade show that many vehicle
navigation units are now being showcased: the 1996 International
Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
     Troy, Mich.-based Directional Technologies, which is experienced
in aftermarket products for corporate fleet accounts, will begin its
portion of the contract by establishing a nationwide dealer network,
the company said.
     George Derderian, Directional Technologies president, said the
deal with Rockwell gives his company a competitive edge in driver
information systems and traffic telematics.  He also said that
Directional Technologies wanted to enter the wireless integration
product field to include GPS, cellular and wireless data integration.
     In addition, Directional Technologies will provide national
distribution and marketing support that will include commercial and
corporate accounts.
     The company will establish offices in large metropolitan areas to
provide installation, sales, customer service and marketing support
for PathMaster.
Minneapolis-based Entronix International will provide repair and
remanufacture services and establish a nationwide installation network
for PathMaster.
     Entronix plans to distribute PathMaster to new car dealers. 
Distribution initially is planned for the San Francisco Bay area.
     The company will establish a chain of installation, repair and
remanufacturing outlets nationwide, the company said.  Entronix will
use its experience, which includes distribution of car stereos and
related products, for PathMaster's service and installation
activities, the company said.
     Currently, map data bases are available for the PathMaster system
in Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orlando,
San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.  In 1996, Rockwell hopes to expand
the system to Austin, Texas; Albuquerque, N.M.; Boston; Denver;
Dallas; Houston; Minneapolis; Philadelphia; Phoenix; San Antonio,
Texas; and Seattle.
     The Rockwell-based vehicle navigation system is featured in
Hertz, Avis and National Car Rental vehicles.
     In other CES show news, San Dimas, Calif.-based Magellan Systems
Corp. showed off its $200 GPS 2000 handheld receiver for consumer
markets.  In addition, Magellan displayed its aviation handheld with
cartographic maps and aviator data base.

AVL UNIT SALES CONTINUE RAPID GROWTH WORLDWIDE

     Automatic vehicle location units will continue to achieve growth
in 1996 in both international and domestic markets, many industry
observers believe.
     However, a saturation point may be realized in about five years
as trucking fleets, taxi cab companies and service fleets realize the
benefits of GPS-based fleet management.
     In a contract worth more than $3.3 million, GMSI, Canadian
subsidiary of Montvale, N.J.-based Geotek Communications Inc. and CEI
Technologies sold 4,400 GPS-based units to Comfort Transportation in
Singapore.  The units will go into the nation's largest taxi fleet.
     First deliveries are scheduled for later this month, with the
remaining units to be shipped by June.  With options, the deal could
call for as many as 9,500 more units sold to Comfort Transportation.
     Although its survey and mapping sales continue to see high sales
to lead the company, Trimble Navigation recently sold GPS/AVL systems
to public safety fleets in Aurora, Colo.; Monterrey, Calif.; and a
paratransit agency in San Jose, Calif.  A total of 122 units were sold
to the three companies.

GPS COMPANIES NOT HAPPY WITH SECURITIES LAWSUITS

     Although there are not many publicly traded GPS companies,
several are defending themselves against securities lawsuits that are
plaguing high-technology firms.  Dallas-based HighwayMaster
Communications Inc. recently was named in a securities class-action
lawsuit in a Texas federal court.
     The lawsuit alleges that the company's registration statement,
prospectus and other information contained in its June 1995 initial
public offering (IPO) contained "false and misleading" statements.
     The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, named the company,
its board of directors and lead underwriters from the IPO.  An
attorney for HighwayMaster declined to be interviewed.
     Another company also fed up with the plethora of lawsuits is 
Trimble Navigation Ltd., which has seen its stock go from about $8 to
more than $30, then drop to less than $20.
     Trimble recently was named in a securities class-action lawsuit
that was aimed at companies that experience a wide swing in stock
value.  The same San Diego-based law firm that is suing HighwayMaster
is suing Trimble and other companies.
     "I cannot understand the justification for permitting the
prosecution of these [lawsuits], primarily benefitting lawyers under
the guise of protecting shareholders.  A clever niche market [has]
been discovered to drain the energy out of the entrepreneurial
process," said Trimble President and CEO Charles Trimble.
     He said that the lawsuits will hurt high-technology companies'
ability to compete in international markets.
     Trimble also said it only takes one disgruntled shareholder to
extract millions of dollars from companies.  The cost is then passed
back to the shareholder in terms of insurance premiums, he said.

BATTELLE USING SIEMENS ROUTE GUIDANCE SYSTEM

     As part of a $14 million Federal Highway Administration project,
Battelle's Transportation Division is using an in-vehicle device
manufactured by Siemens for a Traveler Information Showcase in Atlanta
this summer.
     The Siemens in-vehicle device uses FM subcarrier transmissions
for route guidance, electronic yellow pages and traffic updates.
     The Siemens unit does not use GPS, although some companies such
as Cupertino, Calif.-based Differential Corrections, John E. Chance
and Associates and Cue Network Corp. offer differential GPS services
through FM subcarrier transmissions.
     Scientific-Atlanta, while not an ITS Showcase team member, is
using a GPS-based system in testing during the 1996 Olympics.
     Other technologies used in the Showcase include wireless data
transmission, cable television, the Internet and interactive
television technology.
     Although the users of the Showcase will be able to avoid
accidents through information provide, they will not be able to use
their devices to report incidents.
     The Showcase's map data bases are provided by Navigation
Technologies and Etak Inc.
     Other devices used in the Showcase will include handheld devices
from Hewlett-Packard and Motorola.  HP's entry will be the HP200LX
Palmtop and Motorola will test its Envoy system.
     Contrary to previous published reports, the Showcase and the 1996
Olympics, while running concurrently, are not affiliated with each
other.

INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES GIVE INSIGHT ON 1995 AND 1996

     If the positioning and navigation industry had to label 1995, it
could have been "1995: The Year Wireless Integration Spurred Industry
Growth."
     More and more GPS companies and software vendors looked to
partner with the big cellular, personal communication services, land
mobile radio and mobile satellite players to gain a foothold in
lucrative consumer markets.        
     The market segment that always has been growing has been survey
and mapping, with three to four companies always at the top of the
heap in sales.      One company even had a top-drawing survey show
that solidified its lead in that market.  However, even that company
has been making inroads into other areas such as automatic vehicle
location, vehicle navigation and even for the sparse defense
contracts.  Other companies have been dominant in defense market
realms, original equipment manufacturer products and consumer GPS.
     In 1991, the GPS industry was looked upon as a defense offshoot. 
Companies looked for growth as the constellation was developed by the
U.S. Air Force.
     Some concentrated in handheld receiver markets, others left after
a year or two because consumer interest was low.  Now, as the
constellation and industry mature, companies are finding more ways to
integrate GPS and other technology for consumer market entry.
     As we begin 1996, several GPS industry executives took the time
to reflect on the status of the industry and how their companies fared
in 1995.  Each company has found its niche in a particular navigation
and positioning market--and now are looking to expand into other areas
in 1996.  
     Here's what the executives had to say:

Charles Trimble
President and CEO, Trimble Navigation:
     "1995 has been another great year for the industry.  [Geographic
information systems] and tracking have been really strong and we are
also seeing the emergency of a strong avionics market.  
     "For 1996, land survey should experience continued growth in unit
volume, although the average selling price is dropping.  Car
navigation opportunities will continue to expand with unit volumes
anticipated to double again."

Robert Denaro
Director, Motorola Positioning and Navigation Systems Business:
     "I think our strategy includes [going after] the biggest volume
market opportunities, not niche markets.  In our core GPS business, we
are starting to see volume increases in automatic vehicle location and
timing markets.     "Simultaneously, we are seeing technology advances
in GPS that are bringing the cost down.  So the prospects for 1996
look very good.  A lot of press attention went to autonomous
navigation markets, but the late bloomer is wireless integration [of
GPS].
     "The great thing about wireless integration is that it will
enable a lot of people to get involved in GPS--to add value to
[existing products], and fuel the growth of the industry.  In the
past, it was one thing for a company to sell a handheld GPS to a
hiker.  Now, with wireless integrator, that's a huge enabler. Ford is
seeing a tremendous response to the Motorola Rescu system--and we are
hearing from people in the industry who are replicating [wireless
integration efforts]."

Chuck Boesenberg
President, Ashtech Inc.:
     "1995 has been an evolutionary year for Ashtech.  Late in 1994,
majority control of the company was assumed by Patricof and Co.
Ventures Inc., a New York-based venture capital firm.  Bill Bottoms
was named chairman of the board and I was named president and CEO.
     "We added two new board members, Rocky Pimentel of LSI Logic and
Chet Silvestri of Sun Microsystems.  We reorganized the executive
staff to include Todd Townsend as vice president of product
development, Sergei Gourevitch as chief scientist and Len Kruczynski
as director of strategic relationships.
     "We acquired Springhill Engineering, a company which develops and
markets precision farming equipment using GPS technology.  Ashtech
also entered into significant strategic partnerships in 1995.  In
addition to our ongoing relationship with Topcon, we added Philips
Semiconductor, Geotronics AB, and 
Sokkia Corp. 
     "These partnerships have expanded our area of expertise and
marketshare. Additionally, because Ashtech values the dedication
demonstrated by its employees we have added programs internally to
reward that dedication.
     "We feel the key to GPS realizing its full potential will be
adding applications that provide value for all people.  To this end,
we will continue to acquire companies, enter new vertical markets and
create strategic relationships.  Ashtech will continue to explore and
enter partnerships and develop products that will allow us to pursue
and achieve excellence in precision positioning."

W.H. Pomije
Director of Guidance and Navigation
Rockwell International's Collins Avionics & Communications Division:   
 
     "In 1995, Rockwell's Collins Avionics & Communications Division,
as the largest supplier of full military accuracy GPS receiver systems
to the [Defense Department], witnessed several major events.  One was
a ceremony marking the delivery of the 50,000th PLGR (Precision
Lightweight GPS Receiver) to the DoD.  The honored guest and recipient
was Lt. Gen. Otto Guenther, director of Information Systems for
Command, Control, Communications and Computers.
     "Another important milestone was the selection of Collins
embedded GPS by McDonnell Douglas for the Joint Direct Attack Munition
(JDAM).  Major implications in the growth of GPS technology have
permitted Collins receivers to a) decrease in cost, b) improve in
performance and capability, and c) the growth in the number of
applications, including the PLGR+Gun Laying System to swiftly survey
in mortars, artillery and mechanized howitzers, PLGR+ 96 receiver with
major enhancements, VPLGR+96 (Vehicular Precision Lightweight GPS
Receiver), development of miniature PLGR P-code engines, and
deployment of the lightweight, wearable plug-and-play Y-code Hunter
receiver.  Several countries, including Denmark, Norway, New Zealand,
and Germany, have chosen the PLGR as the standard GPS for their
armies.
     "For 1996, Collins Avionics & Communications Division foresees
more of the same, with further price decreases, continued performance
enhancements, and a steady growth in applications.  At least a half
dozen new surface mobility GPS receiver systems will be introduced
during 1996, aimed directly at helping digitize the battlefield.  And
more countries will join the those where PLGR receivers already are in
daily use by armed forces and approved government agencies.
     "[In addition to our defense products,] our GPS/geographic
information system-based precision farming product, VISION SYSTEM, is
expected to have a major impact in the agricultural marketplace in
terms of cost savings and reducing environmental issues associated
with farming.  VISION SYSTEM is a highly integrated crop management,
analysis and reporting product."

BRIEFS

     In the joining of two large GPS players, Lockheed Martin Corp.
and Loral Corp. agreed this week to merge their defense electronics
and system integration businesses.  Lockheed Martin will buy Loral's
defense electronics and system integration businesses for $9.1
billion--including $2.1 billion of assumed debt.  Nearly $7 billion
will be paid to Loral shareholders.  Lockheed Martin also will invest
$344 million for a 20 percent stake in Loral Space, which will allow
that business to operate with $700 million--with no debt--at a price
of $7.50 per share, the company said.  (Chip Manor, Lockheed Martin,

THE TOP INDUSTRY STORIES OF 1995

     During 1995, several positioning and navigation companies emerged
to lead the industry in surveying, vehicle navigation sales, military,
marine and other survey markets.  The editors of GLOBAL POSITIONING &
NAVIGATION NEWS recently compiled a list of the year's top news
events.

1.   WAAS Contract Awarded Amid Controversy 
     The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded a $475 million
contract to Wilcox Electric Co. for the nationwide wide-area
augmentation system (WAAS).  The General Accounting Office is
questioning how the FAA and Wilcox can meet its 1999 implementation
deadline.

2.   Wireless Integration Spurs GPS Industry
     Many GPS companies integrated GPS receivers into consumer
products such as cellular phones, mobile satellite units, land mobile
radio and wireless data to spur consumer sales.

3.   DOD Declares GPS Constellation With FOC
     In a long-awaited, but largely ceremonial event, the Defense
Department declared the GPS constellation with full operational
capability last summer. 

4.   NAPA Study Calls For Phase Out of SA
     The National Academy of Public Administration's report on GPS
called for the Defense Department to scrap Selective Availability--
much to DoD's dismay.

5.   Loral Federal Systems Grabs $400 Million Ground Contract
     Continuing its management of the GPS ground segment until the
Block IIF contract takes effect, Gaithersburg, Md.-based Loral Federal
Systems won one the largest contracts of the year from the Defense
Department.

6.   Trimble Sees Stock Go on Roller Coaster Ride
     Trimble Navigation saw its stock price soar to $35 per share from
around $8 per share in mid-1994.  Then the stock plunged to less than
$20 per share.  It was an investor's dream--and headache--in 1995.

7.   Block IIF Acquisition Contract News
     Formal request for proposals for a $3 billion to $3.6 billion
Block IIF constellation were issued by the DoD.  When awarded, one
prime contractor will be responsible for designing and manufacturing
33 GPS birds among other tasks.

1996 VEHICLE NAVIGATION SALES TO ACHIEVE MODERATE GROWTH

     The new year may allow vehicle navigation manufacturers and
integrators to realize some profits, but it remains to be seen whether
1996 will be the breakthrough year for the industry.  Manufacturers
will continue to gain publicity for new systems and consumer education
and awareness to vehicle navigation systems' benefits. 
     At the recent 1996 International Winter Consumer Electronics Show
(CES) in Las Vegas, GPS-based vehicle navigation products were
showcased in front of an estimated 100,000 attendees.  Companies
participating in an ITS America pavilion included Etak Inc.,
Navigation Technologies, Rockwell Automotive Electronics, Siemens ITS
North America, Sony Corp. and Delco Electronics Corp.
     Other vendors at CES, such as Sanyo Fisher Corp. and Clarion
Sales Corp., 
displayed vehicle navigation units for consumer awareness--not
necessarily to showcase for future U.S. sales.
     However, the consumer electronics manufacturers seem to be
coupling the navigation systems with entertainment systems with
several features.  The current train of thought for marketing managers
is to integrate vehicle navigation capability into radios, CD players
and other entertainment electronics to spur the industry. 
     Sanyo's unit at CES, its new NV-P1, is the first portable
navigation system with a built-in GPS antenna, color LCD monitor with
a TV tuner, CD-ROM and a CD player.  NV-P1 can locate the best travel
a route for a consumer and features Etak digitized maps, the company
said.  The NV-P1 has Naviken format navigation map software.
     The unit is selling in Japan for nearly $1,500, but there is no
scheduled date for its introduction to the U.S. market, Sanyo said. 
Sources said that only time will tell if vehicle navigation markets
will do half as well in the United States as those in Japan. 
Currently, more than 500,000 vehicle navigation units are being sold
in Japan for a variety of reasons.
     The unit constitutes the first U.S. unit to have a video port so
drivers can view videos and even TV while driving with a built-in TV
antenna.  A number of states have loosen laws that preclude a
television screen in a vehicle.  However, it may take a few years
before drivers may watch TV in vehicles--even if the LCD screen also
serves as a vehicle navigation screen.
     The unit can be taken out of a vehicle for portable use--a
feature that may be important in the U.S. market.
     Clarion also is integrated navigation systems with car multimedia
products.  In addition to a VRN1100 voice navigation system, the
company offers a in-dash, hands-free cellular telephone, CD player,
cassette player and TV monitor.    The VRN1100, which costs about
$650, does not use GPS as its navigation engine.  It uses a voice-
activated system that uses a car's wheel bearings for control.
     To activate the system, a person say "navigator," and the system
spells out the starting point and destination, which can be a 
street address, cross streets or landmark such as an airport.  If more
than one location exists, the VRN1100 tells the user what the better
route would be, the company said. 
     The VRN1100 maps cover Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Detroit;
Chicago; Indianapolis; New York/New Jersey; Northern and Southern
California; and Las Vegas.
     Clarion said the company may introduce GPS-based units in the
United States, but that move depends on market acceptance of similar
units made by other companies.  In Japan, the company's vehicle
navigation units equipped with GPS, like competitor's versions, have
been a huge success.  Trying to replicate that success in the U.S. may
take two to three more years, sources said.  

  ...Trimble-Delco Sign Vehicle Navigation Deal 

     To grab part of a vehicle navigation market it expects to grow to
more than $3 billion by the end of the century, Trimble Navigation and
Delco recently signed a memorandum of understanding to develop
consumer automobile GPS products.
     Although Delco has been using Trimble GPS board in its Telepath
100 series vehicle navigation units, the memorandum makes Trimble its
exclusive provider of GPS receivers.  Last year, Delco dropped
Rockwell as its GPS vendor.
     Trimble, always considered a market leader in the survey and
mapping, has acknowledged that vehicle navigation constitutes the
company's largest growth opportunity.  
     At CES, Delco and Chatsworth, Calif.-based ORA Electronics
displayed a Telepath 100 unit to provide vehicle navigation and hands-
free cellular interface capability.  Gershon Cooper, ORA's president
said the cars of the future "are going to be like giant computers with
wheels."
     The ORA cellular system, called Telecar, is compatible with most
cellular phones and is designed to integrate into most Delco radios. 
The company is marketing the system at Circuit City and Tandy's
Incredible Universe.  The company plans to ship the units in 1996's
first four months.
     In addition to cellular capability, Delco is enhancing its
Telepath 100 with its EyeCue head-up display.  EyeCue projects an
image of navigational information on a vehicle's windshield to allow
users to keep their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel,
Delco said.
     Delco's Telepath 200 series include GPS, the cellular system and
an AM/FM entertainment system.  Both the Telepath 100 and Telepath 200
systems have a PCMCIA memory card that features a single display
indicating a user's navigational menu choices and directional buttons. 
The distance to a user's destination also is displayed.    
     Overall, vehicle navigation companies are relying on early rental
car consumer acceptance of the vehicle navigation units to boost the
industry's market.  Avis Inc.'s Satellite Guidance vehicle navigation
units will be available at Denver International Airport, the company
said.  The Rockwell-built unit currently is available in California;
Florida; Nevada; Georgia; New York; Washington, D.C.; and in the
Midwest in Chicago; Detroit; and Indianapolis.
     A large advertising campaign for the units has boosted brand name
recognition not only for vehicle navigation, but for GPS, because many
consumers still do not know how the system works.

HEALTH CARE CONTRACTOR
PAYS $700,000 TO SETTLE
QUI TAM ALLEGATIONS

     An Ohio health care contractor and its three owners will pay
the U.S. government $700,000 to settle a San Antonio businessman's
qui tam allegations that they falsified information regarding the
company's size to obtain small business set-aside contracts from
the federal government.  United States ex rel. Reed v. Sterling
Medical Associates, Inc., No. SA-92-CA-0835 (WD TX).

     The settlement, approved Nov. 17 by the U.S. District Court
for the Western District of Texas, is the first qui tam suit to be
made public in the San Antonio division.

     Relator M.W. Reed's company, Med National Inc., often competed
with Sterling Medical Associates in the late 1980s for contracts to
supply radiologists for military health care operations.  Sterling
consistently underbid Med National, and Reed, suspecting Sterling
of gaining an unfair advantage, investigated the company's
practices.

     Reed filed his qui tam action in U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Texas, alleging that Sterling falsely certified
that it was a small business in bids for 11 government contracts
with the Army, Navy and Air Force totalling $5.5 million.  Reed
alleged that from 1986 to 1989, Sterling's revenues were higher
than the $3.5 million limit entitling companies to bid as a small
business.  Government regulations give small business priority in
contract procurement.

     The defendants denied liability for the allegations, stating
that it would have cost them more to litigate the case.  Reed will
receive 20%, or $140,000, of the settlement amount.

     Representing M.W. Reed was solo practitioner Glenn
Grossenbacher; and Rand Riklin and John E. Clark of Goode, Casseb
& Jones, P.C. in San Antonio.

9TH CIR. GRANTS HUGHES
STAY OF ISSUANCE IN
QUI TAM ACTION

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals Nov. 29 granted Hughes
Aircraft Co.'s motion to stay issuance of mandate pending its
petition to the U.S. Supreme Court that challenges the panel's
denial of its motion for summary judgment regarding qui tam
allegations that Hughes misappropriated the technology costs of
fighter jet contracts to various subcontractors.  Schumer v. Hughes
Aircraft Co., Nos. 92-55759 and 92-55857 (9th Cir.);  see
Government Contract LR, Dec. 21, 1995.

     The panel granted the stay after denying Hughes' petition for
rehearing on Nov. 17.

     Relator William J. Schumer, a former Hughes manager, filed a
qui tam complaint in U.S. District Court for the Central District
of California, alleging that Hughes mischarged expenditures to the
B-2 bomber program that should have been charged to the F-15
fighter jet program.  After finding that the government and the
programs' subcontractors were previously made aware of the
allocations by an audit, the district court granted Hughes' motion
for summary judgment.

     The Ninth Circuit on Aug. 22 upheld the lower court's
determination that Hughes did not defraud the government.  However,
it reversed the grant of summary judgment, finding a genuine issue
of material fact regarding the allegations that Hughes entered into
unauthorized commonality agreements.

     In its petition for rehearing, Hughes asserted that the Ninth
Circuit erred in holding that government audits do not constitute
public disclosure and that Schumer's suit is valid under the False
Claims Act.  Hughes argued that government contractor employees are
not included in a "closed loop of secrecy," because there "is no
aspect of secrecy in defense procurement that would require keeping
illegal conduct secret."

     Arguing for Hughes is James J. Gallagher, Fred D. Heather,
Mark R. Troy and Barbara J. Bacon of McKenna & Cuneo, L.L.P., Los
Angeles.

DC JUDGE WILL NOT DISMISS
HBI CASE; ALLOWS
AMENDED COMPLAINT

     A District of Columbia federal judge refused on Nov. 8 to
dismiss a lawsuit against contractor Healthy Buildings
International (HBI) charging that it falsified reports of
inspections of the level of environmental tobacco smoke in federal
buildings.  United States ex rel. Seckler v. Healthy Buildings
International.

     Ruling from the bench, Judge William B. Bryant of the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia lifted a stay on
discovery and allowed relator Jeffrey Seckler, a former employee of
HBI, to file an amended complaint.

     Seckler alleged in his qui tam complaint that between 1986 and
1992, HBI fraudulently conducted inspections of federal buildings
and submitted inspection reports that were fraudulent and false.
Seckler charged that HBI has a secret contractual relationship with
The Tobacco Institute (TI), a trade association funded by leading
tobacco companies, "to provide inspection reports that would not
focus on the harms caused by cigarettes, to reduce and adjust the
data from tests, ...to show reduced levels of and less harmful
effects from smoking, and to testify against smoking bans."

     In return, Seckler said, TI and the tobacco interests paid HBI
a fee for each inspection, provided HBI other fees and subsidies,
and "under the guise of grants [from Philip Morris, through TI],"
provided "hundreds of thousand of dollars to publish Healthy
Buildings International Magazine, which TI and Philip Morris
used...to combat the anti-smoking movement."

     The complaint also alleges that TI told HBI employees to lie
about their motivation for testifying and that HBI employees were
paid to spy on anti-smoking individuals and groups.  Additionally,
the complaint asserts, TI secretly reviewed many of HBI's speeches
and releases and conspired with tobacco companies to funnel money
to HBI in return for favorable inspections or testimony.

     "Despite the fact that by the mid-to-late 1980s HBI was
virtually a front for the tobacco interests, defendant HBI never
disclosed its relationship and agreements...to the United States
when it contracted to do the inspections..., leading the United
States to believe HBI's inspections would be impartial, fair,
honest and unbiased, which HBI knew in advance they would not and
could not be," the complaint states.

     According to the complaint, HBI routinely altered inspection
tests to reduce the impact of smoking but never disclosed this
practice to the United States.  Meanwhile, the complaint said, HBI
boasted of its contract with the government in promotional
materials and used the existing government contracts to obtain
further business with other federal and state agencies.

     Seckler said that HBI employees were told that any air
pollution problems could be alleviated by installing better
ventilation and that the employees were never to suggest that
smoking be banned or restricted.  Seckler also maintained that he
was instructed to lie about his identity when testifying against
smoking bans.

     Seckler said he was dismissed by HBI in September 1991,
allegedly because of poor productivity and expense account
irregularities.

     The plaintiff contends that the contracts signed by the United
States and HBI were false and fraudulent and seek relief under the
False Claims Act.  The lawsuit seeks restitution, treble damages
and costs.

     Seckler is represented by Alexander J. Pires Jr. of Conlon,
Frantz, Phelan, Knapp & Pires of Washington, DC.

CA HIGH CT. REFUSES TO
HEAR WRONGFUL DISCHARGE
SUIT AGAINST HUGHES

     The California Supreme Court Dec. 4 refused to review a
petition filed by a former in-house attorney of Hughes Aircraft Co.
challenging a Superior Court determination that the attorney was
not constructively discharged after refusing to accept a demotion,
because he failed to prove that Hughes created intolerable working
conditions.  Karambelas v. Hughes Aircraft Co., No. S050046 (CA
Sup. Ct.).

     The demotion stemmed from the attorney's supervision of a $45
million patent infringement settlement between Hughes and Ford
Motor Co., which later caused Hughes to release its claims against
the government in a separate suit worth $270 million.

     Petitioner Anthony W. Karambelas was employed by Hughes as the
assistant general counsel in charge of patents and licensing.  He
oversaw the company's patent litigation and was the main contact
with outside counsel representing Hughes in various suits.

     Hughes was the plaintiff in two 1987 patent infringement suits
involving the "Williams patent," named for the Hughes employee who
invented a satellite orbiting device.  One defendant, Ford Motor
Co., was accused of infringing upon Hughes' rights in the Williams
patent.  The U.S. government was sued in the other action for its
purchase and use of satellites infringing the Williams patent,
which included 13 Ford satellites.  Latham & Watkins represented
Hughes in the Ford case, and other outside lawyers represented
Hughes in the government case.  Ford settled the case in August
1987 for $45 million.

     Several drafts of the settlement documents prepared by Latham
& Watkins and reviewed by Karambelas contained a release of all
patent infringement claims against Ford.  Karambelas testified that
although he thought the release's language was "very broad," he
never imagined that it would "operate as a release of Hughes'
claims against the government."  The documents were signed in
September 1987.

     The government learned of the Ford settlement, and moved for
partial summary judgment on the ground that Hughes relinquished its
Williams patent infringement claims.  The U.S. Court of Federal
Claims granted the motion.  Hughes retained counsel to investigate
the handling of the settlement, which concluded that Karambelas and
Latham & Watkins negligently released Hughes' claims against the
government.  Upon its counsel's advice, Hughes did not sue Latham
& Watkins for legal malpractice.

     In May 1989, Hughes' general counsel notified Karambelas that
he was being demoted from assistant general counsel to patent
counsel due to his handling of the Ford settlement, his
"administrative failings," and his inability to work with fellow
lawyers.

     Karambelas did not accept the demotion, and was told by Hughes
that his only other choice was to resign.  Karambelas did not
return to Hughes after May 22.  He refused to sign a release and
held out for a "more appropriate" severance package.  Hughes
refused to increase the package, and notified Karambelas that he
had been "terminated for cause."

     Karambelas filed suit against the company in Los Angeles
County Superior Court, alleging wrongful termination, defamation,
invasion of privacy and blacklisting based on newspaper articles
describing the Ford settlement as a "major legal blunder" and
Karambelas as a "macho style" manager who left behind
administrative problems.  Hughes moved for summary judgment, or
summary adjudication of issues, asserting that Karambelas quit and
was not fired, that his demotion was not a constructive discharge,"
and that Hughes did not provide the newspaper article information.

     Hughes was granted summary judgment on the ground that
Karambelas quit and that Hughes did not provide information to the
press regarding the settlement or his performance at Hughes.
     Karambelas appealed to the California Court of Appeal,
contending that there were disputed facts regarding his termination
and that the trial court "seriously misapprehended its function in
ruling on a summary judgment motion."  The state high court panel
disagreed and denied review.

     The panel noted that the facts regarding Karambelas' departure
from Hughes are "irrelevant."  "What matters is his conduct
(expressly refusing to accept the demotion and telling his
coworkers he was leaving) and his own admissions at his
deposition," the panel held.  "It follows that the facts were
undisputed and that the trial court properly found that Karambelas
quit."

     The panel also rejected Karambelas' assertions that, if he
quit, it was a constructive discharge and triable issues of
material fact existed regarding that issue.  Citing to Turner v.
Anheuser-Busch, Inc., (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1251, the panel found
Karambelas failed to prove that Hughes "intentionally created or
knowingly permitted" intolerable working conditions compelling him
to resign.

     "Demotion, even if unfair or outrageous, does not by itself
create the sort of 'intolerable' working condition that is required
to establish constructive discharge, and a claim based upon a
demotion must be supported by evidence of something more, such as
harassment," the panel held.

     In addition, the panel rejected Karambelas' claim that there
were triable issues of fact regarding his defamation, invasion of
privacy and blacklisting claims.  The panel found Hughes met its
burden of showing that it did not furnish the press with
information and, thus, showed that Karambelas' claims were
meritless.

     Arguing for Karambelas was solo practitioner Gary D. Stabile
of Manhattan Beach, CA.  Arguing for Hughes were Paul Grossman, J.
Al Latham Jr. and George W. Abele of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &
Walker in Los Angeles.

8TH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS
ED MI DISMISSAL OF
ENGINEER'S BIVENS CLAIM

     A Missouri federal district court properly dismissed a former
civilian Army engineer's Bivens claim that the Army fired him
because he publicly disclosed allegations that the Army was
covering up reliability problems and providing second-rate
equipment to soldiers during the Gulf War, the Eighth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals held Dec. 21.  Weber v. Buhrkuhl et al., No. 95-
2554 (8th Cir.).

     The circuit court held that the plaintiff's allegations were
barred by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and the
Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA).

     During the Gulf War, civilian Army engineer Calvin J. Weber
told various news organizations and U.S. legislators that the Army
was covering up reliability problems and not providing the best
equipment available to soldiers.  The Army terminated Weber in
June 1993.

     Weber filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Missouri, alleging a violation of his First Amendment
right to free speech and seeking compensation under Bivens v. Six
Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388
(1971), in which the U.S. Supreme Court found that the plaintiffs
were entitled to monetary damages because their Fourth Amendment
right against unreasonable search and seizure was violated by
federal agents acting under color of authority.

     Weber maintained that his free speech and due process rights
were violated when federal officials allegedly made false
statements and perjured themselves when Weber appealed the
revocation of his security clearance and his termination.  The
district court granted the Army's motion to dismiss for failure to
state a claim, holding that Weber's allegations were conclusory and
that his due process rights were not violated when his security
clearance was taken away, because he had no right to clearance in
the first place.

     Weber appealed, and in a three-page opinion, the Eighth
Circuit upheld the lower court's findings, noting that even if
Weber's allegations amounted to a constitutional violation, the
CSRA and the WPA bar such claims.  The CSRA prevents the creation
of new judicial remedies for federal employees whose First
Amendment rights are violated by superiors.

     "We disagree with Weber that the defendants' actions fall
outside the scope of CSRA 'prohibited personnel practices,'" the
panel held.

     The panel added that the district court properly found that
Weber's due process claim based on revocation of his security
clearance was not a constitutional violation.

6TH CIR. REINSTATES SUIT
DESPITE FAILURE TO PRODUCE
OFFICER FOR DISCOVERY

     The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 reinstated
a breach of contract complaint although the plaintiff repeatedly
failed to produce an officer for depositions.  Roots Contracting
and Trading Co. v. Creighton Ltd. et al., No. 94-5752 (6th Cir.).

     The panel said if the suit is again dismissed, the trial court
must provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other reasons
to support the inference that Roots engaged in a course of conduct
to evade deposition and it must explain why lesser sanctions were
rejected.

     Roots Contracting and Trading, a Qatari limited liability
company, contracted for a joint venture with Creighton Ltd., a
Cayman Islands corporation headquartered in Nashville, to build a
government-sponsored hospital in Qatar.  The Qatari government
terminated the construction contract due to Creighton's work
deficiencies and delays.

     Roots sued Creighton and other defendants in the Middle
District of Tennessee for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,
dissolution of the joint venture, breach of contract and an
accounting.

     During the Persian Gulf War, two codefendants noticed the
Nashville deposition of Abdullah Hamad Al-Attiyah, who chaired
Roots' board of directors and served as managing agent.  At the
time, Al-Attiyah was chief of the cabinet of the Qatari Interior
Ministry.

     Roots opposed the deposition, contending Al-Attiyah was merely
a passive minority shareholder who performed no managerial duties,
received no salary and knew nothing about the company's business
operations; Roots also said its general manager, who was deposed,
had the same knowledge as Al-Attiyah about the hospital project.
However, the defendants offered evidence Al-Attiyah was a policy
maker and an operational factor in Roots.

     Al-Attiyah failed repeatedly to appear.  Roots argued that the
Qatari interior minister had refused to allow him to leave the
country; meanwhile, he rose to become minister of energy and
industry and president of OPEC.  Ultimately, Chief Judge John T.
Nixon granted a defense motion to dismiss the complaint as a
discovery sanction.

     The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded in a per curiam
opinion.  Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize
dismissal as a sanction for the refusal of an officer, director or
managing agent to provide discovery, this particular dismissal was
an abuse of discretion, the panel held.  Judge Nixon failed to
articulate sufficient findings of fact to justify the sanction, it
said.

     If Judge Nixon again dismisses the complaint on remand, he
must provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other reasons
for Roots' failure to produce Al-Attiyah to support the inference
that Roots engaged in a course of conduct to evade deposition.
Those findings also should explain why lesser sanctions were
rejected, it said.  In addition, it said there should be findings
as to how the defendants would be prejudiced if they cannot depose
Al-Attiyah in Nashville.

CFC CAN HEAR CLAIMS
LATER FILED IN FED.
DIST. CT., CAFC RULES

     The U.S. Court of Federal Claims may retain jurisdiction over
a claim that is subsequently filed in federal district court, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) ruled Dec. 26,
reversing and remanding a suit filed by a government contractor
seeking equitable adjustment for a flood control project contract.
Hardwick Brothers Co. II v. United States, No. 93-5050 (CAFC).

     In its determination, the panel reviewed the language of 28
U.S.C. Section 1500 and concluded that as long as the claim is
filed first in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), the court may
retain jurisdiction.

     In 1980, Hardwick Brothers Co. II contracted with the Army
Corps of Engineers (COE) to build a levee for a flood control
project in Missouri.  Six years later, Hardwick submitted a claim
to the contracting officer under the Contract Disputes Act (CDA)
for adjustments to the contract price.

               The COE denied the claim, and Hardwick filed suit in the CFC,
seeking damages based on defective specifications, differing site
conditions, rescission of a changed proposal, contract reformation
and failure to disclose superior knowledge.  After waiting 18
months for an opinion, Hardwick filed a Federal Tort Claims Act
suit in March 1992 in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Missouri to avoid a time bar based on spoliation of
evidence.

     Meanwhile, in April 1992, the CAFC issued an opinion in UNR
Industries, Inc. v. United States, 962 F.2d 1013 (Fed. Cir. 1992),
which upheld the CFC's dismissal of asbestos manufacturers' claims
for indemnification for several personal injury suits.  These
claims were filed against the government in various district
courts, which were pending when the manufacturers filed the same
suits in the CFC.

     In UNR, the CAFC noted that under 28 U.S.C. Section 1500, it
"shall not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to
which the plaintiff...has pending in any other court any suit or
process against the United States."

     After the issuance of the UNR decision, Hardwick dismissed its
district court action before the government responded.  Then, the
government moved to dismiss Hardwick's CFC action, maintaining that
jurisdiction was not restored by Hardwick's dismissal of its
district court action.

     The court dismissed the claim without prejudice, holding that
there was "no material difference in the operative facts in the two
actions" and that, because the UNR decision is retroactive,
dismissal was required.  The trial court denied Hardwick's motion
for reconsideration and denied the contractor's pending motions to
file an amended and supplemental complaint as moot.

     Hardwick appealed to the CAFC, which reversed the decision of
the trial court.

     The CAFC panel referred to Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United
States, 170 Ct.Cl. 389, 343 F.2d 943 (1965), in which the CFC
examined Section 1500 and determined that the CFC can retain
jurisdiction if a claim was filed there before being filed in a
federal district court.  The CAFC noted that the Supreme Court did
not overturn Tecon, and it "acknowledged the continuing vitality of
Tecon as an established precedent."

     The CAFC rejected the government's argument that Tecon should
be limited to the "unusual" facts of that case.  "Nothing in Tecon,
UNR, or our recent cases citing Tecon supports such a limitation,"
held the panel. "[T]he trial court indicated that its decision on
the merits of Hardwick's claim was ready to issue, then this
court's decision in UNR prompted dismissal of the claim."  The
panel remanded the case for judgment in accordance with the trial
court's decision on the merits.
               Arguing for Hardwick were Michael J. Blake of Sandler, Balkin,
Hellman & Weinstein of Kansas City, with Lawrence Lerner on brief.
Arguing for the government was Margaret L. Baskette of the
Commercial Litigation Branch of the Department of Justice,
Washington, DC.  On brief were Assistant Attorney General Frank W.
Hunger, Director David M. Cohen and E. Kathleen Shanan.

CONTRACTOR ENTITLED TO
TAX CREDIT FOR AIRCRAFT
DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COSTS

     A research tax credit is available to a company that incurred
research costs in a fixed-price incentive contract with the
government, because although the government made progress payments
toward the research, it is not considered "funded" under Section
44F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, ruled the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).  Fairchild Industries, Inc.
v. United States, No. 94-5116 (CAFC).

     In its Nov. 29 opinion, the panel found that the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims incorrectly held that because the contractor
expected to be paid for the research by the government, it "did not
itself incur" the expenses.

     In July 1982, Fairchild Industries, Inc. entered into a fixed-
price incentive contract to produce the T-46A training aircraft for
the U.S. Air Force.  The contract included a full-scale development
(FSD) phase in which Fairchild was to develop two prototype
aircraft.  Under the contract, the Air Force was to pay for
research only if Fairchild met the contract specifications.

     Under the contract, the Air Force paid bimonthly progress
payments, which were a percentage of the expenditures Fairchild
incurred.  After formal acceptance of a line item, the payment was
liquidated by being credited against the total fixed price.  If the
Air Force terminated the contract for default, all payments were
repayable to the Air Force under the contract.

     The ceiling price for the FSD phase was $133 million.  When
Congress cancelled the T-46A program in late 1986, the Air Force
paid Fairchild $53 million for the completed work, and $60.8
million in unliquidated progress payments.  The two parties agreed
to termination for convenience.

     An Air Force audit showed Fairchild completed 90% of the FSD
work and was entitled to payment of $120.6 million.  The $53
million in liquidated progress payments and the $60.8 million in
unliquidated payments were applied, and the remaining $6.8 million
was paid.

     Fairchild reported $109.4 million in research expenses on its
1982-1985 federal income tax returns.  The Internal Revenue Service
disallowed $50.3 million, maintaining that it was "funded" by the
Air Force.  As a consequence of this decision, the IRS disallowed
$5.8 million in research tax credits claimed by Fairchild for 1983
and 1984.

     The research tax credit was created by the Economic Recovery
Tax Act of 1981, which provides a tax credit of 25% of increased
research expenditures, which are compared with a baseline measured
by the previous three years' research expenditures.  Under the act,
a contract customer can claim a research tax credit only if the
contract requires the customer to pay for the research even if it
is unsuccessful.  However, the customer cannot claim a tax credit
if the contract provides that the customer does not have to pay if
the research is successful.

     Fairchild filed a claim for the tax credit in the U.S. Court
of Federal Claims, which held that because Fairchild expected that
it would be paid for the research by the Air Force, it "did not
itself incur" the expenses because they were "funded" by the
government.  The court determined that although the contract
provided for return of the progress payments if the project were
not successful, this was not controlling because, through the
payments, Fairchild "was spending the government's money to conduct
the research, not its own."

     Fairchild appealed, contending the Air Force did not, in fact,
fund the research because its right to payment hinged on the
success of the research.  Moreover, Fairchild argued that according
to the Treasury Regulation, research cannot be considered "funded"
if (1) payment to the researcher rests upon the success of the
research, and (2) the researcher keeps "substantial rights in the
research."  Both parties agreed that Fairchild met the second
provision.

     Regarding the first provision, the government contended that
whether research is "funded" does not depend on whether, under the
contract, the government has the right not to pay for unsuccessful
research.  Rather, the government argued, payment of the research
must be "unexpected or surprising" in order for the contractor to
receive a tax credit.

     The CAFC panel found that the trial court properly determined
that the availability of the tax credit does not depend on whether
the researcher is paid; rather, it depends on whether the contract
requires payment upon success of the research.  However, the panel
held that the trial court erred in determining that Fairchild "did
not itself incur" the research expenditures, because Fairchild
"received payments under the contract as its research progressed."

     Because Fairchild received the progress payments, and it
expected to eventually be paid for the research, the trial court
mistakenly determined that Fairchild's right to payment did not
hinge on success as that term is used in the regulation, held the
panel.

                    The panel found that the progress payments did not, 
in fact, ,
alter the contract provision that Fairchild was not entitled to
keep any payments if it did not successfully produce the product
for which the payment was sent.  "A progress payment does not
commit the agency to accept unsuccessful performance, or to make
full or partial payment if the product is not successfully
produced," the panel found.

     The government contended that only under "risky and uncertain
fixed-price incentive contracts" would the researcher be entitled
to the tax credit, and that the availability of the tax credit
cannot be determined until the project is over and the degree of
the researcher's risk of nonpayment is known.

     The panel disagreed, holding that Congress designed the tax as
an incentive to divert additional resources to research by reducing
the cost of that additional research.  "In harmony with this
purpose, the regulations state that the research agreement must be
'entered into prior to the performance of the qualified research,'"
noted the panel.

     The panel concluded that this "wait and see" view cannot be
applied to Fairchild's contract, because it expressly provides that
the government may decline payment if the research is not
successful; therefore, the research is not "funded."

     Arguing for Fairchild was Albert G. Lauber Jr. of Caplin &
Drysdale in Washington, DC, with Ralph A. Muoio and Julie W. Davis
on brief.  Arguing for the government was Steven I. Frahm of the
Department of Justice, Washington, DC, with Assistant Attorney
General Loretta C. Argrett, Gary R. Allen and Jonathan S. Cohen on
brief.

ED VA FINDS CITY'S
DEVIATION FROM CONTRACT
SHIELDS SURETY

     A city's failure to conduct reasonable tests and inspections
of work done by a contractor constitutes material deviation from
its surety contract, a federal judge in Norfolk, VA, ruled Nov. 29,
finding that, as a result, the surety is not liable under its
performance bond.  Continental Insurance Co. v. City of Virginia
Beach, No. 2:95cv212 (ED VA).

     The city of Virginia Beach contracted with Utility Builders
Inc. to construct water and sewer lines for $1.33 million.
Continental Insurance Co. executed a $1.33 million performance and
payment bond in favor of the city.  Utility received periodic
payments totaling $1 million before the city learned the company
had filed for bankruptcy; the city then declared Utility in default
and withheld additional progress payments. Before doing so, the
city had not made the inspections and tests called for in the
contract.
               The city demanded Continental complete the original contract
as the performance bond surety.  Continental hired a consultant to
prepare rebid documents, selected a bidder and signed a tri-party
agreement with that contractor and the city.  Numerous defects in
Utility's work were found; Continental and the city agreed to share
the remediation costs. The parties spent $321,563 beyond the $1.33
million original contract price.

     Continental sued the city to collect $234,828 it paid the new
contractor to correct or complete Utility's work.  The
diversity-based complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia also sought prejudgment interest, consulting
fees and a declaratory judgment absolving Continental of further
liability under the contract.  The city counterclaimed for $86,736
it paid the new contractor for repairs; it also asked for
liquidated damages under the contract for late completion of the
project.

     After a bench trial, Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. awarded
Continental $234,828 plus consulting fees, offset by the city's
$86,736 counterclaim.  He denied prejudgment interest and a
declaratory judgment to Continental.  He also denied the city's
request for liquidated damages.

     Under the original contract, the city was required to
reasonably test and inspect Utility's work before making payments,
but failed to do so, he said, rejecting the city's argument that
the city had no such duty.  As a result, the city made monthly
progress payments prematurely to Utility in violation of the city's
contractual obligations, he said.

     That material deviation from the contract discharges
Continental from its obligations to the extent it was prejudiced by
the city's failure to test and inspect, he held, adding that the
city's policy encouraged contractors to take the money and run.
The premature payments also hurt the surety by significantly
decreasing the money available for the project.

     The judge also found inadmissible the city's attempt to offer
extrinsic evidence as to custom and usage pertaining to
inspections.

     He allowed $23,573 in engineering consulting fees as
foreseeable expenses after the city's material deviation but denied
prejudgment interest as a matter of discretion, saying both parties
acted in good faith in a bona fide legal dispute.  A declaratory
judgment was deemed unnecessary.

     Continental was represented by Timothy G. Clancy of Cumming,
Hatchett, Moschel, Patrick & Clancy in Hampton and by Wendy Ann
Hartmann and Robert F. Carney of Whiteford, Taylor & Preston in
Baltimore.  Charles Bernard Miller and Richard Jay Beaver of the
city attorney's office appeared for Virginia Beach.

ED MI FINDS COUNTY
CONTRACTOR NOT LIABLE
FOR INDEMNIFICATION

     As a matter of public policy and Michigan law, a county
contractor is not obligated to indemnify the county for gross
negligence by county employees, the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals held Dec. 8, overturning summary judgment against a
contractor that provided medical services to jail inmates. Caldwell
v. Enyeart, No. 94-1406 (ED MI).

     Washtenaw County contracted with Correctional Medical Services
Inc. (CMS) to provide medical care to county jail inmates.  The
contract included a broadly worded indemnification provision.  In
1988, Willie Caldwell's mother, an asthmatic inmate, asked CMS
employees and a jail employee to hospitalize her; they failed to do
so, and she died the same night.

     Caldwell filed a Section 1983 complaint against the county in
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  The
complaint also alleged gross negligence by county employees and
gross negligence and malpractice against CMS and CMS employees.
The county cross-claimed against CMS for indemnification.  The
county settled with Caldwell, but CMS won at trial on the
underlying claims.

     Judge Patrick J. Duggan granted summary judgment in favor of
the county on the cross-claim, ordering CMS to indemnify the county
for the settlement and its attorney fees.

     The Sixth Circuit reversed in a majority opinion by Judge H.
Ted Milburn and remanded the case to determine the nature of the
settlement between the county and Caldwell.

     If the settlement included damages for gross negligence by
county employees, CMS would not be obligated to indemnify the
county, according to the court.  Caldwell's claims against the
county included allegations of gross negligence, and both Michigan
public policy and statutes prohibit preinjury contracts to
indemnify a party for its own gross negligence.  On remand, the
trial judge must determine whether the settlement agreement
included any admission of liability or guilt by the county and
county employees.

     Dissenting, Judge David A. Nelson said the contract language
does not provide indemnification for the county's gross negligence
and, therefore, is enforceable under state law.  However, he said,
the case should be remanded to determine what proportion of the
settlement and fees were attributable to the conduct of CMS
employees; only that portion is subject to indemnification because
liability based on the county employees' conduct did not arise from
the underlying contract.

GATT COULD CHILL GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY MARINE R&D
COST SHARING

     As international trade negotiations move toward a Dec. 15
deadline, lawmakers have told President Clinton that one of the
agreement's provisions could endanger between $2 and $3 billion
dollars of government assistance each year to industrial research
and development projects.
     In a Nov. 19 letter to Clinton, 21 lawmakers--representing
both parties and houses of Congress--noted that the language on
research subsidies being discussed during the current round of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) would "outlaw"
technologies resulting from certain types of government-industry
R&D partnerships. The letter was released by a bipartisan group
of senators and representatives led by Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-
N.M.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee technology
panel, and Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.), chairman of the House
Science, Space and Technology Committee.
     As a signatory to the agreement, the U.S. accepts GATT as
the controlling law for international trade.
     The GATT language would likely affect the Technology
Reinvestment Program (TRP) for defense conversion and dual-use
applications functioning through the Advanced Research Projects
Agency and ARPA's new MARITECH program for shipbuilding
modernization.
     An aide to Brown said the GATT provision would also capture
Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), through
which government and industry have collaborated since the late
1980s, affecting "dozens, if not hundreds" of programs.
     Specifically, GATT would make illegal technologies from
projects where a government pays 50 percent of the costs of
"basic industrial research" or 25 percent of the costs of
"applied industrial research," the letter says.
     As it stands, the measure would allow such assistance only
if companies submitted their plans to a GATT committee for
administrative review, a requirement that might have a "deterrent
effect" on some government-industry partnerships, the letter
says. Also, while the language contains a "defense exception" to
the provision, the Bingaman aide says that its most likely
reading protects weapons systems, not technology programs.
     The letter states that ironically, the U.S. government made
the first moves to include research subsidies in the GATT,
"apparently aiming at [the European] Airbus and Ariane" consortia
for commercial aircraft and space launches, respectively.
     In addition, the openness of the U.S. budget process and the
public disclosure required of U.S. corporations allows easy
access to information about government assistance. Other nations,
however, "provide the bulk of their assistance to industry
indirectly through tax holidays, favorable bank loans, [and]
subsidized land...which would not be captured by the [GATT]
language," the members' letter says.

NAVY SUB CHIEF TOUTS MULTIPLE MISSIONS FOR NEW ATTACK SUB

     The Navy's submarine warfare director, highlighting the
multi-mission capabilities of the New Attack Submarine (NAS),
said the service plans to begin NAS production in 1998 at a cost
of $1.5 billion per boat.
     Rear Adm. Thomas Ryan said Nov. 30 that he held out $1.3
billion as a personal objective for the unit cost of NAS, and
said that program officers are working to reduce construction and
life-cycle costs to meet that figure.
     A recent cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA)
validated the requirement for "the Navy's submarine for the next
40 years," Ryan said at a Naval Submarine League luncheon held in
Arlington, Va. The Defense Acquisition Board has not yet approved
development of a design for NAS.
     Ryan said that he expected to see an NAS about the size of a
Los Angeles-class attack sub, displacing between 6,800-7,000
tons. The program would build a series of NAS variants, each
varying somewhat depending on its intended mission. The part of
each submarine that would be different is the section of the hull
in front of the submarine's forward reactor-compartment bulkhead.
     Ryan said the COEA for NAS indicated that the Navy would
have to procure three of its own diesel-electric subs at a cost
of almost $2 billion to counter the threat a $1.5-billion NAS
could address.
     He also said that the Navy would optimize NAS's quieting,
speed, and shiphandling, and would modify the advanced-capability
torpedo to operate in littoral waters. Also, Ryan said that the
QE2, TB-29 towed array, and wide-aperture array sonars, some of
which may appear on NAS, will "significantly improve our ability
to detect and quickly target vessels in coastal waters."
     Ryan also discussed the role of NAS as a strike platform.
     With ballistic missile defense and ship self-defense
increasingly occupying space on surface combatants, Ryan said
that he has decided to include 12 vertical-launch systems in the
NAS while studying the addition of eight more launchers. In
addition, Ryan said that an NAS variant might provide the follow-
on to current Navy ballistic-missile submarines.

Optimizing the NAS Design For Specific Missions

     Turning to the future of the entire submarine fleet, Ryan
noted that DoD's Bottom-up Review identified submarines as the
most effective platform for four specific missions, "for which
the design of [NAS] will be optimized."
     The four missions are:
     * Intelligence Collection and Surveillance:  While
the Navy has developed super-high-frequency (SHF) and extremely-
high-frequency (EHF) antennae for use on subs, Ryan said that the
Navy will develop a stealthy sail for the NAS with SHF
transmission capability that supports imagery. This would allow a
submarine to broach the waterline and transmit collected data
without risking detection.
     * Mine Detection: Ryan noted that commanders would feel
uneasy committing a large amphibious ship or aircraft carrier to
an area not cleared of mines, and that countermine ships
operating in the littoral could face enemy coastal defenses.
     The Submarine Offboard Mine Search System (SOMS), the Navy's
"most significant new system for mine detection," will join the
fleet by 2003, roughly at the same time as NAS, Ryan said.
Deployable from a torpedo tube and tethered by several miles of
fiber optic cable, SOMS would allow complete coverage of bottom
and water-column spaces, he said.
     On other technologies facilitating this mission for Navy
subs, Ryan cited the minehunting capabilities of the AN/BSY-1
sonar deployed on Los Angeles-class boats, the Advanced Mine
Detection System under development for NAS, and the EXUS sonar
backfit for Los Angeles-class submarines without the BSY-1 sonar.
     * Special Operations: "The [NAS] will be designed from
the start to maximize SOF [special operations force]
capabilities," Ryan said, noting plans for a sub  capable of
shallow-water operations and bottoming "in many littoral areas."
In addition to providing a dry-deck shelter for delivery of Navy
SEALs, NAS will have a lock-in/lock-out capability and a
reconfigurable torpedo room to allow for delivery of swimmers or
supplies through torpedo tubes.
     * New Antisubmarine (ASW) Warfare Threats: "More
and more Third World nations are acquiring diesel submarines
since they are a high threat-to-cost platform against surface
forces," Ryan said. However, he added that unlike the former
Soviet navy, "most Third World submarines train almost
exclusively in [antisurface warfare]. Many don't have an ASW
weapon and have little or no training against other diesel
submarines, much less modern nuclear attack subs."

ROYAL CARIBBEAN INCREASES EFFICIENCY,
POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS WITH VMS

     Ship owners looking to buy a Voyage Management System this
year can expect to pay anywhere from $40,000 to $140,000
depending on the complexity and sophistication of the system they
choose.
     But despite tough economic times, companies like Royal
Caribbean Cruise Lines, which currently uses Sperry Marine Inc.'s
VMS on three of its cruise ships and has plans to integrate the
system on two new constructions, are willing to invest in such
systems because of the increased safety and efficiency that can
be derived from them.
     Designed to be used on virtually any vessel, from 80 foot
luxury yachts to aircraft carriers, Royal Caribbean uses VMS
because, "it makes it easier to get hold of information in one
location. You don't have to look at a lot of screens or
instruments to find vital information," Roar Molvig, Marine
Superintendent of Royal Caribbean, told MARINE TECHNOLOGY NEWS.
     But that's not the only reason Royal Caribbean purchased
Sperry's VMS.
     "Based on their technology and very much the price -- they
were very competitive in the market -- [Royal Caribbean decided]
they seemed to have what we needed," Molvig said.
     As well as providing the watch officer with specific
information on where the ship is and where it's going, VMS uses a
Global Positioning System to provide information on where the
ship is relative to such potential hazards as channel boundaries
in a harbor.
     VMS also assimilates input from ships' radar and is able to
superimpose on electronic charts the positions of "other ships
out there that [the watch officer] may have a concern with,"
according to Frank Soccoli, Commercial Marketing Manager for
Sperry Marine.

More Effective Conning Time

     The VMS also increases the efficient use of the watch
officer's time. "The centralized information certainly can
enhance the operation of the bridge and also the safety, thereby
making it more efficient," Molvig noted.
     "To some degree we get a financial return by having the
information about the ship's position," Molvig added. Knowing
this information makes a ship "open to savings" because it allows
the watch officer to more effectively determine appropriate
routing. He can also calculate the speed the engines need to work
at to meet the requirements of the voyage plan most efficiently,
Molvig explained.
     There are two main reasons a shipowner would want to use a
VMS system, Soccoli said. The first is safety: the watch officer
at all times is aware of the ship's surroundings and any objects
which may get in its path.
     In addition to making the crews more safe, however, Soccoli
noted that "a lot of owners are looking at trying to maximize
efficiency through effective manning." Depending on the company,
a bridge crew may consist of two or three people. Sperry's VMS
satisfies all international classification group "One Man Bridge"
guidelines for navigation equipment, meaning ships using Sperry's
VMS in international waters only require a one man watch.

IDB MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS TO OFFER INEXPENSIVE
ALTERNATIVE TO INMARSAT

     IDB Mobile Communications plans to offer a new satellite
telephone service allowing ships at sea to place and receive
calls for as low as $1.50 per minute during peak times.  The cost
structure is at least $4 cheaper than the lowest rates charged by
the International Maritime Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), a
70-country consortium based in London that now provides phone
service to ships.  Inmarsat's costs range from $5.50 to $10 per
minute.
     The new service, called Oceancell, will use the American
Mobile Satellite Corp. (AMSC) satellite, scheduled for launch in
late 1994.
     IDB Mobile's vice president of sales, John Marra, said
vessels trading in the inland waters and the Gulf of Mexico will
be able to "utilize high quality satellite communications, using
a mobile phone number and [will] receive a single bill." The
company estimates that ships calling on U.S. ports will spend
more than 25 percent of their voyage within Oceancell's coverage
area. The new service, the company said, will meet "substantial
pent-up demand" for cost-competitive satellite service.
     The satellite to be used by Oceancell is scheduled to be
launched in about a year by American Mobile Satellite Corp.
(AMSC), a privately held company based in Reston, Va. AMSC is the
federally licensed provider of mobile satellite services to the
U.S. market. IDB Mobile and AMSC have signed a value-added
service provider agreement under which IDB will service to the
maritime industry.
     The AMSC bird will cover nearly all of North America.
Service will generally be available within 200 miles of the
coast.  The Hawaiian Islands will be similarly served, the
company said. Users will be able to place calls anywhere in the
world. IDB Mobile said most tugs, barges, fishing and offshore
supply vessels will be in range of the Oceancell service at all
times. The service also will provide fax, data and GPS
capabilities.

Equipment Price To Range From $3,000 To $4,000

     To use the new service, vessels will need a small
transceiver and an antenna unit. The satellite's power will allow
smaller antennas to be used at reduced costs. The system will
come with its own handset, with prices ranging from $3,000 to
$4,000 depending on features and antenna type. Westinghouse and
Mitsubishi both are licensed to build phones for the Oceancell
service.
     IDB said it will use Oceancell to complete its second
generation of mobile services.  This summer, customers will be
able to use the company's Inmarsat M service in all four ocean
regions at a cost of $5 per hour or less.
     IDB, which had revenues of $148 million last year, operates
a domestic and international communications network that provides
television, radio, telephone, fax and data services.

NRL DEVELOPS FIBER-OPTIC MAGNETIC ARRAY SYSTEM

Researchers at the Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL) Optical
Sciences Division have developed a fiber-optic magnetic array
system (MARS) for underwater intelligence gathering. The program
is a cooperative effort between NRL and the Norwegian Defense
Research Establishment. MARS consists of eight nodes connected by
fiber-optic cable which is anchored to the seafloor. Each node
houses a fiber-optic interferometric magnetometer, a device that
uses light to detect changes in the surrounding magnetic field
caused by a passing submarine or other vessel. A NRL official
said MARS technology can be applied to a variety of civilian
situations where multi-influence, multi-sensor arrays are needed,
such as harbor and airport runway control.

Norwegian shipbuilder Kvaerner Mandal, which also has an RNoN
contract for a further five "Alta" class mine sweepers.
     The design of the new vessel, known as a "75 percent air
cushion borne surface effect ship," requires strict weight
discipline by the builder, according to Kvaerner. Application of
the surface effect configuration offers several key advantages,
according to Bore Norland, an official with Kvaerner, including
shock protection offered by the air cushion, and the placement of
all vibration-sensitive equipment above the waterline.
     The design means both crew and hardware are less exposed to
underwater explosions.
     The vessel was constructed at Kvaerner's purpose-built
facilities, which have been specifically designed to build both
civilian and military high-performance vessels.
     The company said the yard's unique configuration permits
cost savings of about 10 percent compared to conventional
methods.
     Delivery of the ship is expected in early 1994.

PROCUREMENT CUTS MAY STALL NLOS FOG-M

     Procurement cuts over the next few years in the Army's Non-
Line Of Sight (NLOS) fiber optic guided-missile (FOG-M) program
indicate that the service intends to halt the program after it
completes development and put the technology on the shelf for
possible future use, industry sources tell MILITARY FIBER OPTICS
NEWS (MFON).
     An Army source tells MFON that advanced procurement funding
for the NLOS FOG-M program was deleted for FY '91 and added that
it will suffer budget decrements in fiscal 1992 and 1993.  Fiscal
1991 procurement of the NLOS system is currently set at $131.2
million.
     The source also disclosed that the advanced procurement cuts
could result in an NLOS FOG-M procurement slip of six months to
one year.
     A spokesman at the Army Missile Command in Huntsville, Ala.,
could not confirm whether NLOS FOG-M advanced procurement funding
for FY '91 had been nixed but said that if this happens the
program schedule will slip.
     The FY '90 defense budget provides $129.4 million in
engineering development for the FOG-M program and $32.5 million
in advanced procurement.
     The reason for the advanced procurement funding cut,
according to one Army source, is that the Army's Air Defense
School in Fort Bliss, Texas, "felt it was more important that the
money go for other air defense programs.  They could live with
budget decrements in the early years of the program and the
program would still go ahead; it would just inconvenience them."
     The Air Defense School is the prime proponent for the NLOS
air defense application and has responsibility for establishing
the Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements
for the system.
     According to the industry sources, the Army has determined
for the moment that it is going to emphasize the Martin Marietta-
developed Air Defense Anti-Tank System (ADATS) over the NLOS for
the anti-helicopter role in the Army's Forward Area Air Defense
System (FAADS).  They said that the Army will develop and test
the fiber optic guided-missile technology but that the service
does not intend to procure or field this particular weapon
system.
     Last December an industry team consisting of Boeing Military
Airplanes and Hughes Aircraft Co. won a 43-month $125 million
contract for full-scale engineering development of the NLOS
system.  Current Army plans call for the eventual deployment of
18 systems per air defense battalion.

NLOS Associate Proponency Undecided

     A decision made in late August by Lt. Gen. Leonard Wishart
of TRADOC to establish associate proponency for the NLOS FOG-M
combined arms system at the Army's Field Artillery School at Fort
Sill, Okla., (MFON, Sept. 8, 1989), was revisited by TRADOC
Commander Gen. John W. Foss, according to an Army source, who
said Foss has put off a final decision on associate proponency.
He noted that the final decision will at the least "await the
results of the NLOS Concept Evaluation Program (CEP)" of which a
draft is due on Jan. 15.  He added that the outcome on proponency
is unclear due to "all the budget cuts and turmoil" associated
with projected defense spending reductions.
     For the past year the Army's Combined Arms Center, Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., has been conducting the CEP which is aimed at
studying ways to integrate the air defense and ground
applications of FOG-M, including feasibility of its combined arms
mission.
     If associate proponency is established, this could double
the size of the NLOS FOG-M program," Army sources told MFON in
September (MFON, Sept. 8, 1989).  If FOG-M is procured for field
artillery battalions, up to 36 systems could be deployed with
each of these units.  There are 16 divisions in the Army and each
has a field artillery and air defense battalion.

MOSBACHER BACKS TRANS-SOVIET FIBER LINK

     Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has endorsed U.S.
participation in a proposed international effort to lay a fiber
optic communications line across the Soviet Union if the
technology involved is not the most sophisticated available.  He
said recently that technology that is five to 10 years old could
be approved for transfer.
     Mosbacher's comments follow a recent warning by Frank
Gaffney, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear
forces and arms control, that the proposed fiber line linking
Japan, the Soviet Union and Europe would greatly improve the
Soviet telephone network and consequently enhance military
command, control and communications (MFON, Dec. 15, 1989).
Gaffney also said the fiber link would make it more difficult for
U.S. intelligence agencies to monitor Soviet strategic military
communications.
     Talk within the Executive Branch about relaxing export
controls for Eastern Europe has reached the highest levels.
President Bush said just before Christmas that "it's timely to
take a new look at some of the commercial constraints."  And
Lawrence S. Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, said in
November that "we and our COCOM partners want to signal our clear
willingness to respond constructively to the democratization
under way in Eastern Europe."
     The Defense Department, a key player in any decision on
relaxing high-technology export controls to Eastern Europe, has
not publicly made a stand on the Soviet fiber optic link issue or
on any recent comments by government officials expressing a
willingness to relax technology export control to East European
countries.  A Pentagon spokesman tells MFON that DoD does not
publicly comment on interagency issues and is not likely to on
these.
     Transfer of the fiber optic technology to the Soviet Union
is currently prohibited by the Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) and would need U.S.
government approval to take place.  COCOM approval is seen as
less difficult than U.S. approval because Western Europe, Japan
and Australia have historically been less resistant to technology
transfer than the United States.
     U S West International, the U.S. participant in the planned
international effort, is expected to make a formal application
for the project this month.

U.S. Planning To Ease Technology Export Controls

     In response to the rapidly changing political landscape in
Eastern Europe, the Bush administration is examining plans to
ease export controls on advanced computers and telecommunications
equipment to East European countries, Mosbacher said recently.
He added that special exceptions for Poland and Hungary might
also be worked out because these two have formed non-communist
governments.
     The Commerce secretary said that Polish and Hungarian
officials have said they would carefully manage the transfer of
Western high-technology exports to their countries to prevent the
retransfer of that technology and to safeguard any technologies.

DCA BEGINS USING COAX AND FIBER-BASED LAN

     The Headquarters of the Defense Communications Agency (DCA,
Arlington, Va.) has begun using an IEEE 802.3 standard ethernet
local area network (LAN) based on thick and thin coax Ethernet
cable and fiber optic cable for connectivity between servers and
the customer base, the Agency has announced.
     According to the DCA, the "fiber optic cable provides intra-
building connectivity, and thick Ethernet cable provides inter-
building connectivity.  Thin Ethernet currently provides
connectivity from workstations to the media access controllers."
     The announcement also said that the LAN provides E-Mail,
calendaring, user-shared text processing and access to the DCA
Wang hosts.  "With this robust mail capability LAN users can
contact approximately 1,500 DEA personnel in the National Capital
Region and the Acquisition Management Directorate at Scott, AFB,
Ill."
     A DCA official told MFON last week that the Agency plans to
have implemntation of the LAN at the DCA Headquarters completed
this month and will install a LAN at a DCA complex in Reston,
Va., this summer.  He added that DCA is looking into installing
the same LAN at its office complex in Europe.
     The LAN was designed and installed by the Army's Information
Systems Engineering Command, Fort Ritchie, Md.  And according to
the DCA, the LAN is "part of an overall networking project that
includes the installation of a broadband cable plant."
     Eventually, video distribution at the DCA Headquarters will
be carried over this broadband cable.  (DCA, 8th & South
Courthouse Road, Arlington, VA  22204.  Bev Sampson, 202/692-

IDA ANALYST SEES JAPAN DOMINATING FUTURE FOG MARKET

     Japanese firms are spending a lot of money on their
production base to build fiber optic material and component parts
for use in fiber optic gyroscopes (FOGs) in order to position
themselves to capture a large share of the eventual marketplace
for this technology, John P. McHale, an analyst with the
Institute of Defense Analyses (IDA), said recently.
     Speaking to the Washington (D.C.) Section of The Institute
of Navigation last month, the former Navy official said that "the
Japanese are spending out the door" for research and development
(R&D) on FOGs.  In an interview with MFON last month, McHale
said, "In my opinion, unless we control the market and obtain
adequate funding and have a U.S. capability, what's going to
happen is other nations are going to come in and invest money in
the technology, and Japan is doing it already, to become the
dominant supplier for high-quality, relatively low-cost fiber
optic material."
     McHale said that the United States cannot afford to have a
national R&D capability in fiber optics unless "we have a
production and manufacturing base.  And we cannot have a
production base unless we have a national economic base on which
it is built."  He described the economic base as being the
"demands, requirements, funding and long-term tax advantages for
companies to invest money into the product."
     McHale's views are not without foundation.  He retired from
the Naval Air Systems Command in February 1988 where he was in
charge of the Gyro and Inertial Systems Section for 20 years.  In
addition to his work at IDA, he is also a consultant to several
firms and chairman of the Critical Technologies Technical Working
Group (TWG) for Inertial Systems (4B) and of the Magnetometers
and Magnetic Gradiometers TWG (4E).  McHale has also been
supporting the Pentagon in the drafting of technical proposals
for U.S. negotiating positions for COCOM.

What Must The U.S. Do?

     Why are the Japanese showing such promise in the area of
FOGS and high-technology in general and what must the United
States do to make sure its firms capture at least a significant
share of the FOG market?  According to McHale, in Japan
centralized leadership for applying new technologies is provided
by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) which
helps Japanese firms plan long term, find product applications
and market overseas.
     He pointed out that there is no parallel in the United
States to MITI.
     "The long-term plan of any U.S. fiber optic company is zero
to five years," McHale said.  On the other hand, "MITI's long-
term plan is 250 years," McHale said, "and they have very
advanced planning in terms of technological and manufacturing
production capability and a masterplan for it at a nationwide
level."
     While the U.S. government does not necessarily have to
invest money into FOG R&D, McHale said, it must at least show
leadership in determining standards for the technology "so that
not all our companies are going off in 13 different directions
without a national plan.  U.S. companies are each going their own
way; They can't compete by themselves."
     In his speech McHale also pointed to the need for a
different tax structure for the U.S. industrial base that
provides incentives for investing.
     Concerning the current state of Japanese FOG technology, the
analyst said that he is not aware of any working fiber gyroscopes
in Japan today.  He said that the Japanese are concentrating
their efforts on the production base to build the material for
FOG and added that "devices will come next."
     Industry officials in the United States whose firms are
developing fiber gyros have told MFON in the past that the
military currently represents the most likely near term market
for the FOG technology.  However, these sources say the military
has not expressed any commitment toward buying this technology
and express concern that any applications for it may be years off
if the military does not move to procure FOGs soon.
     Asked about U.S. industry's concerns here, McHale pointed
out that Japanese firms, through the help of MITI, will find the
necessary economic base for fiber gyros by applying them in as
many product lines as possible.  He said the Japanese will build
small and inexpensive FOGs for automobiles, trucks, police and
emergency vehicles as well as for other vehicles and vessels.
For such applications, he said, the gyros would serve stability
and control and navigation functions.
     The problem, McHale said, is not in the U.S. labs, it is how
to get the technology out of the laboratory.  "The Japanese lab
work has duplicated a lot of what we do.  So when we drop out
because there is no short-term profit, the Japanese will pick up
where we leave off.  They are in it for the long-term," he
concluded.

DOD `TREMENDOUS NEED' FOR TACTICAL DEVELOPMENT OF FIBER, NEW
STUDY SAYS

     Companies involved with the development and manufacture of
fiber optic technology that do not anticipate entering the
telecommunications market will find a significant military market
for the tactical development of fiber optic technology, a
recently released study entitled "Fiber Optics in the Military
and Communications Markets" says.
     Prepared by S&W Associates of Bethesda, Md., the study
forecasts sea-based fiber optic applications increasing from $10
million last year to about $72 million in 1994.
     And S&W predicts a six-fold increase in the growth rate for
fiber optic avionics applications between 1989 and 1994.
Specifically, the study sees these applications, such as fiber
optic flight controls and high-speed data buses, either in new
weapons systems or as upgrades to existing platforms in each of
four military services.
     Electronic Warfare, command, control, communication and
intelligence (C3I) and navigation are areas seen in the study
that will be receiving funding emphasis within the mililtary.
     Taking into account that the Defense Department faces
budgets with "very little, if any, real growth," S&W notes
several other economic considerations impacting future market
growth for fiber in the military.  Because a lot of DoD money is
tied up in existing contracts, the study says opportunities to
employ fiber optics and related components either in new weapons
systems or to modernize existing ones, "will require demonstrated
capabilities and/or greater investment with a higher degree of
risk in regard to an adequate return on the investment."
     Concerning spending trends within DoD on fiber optic
technologies that are already being used, "priority interest" is
projected for the following:  "Wide bandwidth distributed
information and image processing; secure, TEMPEST certified LANs
and related processing systems; and, modernization of base
telecommunications systems."
     The Bethesda-based analysts see even more intense
competition ahead within the military fiber optic market due to a
slowdown in the commercial market and because "defense
contractors will be compelled to exploit future fiber optic
technology by finding not only the highest quality system
components at a reasonable cost but also by foreseeing and
satisfying requirements arising from ongoing military efforts."
And the study foresees the cost of replacing copper cable with
fiber cable on existing systems as potentially prohibitive.  (The
report sells for $995.  For more information or to order, contact
Phillips Publishing, Inc., 7811 Montrose Road, Potomac, MD 20854,

AWA DEMONSTRATES MILNET FOR FDDI DEFENSE APPLICATIONS

     The Australian firm AWA Defence & Aerospace recently
demonstrated MILNET, a high-capacity image, voice, data and
sensor network for local area communications applications, for a
variety of defense applications, the company has announced.
     MILNET is compliant with the Fiber Distributed Data
Interface (FDDI) Standard and supports both FDDI-I and FDDI-II
modes of operation.  Some of its potential applications include
ground/shipboard command and control, fixed/tactical voice and
data communications, shipboard internal/external communications,
air defense/ATC radar and communications, sonar/radar/optronic
sensor systems, secure building/base communications and
administrative backbone networks.
     The defense electronics company demonstrated its FDDI local
area network (LAN) technology at the Australian Industry &
Defence Exhibition held at the end of November.  According to the
company, the "demonstration consisted of two Backbone Nodes
interconnected by standard multimode fiber cable.  High-
resolution screen graphics were transferred between two
workstations connected to the Nodes.  Integrated Service Digital
Network communications between two Intercom stations attached to
the Nodes was also demonstrated."
     AWA expects release of the commercial variant of MILNET,
known as MERLAN, late this year, with MILNET going on the market
shortly thereafter, a company official said.  (AWA Defence &
Aerospace, 422 Lane Cove Road, North Ryde, Sydney NSW, 2113

BELL `DISAPPOINTED' OVER MISSING AF GYRO WORKSHOP

     A Bell Aerospace Textron official expressed "disappointment"
at not being invited to a mid-December Air Force workshop that
was called to get a snapshot of the current technology status of
fiber optic gyroscopes and of a micro-optic gyro for use in
tactical missiles and projectiles (MFON, Dec. 15, 1989).  "I feel
we should have been there," he told MFON, after saying his
company was not made aware of the workshop.
     Bell entered the fiber optic gyro (FOG) market in September
after the company signed a series of agreements with Standard
Elektrik Lorenz (SEL) of West Germany "to develop, market, and
team on programs which use the latest FOG technology" (MFON,
Sept. 22, 1989).  At the time, Bell officials said the agreements
represent the "first known commitment of FOG technology to the
production floor."
     The official noted that "the Air Force may have left us out
of the workshop because they were not aware that we are a new
player in the [FOG] game."  He pointed out that because SEL is a
foreign company, it is possible the Air Force did not realize
that the firm had a FOG.  "We are currently marketing our gyro in
the U.S." the official said, adding, "We expect to do well in
this country with the technology."  (Bell Aerospace Textron, PO
Box One, Buffalo, NY 14240, 716/298-6932.)

PENTAGON DRONE LANDSCAPE COMPLETELY CHANGED

     The year 1995 was a tumultuous one for the Pentagon unmanned
aerial vehicle program. A series of significant events have
further rocked the power of the UAV Joint Projects Office and
moved the Air Force into the center stage.
     And when the smoke cleared one program, the beleaguered
Hunter short range drone, would head towards the scrapheap.     
Pentagon UAV programs include the aforementioned Hunter, the
so-called "tactical UAV" formerly the close range or maneuver
variant, the medium range UAV, the Tier One endurance drone, the
Tier Two Predator medium-altitude system, the Tier Two Plus
high-altitude UAV and the Tier Three Minus stealth drone.
     The defense authorization budget vetoed by President Clinton
contained $23 million for the short range system; $26.8 million
for the tactical drone, a $10 million cut; $45.3 million for
Predator a $25.3 million boost; the $117 million request for the
Tier Two Plus system; and $66 million for the Tier Three
Minus, an $18 million hike.
     For the TRW Inc.-Israel Aircraft Industries Inc. Hunter
short range drone, acquisition czar Paul Kaminski is expected to
sign at any time a order terminating further Hunter production,
maintain eight aircraft and ground equipment at Ft. Hood and less
than a full system at Ft. Huachuca for training and doctrine. The
rest will be put in storage for attrition.
     According to a Jan. 5 Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office
(DARO) document titled "UAV Information Update," some details are
still being worked out. "Joint Staff has taken issue with the
deployment of Hunter beyond the one system and the use of
additional attrition vehicles out of storage," it said.
"DARO continues to work the funding color of money issue with the
Army and the Navy."
     And the Army has stopped recruiting soldiers and told Ft.
Huachuca,  Ariz., to shutter scheduled training classes,
according to the Sierra Vista Herald. 

Tactical UAV

     After years of delay, the release of a draft request for
proposals for the tactical drone program was expected to be
released Jan. 10 (solicitation No. N00019-93-R-0010). A notice in
the Dec. 28 Commerce Business Daily said a final RFP will be
released Jan. 24.
     According to the notice, the system should cost $350,000 for
the 33rd air vehicle and sensor. The 100th air vehicle and sensor
should cost $300,000. The program has also been attributed
Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) status. ACTDs
are reasonably mature systems that will be put into soldiershands
and will be made available for contingency operations.
     The ACTD plan is to buy six tactical systems, two mobile
maintenance facilities and eight attrition air vehicles and
modular mission payloads (MMP video and infrared sensors). There
will also be a low-rate initial production option for six more
systems, two MMPs and eight attrition vehicles and MMPs.
     The requirements call for 200 kilometer range, three hour
basic operation, to be upgraded to four, less than 100 meter
target location error and launch and recovery from unprepared
surfaces and large deck amphibious ships. Upgrades would add
automatic takeoff and landing and a heavy fuel engine. Payload
upgrades would include a synthetic aperture radar. The
systems will be carried aboard a single C-130 (four air vehicles
and ground equipment) and be transported on the ground by two
Humvees with a trailer. 
     Oklahoma Republican lawmakers are concerned about this
program's future. A Dec. 4 letter from Sens. James Inhofe and Don
Nickles and Rep. J.C. Watts expressed concern that the system
should carry a heavy fuel engine. They also advised the prototype
system be already demonstrated and available. Regarding the navy
requirement, they suggested a vertical takeoff and landing
system. They also advised that the target location error be less
than 100 meters.

     Endurance UAVs

     The Predator medium-altitude UAV has had some success in the
Bosnia theater and war games. A new sensor, a synthetic aperture
radar, has now been added. Integration of a vehicle has been
completed and a second system is being flight checked, according
to the aforementioned DARO document. Training on the radar will
begin at Ft. Huachuca, Ariz., on Jan. 16.
     Predator has also been used in conjunction with a aircraft
carrier battle group for the first tie in late November to early
December, according to a December Navy memo.
     For the Tier Three Minus system, a first flight is scheduled
for Jan. 27, according to the DARO document. And regarding the
Tier Two Plus, a major design review is slated for Jan. 29 to
Feb. 1.
     As endurance drones become more important to Pentagon plans,
UAV Joint Projects Office officials are concerned that their role
as developer and procurement center may be usurped by the Air
Force. After years of treating UAVs like poor relatives, it has
set up a drone squadron to handle endurance vehicles and a system
program office to manage them.
     Air Force officials are also interested in the Advanced
Research Projects Agency s Unmanned Tactical Aircraft program
examining robot jet fighters and bombers.

MILITARY ROBOTS EXPECTED IN BOSNIA BY APRIL

     Of all the Pentagon s robot vehicle programs, unmanned
ground vehicles (UGV) have always been the runt of the litter.
But its status may be changing due to increased interest in
anti-mine operations for which the systems are seen by many as a
godsend.
     For a case in point, the UGV Joint Joint Program Office, the
Army and contractors are preparing to send in April four
different types of robotic strap-on kits to Bosnia to turn manned
vehicles into remote control systems, said a knowledgeable
source.
     The engineer vehicles will perform a variety of tasks, but
the most important is mine clearing. The area holds an estimated
three million mines.
     The systems to be sent include the Panther, an M-60 tank
minus turret; Badger, based on a five-ton truck and Humvee;
Miniflail, a skid-steer loader with a chain flail; and Pointman,
currently based on the Westinghouse  Hazard Avoidance and
Reconnaissance Extender (HARE) II six-wheeled robot
chassis. The number of systems being sent is classified, the
source said. 
     Contractors involved include Omnitech Robotics (Panther and
Badger), Lockheed Martin Corp. (Miniflail) and Westinghouse
(Pointman).
     "There s a big push to get them over there in time for the
spring thaw," said the source.
     The Ft. Leonard Wood, Mo.-based Army Engineer School Robotic
Technology Insertion Activity is helping to construct new systems
and planning mobile training and logistics for the systems.     
The UGV master plan released in October calls for spending about
$260 million on the robots through fiscal 2001. Besides the
engineering vehicles the plan also funds the Tactical Unmanned
Ground Vehicle, Remote Excavation Vehicle System and the Remote
Ordnance Neutralization System.
     And along with mine warfare an increasingly important
application is security, and the Mobile Detection Assessment
Response System for interior and exterior applications enjoys
support in the services and Congress.
     In addition, the Army is prepared to approve an Operational
Requirements Document for the remote control strap-on systems
after the service formally accepts the Vehicle Teleoperation
Mission Needs Statement later this month, said a service source.

NAVY MOVING OUT ON UNDERWATER ROBOTICS PROJECTS

     In fiscal 1996 the Navy is preparing to move out on advanced
unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) projects. Such systems could be
worth billions of dollars over the next ten to twenty years, said
industry sources. According to a just-unclassified version of the
UUV master plan, "Clandestine mine reconnaissance is the Navy s
top UUV priority."
     The other applications include surveillance, intelligence
collection, tactical oceanography, special warfare,
counter-narcotics and counter terrorism.
     Special Operations forces are also keen on such systems and
have requested an Advanced Technology Demonstration to
investigate the performance of miniature UUVs such as those
measuring six inches in diameter and 52 inches long for shallow
water operations, said the plan.
     At the center of Navy UUV activities is the Near-term Mine
Reconnaissance System (NMRS). Last year a Westinghouse Electric
Co.-Lockheed Martin Corp. team won a contract to design, build,
test and support the system, based on a classified Westinghouse
robot.
     It will detect, classify and accurately locate mines. The
robot will be launched and recovered from a 688-class nuclear
submarine. Deployment is pegged for fiscal 1997.
     The so-called "interim operational requirement" calls for
one system, consisting of two UUVs, launch and recovery equipment
and shipboard command and control and support equipment. Its
operational life will be six years.
     Not only is the vehicle to use existing Westinghouse
hardware, the sensors will also be built from existing designs
used on the classified demonstration system, said the plan. In
addition, "The command and control consoles and the launch and
recovery subsystem built for the demonstration system will be
refurbished for the operational prototype system," the plan said. 
    Now the Navy is pushing the next stage, the Long-term Mine
Reconnaissance System (LMRS). The request for proposals for the
system is expected to be released in the Spring, said the Navy.
Milestone I, concept definition, is expected to be achieved this
fiscal year. Deployment would begin in 2003.
     The service is offering data on the system over the Internet
and will hold a classified biddersconference on the robot Jan. 31
at Johns Hopkins University in Laurel, Md. 
     The Navy late last month released new information on LMRS
requirements. "LMRS will capitalize and build on the concept
exploration and definition efforts supported by Congress and
executed for the Submarine Offboard Mine Search System...which is
canceled," said the plan.
     A Cost and Operational Effectiveness Analysis (COEA) has
been launched and will investigate three vehicle diameters, 21
inches, 36 inches and 54 inches. Also to be studied are three
launch and recovery options including torpedo tube, dry deck
shelter and wet dock. LMRS will be launched and recovered from
SSN688, 688I and NSSN submarines.
     Overall, the COEA will identify various task areas. These
include scenarios involving attack submarines; measures of
effectiveness and performance; threat mine types; offboard
vehicle alternatives organic to the submarine and available after
2005; and models and simulations. Leading the COEA is Johns
HopkinsJohn Bennedict, COEA director for the Submarine Offboard
Mine Search System. Among the LMRS operations to be considered
include scenarios in the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula, the
Far East and Korean Peninsula and Russia. Operators would include
Naval Expeditionary Forces conducting naval or amphibious
operations and submarines performing singular missions.
Missions would include finding safe passages without compromising
submarine stealth. Mine threats would include moored and bottom
mines. 

LMRS Requirements

     The Navy has also revealed a number of broad requirement
considerations depending on applications. They include:
     o Clandestine operations: LMRS should be stealthy and use
standard SSN communications links in accepted anti-mine warfare
reporting formats.
     o Exploratory mine reconnaissance: the robot would be
capable of detecting bottom and other objects and classifying
them. The system should be able to find safe routes or operating
areas for naval forces.
     o Support multiple ship operations: LMRS should be able to
support a wide array of naval force operations, not just its host
ship.
     o Single ship operational support: UUV installation,
operation and performance should not hinder SSN operations and
missions.
     o Early reconnaissance: the robot should be capable of
deployment to forward sites prior to hostilities and naval force
build-up. "Under normal conditions, the system will be routinely
deployed aboard CONUS [continental United States] SSNs being
forward deployed," said the Navy s just-released June 7, 1995,
LMRS Top-Level Requirements document. The UUV should be rapidly
deployed at forward sites in an emergency.
     o Required functions: the LMRS should be self-powered and
self-propelled and capable of operating at variable depths.
Reverse propulsion may be necessary for launch and recovery
operations. For the sensors at a minimum they should detect
objects and provide enough information for characterization or
discrimination without further sensing.
     The navigation suite should allow the UUV to locate the
position of detected objects in a geodetic reference frame,
relocate and rendezvous with the SSN mother ship after a sortie
and conduct maneuvers in real-time along reconnaissance plans,
including reacquisition of previously detected targets.
     The Top-Level Requirements document also said LMRS should
include automated launch and recovery. Both autonomous and
semi-autonomous operations will be considered.
     Some specific design parameters include for deep water depth
of 600 feet, temperature 11.5 degrees Celsius, salinity of 35
ppt, density of 1.027 gallons per centimeters squared, sandy
bottoms, sound velocity of 1,500 meters per second and sea state
two. The nominal UUV search altitude would be 100 feet above the
bottom. The nominal altitude for object identification is 30 feet
to 50 feet above the bottom.
     For shallow water, the parameters include water depth of 100
feet, temperature of 22 degrees Celsius, salinity of 36 ppt,
density of 1.025 gallons per cubic centimeter, sandy bottom,
sound velocity of 1,522 meters per second, sea state two, 30 feet
above the bottom for nominal search altitude and 30 feet to 50
feet above the bottom for identification altitude.
     The mine threats the UUV will be used to detect include
bottom-type, close-tethered and deep volume. There is no
requirement for LMRS to detect or classify tethered near-surface
mines, floating or buried mines.
     Installation of LMRS aboard a submarine will be temporary
and not excessively impact boat operations and missions. But
according to the Navy requirements document, "some offload of
weapons will be necessary to accommodate the command, control and
replenishment elements of the system."
     In addition, there is no requirement for LMRS operations to
be compatible with SSN towed array operations. But speed, heading
and depth considerations on the mother ship will be necessary for
selected LMRS operation periods, said the document. At a minimum
such periods will include UUV launch and recovery and homing and
docking.
     The Navy has established two design cost goals for a six to
seven years of $143 million and $214 million in then-year
dollars. A single system would include two UUVs.

Joint Space Management Board finalized

      Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Director 
of Central Intelligence John M. Deutch agreed late 
last month to the shape and scope of the long awaited 
but oft-delayed Joint Space Management Board 
(JSMB). 
     In an agreement signed Dec. 13th, Perry and 
Deutch established the JSMB as a "board of 
directors" for defense and intelligence-related U.S. 
space programs. The board will provide executive 
management for the various military and civilian-
controlled space programs with intel functions, as 
well as direct oversight of the newly created National 
Space Architect post. 
     The board's first task is to integrate policy, 
requirements, architectures, acquisition strategies and 
funding needs.

**DoD, CIA to share leadership roles

      The Pentagon announced direction of the board 
will be provided by a co-chairmanship of 
Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and 
Technology Paul G. Kaminski and Deputy Director 
of Central Intelligence George J. Tenet. 
     This management team will be backed by an 
executive committee empowered to act by the 
secretary of Defense and the director of Central 
Intelligence, giving it broad executive powers within 
the charter of the JSMB. That committee will be 
comprised of the two co-chairs, plus the vice 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 
executive director, Intelligence Community Affairs.

**Part of a three-phase reorganization

      The DoD had previously placed the formation of 
the JSMB as the third element of a reorganization 
plan for defense space programs.
     In the first phase, an undersecretary of Defense 
for Space was created Dec. 10, 1994. Consolidations 
of space requirements and acquisition plans began 
last year under that new office, now held by former 
Capitol Hill staffer Bob Davis. 
     Next Kaminski's office created a Space Architect 
post to be responsible for acquisitions for military 
space programs, from satellites and ground elements 
to launchers. Last fall that post was filled by Air 
Force Brig. Gen. Robert Dickman.
     While Dickman and Davis report to Kaminski, 
Davis remains in overall charge of U.S. military 
space policy. With the JSMB in place, a new defense 
space use directive and a National Security Policy for 
Space are expected to emerge this year. 
     Space chief Davis told Military Space last fall that 
new policy documents were in preparation and 
constituted his first priorities, along with program 
consolidations. 

**Details of JSMB membership

      Other JSMB members include the Pentagon's 
controller; Vice Chief of Staff of the Army; Vice 
Chief of Naval Operations; Vice Chief of Staff of the 
Air Force; Assistant Commandant of the Marine 
Corps; the acquisition executives of the Army, Navy 
and Air Force; Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Command, Control Communications and 
Intelligence; Director, Program Analysis and 
Evaluation; Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for 
Space; Commander-in-Chief U.S. Space Command.
     Also Executive Director Central Intelligence 
Agency; and the directors, National Security Agency, 
National Reconnaissance Office, Defense 
Intelligence Agency, National Imagery and Mapping 
Agency (ex-officio until agency is formally 
established by act of Congress), and director, Bureau 
of Intelligence and Research Dept. of State.

**Charter lays out specifics

      Other details of the JSMB charter as agreed to by 
Perry and Deutch include:
     * Overall policy and program guidance for 
defense and intelligence space programs, including 
review function and approval of all trade-offs among 
requirements, programs and resources.
     * Review and approval of all defense and 
intelligence space policies, architectures and program 
plans for consistency with current JSMB policy and 
program guidance. 
     * Develop and make recommendations regarding 
defense and intelligence space program budget 
matters to the Expanded Defense Resources Board.
     * Establishment the integration of defense and 
intelligence space architectures under a single 
National Security Space Architect, with authority to 
design implementation of programs and 
architectures.
     * Provide recommendations to the secretary of 
Defense and the director of Central Intelligence on 
any issue with impact upon defense and intelligence 
space programs or other such matters as referred to it 
by either the secretary of Defense or the director of 
Central Intelligence.
     * Provides authority to establish Integrated 
Product Teams as deemed necessary to accomplish 
its functions.
     * Authority via the co-chairs or at the request of 
any member to call meetings, but at least quarterly.

A Milspace Policy Brief
Defining Missile Defense: What missile, which 
defense?

     President Clinton's veto of the fiscal year 1996 
Defense Authorization bill, which the Congress 
failed to override last week, was focused on 
accelerated funding for a National Missile Defense 
(NMD). 
     The White House said that, in addition to being 
unnecessary, NMD was a potential violation to 
START agreements.

**Bill increases funding

     Under the bill, funding for ballistic missile 
defense research, development and testing would 
soar to more than $3 billion, a massive $598.9 
million increase over the Clinton administration's 
requested $2.44 billion. That high- point in missile 
defense history would mark the first time the 
Ballistic Missile Defense Office budget request was 
either fully funded or increased. 
     Of the $3 billion, some $820 million -- a $450 
million increase -- will go for acceleration of NMD 
"at the earliest possible date," in about four to six 
years, the bill said. Clinton objected to this provision.

**Senate boosts SMTS schedule

     While the House increased missile defense 
funding, the Senate poured more funds into missile 
tracking. The Senate Armed Services Committee 
authorized $249 million in FY 1996 monies for the 
Space and Missile Tracking System program, 
formerly Brilliant Eyes. 
     The SMTS is the low-Earth orbit segment of the 
Space-based Infrared Sensor System. The programs 
are part of the NMD. The Senate committee also 
boosted funding for cruise missile programs, and 
called for the establishment of a Cruise Missile 
Defense (CMD) Initiative. 
     The bill called on Defense Secretary William 
Perry to ensure existing air defense systems "are 
upgraded to improve capabilities" against cruise 
missiles. Perry was also directed by the Senate to 
make CMD a priority to support deployment of 
future systems that are effective against advanced 
and stealth cruise missiles. 
     The initiative must lay out a comprehensive plan 
of organizational changes within DoD that could 
strengthen CMD activities. But within the Pentagon, 
the intelligence agencies, and the Washington policy 
establishment, the issue of what type of missile 
threat -- what ballistic missile system with what 
attributes and coming from what geographic threat 
arena -- has come to the forefront of the missile 
defense debate: What missile? Which defense? And 
if the United States faces near-term ICBM threats, is 
the technology available to provide protection?

**Core of the debate

     At the center of the debate are two issues: what is 
the nature of the threat(s) facing the United States, 
and what kind of defensive system could or should, 
if any, be deployed as counter measures? 
     On the issue of the existence or emergence of a 
new strategic threat, two wholly different views are 
held by many who frame the issue. 
     One view holds that the threat of ballistic missiles 
is a real and growing one, with a cast of rogue 
nations racing toward early deployments and 
searching the world's arms markets for the most 
advanced technology available. The other, sees a 
minimal threat from any Third World missile 
deployments, which such a view finds is not the 
most likely delivery system for nuclear weapons in 
any case. And, where such weapons already exist or 
are likely to be developed, this view finds 
development and deployment of a strategic defense 
system facing unsolved technical risk and uncertain 
countermeasures -- and cost.
     To put the issue of missile threats and defenses in 
focus, Military Space here details the work of two 
groups that have exhaustively researched the subject, 
the Missile Defense Study Team of the Heritage 
Foundation and the scientist members of the Union 
of Concerned Scientists. 
     In this part, we will look at the missile threat; in 
part II the types of defenses proposed and how space 
elements are factored in each scenario.

**I. What Missile?

     The Heritage study looked at the existing 
documentation from unclassified and grey-literature 
sources. The team concluded that ballistic missiles 
"represent a major threat to civilian populations and 
military forces." 
     To back up that claim, the team reviewed the 
CIA's 1995 report of its Nonproliferation Center. 
That report stated 20 nations, by conservative 
estimate, currently have or are developing weapons 
of mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery 
systems. 
     Half of these nations, the CIA reported, were in 
the Middle East and South Asia. Five countries, 
North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria, posed the 
greatest danger to the West based on what the agency 
described as "the aggressive nature of their weapons 
programs." 
     All five nations either had ballistic missiles or 
were in the process of developing them.
     This program of missile deployment was 
proceeding so briskly, the Heritage team said, 
through a combination of indigenous technology 
development as well as the purchase of space launch 
vehicles for reportedly civil uses. Much of the 
technology of payload launchers has applications to 
carry weapons such as warhead reentry vehicles. In 
addition, the flight hardware of space boosters and 
ballistic missiles were common to each other. 

**A viable missile threat?

      The Union of Concerned Scientists also looked at 
the emergence of the rogue missile threat. But as 
summarized in a July 7, 1995 letter to the members 
of the Senate, the Union's scientists said that the 
threat of foreign missiles "do not justify deployment 
of national missile defenses." The group said that it 
found no nation currently hostile to the United States 
"possesses ballistic missiles capable of reaching the 
United States." 
     The Union listed four types of potential ballistic 
missile attacks that should be addressed. They 
consisted of accidental launch of Russian or Chinese 
ICBMs, a deliberate nuclear attack by Russia or 
China, deliberate attack by another country or a 
deliberate missile attack by a terrorist organization. In 
all cases, the Union determined a deployed NMD 
system as "not an appropriate or effective response" 
to counter such threats. 
     The Heritage group did not agree. It found the 
evidence of missile development abundant. First, it 
cited the purchase by Saudi Arabia of Chinese CSS-
2 missiles, each with a 2,000- mile range. This was 
proof enough, it claimed, that missile technology 
was proliferating. Next the group cited Iraqi tests of 
ICBM configurations, and the United Nations' belief 
that prior to the Gulf War Iraq was 18-months away 
from having atomic weapons. 
     Most troubling, and contentious, was the issue of 
the viability of the North Korean Taepo Dong 2 
ICBM, the most advanced system being developed 
by a Third World nation.
     Heritage quoted then-Deputy Defense Secretary 
John  Deutch as telling Congress in August 1994 
that the TD2 "may be able to strike U.S. territory by 
the end of the decade." Such a capability, it was 
noted, would come less than five years after its 
discovery by U.S. intelligence.

**Scud or no Scud?

      The Union's scientists were also mindful that 
actual deployment of the TD2 was speculative at 
best, and even under the most optimistic timetable 
would not actually threaten U.S. soil for years. The 
CIA confirmed such estimates last summer. 
     The Defense Intelligence Agency reported last fall 
that the TD2 would have a range only of 4650 miles, 
using a nuclear warhead sized for its lifting power. 
But the DIA also said a smaller yield warhead 
mounted on the missile would extend its range to 
more than 6,000 miles. It was just this modified 
configuration that Arizona Republican Sen. John Kyl 
quoted South Korean intelligence as detecting. 
     The intel sources, Kyl said, have discovered 
North Korea was furiously making technical 
improvements to both missile and warhead designs 
in configurations that could reach all major U.S. 
cities on the west coast plus those of Europe. 
     Others in the U.S. intelligence community 
dismissed both the TD2 and any accelerated 
program. The missile was still "basically a glorified 
Scud," one analyst said, and without a guidance 
system or upper stage can't threaten any specific site. 
     The CIA and the DoD considered the accuracy of 
the TD2 so poor many within the agencies wondered 
what the fuss was about. 
     But other pointed out that if proliferation was as 
prevalent as feared, missile programs like the TD2 
would not stay static. "Even the V-2 became a 
launch vehicle", one industry source told Military 
Space.
     Part II Which Defense? Will compare the types 
of NMD systems under study, along with their 
ground, air and space-based elements, and the risks 
the Union of Concerned Scientists saw associated 
with each.
     Editor's Note: a full document bibliography will 
follow part II for subscribers' files.

Milstar sends first crosslinked message

      Less than six weeks after the second Milstar 
satellite was orbited, the pair of advanced military 
communications satellites were crosslinked to 
transmit a history-making test message from the 
chairman, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
     That successful space exchange ranks as an 
important a space milestone as the first use of an 
orbiting ECHO satellite to transmit greetings to 
Earth by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the 
afternoon of Aug. 13, 1960.

**Satellite-to-satellite crosslinks

      The military space "handshake" took place when 
the written message, signed by Joint Chiefs 
chairman Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, was uplinked 
to Milstar 1 from the National Military Command 
Center, Fort Belvoir, Va., at 10:52 p.m. EST Dec. 
15. 
     Milstar 1's crosslink dish antenna was used to 
process and relay the message signal to Milstar 2 
orbiting in the same plane. Milstar 2 then 
downlinked the message to the U.S. Pacific 
Command, Camp Smith, Hawaii, and to the U.S. 
Atlantic Command, Norfolk, Va. 
     Each Milstar spacecraft incorporates two 
crosslink dish antennas located at opposite ends of 
the rectangular satellite bus. These will eventually be 
used to connect the four operational Milstar satellites 
to form a self-contained, secure space constellation 
that can be controlled from a single fixed- or mobile-
site.

**Unique Milstar technologies

      The Milstar system remains unique to military 
space communications technology. The signals 
processing system operates in the extremely high-
frequency (EHF) and super high -frequency (SHF) 
bands. Technologies in on-board signal processing, 
on-board signal routing, on-board resource control, 
crossbanding and crosslinking are space-born 
capabilities unique in the Milstar series. 
     The satellites are designed to display immunity to 
jamming and signal interception, possible in part by 
the satellite's ability to move transmissions from 
frequency to frequency across the full 2 GHz 
bandwidth.

**Block II satellites planned

      The first in the series was launched Feb. 7, 1994 
with the second orbited Nov. 6, 1995, both aboard 
Titan IV boosters. Air Force launch plans call for full 
operational use of the Block I units now in space, 
with the second satellite completing testing and 
becoming fully operational later this year.
      But in 1999 a Titan IVB is scheduled to launch 
four additional Block II satellites that will feature 
both the low data rate system now on the first 
generation as well as a medium data rate, tactical 
communications payload package. The four Block II 
vehicles will eventually replace the pair of Block Is 
now in service. 
     Each Milstar spacecraft, the largest military 
satellites ever launched, has an on-orbit life of 10 
years.

AIA's Fuqua: Aerospace recovery under way

     Despite falling sales in 1995, the Aerospace 
Industries Assn. sees the industry riding toward 
growth in 1996. 
     If this forecast is correct, it would mark the first 
year of positive numbers for the aerospace industry 
since 1991. "The light we see at the end of the tunnel 
is not an oncoming train," AIA president Don Fuqua 
said last month at the group's annual year-end review 
in Washington. "It is the light of a new dawn for the 
aerospace industry, the herald of an era of stability 
and exceptional promise," he said. 

**1996 sales to rise-but DoD dollars will drop

      AIA anticipates industry sales will rise 3.2% to a 
total $111 billion this year. The jump will come from 
a surge in airline sales, projected to be about $7 
billion. 
     Sales to the DoD will continue to decline, 
however, with a $3 billion drop in 1966. Also sales 
to other federal agencies will drop by $213 million. 
     The turnaround overall will be led by a rise in 
civil aircraft, engines and parts, with a 24% growth 
expected in 1996 to $5.6 billion. 
     Civil helicopter sales will also grow, AIA said, 
some 18% to $268 million. But the biggest increase 
expected in this year will be in space-sector sales, 
with a whopping $1 billion rise, to annual sales 
projected of $28 billion. 
     American space launchers and satellites are 
driving that growth, Fuqua said. 

**Declines continue in military weaponry

      As in years past, cuts in defense acquisitions will 
cause weapons procurements to drop. Missiles sales 
will fall 23% to $5.7 billion, military aircraft will 
drop $1.4 billion to annual sales of $30 billion, and 
overall aerospace/defense employment will decline 
2%, from its 1995 totals, to 763,000 workers. 
     Production workers will number 243,000, a loss 
of 6,000 job. Scientist and engineer slots fell in 1995 
by 6%; technician slots declined by 7%. 
     Overall industry net profit after taxes fell 20% to 
$4.5 billion following a 1994 record high. Despite 
these reductions, Fuqua said aerospace profits are 
expected to surpass the margins generated by all 
manufacturing industries combined.
     Since 1989, total aerospace industry employment 
has dropped a staggering 42%. The pattern of these 
declines was cited by outgoing Lockheed Martin 
CEO Daniel Tellup. He told a Washington press 
briefing, prior to the release of the AIA numbers, he 
expected the decline of the aerospace/defense 
industry to slow in 1996, but a full upswing was still 
waiting in the wings. 
     Tellup, as did Fuqua, said the best areas for 
profits in defenses were in servicing existing 
systems and weapons programs, with tailor-made 
upgrade programs and small, system-by-system 
enhancements. Production of replacement systems 
won't involve major operations. 
     For 1996, the Clinton administration had plans to 
buy no new tanks, only four new warships and only 
127 military aircraft, including helicopters and 
transport planes.
     Military space dollars were concentrated in the 
final phases of large programs like DSCS and Titan 
IV and the beginnings of SBIR, EELV and SMTS. 
     Jointness as a policy element, and widening 
awareness of the need for using space assets fully in 
the battlefield environment, also were strong drivers 
for space in the defense sector -- although not in the 
size of dollar numbers as say military aircraft or 
missiles. 
     But total R&D proposed as a part of the DoD 
new budget authority in fiscal year 1996 shrank to 
14%, dropping more to 11% by 1999. 
     The Congressional Budget Office reports the 
administration remains about $101 billion short of 
the amounts needed for a fully modernized Bottom-
Up Review force, a fact not addressed by either 
Clinton or the Republican Congress. 
     From FYs 1996 through 2002, defense budgets 
projected by both side decline an average of 20% 
from FY 1995 spending.

The Editor's Notebook: Issues and answers in 
defense & space ...
Remembering a warrior's legacy

      When all has been written about the defense 
policies of the late 20th century, what will be the 
issues that will linger to stir America?
     One that will likely remain is the question of a 
Revolution in Military Affairs, and the exact form 
that such an RMA might take. A second is likely to 
be the endless debate over ballistic missile threats, 
defenses, and the costs and timetables for each, real 
or imagined, needed or not. 
     A third issue likely to remain to haunt some 
future defense secretary is the cost of space launch, 
and the many ways to make space transportation 
affordable and accessible to military spacecraft and 
public researchers. 
     If it is true that the resolution of these latter issues 
will shape the security and viability of America's 
industrial base and its future as a great power, then 
history will surely remember the life and legacy of 
Daniel O. Graham, who died New Year's Eve at 70.

**He saw the 'High Frontier'

      Graham will most likely be remembered as the 
founder of High Frontier, the association of 
scientists, scholars and strategists determined to craft 
a comprehensive ballistic missile defense against the 
Soviet Union at the Cold War's climax. 
     In his role as High Frontier's director, Graham 
became a familiar figure in Washington meetings, 
hearings and press conferences, urging American 
policymakers to marshall the technological will to 
banish forever the dread of nuclear attack. 

**The legacy of 'Team B'

      But much less known to the public - and more 
important to history - was the reason behind much of 
Graham's determined support for what became later 
the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
     Some 20 years ago a great debate raged within the 
defense establishment over the strength and purposes 
of Soviet military intentions. To forge what was 
considered by some to be a more realistic picture of 
the Russian bear's embrace, the CIA chartered a team 
of government and industry experts and thinkers to 
see what the USSR might do with military 
superiority. 
     Graham, who was then the director, the Defense 
Intelligence Agency, was a member of that "Team 
B" group. He gathered what he would call later 
"exhaustive" documentation of the depths of the 
unmatched threat from Soviet weapons programs 
flourishing under "detente." He knew then what the 
risks were to an unprotected America, exposed in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s to the threat of Soviet 
missiles.
     Graham's later concept of a "defense that 
defends" was an effort to repel that threat. 
     A quarter century after the Team B report, the fall 
of the Soviet state, the rise of Russian Communism 
and missile proliferation, there is still no consensus 
on how to defend the nation against missile attack. 
And Graham's idea of a space-born shield of 
protection remains, for the time, only on paper.
     So, too, does languish the idea of truly affordable 
space transportation, with more studies than 
spaceships the product of America's labs. Here, too, 
Graham played a key role in defining the issue. In 
1990 he founded the Space Transportation 
Association to push the military and NASA to look 
anew at a bold concept for a single stage launcher, a 
true spaceship. 
     He haunted the halls of the Pentagon and 
Congress, calling for a rational review of America's 
launch capabilities. His work finally paid off in the 
unique Delta Clipper, single-stage prototype vehicle, 
started first by the Strategic Defense Initiative 
Program, and later by NASA, that awarded Graham 
its Distinguished Service Award last year for his 
work on space launch. 
     But the Clipper remains only a test program, and 
the follow-on X rockets mired in budget woes and 
acrimony. Like the issue of strategic defense, 
promising beginnings, made possible in part by 
Graham's advocacy, have not been followed by a 
matching vision of policymakers -- at least not yet.
     But when the moment finally comes, early in the 
21st century, when a single-stage spaceship returns 
to a free port from orbit, it will have been powered, 
in part, by the ideas of that retired Army General 
who would not take "no" for an answer. 
     And there will also come a time when missiles no 
longer threaten American skies. When ballistic 
missiles will have but one purpose: to launch small 
satellites, not warheads. When that age comes to 
America, her children will owe the peace that comes 
with stability to Graham's vision of SDI, an idea for 
which time might finally have come. 
     A stampede to orbit, and quiet in the heavens: 
fitting legacies to Daniel Graham, who gave 
testament to relentless truth. It took, not an admiral 
of the seas or an aviator of the skies but an Army 
General to, not unquietly, find security by sailing 
against the wind. 
     He will be remembered ... and missed.

Milspace Launch Notes

      OSC says that tests of the Pegasus XL/Rex II on 
Feb. 10 will determine the final launch date of this 
return to flight mission. But it won't be earlier than 
Feb. 15, OSC spokeswoman Elania Furhman told 
Military Space.
     The Russian military launched the IRS-1C Dec. 
28 aboard a Cosmos booster. Along with the 
primary payload the Skipper satellite was also 
inserted into orbit. 
     A joint project of the BMD program office and 
the Moscow Aviation Institute, Skipper will simulate 
ICBM reentry vehicles and will test aerobraking 
technology. 
     The payload's instrumentation was built by Utah 
State University's Space Dynamics Lab. It will be 
deorbited over Kwajalein Island in about a week.
     A Delta booster lifted the NASA-Goddard XTE 
science satellite into orbit December 30 from Cape 
Canaveral, Fla. 
***
     The Navy reported that it has completed testing 
the UHF F6 satellite and has moved it to its 
permanent orbital slot at 105.3 degrees WL. 
According to Harvard scientist Jonathan McDowell, 
who compiled the data, the original test location was 
at 171W.

Mission Control

      Rescissions are rippling across the full range of 
military space and related programs as the fiscal year 
1996 budget battle continues into mid-January ... In 
retaliation for an additional $7 billion in unrequested 
spending contained both in the earlier-signed FY 
1996 Defense Appropriations Bill and the vetoed FY 
1996 Defense Authorization Bill, Defense Secretary 
Perry has ordered cuts of nearly $2 billion to 
approved programs as partial offsets.      Some 
rescission cuts have already been imposed on such 
projects as military satellites (SBIR, SMTS and 
Milstar), launchers (Titan IV), and weapons (ASAT 
studies and other BMD work). 
     Although not significant reductions, the 
rescissions will, nonetheless, play havoc with 
program schedules planned for the New Year.
***
     Remembering a legend ... In the aftermath of the 
passing of Adm. Arleigh Burke, many in 
Washington remember the "sailor's sailor" as a 
major, driving force behind the Navy's Polaris 
missile program -- but in a measured way typical of 
the crafty old salt. 
     Burke supported Polaris, but remained 
determined that the Navy never become totally 
dependent on sub-launched missiles. His Naval 
Warfare Analysis Group also moved to use Polaris 
to put the Navy at the heart of strategic issues, a 
firefight at the time with the Air Force. 
     He was adroit at using his political power 
carefully, cementing a "place in the strategic sun," as 
one author described him, for the newly nuclear 
Navy.

INSPECTOR GENERAL FINDS FAULT WITH PATRIOT PROGRAM


Although the Army effectively managed the $7.3 billion Patriot Advanced
Capability (PAC) 3 program its acquisition strategy is risky, its chemical and
biological survivability questionable, its future reliability unknown, its
future reliability testing program non-existent, its inventory plan wastes
money and its contract management resources are underused, said a
just-released Pentagon report.

The Department of Defense Inspector General audit report "The Patriot Advanced
Capability-3 Program" (dated Nov.  4 but just released) recommended adding
development test report dates and revising PAC-3 program exit criteria
supporting low- and full-rate production decisions.  Also recommended was
establishing adequate chemical and biological survivability, improving the
reliability test program, using more efficient spares and replenishment
concepts and using contractor Raytheon Co.  resources more smartly.

The Army concurred with almost all the audit findings.  But the service did
not agree to add additional development test reporting dates saying reporting
requirements were adequate.  And the Army requested the Pentagon direct test
and evaluation master plan revision recommendations to the Army Materiel
Systems Analysis Activity.

A June 28 letter from Michael Hartwell, deputy director of the Missile
Command's Integrated Materiel Management Center Air Defense Directorate,
included in the report takes issue with the finding that the inventory plan
wastes money.  At issue are so-called "just-in-time" and "direct vendor
delivery" strategies.  The former refers to delivering parts as needed and not
storing them, and the latter to sending parts right to the user and not to a
warehouse.

"Once a system has been deployed and the sustainment concepts initiated for
several years [like Patriot]...it requires a major overhaul of all facets of
the support structure" to use the two strategies, said the letter.

In addition, Patriot parts are such that they require intense management
attention, making it unfeasible to store them at the contractor, said the
note.  "In fact, the prime contractor [Raytheon] is currently requesting the
removal of all GFM [government-furnished material] that is...stored at the
facility."

George Schneiter, undersecretary of defense for strategic and tactical
systems, disagreed with the audit recommendation that PAC-3 s so-called "exit
criteria" needed to move into production require that components meet
reliability levels established in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD).
He said that action was not necessary.

"What must be demonstrated for such decision points is that the program is on
track or at the proper point on its reliability growth curve to achieve ORD
standards" by the time of deployment, he wrote.

The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization agreed with all the conclusions and
recommendations.

The audit s purpose was to determine if PAC-3 management is cost-effective and
sufficient to lead to a low-rate initial production decision in early fiscal
1998 at an estimated cost of $252.4 million.

The report listed a number of management actions or plans to respond to the
recommendations.  For the low-rate initial production strategy risk, the
Pentagon issued a Program Budget Decision (No.  224) last February which
deferred deployment until the first quarter of fiscal 1999.

In addition, the Army instituted a risk-reduction program ("final scope and
level of effort will depend on contractor response to non-to-exceed package")
and inserted extra time between flight test for analyses and potential fixes.

For the chemical and biological survivability issue, the Patriot office took
several steps.  First, it established and applied exit criteria involving
chemical and biological survivability in the critical design review process;
and second, established a five-step general approach to address chemical and
biological survivability issues.  The steps included:

o defining quantitative and measurable chemical and biological survivability
hardness requirements in the Operational Requirements Document in compliance
with Army policy;

o completing a system survivability assessment and report to determine the
current status of the Patriot s vulnerability;

o performing trade-off analysis and studies to determine what survivability
enhancements that can becan be cost-effectively achieved;

o briefing the Nuclear and Chemical Survivability Committee Secretariat on
system assessment and trade-off analysis results; and,

o incorporating chemical and biological survivability into the Patriot system
in the most cost-effective manner.

On the issue of better use of contractor resources, on Oct.  26, 1995, the
Patriot office established a Memorandum of Agreement with Loral Corp.  (now
part of Lockheed Martin Corp.)  to provide program manager real-time
assessment through participation in Integrated Product Teams, participate in
planning, executing and following risk reduction plans to determine missile
production readiness; and, strengthen engineering, surveillance and contract
compliance activities.

SBIRS CONTRACT AWARDED TO LOCKHEED MARTIN


The Air Force has awarded a $1.8 billion contract to a Lockheed Martin
Corp.-led team to build the potential $17 billion Space Based Infrared System
early warning satellite follow-on to the Defense Support Program.

The team, including Northrop Grumman Corp., Honeywell and Aerojet beat a
Hughes Aircraft Co.-TRW Inc.  team.

The contract is for the SBIRS so-called "high element."  The "low element" or
Space and Missile Tracking System used to be the Pentagon s Brilliant Eyes
program.

NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SOLICITATION HITS STREETS MONDAY


The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) has formally said the final
Request for Proposal for the National Missile Defense Lead Systems Integrator
contract should be released Nov.  25, 10 days later than originally intended.
No explanation for the delay was offered.

Bidders expected on the contract include a Lockheed Martin Corp.-TRW
Inc.-Raytheon Co.  team.  Also expected to bid are McDonnell Douglas Corp.
and Boeing Corp.  It is not clear if Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV)
contractors Rockwell International Corp.  and Hughes Aircraft Co.  will be
allowed to bid as prime contractors, said industry sources.

The missile defense office said it is negotiating with the two firms to obtain
their EKV design and performance information.  The contracting office promised
that at least non-proprietary data will be provided to the bidders.  "No
proprietary information will be made available prior to the award of the CD
[concept definition] Phase contracts," said the contracting office in its list
of questions and answers to industry.  The process for post-award handling of
proprietary information is under consideration.

And regarding whether the two EKV designs are the only options for the weapon,
BMDO said proposed configurations can include any kill vehicle option that
meets system requirements and can be developed and deployed with "acceptable
risk and cost.  The only requirement that is specific to EKV is to recommend
an approach to the down select or continuation of the current competitive
efforts," said the contracting document.

Contractors which sent representatives to a Sept.  19 Lead Systems Integrator
briefing include GTE Government Systems, Aerojet, Litton Data Systems, Alliant
TechSystems Inc., Coleman Research Corp.  and Teledyne Brown Engineering.

Regarding Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty-compliance issues, the government will
provide contractors a standard set of architectures and schedules.  "These
architectures will reflect a common set of treaty considerations so the CD
contractor will not need to independently determine treaty compliance," said
BMDO.

The missile defense office also released a list of objectives and criteria for
the fiscal 1999 system test.  They include:
     o  Demonstrate end-to-end integrated system performance. 
     o  Demonstrate end-to-end target detection, acquisition, tracking, 
correlation and handover performance.
     o  Demonstrate real-time discrimination performance.
     o  Demonstrate NMD system kill assessment capability;
     o  Demonstrate the ability of the NMD system to develop and coordinate

ARMY MOVING ON TACTICAL LASER FORCE PROTECTION


The Army Early Entry Lethality and Survivability Battle Lab (EELS) is studying
the utility of high energy ground-based lasers to protect forces from airborne
threats like ballistic and cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft, mortars and
artillery rounds, according to Army sources.  The weapon to be applied to the
mission is the $100 million Tactical High Energy Laser being developed at the
Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (SSDC).

EELS is specifically interested in survivability and situational awareness to
protect forces at the point when troops first enter a battlefield area.  That
means the system must be tactically deployable (a trailer towed by a Humvee),
be highly reliable, need little sustainment and be able to operate in an
austere environment with no depot or logistics readily available.

To this end EELS is performing a small-scale study to create a data base that
next year can be plugged into EELS battlefield simulation system.  Last July
TRW Inc.  won an $89 million contract to develop and field the system in
conjunction with Israeli firms Rafael, Israel Aircraft Industries and Tadiran.
U.S.  subcontractors include McDonnell Douglas Corp.  and W.J.  Schaefer
Associates.  The system is to be completed next November.

According to the Army SSDC, THEL will be able to rapidly fire for close-in
engagements and cost "only a few thousand dollars per kill or less with a deep
magazine to counter saturation attacks."

The price tag is an important consideration, given that THEL is a chemical
laser powered by deuterium fluoride.  Deuterium is extremely expensive,
costing about $1 per gas liter.  The Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser
(MIRACL) upon which THEL is based used 6,000 liters a second for two to three
second bursts, said a knowledgeable industry source.  Safety is also an issue
because fluoride is a deadly gas.

A high energy laser against short-range rockets was tested and demonstrated in
the "Nautilus" program, an outgrowth of Project Strong Safety, in
collaboration with Israel.  The program was conducted primarily at SSDC s High
Energy Laser Systems Test Facility at White Sands Missile Range, N.M., and
utilized a fraction of the MIRACL s megawatt power to emulate the THEL weapon
concept performance, according to SSDC.  The program successfully destroyed a
short range rocket in flight on Feb.  9, 1996.

The Army Air Defense Artillery School in Fort Bliss, Texas, has been
designated as the THEL proponent by the Training and Doctrine Command and
plans to develop a mission need statement and operational concept that could
lead to an operational requirement.

MISSILE DIGEST tm


o Air Force Wright Laboratory is interested in receiving proposals for
countermeasures for missile infrared seekers.  The purpose of this Imaging
Seeker Countermeasure program is to address both surface-to-air and air-to-air
imaging seeker threats and define and develop innovative countermeasure (CM)
solutions, methods and techniques to defeat them.  Existing CM techniques have
been optimized against reticle scan missile seekers.  New systems will need to
address current and advanced (imaging) missile threats.  A Program Research
and Development Announcement (PRDA) is being used for this solicitation to
encourage new and innovative concepts for both near-term and far-term
applications.

This program consists of three technical efforts to accomplish this goal.
They include Imaging Threat Investigations (ITIV), Imaging Sensor
Countermeasure Follow-On (ISCF) and the Imaging Countermeasures Concept
Development (ICCD) program.  Alternative approaches will also be considered.
The objective of the ITIV effort is to determine possible imaging threat
seeker configurations and key technologies.

Of particular interest are surface-to-air and air-to-air configurations which
shall be directed against aircraft.  This effort shall investigate components,
subsystems and technologies used in imaging seeker development.  This program
shall begin with a survey of key technologies and existing data describing
system functions of potential imaging threats.  This shall include optics,
sensors, processors and architectures, as well as, image processing techniques
and tracking algorithms.  During this investigation, the offeror shall combine
R&D with available intelligence information to predict one or more imaging
seeker configurations.  This effort shall postulate hardware configurations,
and define and create software flowcharts and/or block diagrams for each
imaging seeker threat defined.  Components shall be identified along with
equations, transfer functions, or any other necessary information to model the
threat system and subsystems.

The objective of the ISCF effort is to evaluate the performance of signature
management based countermeasures (CM) against imaging seekers through field
testing.  This program shall continue the development of candidate
technologies and techniques for imaging sensor countermeasures.  The need
exists to explore concepts which are robust against an expected difficult
threat.  This effort shall take advantage of, and then advance the results of
contract No.  F33615-93-C-1224 (Imaging Sensors CM (ISCM) Program) which
performed countermeasure and signature analysis against imaging sensors.
Information on the ISCM is available from a classified annex.  The ISCM Final
Report shall be made available to the contractor after contract award.  This
new ISCF effort shall concentrate on testing the CM concepts in the field.  A
determination shall be made if signature management based CM concepts are a
viable means to defeat imaging sensors.

The approach for this effort is to first review the Final Report and auxiliary
data from the ISCM program, then evaluate the progress that was made.  Next,
explore new and past paint and coatings technology and its application to
countermeasure concepts.  This technology may be either new or resulting from
the ISCM contract.  This effort shall also update the CM concept priority list
developed on the ISCM program.  Field testing is expected to make use of radio
controlled models and appropriate sensor devices to evaluate performance.  It
is important that lessons learned from the first program combine with the
contractors expertise to define and execute a field test that adequately
evaluates CM concept performance.  The contractor shall develop a methodology
(test plan) that tests the concepts to clearly determine if the CM techniques
merit transition to full scale.

Some critical areas to be considered are the problems associated with field
testing and the unique problems of scaled testing.  Unique, imaginative use of
available scale model technology and resources are encouraged.  Concepts
tested shall not enhance current seeker performance, but may allow improved
conventional CM performance against imaging seekers.  This effort shall
implement these Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM) concepts (from both the
previous ISCM and this contract) by obtaining the material, coatings, etc.,
that exhibit the desired effects, and test for effectiveness.

Effects may have to be simulated where technology is unavailable or too
expensive for this effort.  If possible, this effort shall take advantage of
other programs or contractors own IR&D to supply technology.  If information
is available in a timely manner, this effort may take advantage of findings
from the ITIV effort to help predict potential vulnerabilities of imaging
seekers and use the predicted threat configurations for the advanced sensors
required during field testing.  An Associate Contractor Agreement may be
required to coordinate the ITIV with this effort.  The first effort (ISCM)
used one scale model, tested at one geographical location, using limited
flight profiles, and did not attempt cooperative concepts.  The goal of this
effort is to demonstrate the performance of the best concepts under a wider
range of environmental conditions, more small-scale aircraft, additional
scenarios and combinations with traditional CM s, if possible.

Testing should include flightworthy (full scale) materials when possible and
shall use advanced sensor platforms which allow determination of effectiveness
and robustness.  The test results will be analyzed in order to determine if
integration of the ideas and concepts into an aircraft countermeasure system
is possible.

The objective of the ICCD effort is to develop innovative CM solutions,
implementation techniques, and methods to defeat the anti-aircraft imaging
seeker threats.  This program shall research and evaluate past and existing
imaging seeker CM work to focus on solutions to defeat the threat.  As it
becomes available, this effort shall utilize any findings from the parallel
ITIV effort described above.  From this review and the contractors own
expertise, the contractor shall theorize a potential set of CM solutions and
outline methods to implement them.  Potential countermeasures should consider
the overall systems approach as well as address operational issues.

The results shall be tested using a missile simulation (and environment) to
rank and evaluate the countermeasure effectiveness.  The environment used for
testing shall include missile models that includes all necessary components,
preferably industry recognized.  Selection and use of a model shall be
discussed at the design review prior to testing.  It shall be a goal of this
effort to breadboard at least one concept and demonstrate performance.

The total length of the technical effort is estimated to be 24 months for the
ITIV and 30 months each for the ISCF and ICCD.  An additional 5 months shall
be added to the technical period of performance to provide for processing and
completion of the final report.

The expected award date is May 1, 1997.  The Government funding is expected to
be $1,475,000, allocated as follows:  a total of $350,000 for ITIV including
$35,000 (fiscal 1997) $200,000 in 1998 and $115,000 in 1999; a total of
$525,000 for ISCF including $100,000 in fiscal 1997, $250,000 in 1998 and
$175,000 in 1999; and a total of $600K for ICCD including $20,000 in fiscal
1997, $300,000 in 1998 and $280,000 in 1999.

Aegis ships head for Hawaiian CEC experiments

     NORFOLK, Va. -- Aegis guided missile cruisers 
Cape St. George (CG 71) and Anzio (CG 68) are 
underway for Hawaii and the Mountain Top 
experiment that will take place at the end of this 
month.
     Rear Adm. Daniel J. Murphy Jr., commander, 
Eisenhower Battle Group, and commander, Cruiser-
Destroyer Group 8, said the experiment was but a 
gleam in the eye of Vice Chairman, the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff Adm. William Owens three years ago.
     The Mountain Top experiment will demonstrate 
the "forward pass" concept, which will use elevated 
sensors and illuminators, set up on a Hawaiian cliff, 
to pass information via the Cooperative Engagement 
Capability (CEC). 
     Hopefully, this will allow an Aegis cruiser to 
launch a Standard Missile toward a low-flying threat 
the ship's sensors can't see, because it is over the 
ship's horizon. The threat will be illuminated from 
the cliff, and the cliff-based sensor will provide a 
guidance update for the ship's missile, to score an 
intercept.  
     CEC is the Navy's program that combines all the 
combat systems and major sensors on ships into a 
single networked battle force system. It is an 
automatic, jam-resistant network, which takes radar 
measurement information from all ships, blending it 
into a composite picture. The same information -- a 
common air picture -- is available on each CEC-
equipped ship.
     Murphy said Patriot and Hawk systems, two 
CEC cruisers, a cruiser without CEC, an E2-C 
aircraft and an Air Force Airborne Warning and 
Control System aircraft will participate in the 
experiment. 
     The test will also look at discriminating through 
the clutter and backscatter radars experience near 
shore, and how to deal with more simultaneous 
threats. 
     Initial operational capability for CEC is 
anticipated in July. After a rigorous 18 months of 
demonstrations and at-sea tests, which include what 
Murphy called, "getting a glimpse of what it [CEC] 
will offer when it is integrated with other systems ...."
     Murphy said "the vision is that the [NATO 
common communications] Link 16 will become the 
universal command and control network, where 
force orders will be sent [and] data exchanged. But 
like any other system, it's only as good as the 
information being put into it."
     CEC, as the principal underpinning of Link 16, 
would standardize all of the information that rides on 
it as the common data link of the future.
     The Air Force is anxious to participate in CEC, 
and is looking at the AWACS platform in particular. 
The Army is still studying what CEC could add to 
its capabilities.
     Murphy said while there's still skepticism about 
CEC, he's "absolutely convinced that 10 years from 
now, there will be no naysayers." 
     CEC buys time, Murphy said, with the 
opportunity to make the right decision. It also 
expands the protected battlespace, and protection is 
essential to project power, he added. "Broadly, CEC 
will ultimately help revolutionize the way all joint 
forces are structured."
     By mid-January, Murphy will be in his new job, 
N86, director, Surface Warfare Div., at the Pentagon.
     While nothing is set in stone as yet, Murphy told 
Navy News he has some ideas about what he wants 
to accomplish in the new job:
     * Emphasize improvements to the warfighting 
architecture to maximize the capabilities of existing 
weapons systems through improved combat 
identification capability.
     * Through technology, including electronic 
controls, move the surface Navy closer to what is 
done in the commercial world -- to trust computers 
to do what people do today. 
     For instance, he said, today ships can have as 
many as 15 people on the bridge when entering port. 
"We have not integrated sensors with alarms and 
controls. My vision is to get to a pilot, copilot 
concept in a ship, like a plane. We've not yet made 
the jump commercial aviation made 40 years ago."

Carderock's minisub race won by Tennessee team

     To take advantage of the holiday season, an 
illustrious group of college students met at the 
Carderock Naval  Surface Warfare Center, Bethesda, 
Md., Dec. 27-30, jumped in the David Taylor model 
basin and raced against the clock -- in muscle-
powered mini submarines. 
     Thirteen teams participated in the race, sponsored 
by the Foundation for Underwater Research and 
Education, the fourth of the biannual events held 
since 1989. This year's meeting was the first under 
the controlled conditions of a basin. 
     The first three races were held in the ocean off the 
coast of Florida. But for the designers, eliminating 
unpredictable side effects such as ocean currents and 
weather makes it easier to concentrate on the main 
job: creating a fast man-powered minisub.
     There was a mind-boggling amount of high-tech 
designed into submarines built by small community 
colleges and even high schools students. Most 
contestants used advanced composite materials, and 
one entry even had an onboard computer to adjust 
the propeller blades to speed and water drag. This 
boat, the OMER from the Ecole de Technologie 
Superieure, Montreal, Canada, won the innovation 
category, but it could not challenge Tennessee 
Technological University's Torpedo III, which 
reached 5.36 knots. 
     Water-lubricated bearings, highly efficient 
transmissions (most often in the style of bicycle 
pedals) and sophisticated shapes to reduce drag are 
standard. So are highly trained athletes who "bike" 
the boats to stunning speeds along the 3,200 foot-
long basin. 
     One boat, the Mermaid of the Annapolis Human-
Powered Submarine Club, composed of engineers at 
the Annapolis facility of the Naval Surface Warfare 
Center, even had to face enemy fire. 
     A metal structure as tall as the boat itself fell on 
the Mermaid before the crew could put it into the 
water for even a single run. The tail fin shattered, but 
it was replaced to log a good run time. Maybe for 
this proof of survivability and maintainability, the 
jury awarded the Mermaid the first prize for the best 
use of composites. 

**The Navy seeks talent

     Carderock's spokesman Tom Warring said the 
numerous inventions had been made coincidentally, 
and the Navy had engineers at the race to look at the 
13 entries from the United States, Canada and 
Mexico. 
     But, as Joel Spencer, the head of the Cape Fear 
Community College, Wilmington, N.C., said, these 
raceboats involve different aspects of submarine 
design than the Navy may want to explore. Noise, 
for example, the quintessential measure of a warship, 
is no factor at all for the race boats. Cape Fear won 
the overall design category.
     But Warring said the Navy was currently doing 
work on manpowered Seal delivery vehicles, and 
there is a chance something new could emerge from 
the studies of the 13 teams.
     John Hussey, one of the volunteers who 
organized the event, said the real advantage for the 
Navy is to get a pool of talented young people, who 
are thinking of making naval engineering a career, 
and show them there is interest in their ideas. 
     "The goal is to form a relationship between bright 
young minds and those who want to tap into those 
minds in the future," Hussey said. 
     Hussey said he knew of the head of the first 
winning team, in 1989, who went on to a remarkable 
career in the Navy. 
     And then there is the public relations coup the 
Navy got as a mentor during the slow news days of 
the Christmas season. 
     The four major Washington local television 
stations had reports on the event, and the Associated 
Press and the New York Times help spread the 
word.
     For information on the sub race series, call Nancy 
Hussey at 410-326-6896.

DoD reduces impact of 'rule of two' decision

     The DoD has proposed expanding contracting 
opportunities for small disadvantaged businesses 
(SDBs) after it suspended the SDB set-aside 
program. 
     In October the DoD suspended its "rule of two" 
set-aside program for SDBs, as part of the 
government's on-going review of all federal race-
based programs. DoD acted in response to the 
Supreme Court's June decision in Adarand v. Pena 
(NN, 10/30/95).
     Proposed new DoD contracting procedures 
include: 
     * expanding the mandatory use of the 10% price 
preference for SDBs to include competitive awards 
based on other than price or price related factors; 
     * considering small, small disadvantaged and 
women-owned small business subcontracting as a 
factor in the evaluation of past performance;
     * requiring prime contractors to notify the 
contracting officer of any substitutions of firms that 
are not small, small disadvantaged or women-owned 
small businesses for the firms listed in the 
subcontracting plan; and 
     * establishing a test program of an SDB 
evaluation preference that would remove bond cost 
differentials between SDBs and other businesses as a 
factor in most source selections for construction 
acquisitions.
     The DoD said the new proposals will 
significantly enhance the opportunities for SDBs to 
participate as key elements of the defense industrial 
base.
     The Justice Dept. continues to coordinate efforts 
to review programs to ensure they are in compliance
with Adarand and the president's July policy 
directive.       Also Justice is continuing efforts to 
reform federal government procurement to meet 
these standards while ensuring that "individuals 
traditionally excluded from business
opportunities have a chance to compete meaningfully 
for government contracts," the DoD said.

Pentagon plans TUAV solicitation this month 

     A full and open competition for the Tactical 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for shipboard and field 
use is expected this month, the DoD reports.
     Paul Kaminski, DoD's undersecretary for 
Acquisition and Technology, directed an Advanced 
Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) 
acquisition approach for the vehicle.  
     Kaminski made his decision last month after 
digesting final staff recommendations for satisfying 
the tactical need for reconnaissance, surveillance and 
targeting at sea or on land. 
     He agreed with the recommendation to procure 
six TUAV systems, each consisting of four air 
vehicles and sensors, plus eight attrition vehicles. 
     The TUAV performance and cost requirements 
were outlined by the Joint Requirements Oversight 
Council (JROC), Dec. 15, in JROC Memorandum 
150-95. 
     The DoD has designated the Joint Program 
Office for UAVs, within the Program Executive 
Office for Cruise Missiles and UAVs, as the lead for 
the TUAV acquisition.
     Contracting support will be provided by Naval 
Air Systems Command.

**Hauls mixed payload

     The air vehicle will have the capacity to carry a 
variety of payloads, including electro-optical and 
infrared imagery sensors, and, if practical, a synthetic 
aperture radar. 
     The vehicle will have a minimum of three hours 
on station at up to 200 kilometers for field and 
shipboard use.  The TUAV requirements also 
include electromagnetic interference shielding and 
anti-corrosion features.  
     If offerors do not provide automatic takeoff and 
landing and a heavy fuel engine, or HFE, as part of 
the basic system, options for development and 
integration of those capabilities into the TUAV will 
be requested by the government, the DoD said. 
     Development of a common ground reception, 
processing, and control system, providing for or 
leading to compatibility with other UAVs, collection 
systems, and command, control, communications, 
computers, intelligence, surveillance and 
reconnaissance systems, is also a program 
requirement.  
     Another UAV system, the Hunter has been 
blasted by some admirals and the General 
Accounting Office. They agree the Hunter does not 
satisfy shipboard and naval operational requirements 
(NN, 12/11/95).

GAO: Navy clipped AF's wings through faulty stats

     The Navy used statistics at its own pleasure and 
advantage when it cut the Air Force out of an F-18 
maintenance deal, the General Accounting Office 
says.
     In an effort to minimize maintenance costs for its 
F-18 fleet, the Navy subjected the depot work to a 
competition. Four contenders emerged; two private 
firms, the Ogden (Utah) Air Logistics Center and the 
Naval Aviation Depot, North Island, San Diego. 
     In a first competition, Ogden won on cost and 
began to perform the Modification, Corrosion and 
Paint Program (MCAPP) in 1993, the year of the 
competition. But the Navy immediately informed the 
Air Force the sea service intended to maintain a core 
capability in-house, and Ogden would only get the 
minimum number of aircraft specified in the 
competition documents. 
     Core capability requirements are a common 
argument in the privatization debate between the 
Defense Dept. and private contractors. The issues 
involve the availability of private workers in war 
areas and their reliability due to labor conflicts that 
cannot rock the military. Such arguments seemed not 
to play a role in interservice competition.
     Core capability generally goes beyond service 
requirements. "However," GAO admits, "in practice 
it appears each service will be allowed to define a 
core capability requirement for its own essential 
systems and equipment ... ."
     In September 1994, a year after the initial 
competition, the Navy determined in a bid for 
additional work that North Station could perform the 
MCAPP faster and cheaper than Ogden. Thus the 
Navy decided not to exercise an option for an 
additional year of work at Ogden, and consolidated 
the work in California.
     Consolidation, the GAO says, is more cost-
effective than splitting the work between two 
contractors. But , if the Navy knew it wanted an in-
house capability and could therefore not consolidate 
at any other place, why launch  a competition in the 
first place?
     According to the Navy, quality of work was 
comparable at Navy and Air Force depots. The 
reason for the award to North Station was the faster 
turn-around time. If an aircraft takes less time in the 
maintenance pipeline, fewer planes are needed to 
meet the readiness requirements.
     But the Air Force contends that the delays 
experienced in the period used by the Navy to make 
its decision were caused by the Navy itself. Late 
funding delayed start-up and replacement parts 
(which under the contract the Navy was to provide) 
arrived behind schedule. Additionally approval of 
work wasn't on time.

**The ghost of the A-12 lawsuit

     Such Navy activity is reminiscent of why a 
federal judge ruled last year that the Navy had to 
reimburse contractors for the terminated A-12 
bomber development contract (NN, 12/25/95).
     The Navy, the GAO furthermore concludes, 
compared apples and oranges when it used data for 
ground-based F-18 and compared them to carrier-
based ones, and looked at different stages on the 
learning curve in comparing cost at North Station 
and Ogden. Accounting for these methodological 
flaws, Ogden would have come out the slightly 
cheaper place for the MCAPP, the GAO says.

**DoD guidance required

     The GAO conclusion can be read as an absolution 
of the Navy as well as an indictment. "We 
recommend that the secretary of Defense develop 
and implement guidance on using merit-based 
selection procedures when moving depot workload," 
the GAO says, thus putting the onus of change on 
the secretary.
     On the other hand, in an era where "fewer 
regulation" has become the dominant buzzword, 
requesting more DoD regulations also implies that 
the Navy is not capable of finding reasonable and 
cost-saving ways to handle its maintenance work, the 
GAO adds.
     The F-18 maintenance work continues today at 
North Station.
     Fax 301-258-4066 for the GAO report: "Depot 
Maintenance: The Navy's Decision to Stop F/A-18 
Repairs at Ogden Air Logistics Center" (NSIAD 96-
31).

Marines buy latest addition to LAV family

      The Marine Corps has bought the newest variant 
of their Light Armored Vehicles (LAV), an air 
defense version of an established family of armored 
vehicles.
     The Corps ordered 17 of the vehicles designed to 
defend against air attacks, but also capable of fighting 
ground threats. The cost is $70 million, including the 
operational support tab. 
     The LAV-AD (for air defense) features eight 
Stinger missiles distributed over two launch sets and 
a 25 mm gun.

**System has added fire power

      Including the eight extra missiles stored onboard 
and the large amount of ammunition for the gun 
(385 rounds in the gun magazine plus 605 extra), the 
vehicle has enough firepower for 44 engagements, 
its manufacturer Lockheed Martin says. 
     The Navy's "Forward ... From the Sea" strategy 
calls for rapid deployment and sustainment of 
ground forces from the sea. The LAV family meets 
these requirements, the Marines contend. 
     The craft features self-protection technology 
against  nuclear, biological and chemical attack and 
laser-protected windows. Its data links allow instant 
communication with other units or other services 
through satellite hook-ups. 
     For rapid deployment, the 29,000-pound vehicle 
can be airlifted by C-130 transports or CH-53 
helicopters. Tests, which began in 1991, show its 
good surface mobility and the ability to fire on the 
move. 
     Since the beginning of the test and evaluation 
phase, 54,000 rounds of ammunition and 26 live 
Stingers have been fired, and tests in extreme heat 
and cold conducted, Ron Gagne, a Lockheed Martin 
executive in the Burlington, Vt., facility told Navy 
News. 
     The order of 17 represents four groups of four, 
plus an extra vehicle. Gagne said the initial 
requirement was higher, but the changes in force 
structure impacted the Marine Corps LAV fleet.

Northrop Grumman grows via Westinghouse

     Defense giant Northrop Grumman bought 
Westinghouse's Defense Electronics Div. offered for 
sale last year.
     Northrop Grumman, itself created through a 
merger in May 1994, managed to obtain sufficient 
credit from different banks to close the $3 billion 
deal, the Los Angeles-based company announced 
Jan. 3.
     Northrop Grumman is involved in fighter and 
surveillance aircraft, electronics and systems 
integration, precision weapon systems and 
information technology.
     Westinghouse has a strong naval business, 
making radars, surveillance technology, anti-
submarine gear, torpedoes and anti-torpedo systems 
and other electronics for underwater applications. 
     One major naval program will stay with 
Westinghouse for the time being: the submarine 
auxiliary propulsion, developed and produced in the 
Pittsburgh Science and Technology Center. A part of 
the center is moving to NG, but the sub engines are 
not, an official said. 
     The new company's sales could top $10 billion by 
the end of the decade, said NG's CEO Kent Kresa. 
Northrop Grumman's sales in 1995 reached $6.8 
billion; Westinghouse's $2.6 billion.
     Northrop Grumman was not a top pick when 
analysts and defense experts put their heads together 
after the announcement that Westinghouse would go 
on the block. 
     Despite synergies in the electronics between 
Westinghouse's and NG's business, the acquisition 
broadens NG's business. Particularly in the 
underwater area, Westinghouse will add 
considerably to NG's current product line. That is a 
deviation from the industry trend to consolidate 
around a narrowly defined core business and drop 
other areas.
     Some expect that Northrop Grumman will soon 
look for buyers of these areas outside its own core 
business. 
     By contrast, NG raised bank commitments of 
$4.8 billion, in excess of the purchase price and the 
financial commitments the buyer assumed for 
employee benefits. These are estimated at $600 
million. 
     In addition, Kresa noted NG had succeeded in 
reducing its overall debt by $200 million more than 
expected in 1995, to $1.6 billion.
     All the financial data indicate NG may as well try 
to break out of the trend and enlarge its defense 
business base.

No-nuke zone worries Navy

     The Assn. of South-East Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) and the observer states of Cambodia, 
Myanmar and Burma decided last year to declare 
their territorial waters nuclear weapon- free. 
     The Navy fears that will limit its ability to pass 
through the area with nuclear weapons onboard 
surface ships and submarines.
     ASEAN includes Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and 
Brunei. 
     The territorial waters of Indonesia and the 
Philippines block the entire Pacific between the 
Asian and the Australian continent. 
     Indonesia alone would stretch from Seattle to the 
Bahamas, if superimposed over the map of the 
United States.
