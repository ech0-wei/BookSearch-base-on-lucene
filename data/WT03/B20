<IMG SRC = "iucctiny.gif" ><P>
<H1>How policy-makers<BR>
are responding<BR>
to global climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The first time climate change was recognized as a serious problem by a major 
intergovernmental meeting was in 1979.</B> <A HREF = 
"fs213.html">The First World Climate Conference</A>, held in 
February of that year, was an important scientific event. It issued a declaration calling on 
the world's governments "to foresee and prevent potential man-made changes in climate 
that might be adverse to the well-being of humanity."<P>
<B>A large number of international conferences on climate change have been 
convened since then.</B> Attended by government policy-makers, scientists, and 
environmental groups, they have addressed both scientific and policy issues. Important 
meetings have been held in <A HREF = 
"fs215.html">Toronto</A>, <A HREF = 
"fs217.html">the Hague</A>, <A HREF = 
"fs218.html">Noordwijk</A>, <A HREF = 
"fs220.html">Bergen</A>, and elsewhere.  <A HREF = 
"fs221.html">The Second World Climate Conference</A>, held 
in 1990 in Geneva, was a particularly crucial step towards a binding global convention on 
climate change. Some of these meetings have taken place under the auspices of the United 
Nations and its specialized agencies. Others have been held within regional and global fora 
such as the European Community, the Commonwealth, and the South Pacific Forum, or 
have been convened by individual governments. A number of meetings have been 
dedicated to <A HREF = "fs203.html">the particular concerns 
of small island states</A> and of <A HREF = 
"fs204.html">developing countries</A>.<P>
<B>The <A HREF = "fs250.html">1992 UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change</A> is the first binding international legal 
instrument to address the issue specifically</B>.1 Adopted after 15 months of intensive 
negotiations within the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework 
Convention on  Climate Change (INC/FCCC - see fact sheet 209), it was opened for 
signature in Rio de Janeiro at the June 1992 <A HREF = 
"fs207.html">UN Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED)</A>. The INC negotiators drew on the First Assessment Report of the <A 
HREF = "fs208.html">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC)</A>, a body established jointly by the <A HREF = 
"fs206.html">United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP)</A> and the <A HREF = "fs206.html">World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO)</A>. They were also influenced by the Ministerial 
Declaration issued by the Second World Climate Conference and by policy statements 
adopted by numerous other climate conferences. The Convention incorporates a number 
of <A HREF = "fs202.html">newly emerging legal 
principles</A> that had been developed or affirmed by various climate conferences.<P>
<B>The Convention will provide a general framework for addressing the climate 
change issue . . .</B> The Convention was signed by 154 states and the European 
Community during UNCED. Other states have signed since then, and some national 
legislatives have ratified.  It will enter into force after it has been ratified by 50 states. In 
the meantime, states are expected to start working towards the aims set by the Convention 
on a voluntary basis.<P>
<B>. . . but much work remains to be done.</B> States must now strive to ensure that 
the Convention enters into force as soon as possible. At the same time, government 
experts must decide whether to adopt additional measures in future annexes and protocols 
to the Convention. These protocols may set out more specific commitments, such as 
timetables for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<P>
<B>Even before the Convention was adopted, some countries had already taken 
unilateral action at the national level.</B> Most OECD member states have set 
national targets for stabilizing or reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases.2 In 1990, 
the <A HREF = "fs211.html">Council of the European 
Communities (EC)</A> adopted a policy that provides for stabilizing the emissions of 
carbon dioxide - the most significant greenhouse gas - at 1990 levels by the year 2000. 
A strategy to limit carbon dioxide emissions and to improve energy efficiency is currently 
being elaborated by the EC Commission.<P>
<B>In addition, two other international environmental treaties address climate 
change indirectly.</B> The amended 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That 
Deplete the Ozone Layer legally obliges its parties to phase out chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) by the year 1996 (fact sheet 224). Although inspired by concern over the 
destruction of the ozone layer, this protocol is significant also for climate change since 
CFCs are greenhouse gases. Similarly, the <A HREF = 
"fs225.html">1979 Geneva Convention on Long-Range 
Transboundary Air Pollution</A> and its protocols regulate the emission of noxious 
gases, some of which are precursors of greenhouse gases. These treaties, however, do not 
address the complex set of inter-related climate issues.<P>

<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 128</TITLE>
<IMG SRC = "iucctiny.gif" ><P>
<H1>Zimbabwe's vulnerablility to<BR>
climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>Zimbabwe is a developing country with a semi-arid climate. </B> As such, it is 
particularly vulnerable to the possibility that global climate change will lead to an even 
drier climate and create conditions that undermine economic development.  It is not yet 
possible, however, to predict how greenhouse gas-induced climate change will express 
itself at the <A HREF = "fs018.html">regional or national 
level</A>. At the global level, it is expected to raise average temperatures by 1.5-4.5 C 
over the next 100 years. It is also likely to increase rainfall, but because 
evapo-transpiration would also accelerate, soils would tend to become drier than before.  
Climate change may also affect the frequency, magnitude, and location of <A HREF = 
"fs105.html">extreme events </A>such as windstorms and 
droughts.<P>
<B>The catastrophic drought of 1991/92 offers valuable insights into Zimbabwe's 
vulnerabilities.</B>  During the drought, which was probably linked to an El 
Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event, Zimbabwe's temperatures reached record 
heights.  Rainfall levels fell to just 40% of normal, the water table dropped by 100-200 m, 
ground water (including traditional shallow wells and boreholes) dried up, and numberless 
rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and their related ecosystems disappeared.  Only the very oldest 
people had ever experienced such a severe drought.  In addition to highlighting the 
vulnerabilities of Zimbabwe's various economic sectors, the drought created widespread 
awareness among policy-makers and the general public of the need to address the 
country's dependence on climatic conditions.<P>
<B>Under the best conditions, Zimbabwe's limited <A HREF = 
"fs104.html">water resources</A> are in great demand 
for both domestic and industrial use.  </B>During the drought, people in remote areas 
often walked 10-15 km for their daily supplies. Schools, hospitals, and rural service 
centres were threatened with closure due to water shortages. Meanwhile, irrigation 
programmes failed completely and will require more than just one or two good rainy 
seasons to recover.  The rains during the 1992/93 season were 80% of normal and so were 
not sufficient to sustain river flow or to raise the water table to safe levels.<P>
<B>The 1991/92 drought caused a near-total collapse of the nation's agricultural 
system, including irrigated and rain fed crops and animal herds.</B>  The southern 
limit of the grain production zone, normally around 20 S latitude, shifted northwards to 
15 S, across the central districts of neighbouring Zambia.  Similar shifts in agricultural and 
ecological zones are likely to be a key feature of long-term climate change. Meanwhile, 
the national herd was reduced by up to 50%. The drought recovery programme, including 
the importation and distribution of grain, cost over Z$200 million (US$40 million).  Since 
some 80% of Zimbabwe's 10.5 million inhabitants are farmers, with many of the remaining 
city-dwellers also engaged in agro-industry, the economic damage and human suffering 
were enormous.<P>
<B>Because Zimbabwe is dependent on hydropower, its energy sector is 
particularly vulnerable to drought.  </B>Some 80% of the country's energy comes 
from hydro-generators on the Lake Kariba dam (which helps to limit Zimbabwe's carbon 
dioxide emissions).  During the 1991/92 season the lake level dropped to 40% of capacity; 
any further drop would have made generating electricity impossible. The result was 
frequent power cuts during 1992 and a serious challenge to Zimbabwe's economic 
structural adjustment programme.  Productivity may have fallen by 30% or more.  To 
maintain the programme, the Government was forced to import power at great expense 
from Zaire, Zambia, and South Africa.<P>
<B>The forestry sector, essential for both energy and manufacturing, is also 
dependent on water resources.</B> Most of Zimbabwe's rural population uses 
fuel-wood and other biomass for its domestic energy needs. Unfortunately, population 
pressure and the unsustainable use of this resource has deforested much of the rural areas.  
The drought then created such harsh conditions that a number of indigenous and exotic 
tree species actually perished.  Although the Government has embarked on an extensive 
tree-planting programme, it cannot succeed if the climate is not supportive. <P>
<B>Drought usually has negative effects on <A HREF = 
"fs116.html">human health</A>.</B> The problems of 
under-nourishment, water and air borne diseases, and the lack of resources to purchase 
essential drugs are exacerbated during times of drought.  While Government efforts 
prevented human deaths due to famine during the 1991/92 drought, new and 
drug-resistant strains of malaria and diarrhoea were reported in all districts of Zimbabwe.  
Logistical problems plagued the delivery of essential drugs to rural clinics and hospitals, 
and reports of sudden outbreaks of disease were not uncommon.<P>
<B>Economic development can be undermined by extreme climate events such as 
drought.</B>  During the recent drought, the diversion of funds to emergency relief 
weakened investment in the country's industrial reform programme.  Since the success of 
economic development in most developing countries depends to a large extent on good 
agricultural performance, a supportive climate is a prerequisite.  Climate extremes will 
have an adverse ripple effect on key economic sectors such as agriculture, energy 
development, industry, forestry, and health.  In addition to enhancing the resilience of 
these vulnerable sectors, a careful mix of new industries with a limited agricultural bias 
could be introduced to minimise the country's dependence on climate-sensitive 
development programmes.<P>
<B>Zimbabwe signed the <A HREF = 
"fs250.html">United Nations Framework convention on 
Climate Change</A> at the Rio Earth Summit and on 3 November 1992 became the 
fifth country to ratify.</B> Before the drought, the government had already initiated 
programmes to address this vulnerability. For example, the trend towards a late start to the 
rainy season, prolonged mid-season droughts, and shorter growing seasons had prompted 
the development of  seed varieties that require much shorter growing seasons.  Zimbabwe 
has also taken advantage of support from the United Nations and from other countries to 
initiate country studies and programmes on climate change impacts, response options, and 
awareness-raising.<P>

<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 206</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>How UNEP and WMO<BR>
are responding to climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is the "environmental 
conscience" of the United Nations System. </B>Together with the World 
Meteorological Organization (see below), it plays a leading role in the UNs work on 
climate change. UNEP is a programme of the <A HREF = 
"fs205.html">UN General Assembly</A>. Established as a result 
of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment, UNEP has headquarters 
in Nairobi and regional offices and specialized units around the world. UNEPs primary 
function is to promote environmental action and awareness by spurring others to act and 
by working through and with other organizations. The policies and activities of UNEP are 
determined by its Governing Council, which normally meets once a year. The Councils 
decisions are implemented by the Executive Director, who heads the UNEP Secretariat. In 
the last few years, the issue of climate change has been increasingly high on the Governing 
Councils agenda.<P>
<B>A number of units and programme activity centres within the UNEP Secretariat 
deal extensively with climate change.</B> The <B><I>Global Environment 
Monitoring System (GEMS)</B></I> links together some 25 major global monitoring 
networks. It provides a rigorous scientific basis for all of UNEPs other activities as well 
as for the environmental management programmes of governments and of international 
agencies and institutions. GEMS concentrates on climate, transboundary pollution, 
terrestrial renewable natural resources, oceans, and environmental pollution. The 
<B><I>Global Resources Information Database (GRID) </B></I>was founded in 1985 
to make the findings of GEMS available to decision-makers. It uses geographic 
information system (GIS) and satellite image processing technology to present 
environmental data and analyses in easily-understood maps and print-outs. The<B><I> 
Information Unit on Climate Change (IUCC) </B></I>was set up in Geneva in 1991 
and also produces information on climate change for decision-makers. It provides 
presentations, fact sheets, videos, and other information services (WMO became a 
co-sponsor of the Unit in 1992).<P>
<B>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) also plays a leading role in the 
UNs activities on climate change.</B> A Geneva-based UN specialized agency, WMO 
is responsible for the world-wide coordination of meteorological activities. It ensures the 
provision of authoritative international scientific information on the state and behaviour of 
the global atmosphere, the climate it produces, its interaction with the oceans, and the 
resulting distribution of water resources on the earth. WMO also promotes research on 
climate change and supports a number of mainly science-oriented climate programmes and 
institutions. WMOs fundamental policies and activities are determined by the World 
Meteorological Congress, which meets every four years. WMOs Executive Council, 
meeting at least once a year, monitors the implementation of the Congresss decisions by 
the WMO Secretariat and guarantees the continuity of work between the Congresss 
meetings. <P>
<B>UNEP and WMO cooperate extensively on the climate change issue.</B> They 
joined forces for the first time in 1979 when, together with a number of other 
organizations, they convened the <A HREF = "fs213.html">First 
World Climate Conference</A>. Among other things, the Conference endorsed the 
establishment of a World Climate Programme (WCP) for monitoring global climate. In 
1991, the Congress of WMO decided that the functions of the WCP, which is under the 
joint responsibility of WMO, UNEP, and the International Council of Scientific Unions 
(ICSU), should be considerably broadened to allow it to respond to new developments.1 
In 1985, the two organizations and ICSU sponsored the <A HREF = 
"fs214.html">Villach Conference</A> on the scientific aspects 
of climate change. In 1988, UNEP and WMO jointly established <A HREF = 
"fs208.html">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC)</A>. Both organizations subsequently followed and gave guidance to IPCCs 
work. In 1990 they sponsored the <A HREF = 
"fs221.html">Second World Climate Conference</A> and set up 
an intergovernmental working group to prepare for negotiations on a framework climate 
treaty; this groups activities were later taken over bythe Intergovernmental Negotiating 
Committee on Climate Change (INC). Both organizations stressed the continuing 
importance of IPCC and gave it a mandate for providing scientific support to INC. UNEP 
also recommended that the Preparatory Committee of <A HREF = 
"fs207.html">the United Nations Conference on Environment 
and Development (UNCED) </A>consider climate change as a priority area.2<P>
<B>The UNEP/WMO partnership will continue to be a leading force in the 
international response to the threat of climate change.</B> In 1991 the WMO 
Congress and the UNEP Governing Council reaffirmed the importance of the ongoing 
work of IPCC and INC and of the results of the Second World Climate Conference.3 The 
WMO Congress asked WMOs Secretary-General and UNEPs Executive Director to 
consider convening a third world climate conference at a later stage.4<P>
<B>UNEP and WMO plan to commit more of their financial and organizational 
resources to the climate change issue.</B> In 1991, the UNEP Governing Council 
asked the Executive Director to consider contributing financially towards the work of 
INC. It drew the attention of states and organizations to the special vulnerability of 
low-lying coastal and island states and commissioned the UNEP Regional Seas 
Programme to help such states build up their capacity for response measures.5  Climate 
change was included as a priority area in UNEP's Montevideo Programme for the 
Development and Periodic Review of Environmental Law.6  UNEP is also studying ways 
and means for implementing Agenda 21's  proposals to protect the atmosphere. 
Meanwhile, in 1991 WMOs Congress reaffirmed a 1989 decision by the WMO Executive 
Council7 to establish a WMO Special Trust Fund for Climate and Atmospheric 
Environment Activities. This will be used for financing activities in 15 priority topic areas, 
most of which are directly relevant to developing countries.8 In accordance with a 
recommendation by the Second World Climate Conference, the Congress also decided to 
establish a Global Climate Observing System to coordinate and complement ongoing 
monitoring activities and to provide comprehensive information on the climate system.9 In 
its 1992 Resolution the Executive Council emphasized WMO's need for more funding for 
climate change work, and in particular urged states to contribute to the Special Trust 
Fund.10 <P>

<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 218</TITLE>
<IMG SRC = "iucctiny.gif" ><P>
<H1>The Noordwijk Ministerial 
Declaration<BR>
on climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The Noordwijk Ministerial Conference was a critical milestone on the road to 
international emission targets for carbon dioxide. </B>Held in November 1989 in Noordwijk, The 
Netherlands, the Conference was attended by representatives of 67 countries, 11 international 
organizations, and the Commission of the European Community (EC). The conclusions of the 
resulting Noordwijk Declaration on Atmospheric Pollution and Climate Change1 have often been 
referred to in subsequent climate debates.2 <P>
<B>The Declaration includes an important statement on stabilizing emissions of carbon 
dioxide (CO2):</B> "The Conference recognizes the need to stabilize, while ensuring stable 
development of the world economy, CO2 emissions and emissions of other greenhouse gases not 
controlled by <A HREF = "fs224.html">the Montreal Protocol</A>. 
Industrialized nations agree that such stabilization should be achieved by them as soon as possible, at 
levels to be considered by <A HREF = "fs208.html">the IPCC</A> and <A 
HREF = "fs221.html">the Second World Climate Conference</A> of 
November 1990. In the view of many industrialized nations such stabilization of CO2 emissions 
should be achieved as a first step at the latest by the year 2000."<P>
<B>Not all industrialized states represented at the conference were ready to make concrete 
commitments on emission targets.</B> Nevertheless, this statement was a first step towards the 
recognition of such targets. <A HREF = "fs211.html">The EC</A>, whose 
member states were among those agreeing to specific emission targets, referred back to the 
Noordwijk discussions when it established its policy targets on climate change in 1990.3<P>
<B>The Conference participants recognized a number of <A HREF = 
"fs202.html">key principles</A> of relevance to a climate 
treaty.</B> These included the concept of climate change as a common concern of humankind, the 
common but differentiated responsibilities of states, the sovereign right of states to manage their own 
natural resources, and the necessity of sustainable development.<P>
<B>The participants also endorsed the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) and the convening of the Second World Climate Conference.</B> Urging all 
states to participate in these efforts, they set out the issues which, in their view, the future climate 
treaty and its protocols should regulate. These included research on climate change, action to deal 
with greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of global warming, financial assistance and transfer of 
technology to developing countries, and sustainable management of forests.<P>
<B>The Conference Declaration asked the IPCC to conduct further research into emission 
targets and reforestation.</B> These requests were reiterated by the UN/ECE <A HREF = 
"fs220.html">Bergen Conference</A> in May 1990. The declaration 
suggested that the IPCC consider the feasibility of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions by the year 
2005, as suggested by the conference held in <A HREF = 
"fs215.html">Toronto</A> in 1988. To this end, industrialized states were 
called upon to support IPCC. Another request was that the IPCC consider the feasibility of achieving, 
as a provisional target, a net forest growth of 12 million hectares a year by the beginning of the 21st 
century.<P>
<B>The Declaration contains specific proposals for action on emissions, funding, and research 
and monitoring. </B>These proposals relate to:<P>
	<B><I>Carbon dioxide</B></I>  In addition to collective action within the framework of the 
IPCC, countries should also take individual measures to reduce CO2 emissions by promoting better 
energy conservation and using environmentally sound energy sources. Industrial countries in 
particular were urged to work towards these aims. The need of developing countries for time to 
implement response measures was recognized, but the declaration also called upon them to make 
such efforts as were within their capabilities. <P>
 	<B><I>CFCs</B></I>  The Conference welcomed the efforts made within the framework of <A

<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 232</TITLE>
<IMG SRC = "iucctiny.gif" ><P>
<H1>The economics of internationally-agreed 
climate change policies</H1>
<HR>
<B>From a narrow economic perspective, individual countries do not have a strong incentive 
to reduce their net greenhouse gas emissions unilaterally. </B>Few countries emit more than 
1-2% of mankind's current fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). So if a country reduced its 
emissions, it would receive <I>some</I> benefit in the form of a small reduction in global climate 
change, but that benefit would be only a tiny fraction of the world-wide benefit. As a result, individual 
countries have very little economic incentive for incurring the costs of abating emissions or of 
enhancing forests or other "carbon sinks".<P>
<B>To be truly effective, climate policies will have to be international. </B>The OECD 
countries account for about one-half of mankinds current CO2 emissions. However, even if all the 
OECD countries work together to cut their emissions, they would have only a limited impact on 
future climate change because emissions are expected to increase rapidly in the developing countries. 
It must be remembered that, while the industrialized countries are largely responsible for the historical 
build-up of atmospheric concentrations, <I>new policies can only impact current and future 
emissions</I>.<P>
<B>Resource transfers will be required to make an internationally coordinated policy 
attractive to developing countries. </B>Developing countries may be relatively more vulnerable to 
climate change than are industrialized countries. However, the <I>total</I> benefit they would 
receive from policies to reduce climate change damages is likely to be smaller than the benefit realized 
by industrial countries, since the latter have larger economies (this analysis considers only market 
goods and services - see fact sheet 229). Resources will therefore have to be transferred to 
developing countries to make it attractive for them to incur the costs of substantially reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks. Precedents for such transfers exist. For 
example, under the amended Montreal Protocol industrialized countries compensate developing 
countries for the "incremental costs" of substituting new chemicals for CFCs. In the case of climate 
change, rich countries would find transfers economically attractive because the total cost of 
abatement can be reduced if the abatement burden is distributed widely. While the UN Convention on 
Climate Change calls for such transfers, agreeing on their magnitude and distribution will not be 
easy.<P>
<B>Free rider incentives will be hard to overcome. </B>The problem is that any country that 
decides not to participate in the global effort to reduce emissions saves substantially on abatement 
costs. At the same time, because this countrys emissions are small relative to the total, it would 
suffer only a minute loss in benefit as a consequence of its own decision not to participate. So this 
country would be better off economically  if it did not participate.<P>
<B>It will be harder to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide than it has been to reduce emissions 
of gases that destroy the ozone layer. </B>While it is true that the Montreal Protocol successfully 
harnessed international cooperation to phase out CFCs, climate change is a very different 
environmental problem. Reducing CFCs will be relatively cheap, and the economically-measurable 
benefits quite high - largely because ozone depletion causes cancer, which people are willing to pay 
a lot to avoid. This gave countries strong unilateral incentives to agree to phasing out CFCs. Such is 
not the case with climate change.<P>
<B>To be cost-effective, international climate change policies should include more than just 
emissions targets. </B>Many other actions can be taken to reduce atmospheric concentrations of 
greenhouse gases at a low cost. The destruction of rain forests, for example, has been hastened by 
domestic tax policies that provide incentives for excessive deforestation; removing these policies 
would not only reduce climate change, but would benefit national economic development. Eliminating 
subsidies on fossil fuels would also reduce CO2 emissions while improving economic performance. A 
different type of problem relates to large-scale leaks of methane from the former USSRs natural gas 
pipelines. These leaks occur largely because the Soviet incentive system did not reward efficiency. 
Economic reforms in Eastern Europe and the former USSR are almost certain to lead to more 
efficient energy use and thus fewer emissions per unit of GNP. International cooperation on these 
various issues would help to speed the adjustment to more efficient economies.<P>
<B>An international programme based solely on economic self-interest would not have to 
include measures for adapting to climate change.</B> If the Netherlands builds dikes to protect 
Amsterdam, it incurs the cost but also receives all of the benefit. This gives the Netherlands an 
economic incentive to adapt to climate change to the extent necessary. The same would hold true for 
all other countries. Consequently, apart from transferring funds to poor countries and cooperating on 
research and development, an international agreement on adaptation is not really needed.<P>

<IMG SRC = "iucctiny.gif" ><P>
<H1>Regional climate conferences<BR>
in Africa, Asia, and Latin America</H1>
<HR>
Among the most important points are:<B>Africa, Asia, and Latin America each held a 
regional conference on climate change in 1990-91.</B> These three meetings were 
convened to address the concerns of developing countries in the context of climate 
change. The meetings were co-sponsored by UNEP and various other organizations and 
attended by both scientists and policy-makers.<P>
<B>The statements adopted by the three conferences stressed the same four key 
issues raised by developing countries at all climate meetings:</B> The shared but 
differentiated responsibilities of states to counter-act climate change, the need for funding 
and technology transfer from industrial to developing countries, the importance of 
sustainable development, and the need for developing countries to participate fully in the 
international climate negotiations. The statements contain specific and action-oriented 
recommendations but no concrete commitments by participating states. (See fact sheet 
204.)<P>
<B>The Nairobi Conference on Global Warming and Climate Change addressed the 
concerns of African countries.</B> Held at UNEP Headquarters in Nairobi from 2-4 
May 1990, the conference examined the possible impact of climate change on African 
countries. It also issued a set of recommendations based on the premise that "there is 
sufficient scientific data to justify action being taken now to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and implement strategic planning to deal with climate change". Most of the 
recommendations are addressed to African governments, but some are also addressed to 
industrialized countries, the United Nations, NGOs (non-governmental organizations), and 
the private sector. Specific proposals for African countries include afforestation, family 
planning, and conservation of resources. Industrialized countries are asked, among other 
things, to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to transfer technology to developing 
countries. In addition, the conference statement advocates promoting negotiations on 
binding legal instruments on climate change and raising public awareness. <P>
<B>The Sao Paolo Regional Conference on Global Warming and Sustainable 
Development focused on Latin America. </B>Held from 18-20 June 1990, the 
Conference brought together 200 scientists and government officials from the Latin 
American region. They adopted a Conference Statement consisting of 20 bullet-point 
recommendations based on the conclusions of the Conferences eight working groups. 
<P>
<P>
	Climate change is a serious threat to humankind. Global action must be taken   
immediately to  stop it. The United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development (UNCED) should play an important role in promoting action;<P>
	The world community should be prepared to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 
60%-80% of 1990 levels by the year 2000. This reduction is necessary, according to 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to stabilize atmospheric 
concentrations of carbon dioxide;<P>
	States must end the destruction of forests and adopt reforestation programs;<P>
	Since economic development is a priority for developing countries, they should 
pioneer new forms of sustainable development, especially forms adapted to the 
circumstances prevailing in developing countries. Industrialized countries should 
contribute by removing economic obstacles by, for example, adopting a new approach 
to the foreign debt problem;<P>
	Climate change presents a potential source of conflict between developed and 
developing countries. This problem should be addressed by UNCED; and<P>
	Because some degree of global warming is inevitable, developing countries must 
elaborate strategies for adapting to the consequences of climate change, such as a rise 
in the sea-level.<P>
<B>The Bangkok Conference on Global Warming and Sustainable Development 
established Asias priorities vis a vis climate change.</B> As the last of the regional 
climate meetings of developing countries, the 10-12 June 1991 Bangkok Conference was 
able to draw upon the conclusions of prior meetings. The Conference brought together 
scientists and policy makers from 20 South-East Asian, East Asian, and Pacific countries, 
as well as from other states and international organizations. Because the Asia/Pacific 
region includes both highly industrialized and developing countries, the Conference 
provided a good forum for discussing cooperation between these two groups.	The 
Conference Statement reviews the scientific findings on climate change and its effects as 
well as the conclusions of previous climate conferences. It "proposed policies and 
activities to move the region towards a pattern of development designed for the long-term 
amelioration of these problems". In particular, it advised:<P>
	That the world community treat climate change as a crucial security issue in light of 
the seriousness of the potential impacts of global warming;<P>
 	That the equitable involvement of all social groups within each country was essential 
to addressing climate change in the context of sustainable economic development. 
Women play a particularly important role in both economic development and 
environmental protection and should therefore be involved;<P>
	That transfers of funds and technology to the developing countries are critical to the 
ability of these countries to respond to climate change. The Statement suggests new 
approaches to the international debt problem and proposes that current military 
assistance to developing countries be replaced by environmental assistance;<P>
	That a regional network of policy research institutes focusing on global warming and 
sustainable development and a parallel network of scientific institutions to investigate 
climate change be established; and<P>
	That the International Negotiating Committee on Climate Change (INC) represents a 
welcome and rare opportunity for all states, but especially developing countries, to 
address many of their environment and development concerns within a global forum.

<H1>The economics of  risk 
avoidance<BR>
under uncertainty</H1>
<HR>
<B>Scientists are not yet certain just how the climate will respond to increasing 
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs).</B>  Their best estimate is 
that current GHG emissions trends will cause the global average temperature to increase 
by 1.5-4.5 C over the next 100 years and the global average sea level to rise by 3-10 cm 
per decade.  Scientists have significantly less confidence in regional or national climate 
forecasts. Other uncertainties include future population and economic growth rates and 
how these rates will impact future GHG emissions levels.  What's more, since the majority 
of studies that assess the likely impacts of climate change take the doubling of carbon 
dioxide (CO2) concentrations as their benchmark scenario, little information exists on the 
likely scale of damages either before or - more importantly - after this doubling occurs.  
As a result, there is a great deal of uncertainty about how great the risks of climate change 
truly are.<P>
<B>Economists recognise that people dislike uncertainty and tend to be risk averse . 
. . </B> People are often willing to exchange a risky asset with a high expected return for 
an asset with a lower, yet more certain rate of return. For example, suppose a lottery 
winner is given a choice between receiving a certain prize of $450,000 and selecting one 
of two identical envelopes.  One envelope contains a prize of $1 million and the other is 
empty, making the expected payoff to the gamble $500,000 ([$1 million x 0.5] + [$0 x 
0.5]).  This is higher than the certain payoff, but most people would, of course, prefer to 
take the certain $450,000 prize.  By comparison, a "risk neutral individual" would be 
someone who cares only about the expected outcome and would thus choose to open an 
envelope.<P>
<B>but economic analysis that treats climate change as if it were a problem 
involving perfect certainty does offer valuable insights. </B> One of the most useful 
services economists could render to policy-makers would be to calculate the optimal level 
of GHG emissions, given the costs and benefits of making emissions reductions.  To make 
the necessary calculations for such a cost-benefit analysis, economists usually assign 
definite values to uncertain parameters such as climate sensitivity.  They use the expected, 
or most likely, values. This allows economists to offer some insights, but it does lead to 
treating the problem as if it were one of perfect certainty.  An analysis that ignores 
uncertainty could lend support to policies that would be appropriate for society "on 
average".  They might not, however, reflect the interest that individuals would have in 
avoiding extreme consequences, even if there is a low probability that they would occur.  
Critics therefore argue that people would probably want to make even larger cutbacks in 
GHG emissions than suggested by cost-benefit analyses to avoid this high risk.<P>
<B>Improving the treatment of risk in cost-benefit analyses requires making much 
more complex calculations.</B> Few economists have attempted to do this.  They 
would have to describe variations in key parameters mathematically - for example, to say 
that there is a 95% probability that climate sensitivity lies between two particular values. 
Scientists, however, are generally reluctant to make such statements.  Furthermore, some 
risks are inherently  unquantifiable, and economists have no widely accepted method for 
dealing with such risks.<P>
<B>Research that would reduce climate change uncertainties would be extremely 
valuable for policy-making.</B>  By calculating how much it would be worth paying to 
get immediate, perfect information about key uncertainties, economists can provide a 
strong argument for greatly increased research budgets.  If cost-benefit analyses could be 
based on perfect information, we could more easily avoid restricting emissions 
unnecessarily in the event that global warming involves low risks, or cut back further on 
excessive emissions if the climate is acutely sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions.  One 
study1 calculates that the value of perfect information regarding climate sensitivity is an 
impressive US$148 billion.  However, not only does scientific research seldom provide 
perfect information, but some scientific improvements must await the passage of time and 
cannot simply be bought.  Some economists even speculate that permitting a small amount 
of global warming to occur would provide scientific information that is more valuable than 
the damage associated with the warming (although given the predictions of climate change 
models that some climate change seems inevitable, there would seem to be little or nothing 
to gain from postponing abatement). On the other hand, because the expected value of 
perfect information is high, there is a good argument for substantial funding for scientific 
research.<P>
<B>Because the greenhouse problem is so full of uncertainties, policy-making will 
remain relatively subjective.</B>  Some people argue that society should adopt a 
"maxi-mini' approach to decision-making.  This approach of maximising the minimum 
payoff suggests that we should prepare for the worst possible outcome irrespective of the 
cost and no matter how unlikely this eventuality is.  This is not, of course, very typical 
real-life behaviour.  An alternative proposal is to regard some rate of warming, such as 
0.1o C per decade, as the maximum acceptable and to set an emissions ceiling for GHGs 
to guarantee that such a rate is not exceeded.  This is based on the argument that it will 
remain impossible to quantify the climatic risks of surpassing either a rate of warming or 
an absolute temperature that is greater than what has been recorded in the earth's recent 
history.  The truth of this argument, too, is hotly debated.  For economists, the challenge 
remains to develop policy prescriptions that take into account current scientific 
uncertainties.<P>

<H1>The links between climate change 
and<BR>
acid rain policies</H1>
<HR>
<B>The problems of climate change and acid are distinct but related.</B>  Climate 
change is a global problem that concerns all countries, while acid rain is a regional 
problem concerning individual countries and their neighbours.  Climate change is caused 
by man-made emissions of the so-called <A HREF = 
"fs002.html">greenhouse gases (GHGs)</A>. These non-toxic 
gases, most of which occur naturally in the atmosphere and are not pollutants, include 
carbon dioxide, methane, CFCs, and nitrous oxide.  Acid rain is caused by toxic industrial 
smoke containing sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and chloride.  These chemical 
compounds break down in the atmosphere into their respective acids - sulphuric, nitric, 
and hydrochloric - which are deposited on the earth in the form of dry gas, rain, snow, 
mist, or fog.  These two environmental problems are clearly different - but they are also 
linked in important ways.<P>
<B>Reducing emissions of carbon dioxide to combat climate change would also 
reduce acid rain.</B>  There are at present no economically competitive "end-of-pipe" 
or "scrubbing" technologies for removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial 
smokestacks.  CO2 emissions can only be cut by reducing the use of fossil fuel, whether 
by lowering energy use per unit of economic production or substituting low- and 
non-carbon fuel for high-carbon fuels.  On average, reducing one tonne (1,000 kg) of 
carbon simultaneously reduces about 20 kg of sulphur dioxide and eight kg of nitrogen 
oxides from stationary sources such as factories, and about 0.5 and 9 kg respectively from 
mobile sources such as cars.  From the point of view of policies to cut GHG emissions, 
this secondary benefit of reducing acid rain may be considerable; it may even, at least 
initially, exceed the primary benefit of reduced warming by a factor of 10 or 20.  If these 
figures are accurate, they lend additional support to economic arguments for <A HREF = 
"fs230.html">carbon taxes</A> and other policies for reducing 
GHG emissions.<P>
<B>Reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide to combat acid rain would probably 
affect the rate of global warming. </B> Rather than reducing fossil fuel use, which cuts 
emissions of all fuel-related gases, policies to control SO2 emissions call for installing flue 
gas desulphurisation and other end-of-pipe technologies and for substituting low-sulphur 
fuels for high-sulphur fuels.  While leaving GHGs untouched, these technologies will 
reduce the sulphur dioxide and other sulphuric particles floating in the atmosphere as 
"aerosols".  By scattering and reflecting the sun's light away from the earth (causing bright 
red sunsets), these particles have a cooling effect on the lower atmosphere.  In the highly 
industrialised Northern Hemisphere, sulphur particles in the atmosphere may be offsetting 
at least half of the current man-made warming.  In the less-industrialised southern 
hemisphere, the offsetting effect may be almost negligible.  The potency of sulphur cooling 
has recently been demonstrated with the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 
1991.  This massive release of sulphur particles into the stratosphere seems to have cooled 
the earth by  0.5  C on average between May 1991 and May 1992.<P>
<B>A warmer atmosphere would influence the occurrence and severity of acid 
rain.</B>  Many of the chemical reactions that lead to the formation of acid rain are 
affected by temperature.  Higher temperatures usually accelerate reactions, suggesting that 
global warming is likely to increase the formation of acidic materials.  The likely net effect 
on acid rain is unclear, however, since global warming will also cause changes in cloud, 
wind, and precipitation patterns.<P>
<B>Because of these linkages, there are benefits to designing acid rain and climate 
change policies simultaneously.</B>  Cost benefit analyses of policies to reduce GHG 
emissions normally suggest that reductions should take place as long as the marginal <A 
HREF = "fs228.html">costs </A>of reduction are smaller than 
the marginal <A HREF = "fs229.html">benefits</A> of avoided 
global warming.  Because reducing GHG emissions also reduces acid rain, however, the 
marginal benefits of this secondary reduction should also be considered in the analysis.  
Similarly, a cost benefit analysis of reducing sulphur emissions should consider the 
marginal benefits of avoided acid rain, the marginal costs of making the reductions, plus 
the additional costs of increased global warming due to the reduction in atmospheric 
aerosols.<P>

<H1>Climate change <BR>
and the Geneva Convention<BR>
on Long-Range Transboundary Air 
Pollution</H1>
<HR>
<B>Although drafted in response to acid rain, the Geneva Convention is potentially 
relevant to climate change.</B> The treaty was adopted in 1979, when greenhouse 
gases and their effects on climate were not yet a major issue. It seeks to control the 
emission and cross-border flow of "air pollutants", defined as substances which, when 
released into the air, have harmful effects on human well-being and on flora, fauna, and 
ecosystems. This broad definition does not envisage the greenhouse effect as such, but it 
can be applied to a number of greenhouse gases and their precursors. The Geneva 
Convention was adopted under the auspices of the UN Economic Commission for Europe 
(ECE) and is limited in scope and membership to European and North American 
countries. It entered into force in 1983. As of January 1993, 35 states and the European 
Community are parties to it. <P>
<B>The Convention provides a general framework for the control of air 
pollution.</B>  More specific obligations are set out in the accompanying protocols. The 
Conventions Executive Body reviews the progress that party states are making on their 
commitments under the Convention<P>
	to endeavour to limit and then, as far as possible, to reduce air pollution; <P>
	to attempt to develop "without undue delay" policies and strategies to  combat air 
pollution;<P>
	to initiate and coordinate research on the causes and effects of air pollution and on new 
technologies for reducing emissions;<P>
	to exchange information on scientific research, policies, and measures relating to air 
pollution;<P>
	to hold consultations between upwind "polluter" states and downwind "victim" 
states.<P>
<B>The four protocols adopted within the framework of the Geneva Convention 
have some relevance to climate change.</B> The 1988 Sofia Protocol on nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) and the 1991 Geneva Protocol on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) both 
seek to limit emissions of substances which are precursors of the <A HREF = 
"fs002.html">greenhouse gas</A> tropospheric ozone (O3).1 
The 1985 Helsinki Protocol aims to limit sulphur emissions. As the presence of sulphates 
in the stratosphere tends to promote global cooling, this may also have some impact on 
climate change. Under the EMEP programme, governed by the 1984 Geneva Protocol, 
data on air pollution are collected and monitored.<P>
<B>Parties to the Sofia Protocol must stabilise nitrogen oxide emissions.</B>  The 
Protocol entered into force in 1991 and, as of January 1993, has 20 Parties.  It imposes 
the following obligations:<P>
	to stabilise the emissions or cross-border flows of nitrogen oxides at 1987 levels. This 
must be done by 1994 at the latest, and should represent just a first step. Parties  are free 
to choose a base year from before 1987;<P>
	to apply national emissions standards to major new emissions sources. States must also 
introduce pollution control measures for all major existing stationary sources;<P>
	to start negotiations on further reductions of nitrogen oxide emissions;<P>
	to facilitate the exchange of information and technology for reducing nitrogen oxide 
emissions;<P>
	to make unleaded fuel for vehicles equipped with catalytic converters available  within 
two years of the Protocols entry into force;<P>
	to review the Protocol regularly as new scientific and technical information becomes 
available;<P>
	to carry out research and to develop national policies and strategies for implementing the 
Protocol. <P>
<B>The 1991 Geneva Protocol provides that annual VOC emissions must be 
reduced by at least 30% by 1999.</B>  It sets 1988 as the base year, but Parties may 
choose a different base year from between 1984 and 1990.  Parties with low 1988 
emissions levels (specified in the protocol) must at least stabilise emissions by 1999.  The 
Protocol also obliges states to apply emission standards to all new sources of VOCs and 
to products containing solvents, use the best available technologies that are economically 
feasible, review the Protocol regularly and negotiate further emissions reductions, establish 
a mechanism for compliance monitoring, set up national programmes to fulfill their 
obligations, and co-operate in the exchange of technology and information.  It also 
specifies that compliance with its provisions does not relieve parties from fulfilling other 
international obligations, including those related to combating climate change.  The 
Protocol was signed by 23 states and will enter into force upon ratification by 16 
states.<P>

<H1>Key legal aspects of<BR>
the Climate Change Convention</H1>
<HR>
<B>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is part of the 
body of legal rules that govern relationships among states and international 
organisations</B>.  International law determines the obligations and rights that members 
of the community of states have towards each other.  It does not normally apply directly 
to individuals or to private companies. Treaties (often called conventions) are one of the 
most important sources of international law.  They are formal agreements between two or 
more states to do or to not do certain things, or to do them in a certain way.<P>
<B>The Convention is legally binding only on those states that have agreed to be 
bound by it</B>.  A state that is bound by a convention is called a party.  To meet its 
obligations under a convention, a party may need to impose legal obligations on its 
nationals.  For example, the Climate Change Convention obliges developed country parties 
to take measures aimed at limiting their greenhouse gas emissions.  To meet this 
commitment, these states may need to adopt national legislation that will in turn encourage 
or require companies and individuals to limit <I>their</I> emissions.<P>
<B>The Convention was concluded through a formal procedure.</B>  The task of 
drafting a treaty involving numerous states and a complicated issue is often assigned to a 
body of government representatives set up by a UN agency or other international 
organisation.  The Climate Change Convention was negotiated and drafted by the 
Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (INC/FCCC), a body established by the UN General Assembly (fact sheet 209). 
Participation in the INC/FCCC was open to all member states of the UN and its 
specialised agencies, and efforts were made to involve as many states as possible. 
Meetings were organised and serviced by a Geneva-based secretariat.  The INC/FCCC 
took just 15 months to draft the Convention, a remarkably short time given the complexity 
of the issue and the diversity of positions represented.<P>
<B>The INC/FCCC negotiated and then formally adopted the Convention.</B>  At 
the end of a treaty negotiation, ministers and other duly empowered representatives of the 
negotiating states formally express their collective consent to the draft text.  The treaty is 
then considered to be adopted, although not yet legally binding.  The Climate Change 
Convention was adopted by the INC/FCCC, the same body that drafted it.<P>
<B>The Convention was officially opened for signature at the UN Conference on 
Environment and Development (UNCED). </B> Signature is generally the first step 
towards accepting a treaty.  During the Conference, also known as the Rio Earth Summit, 
the Convention was signed by 154 heads of state or other senior national representatives, 
as well as by one regional economic organisation (the European Economic Community, 
now the European Union).  It remained open for signature until 19 June 1993, by which 
time 165 states plus the EEC had signed.<P>
<B>After signing, states must ratify the Convention in order to become parties</B>.  
Ratifying can take time because many states must have treaties formally approved by 
parliament or some other legal body.  They may also need to adjust their national laws to 
reflect their new treaty obligations. States that ratify a treaty accept it as binding and are 
obliged to implement it.  The Climate Change Convention entered into force<I> 
(</I>became legally binding on its parties) on 21 March 1994, 90 days after the 50th 
ratification.  Those states that were not involved in the drafting and adoption of the treaty, 
or that join after the closing date for signature, may still become a party to the Convention 
through a procedure called accession.<P>
<B>International law does not provide a single, clearly defined way to make states 
respect the treaties to which they are parties.</B>  Some experts argue that 
international law provides rules on liability and responsibility which require states or 
individuals that have caused environmental damage to restore the affected parts of the 
environment, pay compensation to those that suffered damage, or both.  However, these 
rules are of limited value for problems such as greenhouse gas emissions, where the link 
between cause and effect can be difficult to prove.<P>
<B>The Convention creates its own institutions for monitoring compliance</B>.  
Parties to the Convention must regularly provide information on their performance to the 
Conference of the Parties (COP).  These documents are made available to all other parties 
and discussed by the COP.  Two subsidiary bodies are created by the Convention to 
provide expert advice for assessing the reports and the effectiveness of the measures that 
parties take.  In this way, all parties will know if a state is not meeting its commitments.  
This can provide an incentive for a state to comply with its obligations so as to avoid a 
negative international reputation.  Many other treaties also use this so-called "institutional 
supervision" method to monitor compliance.  It is becoming an increasingly important 
mechanism for issues where a country's failure to meet its commitments affects not  just 
one other state, but the entire international community.<P>
<B>Any party can raise questions about whether another party has complied with 
its commitments under the Convention.</B>  If possible this should be done through 
negotiation or other peaceful means.  A multilateral "non-compliance procedure" could be 
adopted to allow the issue to be addressed in a non-confrontational setting aimed at 
facilitating compliance with the Convention. Alternatively, the parties may use more 
traditional methods of dispute settlement, including conciliation, arbitration, and 
adjudication.  The parties concerned could agree to bring the dispute before the 
International Court of Justice or to another agreed forum.  Legally, the resulting decision 
would have to be respected.  The decision of the court or arbitrator may oblige a state to 
honour its commitments in the future, restore the damaged parts of the environment, or 
pay compensation.  One possible drawback of this approach is that all states involved in 
the dispute must have previously accepted the jurisdiction of the arbitrator or court.<P>

<H1>Poland and climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>As a developed country with inefficient industry, Poland is a major emitter of greenhouse 
gases.</B>  In 1988 its emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) exceeded 460 million tonnes, representing 
2.3% of total world-wide emissions, or 12.1 tonnes per capita and 2.66 tonnes per US$1,000 of 
GDP.  These figures result partly from the country's heavy reliance on coal and lignite, which are 
carbon-intensive fuels.  Poland is also vulnerable to many of the potential impacts of global climate 
change.  Over the next 100 years, annual mean temperatures in Poland may increase by about 3.5 C, 
while January temperatures could rise by as much as 5 C.<P>
<B>Agriculture may be both positively and negatively affected by climate change.</B>  Higher 
temperatures could extend the summer growing season by 50 to 70 days. Combined with higher 
humidity, this could triple the harvest of fodder and double the production of cereal and other stubble 
crops.  Shorter and gentler winters might also permit livestock to remain in pasture almost the entire 
year.  Maize soybeans and sunflowers would thrive, and the variety of fruits and vegetables that could 
be raised would expand.  One study has suggested that total food production will increase by about 
34%.  On the negative side, climate change could encourage new and more virulent pests and diseases 
to attack crops.  And, while most crop yields are expected to rise, the staple potato crop could 
decline under warmer and drier conditions.<P>
<B>A warmer climate would probably accelerate the cycle of precipitation, 
evapo-transpiration, and water run-off.</B>  Researchers predict that evapo-transpiration may 
increase by 30% by the year 2100, while the annual runoff in central Poland may increase by 50-100% 
over the next 100 years.  This could worsen the erosion of arable land and reduce the water content 
of the soil.  Greater run-off in the early spring followed by a water deficit during the growing season 
would require a more extensive artificial reservoir system to store excess water.<P>
<B>The species composition of Polish forests would continue to change.</B>  Due in part to a 
slight warming since the 1920s, deciduous trees such as oak and beech have been gradually replacing 
evergreens such as pine, spruce and fir.  If temperatures continue to rise, broad-leafed species are 
likely to continue displacing conifers.  On the other hand, an increase in droughts and heat-waves 
could slow their growth and raise the risk of forest fires.<P>
<B>The mean sea-level of the southern Baltic Sea would continue to rise.  </B>It has already 
been rising by about 1.5-2.9 mm per year over the past century, and higher levels could subject 
Poland's northern low-lying areas - which are mostly farmland - to flooding.  Meanwhile, 18 
holiday centres situated on cliffs would be threatened by severe erosion.  With a higher sea-level 
would come increased salinity in river estuaries, coastal lakes, and ground water.  The area at risk is 
home to 700,000 people, five large harbours, and a number of industrial plants. The cost of a "full 
protection" response strategy for Poland's Baltic coastline has been estimated at US$7 billion, while 
the total cost of a "no protection" strategy would amount to $70 billion.<P>
<B>Poland signed the Climate Change Convention on 4 June 1992 during the UNCED "Earth 
Summit" in Rio de Janeiro.</B>  By 21 September 1994, the government must present a summary 
of its national climate change strategy to the Conference of the Parties to the Convention.  This 
summary will include an "inventory" of Poland's sources and "sinks" of carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases.   It will also outline Poland's strategies for limiting its emissions; a key strategy will 
be to reduce its dependence on coal and lignite for 75% of its energy needs to 50% by the year 2010 
by shifting to gas and oil.  The report will also explain how Poland plans to adapt to the possible 
impacts described above and to promote research and education programmes.<P>

<H1>The First World Climate 
Conference</H1>
<HR>
<B>The First World Climate Conference was one of the first major  international 
meeting on climate change. </B>Held on 12-23 February 1979 in Geneva, the 
Conference was sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization WMO) and a 
number of other international bodies. Essentially a scientific conference, it was attended by 
scientists from a wide range of disciplines. In addition to the main plenary sessions, the 
conference organized four working groups to look into  climate data, the identification of 
climate topics, integrated impact studies, and research on climate variability and 
change.<P>
<B>The Conference focused mostly on how climate change might impact human 
activities.</B> It examined the possible impacts on specific activities such as <A HREF = 
"fs101.html">agriculture</A>, fishing, forestry, <A HREF = 
"fs104.html">hydrology</A>, and urban planning. The 
conclusions were summarized in the Declaration of the World Climate Conference1, which 
highlighted the international communitys emerging perception of the climate as a vital 
natural resource. It recognized that humanitys survival requires us to live in harmony with 
nature, and it urged governments "to foresee and to prevent potential man-made changes 
in climate that might be adverse to the well-being of humanity." The declaration also 
identified the leading cause of global warming as increased atmospheric concentrations of 
carbon dioxide resulting from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and changes in land 
use.<P>
<B>The Conference led to the establishment of the World Climate Programme 
(WCP) to research climate change.</B>  Emphasizing the need for more scientific 
research into the causes and effects of climate change, the First World Climate Conference 
endorsed a proposal by WMO to establish a new climate research programme. The WCP 
was set up under the joint responsibility of WMO, the United Nations Environment 
Programme UNEP), and the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). It is 
composed of the World Climate Data Programme, the World Climate Applications 
Programme, the World Climate Research Programme, and the World Climate Impact 
Programme.<P>

<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 202</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>International law and climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The <A HREF = "fs250.html">UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change</A> was adopted in May 1992 and opened for signature in June at <A HREF 
= "fs207.html">UNCED</A> in Rio de Janeiro.1</B> Conventions 
among states are a key source of international law.<B> </B>Also called <B><I>treaties</B></I>, 
they set out obligations that are binding on their party states.<B><I> </B></I>As a 
<B><I>framework convention</B></I>, the climate treaty contains important principles and general 
obligations. Additional commitments may be agreed upon later in one or more 
<B><I>protocols</B></I>. <P>
<B>Customary international law also provides some general guidance</B> <B>on the legal 
implications of climate change</B>. An unwritten international norm becomes part of customary 
law if it is consistently followed over a long period of time by a significant number of states which 
accept it as a legal obligation. For example, if a particular commitment to act is repeatedly expressed 
at important international conferences, and if all the participating states act in accordance with it, then 
the commitment may become an obligation under customary law.<P>
<B>Existing customary law affirms the sovereign right of states to manage their own natural 
resources, although this right is by no means absolute.</B> Customary law also prohibits a state 
from allowing activities on its territory to inflict serious damage on the environment of other states or 
on parts of the environment that do not belong to any state. Although states are not prohibited from 
causing any environmental damage at all, they must make "reasonable use" of common resources such 
as the atmosphere. The problem is, what is "reasonable"? Exactly how much carbon dioxide is a state 
permitted to release into the atmosphere? How much forest may it turn into agricultural or industrial 
land? Customary law has no definitive answer.<P>
<B>Until 1992, international law did not address climate change directly.</B> Because climate 
change is a phenomenon of unprecedented scale and character, traditional legal concepts and 
mechanisms provided by treaties and customary law do not help much. A number of treaties already 
in force, notably <A HREF = "fs225.html">the Geneva Convention on 
Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution</A> and <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete The 
Ozone Layer</A>, do deal with atmospheric pollution. However, they do not specifically address the 
causes and effects of climate change as such. <P>
<B>Non-binding statements by international climate conferences influenced the drafting of the 
Climate Change Convention by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a 
Framework Convention on Climate Change</B> INC/FCCC). The treaty drafters referred to the 
statements to evaluate the concerns and proposals of various states and regions. In this way, a number 
of concepts and principles were reaffirmed and highlighted. The following three paragraphs describe 
the most important of these principles:<P>
<B>Climate change is a "common concern of humankind".</B> Representing an effort to 
provide a basis for international action to protect the global climate, this concept was first introduced 
in a 1988 resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.2 It has since been supported by 
numerous international climate meetings.3 The legal problem is that climate change is not imposed by 
one state upon another state. As a result, the traditional legal principles governing transboundary 
pollution (which <I>is</I> imposed by one state upon another) do not apply. But if the atmosphere 
is a "common concern of humankind", all states have an interest and duty to protect it from serious 
harm. A state on one side of the globe is thus "affected" by a state on the other side of globe that is 
emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This principle is affirmed in the preamble to the 
Climate Convention.<P>
<B>States have "common but differentiated responsibilities" for combating climate 
change.</B> It is widely recognized that all states contribute to climate change and that all states 
may, to different degrees, suffer from it. But the industrialized states developed their economies over 
the past 150 years in part by treating the atmosphere as a free and unlimited resource, and they 
continue to generate the greatest quantity of greenhouse gases. Developing countries are now 
attempting to industrialize at a time when the atmosphere is no longer considered as free and 
unlimited. In addition, they still make a smaller contribution to climate change (although it will 
increase in the decades to come). The principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" 
proposes that, while all states should act to prevent damage to the atmosphere, developed countries 
should take the lead. This principle is widely recognized.4 It was incorporated into the <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">1987 Montreal Protocol</A> and it underlies the dual 
standard of commitments for developed and developing countries established by the Climate 
Convention.<P>
<B>Potentially dangerous activities should be restricted or prohibited even before they can be 
proven to cause serious damage (the precautionary principle).</B> Traditionally, activities were 
often not restricted or prohibited by legal rules until they had been proven to cause environmental 
damage. In other words, states were free in their activities unless and until a causal link between an 
activity and a particular damage had been established. This approach may not work, however, in the 
case of activities contributing to climate change. Scientists are still unsure about the exact timing and 
nature of climate change impacts, but if efforts to limit net greenhouse gas emissions are not initiated 
before scientific certainty is achieved, it may be too late to undo the damage. Therefore, the 
precautionary principle provides that activities threatening serious or irreversible damage should be 
restricted or even prohibited <I>before</I> there is absolute scientific certainty about their impact. 
This principle was discussed at many international climate conferences,5 and it has also been included 
in some recent environmental policy statements and conventions.6 The climate treaty embodies a 
precautionary approach, since states agreed to take action despite the remaining scientific 
uncertainties about climate change.<P>

<P>
<H1>How climate change could 
impact<BR>
Southeast Asia</H1>
<HR>
<B>Scientists believe that mankinds greenhouse gas emissions may raise 
temperatures and change rainfall patterns in Southeast Asia.</B>  According to 
computerized General Circulation Models GCMs) , the mean annual near-surface 
temperature of the earth will rise by 1.5 - 4.5 C over the next 100 years.  Scientists 
recognize that, while GCMs can offer global climate forecasts, they are still unable to 
generate <A HREF = "fs018.html">climate scenarios at the 
regional level.</A>  Nevertheless, to assist policy-makers who must start preparing 
national climate change response strategies, researchers have begun to use the global 
results of GCMs to conduct studies on the likely socio-economic impacts of climate 
change on particular regions, such as Southeast Asia.<P>
<B>The most serious threat to livelihoods in Southeast Asia would come from 
coastal inundation caused by <A HREF = 
"fs102.html">rising sea levels</A>. </B> Scientists believe 
that higher atmospheric temperatures would cause a sea-level rise of around 20 cm by the 
year 2030 and 65 cm by the end of next century.  Sandy coastlines backed by densely 
populated, low-lying plains make the Southeast Asian region particularly vulnerable to 
inundation.  As much as 20,000 km2 of land in Malaysia, <A HREF = 
"fs272.html">Thailand</A>, and Indonesia could be threatened 
with flooding, including some of the most economically productive land in these countries; 
the city of Bangkok and its surrounding industrial belt is all within one metre of sea level.  
Meanwhile, as the ocean rose the "natural" inland retreat of mangrove swamps - critical 
breeding grounds for fish and prawns - would be obstructed by towns and farms.  
Coastal farmland would also be lost, and the disappearance of beaches would undermine 
tourism, an important source of earnings in the area.<P>
<B>The cost of improving coastal defenses against a sea-level rise of 20 cm may be 
around US$4 million per kilometre.</B>  Although the countries of Southeast Asia 
have seen impressive rates of development over the past decade, such enormous 
expenditures would put serious strains on their economies.  Indonesia has 80,000 km of 
coastline, the longest of any country in the world.  Clearly it would not be feasible to 
protect it all.  An alternative strategy would be to expand land area through reclamation 
projects such as land-fills, with the income from the new land helping to offset the costs of 
construction.  In 1989 Malaysias Prime Minister suggested that a series of sea walls could 
be constructed about 3.2 km offshore in the Strait of Malacca as a prelude to large-scale 
land reclamation.  Whichever response is adopted, deciding what areas should be 
protected and which ones should be sacrificed to the sea would no doubt prove 
controversial. <P>
<B>Higher temperatures and changing rainfall patterns would <A HREF = 
"fs101.html">probably reduce rice production </A> 
throughout the region</B>.  Besides the loss in output resulting from sea inundation, 
yields on remaining cropland would be reduced.  In one research study, the climate 
scenarios developed by GCMs were fed into yield models for various crops.  While there 
are uncertainties over such factors as how farmers would respond to the challenge, the 
results suggest that Malaysian rice yields could fall by around 20%.  Excess demand for 
irrigation water would severely limit the potential for growing two crops per year as is the 
current practice in the more fertile areas of the country, and higher temperatures would 
shorten the time available for grains to mature.  In <A HREF = 
"fs123.html">Vietnam</A>, increased drought in the south 
could seriously damage agriculture in the Mekong Delta, one of the countrys most 
productive areas.  In Indonesia, excessive rainfall would cause erosion and soil leaching.  
In <A HREF = "fs272.html">Thailand</A>, rice yields per 
hectare might actually rise in response to increased temperatures, but a reduction in the 
amount of cultivated land would still cause total production levels to fall.  If changing 
patterns of production in other countries did not compensate for this shortfall, the world 
price for rice could rise sharply, as Thailand currently accounts for about one third of the 
international market.<P>
<B>New agricultural technologies and crop strains might mitigate some of the worst 
effects of climate change.  </B>Local and international agricultural research centres may 
be able to develop new seed varieties that can tolerate the expected changes in 
temperature and soil quality.  However, this is more likely for some crops than for others.  
Rubber, for example, which earned revenues of M$3.6 billion for Malaysia in 1989, might 
adapt well to climate change, but Indonesias maize crop might suffer a 50% decrease in 
yields.<P>
<B>Poverty and high population densities would ensure that even small changes in 
land area or crop productivity would have <A HREF = 
"fs107.html">serious social consequences</A>.  </B>Many 
of Southeast Asias farmers and fishermen must struggle for their daily existence and 
would not have the resources to adapt to climate change or to relocate.  If the climate 
scenarios presented in the studies come to pass, government-sponsored resettlement 
programmes will become essential.  While moving populations can create ethnic tensions 
and foment competition over economic resources, <A HREF = 
"fs112.html">spontaneous migration</A>  could be even more 
damaging and might result in widespread destitution as well as in further harm to the 
environment.<P>

<H1>The economics of carbon taxes</H1>
<HR>
<B>A tax on the carbon content of oil, coal, and gas would discourage fossil-fuel use 
and so reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. </B>Carbon taxes have already been 
introduced by a number of industrialized countries, including Finland, the Netherlands, 
Norway, and Sweden. Detailed proposals are also being debated in Denmark and 
Switzerland, and a proposal by the European Commission for a community-wide carbon 
tax is being considered by member states.<P>
<B>Many economists believe that a carbon tax would achieve any given reduction 
in CO2 emissions at minimum cost . . .</B> Although there are other ways to reduce 
carbon dioxide emissions, they can be less economically efficient than are carbon taxes. A 
tax just on petrol, for example, would reduce the use of oil, but much of the reduction 
would be negated as energy users switch over to coal and natural gas, which also emit 
carbon dioxide. It would also not affect the use of heating oil and other petroleum 
products. As for energy efficiency standards and other regulatory alternatives, because 
they would not raise the price of emitting carbon, they would neither discourage energy 
use nor provide electricity generators with incentives to move away from carbon-intensive 
fuels. A carbon tax, on the other hand, would give all users of fossil fuels the same 
incentive to reduce carbon emissions.<P>
<B>but the tax must be well designed and administered.</B> Because different fossil 
fuels have different carbon contents and can often be substituted for one another, it is 
important to tax <I>carbon content</I>. While such a tax might seem awkward to apply, 
estimates of each fuels carbon content could easily be used to translate the carbon tax 
into separate taxes on coal, oil, and natural gas. Since fossil fuels are already taxed in most 
countries, this would make the carbon tax easy to administer. Unfortunately, many of the 
national carbon tax programmes already in existence are not well designed. In one nation's 
programme, for example, the electricity industry is exempt from paying the carbon tax, 
and industrial companies pay the tax on the basis of their revenues, rather than on their 
energy use. These exceptions and exemptions have the effect of raising the countrys 
overall cost of abating any given level of CO2 emissions.<P>
<B>A carbon tax cannot guarantee how great the reduction in emissions will be . . 
.</B> The effect that a tax has on emissions depends on how energy users and suppliers 
respond to it. Their response would be difficult to predict in advance. Economists have 
made a range of estimates for the effect different carbon taxes would have. The firmest 
conclusion that emerges from their work is that the tax would have to be high - some 
US$100 per ton of carbon - if it were to reduce emissions substantially in the long run. A 
US$100 per-ton tax would raise the current price of crude oil (US$20 per barrel) by about 
two thirds. The tax would have to be this high in part because economic growth will, in 
the absence of abatement policy, increase emissions over time. Hence, the tax would have 
to be raised every now and then to keep emissions levels stable. On the other hand, future 
technological innovations may reduce the cost of abatement in the very long run, allowing 
carbon taxes to be reduced.<P>
<B>but it can guarantee that the cost of abatement will not be excessive.</B> Faced 
with a carbon tax of US$100 per ton of carbon, individuals and firms would seek to avoid 
this penalty by spending up to - but not more than - US$100 to abate a ton of carbon 
emissions. Quantitative emissions limits, on the other hand, would guarantee how much 
CO2 is emitted, but not the price for achieving that level. Therefore, a quantitative limit on 
emissions could turn out to be too costly (higher, for example, than the damage avoided) 
or not costly enough. In many industrialized countries, CO2 emissions are no higher today 
than they were in 1973 due to real increases in the price of energy. If energy prices, always 
volatile and unpredictable, increase in the future, a given quantitative ceiling on emissions 
might be reachable without devoting any additional resources to abatement; if prices fall, 
the costs of achieving a given quantitative target could turn out to be much higher than 
expected. A key virtue of the carbon tax is that it fixes the incentive to abate emissions 
independently of energy price fluctuations (that is, a US$100 tax provides a US$100 
incentive). In addition, the tax could be adjusted up or down if new scientific information 
becomes available about the damages caused by particular emissions levels.<P>
<B>A supplementary benefit is that a carbon tax would allow other, more 
distorting, taxes to be lowered, thus improving the economys performance.</B> A 
high carbon tax would raise substantial sums of money; one study estimates that a tax of 
US$100 per ton would raise revenues equal to 3.4% of GNP in the US and 1.1% of GNP 
in energy-efficient Japan.1 Such high sums would allow income and other taxes to be 
reduced, making the carbon tax revenue neutral (i.e. keeping the total tax burden 
unchanged). While taxes on income and savings distort economic decision-making by 
individuals and firms, a carbon tax actually reduces distortions in the economy. This 
contribution to economic performance needs to be factored in when calculating the true 
cost of an abatement policy based on a carbon tax.<P>
<B>The carbon tax is regressive, but other taxes and transfers can be adjusted to 
offset its negative impact on poorer households.</B> Poor households tend to spend a 
greater percentage of their total income on energy than do rich ones. But the regressive 
nature of the carbon tax can be neutralized by indexing transfer payments to inflation (as is 
already done in many countries) and by increasing the personal deductions households can 
take on their income taxes. At the same time, it should be recognized that other policies 
for abating net greenhouse gas emissions would also impact the distribution of income, 
even if less transparently than would a carbon tax. For example, energy efficiency 
standards would hit the poor hardest because the poor tend to buy cheaper, 
less-energy-efficient appliances than do richer households.<P>
<B>The most cost-efficient carbon tax would be one that is comprehensive and 
internationally coordinated. </B>A one-ton reduction in carbon emissions has the same 
benefit as a one-ton increase in the amount of carbon absorbed by trees or other "sinks". 
The most efficient policy, then, would be to offer a subsidy for sink enhancement that is 
equivalent to the tax on CO2 emissions. In addition, taxes should also be imposed on 
other greenhouse gases; such taxes would be calculated according to the global warming 
potential of each particular gas (fact sheet 7). The US, for example, taxes 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and a few other countries are considering doing the same. If 
such taxes were set at the same level in every country, the total cost of reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced (fact sheet 228). There would be no need for 
such an international tax to be imposed by an international agency, an arrangement many 
countries would anyway not accept. Instead, as exemplified by the current proposal by the 
European Community, a standard carbon tax could be coordinated internationally but 
administered nationally.<P>

<H1>The Cairo Compact on climate 
change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The 1989 Cairo Compact called for urgent international action on the threat of 
climate change. </B>In December 1989 the Egyptian government, the United Nations 
Environment Programme UNEP), and the Climate Institute convened a World Conference 
on Preparing for Climate Change. Held in Cairo and attended by over 400 participants 
from all regions of the world, the conference adopted the Cairo Compact.1<B> </B>The 
Compact states that climate change requires the cooperation of all nations on an 
unprecedented scale. To be effective, any measures would have to be supported not only 
by governments, but by multilateral organizations, the industrial and financial community, 
scientific and educational institutions, and environmental groups. Individuals may also 
make an important contribution through their consumption patterns and participation in 
the decision-making process. The Compact concludes by underlining the urgency of these 
actions: "For the sake of our planet and the lives of our children and generations to come, 
we must act now."<P>
<B>The Compact outlines the key issues that should be at the top of the world 
agenda. </B>They include:<P>

<H1>The climate policy<BR>
of the European Community</H1>
<HR>
<B>The environmental policy of the European Community (EC) has addressed 
climate change since the mid-1980s. </B> Between 1986 and 1989, several non-binding 
resolutions adopted by the Parliament and Council of the EC called for measures to 
combat climate change.1  In addition, a number of binding Directives on air pollution 
addressed the issue indirectly.2  The EC's Climate Change Policy of 1990,3 subsequently 
endorsed by the EFTA states,4 committed member states to stabilising carbon dioxide 
emissions at 1990 levels "in general" by the year 2000.  According to the policy document, 
this target is only a first step, with <I>reducing</I> emissions to be considered at a later 
stage.  The policy document also contains suggestions on how to achieve the target.<P>
<B>The EC and its members signed <A HREF = 
"fs250.html">the UN Framework Convention on Climate 
Change</A> in June 1992 at the Rio "Earth Summit".</B>  On 23 April 1993, the 
EC Council decided that it would ratify the Convention by the end of the year.  During <A 
HREF = "fs209.html">the negotiations for the Convention</A>, 
the Commission of the EC and the 12 member states had played a leading role.  They had 
advocated the adoption of strong measures, in particular the incorporation of the EC 
emissions target, into the Convention.  Although supported by a number of states, this 
stabilisation target was eventually replaced by a compromise formula.<P>
<B>The EC has declared its intention to continue playing a lead role in the 
international effort to combat climate change.  </B>As a block of leading industrial 
states, the EC intends to adopt measures that go beyond the obligations imposed on 
developed countries by the Climate Convention. The focus of current EC initiatives is 
therefore on stabilising and eventually reducing CO2 emissions.  The 5th Environmental 
Action Programme adopted in March 1992 sets objectives and targets for the year 2000.5  
In addition, the EC Commission started work in 1990 on a comprehensive Community 
strategy for limiting carbon dioxide emissions and improving energy efficiency.  The 
proposed strategy, submitted to the Council in May 1992,6 is based on the premise that 
reducing energy demand by increasing energy efficiency and promoting fuel-switching is 
the best way to reduce CO2 emissions.  It proposes a wide range of specific measures, 
which are to be based on the principles of economic efficiency, equity, and subsidiarity.  
The strategy is currently under discussion.<P>
<B>The proposed EC strategy for limiting CO2 emissions incorporates existing 
actions and initiatives for promoting energy efficiency</B>. In October 1991, the EC 
Council approved a five-year energy efficiency programme called SAVE (Specific Actions 
for Vigorous Energy Efficiency).  The proposed ALTENER Programme would promote 
the development of renewable energy sources.  In April  1993, the EC Council decided to 
set up a system for monitoring the Community's CO2 emissions.  Other programmes 
related to research and development in the field of energy efficiency are also under 
discussion.<P>
<B>The most controversial measure under discussion is the introduction of a <A 
HREF = "fs230.html">carbon tax</A></B>.  In June 1992, 
the Commission proposed a Council Directive for taxing carbon dioxide emissions and 
energy.7  The proposal calls for member states to levy taxes at the national level on the 
consumption of energy from non-renewable sources.  The tax would be based on the 
energy source's CO2 content and energy value (measured in calories).  The rate would 
start at US$3 per barrel of oil or its equivalent in 1993 and increase by $1 per barrel every 
year.  There is still considerable debate over this measure.<P>
<B>The EC is also a party to earlier international agreements that have a bearing 
on climate change. </B> As a party to <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">the Montreal Protocol</A>, which controls the 
use of <A HREF = "fs031.html">CFCs</A>, it was among the

is also a party to <A HREF = "fs225.html">the Geneva 
Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution</A> and its protocols. It has 
adopted implementing legislation in the areas addressed by these various legal instruments.  
Work is underway on a draft Directive on volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are 
the subject of the 1991 protocol to the Geneva Convention (fact sheet 225).<P>

<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 207</TITLE>
<IMG SRC = "iucctiny.gif" ><P>
<H1>Climate change<BR>
and the UNCED "Earth Summit"</H1>
<HR>
<B>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) was held in 
Rio de Janeiro on June 3-14, 1992.</B>  This so-called Earth Summit took place 20 years after the 
1972 Stockholm Declaration1 first laid the foundations of contemporary environmental policy.  As a 
high-level forum with universal participation, UNCEDs main aim was to show the way to a new 
global strategy for reconciling development needs with environmental protection.  The key results of 
UNCED were the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21, Forest Principles, and two international conventions, 
one concerning climate change, the other biodiversity.  The decisions taken and the documents 
adopted by UNCED are likely to have important implications for the future international response to 
climate change, as well as for virtually every other environmental issue.<P>
<B>UNCEDs success was made possible by the two-year preparatory process that preceded 
the actual Earth Summit.  </B>A Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) for UNCED, established by 
the <A HREF = "fs205.html">UN General Assembly</A>,2 began its work 
in early 1990.  The PrepCom received guidance from a number of UN bodies on how to address 
UNCEDs various topics.3  It established three working groups and held an organizational meeting 
and four substantive sessions between March 1990 and April 1992.4  The PrepCom dealt extensively 
with UNCEDs primary concern of integrating environmental and development aims to promote 
sustainable development.  The work relating to climate change focused on assisting and monitoring 
efforts already underway in <A HREF = "fs209.html">the 
Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(INC/FCCC)</A> and in other UN bodies.5<P>
<B><A HREF = "fs250.html">The United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change</A> was signed at UNCED by 153 States and the European 
Community. </B> After 15 months of tough negotiations, the Convention was adopted in New 
York on May 9, 1992 by the INC/FCCC.  The negotiations were concluded in time for the treaty to 
be officially opened for signature in Rio, as intended. UNCED was considered the proper forum for 
affirming the international communitys support for this important international treaty.  (The other 
legally binding document signed at UNCED was the Convention on Biological Diversity.)<P>
<B>The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development adopted at UNCED sets out <A 
HREF = "fs202.html">key principles</A> of relevance to climate 
change.</B>  Although not legally binding, the Declaration contains 27 principles intended to shape 
future international and national action on environment and development.  Some of these principles 
had already been affirmed at climate change and other international conferences, such as the common 
but differentiated responsibilities of states at different levels of development, the need for sustainable 
development, and the precautionary principle.<P>
<B>Agenda 21, UNCEDs 40-chapter environmental action agenda for the 21st century, 
contains a chapter on protecting the atmosphere.</B> Chapter 9 of Agenda 21 recommends 
measures that governments and other bodies can take to improve the scientific understanding of 
climate change, to promote sustainable energy use and production, and to reduce the damage caused 
to the atmosphere by transport, industry, resource development, and land use.  Chapter 9 also makes 
recommendations about the related issues of <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">stratospheric ozone depletion</A> and <A HREF = 
"fs225.html">transboundary atmospheric pollution</A>.  This chapter was 
one of the most difficult to negotiate and caused substantive disagreements up to the last moment.

<IMG SRC = "iucctiny.gif" ><P>
<H1>The Toronto and Ottawa 
conferences<BR>
and the "Law of the Atmosphere"</H1>
<HR>
<B>The 1988 Toronto Conference called for a "comprehensive international 
framework that can address the interrelated problems of the global 
atmosphere."</B> Convened by the government of Canada from 27-30 June, the 
Toronto Conference brought together over 300 scientists and policy-makers from 46 
countries and organizations. Unlike most similar international gatherings, the 
"International Conference of the Changing Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security" 
addressed climatic change together with the closely related problems of ozone layer 
depletion and the long-range transport of toxic and acidifying substances. It concluded 
that, although some steps had been taken to develop international law for protecting the 
atmosphere, the existing rules were still relatively fragmentary.<P>
<B>The Conference Statement noted that "humanity is conducting an unintended, 
uncontrolled, globally pervasive experiment whose ultimate consequences could be 
second only to a global nuclear war."</B>1 Stressing the importance of immediate 
action, the Statement called for the adoption of an Action Plan for the Protection of the 
Atmosphere and the establishment of a World Atmosphere Fund to finance its 
implementation. The Action Plan should include an international framework convention on 
the atmosphere as well as national legislation and action plans. The Statement also 
outlined the scientific basis for concern, the economic and social concerns, and the legal 
aspects of the problems.<P>
<B>The Conference issued an ambitious "call for action" to governments, industry, 
and international organizations.</B> Among its recommendations were: 1) the 
reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 20% of 1988 levels  by the year 2005. 
Recommended as an initial global goal,  this goes  beyond the emissions targets 
recommended by most later  international conferences as well as the tentative target set by 
the 1992 <A HREF = "fs250.html">UN Framework Convention 
on Climate Change</A>; 2) the improvement of energy efficiency by as much as 10% by 
the year 2005;    3) the inception of the necessary technological changes to enable these 
goals to be reached; 4) the preparation of the principles and components of a framework 
treaty for the protection of the atmosphere (including climate change, ozone depletion, 
and atmospheric pollution) in time for the 1992 <A HREF = 
"fs207.html">UN Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED)</A>; and 5) the promotion of <A HREF = 
"fs208.html">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change</A> (the IPCC had been established shortly before the Toronto Conference), the 
channelling of resources to the World Climate Programme (WCP) and other research 
institutions, the backing of technology transfer, the reduction of deforestation, and the 
furtherance of public awareness of these issues.<P>
<B>The 1989 Ottawa Meeting of Legal and Policy Experts generated ideas for 
treaties on the atmosphere and on climate change.</B> Held from 20-22 February  as 
a follow-up to the Toronto Conference, the meeting was attended by around 80 legal and 
policy experts acting in a personal capacity, including officials from governments, 
non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions around the world. Its goal was 
to further develop the idea of a "law of the atmosphere treaty" and a narrower convention 
on climate change. The non-binding statement adopted by the meeting2 amounted to 
rough drafts of such treaties. Both drafts contain some interesting and innovative 
ideas.<P>
<B>The "law of the atmosphere" plan tackled not only climate change, but every 
threat to the global atmosphere.</B> This contrasts with proposals made by other 
international conferences and was criticized as being over-ambitious. Although the plan 
was discussed in various international meetings, it was not taken up by the climate treaty 
negotiators. The 1992 <A HREF = "fs250.html">UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change</A> focuses exclusively on climate change. 
This was generally considered to be a more realistic approach with a greater chance of 
leading to a treaty within a reasonable period of time. <P>
<B>The proposed "law of the atmosphere" convention would have created a very 
broad framework for dealing comprehensively with threats to the atmosphere. 
</B>These threats include climate change, ozone depletion, and acid rain, as well as any 
other problems that might arise in the future. Borrowing the approach taken by the 1982 
Law of the Seas Convention, some participants proposed that conventions and protocols 
on specific issues such as climate change be elaborated within this general framework. The 
Ottawa Meetings proposed "law of the atmosphere" convention would have included: 1) 
broad definitions of "atmosphere" and "atmospheric interference";  2) the obligation on 
the part of all states to protect the atmosphere, notwithstanding the sovereignty of states 
in the management of their own resources; 3) a provision that measures taken to protect 
the atmosphere should not lead to damage   of other parts of the environment; 4) the 
development and transfer of technology, especially for the benefit of developing countries; 
5) prior notice to other states, and environmental impact assessment, of potentially 
harmful activities; 6) the elaboration of a regime for liability and   compensation and for 
dispute settlement; and 7) the possible establishment of a World Atmospheric Trust Fund 
to assist developing countries.<P>
<B>The proposed climate treaty was to be a framework treaty with protocols. 
</B>Like <A HREF = "fs224.html">the Vienna Convention on 
the Protection of the Ozone Layer and its Montreal Protocol</A>, the proposed treaty 
would have dealt with fundamental issues while leaving specific issues to protocols. 
Possible protocols could address the various greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, 
CFCs and halons, nitrous oxide, and tropospheric ozone), forest management and 
reforestation, and the setting up of a World Climate Trust Fund to help developing 
countries meet their obligations under the treaty system. The "framework treaty" approach 
also underlies the 1992 Climate Convention.<P>

<title>Wind Plants of Germany</title>

<head><b><h1>Wind Plants of Germany</h1></b></head><p>

<body>

Wind energy is growing more rapidly in Germany than anywhere else in 
the world. In 1994 the recently reunified country surpassed Denmark as 
the world's second largest wind energy powerhouse. By the end of 1995 
Germany will exceed 1,000 MW of installed wind capacity and will outstrip California, long the world leader in installed capacity by 1998, if not sooner.<p>

Wind turbines in Germany generated about 1 Terawatt-hour 
(1,000,000,000 kWh) of electricity during 1994 and will produce nearly 
2.5 TWh in 1996.<p> 

German wind development is concentrated in the two northern l&auml;nder of 
Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony) and Schleswig-Holstein. Because each 
l&auml;nder has a a long coastline with good wind resources, both states have
adopted a goal of installing 1,000 MW of wind capacity.<p>

<img align=bottom src="dwind.gif"><p>
<h3>Enercon E40 near Groothusen</h3>
</center><p>


Enercon is Germany's largest wind turbine manufacturer and is located in the northenmost province of Neidersachsen, Ostfriesland. Groothusen is a small village north of Emden in the Krummh&ouml;rn peninsula. The turbine shown here uses a 40-meter rotor to drive a large-diameter ring generator directly  without the aid of a gearbox. The 500 kW wind turbine is installed on a 40 meter tall concrete tower. <p>

<H1>Cutting back greenhouse gases<BR>
with tradable<BR>
emissions permits</H1>
<HR>
<B>Tradable permits are a cost-efficient, market-driven approach to reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.</B> A government must start by deciding how many tons of a particular gas may be 
emitted each year. It then divides this quantity up into a number of tradable emissions entitlements - 
measured, perhaps, in CO2-equivalent tons - and allocates them to individual firms. This gives each 
firm a quota of greenhouse gases that it can emit over a specified interval of time. Then the market 
takes over. Those polluters that can reduce their emissions relatively cheaply may find it profitable to 
do so and to sell their emissions permits to other firms. Those that find it expensive to cut emissions 
may find it attractive to buy extra permits. Trading would continue until all profitable trading 
opportunities had been exhausted.<P>
<B>Permits would ensure that emissions do not exceed a given level.</B> They are not as good 
as <A HREF = "fs230.html">carbon taxes</A>, however, at guaranteeing 
that the costs of abatement will be neither too large nor too small. So in choosing between the two 
main market-oriented approaches of tradable entitlements and carbon taxes , a government must 
decide whether it is more important to be certain of the quantity of reduced emissions or of the costs 
involved.<P>
<B>Tradable permits are already being used to address several other environmental 
problems.</B> For example, the US regulates <A HREF = 
"fs031.html">chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</A> with tradable emissions 
entitlements, and it is introducing a similar system to limit emissions of pollutants that cause <A 
HREF = "fs235.html">acid rain</A>. <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">The 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer</A> also includes provisions for the international trading of emissions permits, although 
no such trades have yet taken place.<P>
<B>To be successful, a permit scheme would have to be carefully designed.</B> If the rules 
governing trading are complex, or if the market for permits consists of only a few players, trading 
may not be efficient. This will also be true if trading involves substantial transaction costs. On the 
other hand, even an inefficient permits system may be a more cost-efficient way to reduce emissions 
than using most forms of regulatory control. <P>
<B>If implemented internationally, tradable permits could lead to resource transfers from rich 
countries to poor ones.</B> International trading could take place between governments as well as 
between firms. But before trading could begin, governments would have to agree on how to make the 
initial allocation of permits. One proposal calls for  allocating entitlements on an equal per-capita 
basis.1 Such an allocation would guarantee resource transfers from the North to the South because, 
having fewer greenhouse gas emissions per capita than do industrialized ones, developing countries 
would be net sellers of permits, while rich countries would be net buyers. However, it is highly 
unlikely that such an allocation would be acceptable to the rich countries. They would probably prefer 
to have no agreement at all than to make such large transfers.<P>
<B>To win broad acceptance, an international scheme for tradable permits could not allocate 
quotas on a simple per-capita basis</B>. The problem is that OECD countries have high per-capita 
emissions, the developing countries have low per-capita emissions, and the former Communist 
countries are somewhere in between. An allocation based on population would be attractive to 
developing countries, but probably unacceptable to OECD countries because it would require them to 
make huge transfers to poor countries (assuming that the agreed goal was to reduce global emissions 
on a large scale). Allocating entitlements according to a slightly more complex formula could reduce 
these transfers and ensure that every party to the agreement is better off than it would be without the 
agreement. Agreement would be far more likely if the entitlements were initially allocated according 
to a formula that reflected the different circumstances of these country groups. For example, the 
OECD could receive somewhat fewer permits than would be required for current emissions levels, 
and the poor countries a slight surplus, with the total quantity of entitlements being somewhat below 
current global emission levels. One study estimates that such an allocation would lower resource 
transfers to a fraction of current overseas development assistance.2 <P>
<B>International tradable permits could be effective even if implemented on a small scale. 
</B>Economists analysing schemes for emissions permits have usually focused on international 
agreements for making large-scale reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. But trading may 
also be effective in more limited circumstances. For example, a country facing high abatement costs 
may meet its own national target for emissions reduction by providing incentives for other countries 
with low abatement costs to undertake abatement on its behalf. Such bilateral agreements (known as 
"offsets") may involve relatively high transactions costs, but their small scale may make them easier to 
negotiate and implement, at least in the short run.<P>

<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 122</TITLE>
<IMG SRC = "iucctiny.gif" ><P>
<H1>How rersearchers assess<BR>
the implications of climate change<BR>
for agriculture</H1>
<HR>
<B>A growing number of research studies are trying to assess how climate change may affect 
<A HREF = "fs101.html">agriculture</A> and <A HREF = 
"fs127.html">global food supplies</A> .</B>  Because climate change 
would lead to a complex chain of physical and human interactions, methodologies for analysing 
agricultural impacts are still being refined.  But policy-makers need guidance <I>now</I>.  Although 
researchers cannot offer them definitive forecasts, they can provide their current "best guess" of 
future possibilities.<P>
<B>The first steps in an agricultural impacts study are to define the problem and to select the 
research method.</B>  The research team must agree on the goals of the study, the crops and region 
to be studied, the time-frame and the data needs, and the ultimate use of the study findings.  This in 
turn helps to determine the methodology to be used.  The chosen methodology must always be tested.  
For example, a linear regression model that predicts grass yields based on mean monthly temperatures 
can be run with an external set of data unrelated to the study to ensure that the model is realistic and 
sensitive to a wide range of assumptions. Such testing is very difficult, however, and most current 
methodologies have still not been sufficiently refined through experimentation.<P>
<B>A future, potential climate scenario is then selected.</B>  This can be done in one of three 
ways.  The first way is to adopt an <B><I>arbitrary scenario </B></I>and to assume that the 
average regional temperature will rise by, say, 2 C.  Another is to take the output data from a <A 
HREF = "fs014.html"><B><I>General Circulation Model 
</B></I>(GCM)</A>.  Researchers use GCMs to explore how emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
<A HREF = "fs002.html">greenhouse gases</A> will change average 
global temperatures, rainfall, and other climatic variables.  However, these models cannot yet give 
reliable estimates at the <A HREF = "fs018.html">regional level</A> at 
which most impact studies are conducted, especially for rainfall, a key variable for agriculture.  The 
third approach is to use a past or other actual climate as an <B><I>analogue.</B></I>  One study of 
the US Midwest, for example, used the actual climate conditions of the 1930s, when temperatures 
were 1.1 C higher than during the base period, to model the possible future agricultural response to 
warmer and drier conditions.  <P>
<B>The next step is to assess the impact of the climate scenario on crops</B>.  Researchers use 
the scenario's temperature and moisture assumptions to estimate crop yields and animal growth rates.  
The required modelling, however, can be quite complex.  For example, in addition to the climate, 
crop yields depend on air quality, the soil's moisture and nutrient content, farming practices (which 
are continuously evolving), and much more.  And, since the expected combination of temperature, 
moisture, soil quality, and greenhouse gas concentrations is unprecedented, scientists must rely on  
data that has been generated under experimental conditions to validate their impact models. 
Unfortunately, the results of experiments with raising crops under artificial circumstances do not 
always correspond with data from actual farms.  For example, models indicate that the rise in 
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide from 280 parts per million in pre-industrial times to 
nearly 360 ppm today should already have increased actual farm yields by 1-5%. However, no 
statistically significant increases related to "CO2-fertilisation" have yet been detected.<P>
<B>Researchers also consider how climate change might affect agricultural yields 
indirectly.</B>  For example, some crops might be damaged by diseases and pests that have been 
stimulated by the warmer climate.  Other environmental problems, such as acid rain or the depletion 
of ground water resources by expanding populations, must also be considered.  As impacts models 
improve, they will increasingly incorporate more complex interactions, such as how changing rainfall 
patterns may impact hydro-electricity and thus the availability of power for irrigation pumps.  They 
will also account for economic factors, such as the influence of markets and the impact of changing 
food prices on production.<P>
<B>Expected changes in yields are then used to assess the human consequences.</B>  Reduced 
yields combined with population growth and other factors would clearly have implications for food 
supplies.  Lowered agricultural production would also worsen the problems of poverty, migration, 
and employment.  Research studies can assess the possible impacts on individual households, 
especially poorer ones, as well as on entire regions or nations.<P>
<B>Many research studies consider efforts by farmers and governments to respond to threats 
to crop yields or to new opportunities.</B>  Farmers can adapt to climate change by using new 
seed varieties or altering their cultivation methods.  Governments and agri-business can support 
research into crops that are more suited to the changing climate.  Although such responses are 
difficult to predict, researchers can influence them by outlining policy options in their studies' 
conclusions.  Indeed, to serve the needs of policy-makers impacts studies are increasingly being 
designed to focus on the greatest risks to agriculture and on effective response strategies.<P>
<B>There are also other methodologies for assessing the likely agricultural consequences of 
climate change.</B> For example, rather than starting with a particular climate scenario, researchers 
can ask what are a region's most significant vulnerabilities.  This approach can provide policy-makers 
with insights into the risks and the worse case scenarios that may deserve their early attention.  It 
involves assessing which household or regional changes would be particularly damaging and then 
moving "backwards" to identify the changes in production and climate which would be likely to cause 
them.  Yet another approach is to gather information on droughts, floods, and other adverse affects of 
<A HREF = "fs125.html">natural climate variability</A> to gain insights 
into the potential physical  impacts of climate change, the relative vulnerability of different sectors of 
the population, and the most effective response options.  For example, the gradual depletion of 
ground water in the U.S. Midwest or desertification in the Sahel are in many ways analogous to what 
could occur elsewhere in future years due to climate change.<P>

<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 203</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>Climate Change <BR>
and the special concerns of<BR>
coastal areas and small island states</H1>
<HR>
<B>A rise in the <A HREF = "fs102.html">sea-level</A> caused by 
climate change would directly threaten low-lying coastal areas and small island states. </B>A 
number of international meetings have addressed this problem, which is most serious for developing 
countries. The South Pacific Forum in July 1989 expressed concern over the effects of sea-level rise,1 
and the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth declared their support for the efforts of coastal 
and island states to protect themselves against sea-level rise in their 1989 Langkawi Declaration on 
Environment.2 None of these statements have legal force, but they influenced the climate treaty 
negotiations and they are reflected in the <A HREF = "fs250.html">1992 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.</A><P>
<B>The 1989 Malé Small States Conference on Sea Level Rise recognized climate change and 
its effects as <A HREF = "fs202.html">a common concern of 
mankind</A> . </B>The Conference was held in the Maldives from November 14-18 and issued the 
Malé Declaration on Global Warming and Sea Level Rise.3 The Declaration stressed the serious 
consequences of  sea-level rise for low-lying coastal and island states and the special responsibility of 
industrialized states.<P>
<B>The Malé conference decided to develop a programme of action.</B> This programme 
would consist initially of an Action Group, including representatives from the Caribbean, South 
Pacific, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean regions, to develop and coordinate joint strategies to 
approach the issues. The conference also called upon all states to adopt immediate measures in the 
fields of energy efficiency, coastal zone management and protection, and afforestation. It expressed 
support for the work of <A HREF = "fs208.html">the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</A> , urged industrialized countries to give financial and technical 
assistance to developing countries, and proposed the eventual establishment of a broader monitoring 
network involving collaboration with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO).<P>
<B>The 1991 Noumea Ministerial Declaration on Environment and Development addressed 
the effects of climate change on the islands of the South Pacific.</B> Adopted in July by the 
representatives of 27 members of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)4, it 
highlights the special vulnerability of these states and the importance of appropriate <A HREF = 
"fs240.html">energy-efficient technologies</A>, further scientific research 
into and monitoring of <A HREF = "fs102.html">sea-level rise</A>, and 
technical and financial assistance to Pacific island states. The ministers also expressed their 
commitment to control the emission ofgreenhouse gases, manage their natural resources on a 
sustainable basis, cooperate in international efforts, and implement their own strategies.<P>
<B><A HREF = "fs205.html">The United Nations General 
Assembly</A> also discussed the "possible adverse effects of sea-level rise on islands and 
coastal areas, particularly low-lying coastal areas."5</B> The Assembly's December 1989 
resolution welcomed the growing international attention the problem was receiving, urged all states to 
help the countries concerned, and recommended the issue for consideration by the IPCC, the drafters 
of a future climate treaty, and <A HREF = "fs207.html">the UN 
Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED)</A>. In April 1991, the UN 
Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly an extensive report on actions taken at the 
global and regional levels.6 The call for support of low-lying states was reiterated by the Governing 
Council of UNEP in May 1991, which also asked the UNEP Regional Seas Programme to help these 
states build up their capacity to respond to the threat of a sea-level rise.7<P>
<B>The threat posed to low-lying coastal and island states was an important issue in the treaty 
negotiations and is reflected in the <A HREF = "fs250.html">Climate 
Change Convention</A>.</B> The IPCCs Impacts Working Group took special note of it. At the 
<A HREF = "fs221.html">Second World Climate Conference</A> in 1990, 
coastal and small island states formed the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) to demand 
immediate action on climate change and its impacts, in particular sea-level rise.8 The problem was 
also taken up during the negotiations of <A HREF = "fs209.html">the 
Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(INC)</A>, where AOSIS represented the interests of coastal and small island states.9 INCs 
Working Group I agreed that the future climate treaty would have to take account of the special 
needs of small coastal and island states.  The 1992 <A HREF = 
"fs250.html">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change </A>does 
indeed address these concerns. In particular, it calls on parties to give full consideration to the needs 
of small island and low-lying coastal states when fulfilling their obligations under the treaty (Art. 4, 
para. 8).<P>

<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 216</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>The Tata Conference<BR>
on Global Warming and<BR>
Climate Change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The Tata Conference was the first international climate change meeting 
dedicated to <A HREF = "fs204.html">the concerns of 
developing countries</A></B>. Held in New Delhi from 21-23 February 1989, the 
Conference was co-sponsored by the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP) 
and the US-based World Resources Institute.<P>
<B>The Conference Statement1 provides a detailed analysis of climate change and 
its impact on developing countries.</B> It calls for response measures in very strong 
and uncompromising terms, stressing the urgency of "aggressive action" by the 
international community. Among its many recommendations, the Statement advocates 
using fossil fuels more efficiently, introducing non-fossil fuel  technologies, <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">phasing out CFCs</A> by the end of the century 
and transferring substitute technologies to developing countries on a non-commercial 
basis, halting deforestation, and stabilizing the worlds population. <P>
<B>The Statement reminds industrialized countries that they bear most of the 
responsibility for climate change.</B> The Statement asserts that, "having caused the 
major share of the problem and possessing the resources to do something about it, the 
industrial countries have a special responsibility to assist developing countries in finding 
and financing appropriate responses." It calls on them to adopt measures for reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and to provide technology and funding to enable developing 
countries to do the same.<P>
<B>Developing countries should participate in the international response to climate 
change. . . </B>The Statement notes that 20% of greenhouse gas emissions currently 
emanate from developing countries, and that this figure could climb to well over 50% by 
the middle of the 21st century. Consequently, developing countries are "potential 
contributors [to the problem] in the future and burden-sharers today." Developing 
countries should be particularly active in improving energy efficiency, pioneering the use 
of renewable energy, halting deforestation and moving toward net forest growth, and 
slowing population growth.<P>
<B>but economic development should not be sacrificed.</B> The Conference 
Statement addresses the potential conflict between development and the proposed climate 
change measures: "The developing countries contribution in response to the greenhouse 
challenge should be carried out in a way that enhances, rather than diminishes, 
development prospects. Where these are in conflict, priority should be given to 
development, which brings so many clear and needed benefits..." <P>
<B>The Conference Statement emphasizes the importance of research and training 
in developing countries.</B> It recommends setting up national climate monitoring, 
research, and management boards to coordinate research and implementation strategies.

<title>Wind Plants of Cumbria, England</title>

<head><b><h1>Wind Plants of Cumbria, England</h1></b></head><p>

<body>

The British firm Windcluster is attempting to develop wind plants on 

unused land near harbors or old industrial sites. In their first 

project, Windcluster installed five Vestas V27 turbines on an 

abandoned air field. The airport at Haverigg on the Cumbrian coast had 

not been used since World War II when it was an army air base.<p>

<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><P>
Acidic deposition, or acid rain as it is commonly known, occurs when emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)
and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) react in the atmosphere with water, oxygen, and oxidants to form various acidic
compounds.  These compounds then fall to the earth in either dry form (such as gas and
particles) or wet form (such as rain, snow, and fog).  Prevailing winds transport the compounds, sometimes hundreds of miles,
across state and antional borders.<p>
     Electric utility plants account for about 70 percent of annual SO2 emissions and 30 percent
of NOx emissions in the United States.  Mobile sources (tranportation) also contribute significantly to NOx
emissions.  Overall, over 20 million tons of SO2 and NOx are emitted into the atmosphere each year.<p>
     Acid rain causes acidification of lakes and streams and contributes to damage of trees at high elevations (for
example, red spruce trees above 2,000 feet in elevation).  In addition, acid rain accelerates the decay of building materials and paints, including
irreplaceable buildings, statues,and sculptures that are part of our nation's cultural heritage.
Prior to falling to the earth, SO2 and NOx gases and their particulate matter derivatives, 
sulfates and nitrates, contribute to visibility degradation and impact public health.<p>
     Implementation of the Acid Rain Program under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments will confer significant benefits on the nation. 
By reducing SO2 and NOx, many acidified lakes and streams will improve substantially so that they can once
again support fish life.  Visibility will improve, allowing for increased enjoyment of scenic vistas across our country, particularly in National Parks.  
Stress to our forests that populate the ridges of mountains from Maine to Georgia
will be reduced.  Deterioration of our historic buildings and monuments will be slowed.  Finally,
reductions in SO2 and NOx will reduce sulfates, nitrates, and ground level ozone (smog), leading
to improvements in public health.<p>

<h3>Surface Waters</h3>
<hr>
     Acid rain primarily affects sensitive bodies of water, that is, those that rest atop soil with a limited ability to
neutralize acidic compounds (called "buffering capacity").  Many lakes and streams examined in a National
Surface Water Survey (NSWS) suffer from chronic acidity, a condition in which water has a constant low pH
level.  The survey investigated the effects of acidic deposition in over 1,000 lakes larger than 10 acres and in thousands
of miles of streams believed to be sensitive to acidification.  Of the lakes and streams surveyed in the
NSWS, acid rain has been determined to cause acidity in 75 percent of the acidic lakes and about 50 percent of
the acidic streams.  Several regions in the U.S. were identified as containing many of the surface waters
sensitive to acidification.  They include, but are not limited to, the Adirondacks, the mid-Appalachian highlands,
the upper Midwest and the high elevation West.<p>
     In some sensitive lakes and streams, acidification has completely eradicated fish species, such as the brook
trout, leaving these bodies of water barren.  In fact, hundreds of the lakes in the Adirondacks surveyed in the
NSWS have acidity levels indicative of chemical conditions unsuitable for the survival of sensitive fish species.<p>
     Emissions from U.S. sources also contribute to acidic deposition in eastern Canada, where the soil is very
similar to the soil of the Adirondack Mountains, and the lakes are consequently extremely vulnerable
to chronic acidification problems.  The Canadian government has estimated that 14,000 lakes in eastern Canada
are acidic.<p>
     Streams flowing over soil with low buffering capacity are equally as susceptible to damage from acid rain as
lakes are.  Approximately 580 of the streams in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain
are acidic primarily due to acidic deposition.  The New Jersey Pine Barrens area endures the highest rate of acidic streams in the nation
with over 90 percent of the streams acidic.  Over 1,350 of the streams in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands (mid-Appalachia)
are acidic, primarily due to acidic deposition.  Many streams in that area have already
experienced trout losses due to the rising acidity.<p>
     Acidification is also a problem in surface water populations that were not surveyed in federal research projects.  For example, although lakes smaller than 10
acres were not included in the NSWS, there are from one to four times as many of these small lakes as there are larger lakes.  In the
Adirondacks, the percentage of acidic lakes is significantly higher when it includes smaller lakes (26 percent) than when it includes only the 
target size lakes (14 percent).<p>
     The acidification problem in both the United States and Canada grows in magnitude if "episodic acidification" (brief periods of low pH
levels from snowmelt or heavy downpours) is taken into account.  Lakes and streams throughout the United
States, including high elevation western lakes, are sensitive to episodic acidification.  In the Mid-Appalachians, the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain, and
the Adirondack Mountains, many additional lakes and streams become temporarily acidic during storms and snowmelt.  Episodic
acidification can cause large scale "fish kills."<p>
     For example, approximately 70 percent of sensitive lakes in the Adirondacks are at risk of episodic acidification.
This amount is over three times the amount of chronically acidic lakes.  In the mid-Appalachians, approximately 30 percent of sensitive streams are likely
to become acidic during an episode.  This level is seven times the number of chronically acidic streams in that area.<p>
     Acid rain control will produce significant benefits in terms of lowered surface water acidity.  If acidic deposition levels were to remain
constant over the next 50 years (the time frame used for projection models), the acidification rate of lakes in the Adirondacks that are larger
than 10 acres would rise by 50 percent or more.  Scientists predict, however, that the decrease in SO2 emissions required by the Acid Rain
Program will significantly reduce acidification due to atmospheric sulfur. Without the reductions in SO2 emissions, the proprotionjs of acidic
aquatic systems in sensitive ecosystems would remain high or dramatically worsen.<p>
     The impact of nitrogen on surface waters is also critical.  Nitrogen plays a significant role in episodic acidification and new research 
recognizes the importance of nitrogen in long-term chronic acidification as well.  Furthermore, the adverse impact of atmospheric nitrogen deposition on 
estuaries and other large water bodies may be significant.  For example, 30 to 40 percent of the nitrogen in the Chesapeake Bay comes from atmospheric
deposition.  Nitrogen is an important factor in causing eutrophication (oxygen depletion) of water bodies.<p>
<a name="forests"></a>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<H3>Forests</H3>
<hr>
   Acid rain has been implicated in contributing to forest degradation, especially in high-elevation spruce trees that populate the ridges of
the Appalachian Mountains from Maine to Georgia, including national park areas such as the Shenandoah and
Great Smokey Mountain national parks.  Acidic deposition seems to impair the trees' growth in several ways;
for example, acidic cloud water at high elevations may increase the susceptibility of the red spruce to winter injury.<p>
   There also is a concern about the impact of acid rain on forest soils.  There is good reason to believe that
long-term changes in the chemistry of some sensitive soils may have already occurred as a result of acid rain. 
As acid rain moves through the soils, it can strip away vital plant nutrients through chemical reactions, thus
posing a potential threat to future forest productivity.
<a name="visibility"></a>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Visibility</h3>
<hr>
   Sulfur dioxide emissions lead to the formation of sulfate particles in the atmosphere.  Sulfate particles account
for more than 50 percent of the visibility reduction in the eastern part of the United States, affecting our
enjoyment of national parks, such as the Shenandoah and the Great Smoky Mountains.  The Acid Rain Program
is expected to improve the visual range in the eastern U.S. by 30 percent.  Based on a study of the value national park
visitors place on visibility, the visual range improvements expected at national parks of the eastern United States
due to the Acid Rain Program's SO2 reductions will be worth a billion dollars by the year 2010.  In the western
part of the United States, nitrogen and carbon also play roles, but sulfur has been implicated as an important
source of visibility impairment in many of the Colorado River Plateau national parks, including the Grand
Canyon, Canyonlands, and Bryce Canyon.<p>
<a name="materials"></a>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<hr>
   Acid rain and the dry deposition of acidic particles are  known to contribute to the corrosion of metals and
deterioration of stone and paint on buildings, cultural objects, and cars.  The corrosion seriously depreciates the
objects' value to society.  Dry deposition of acidic compounds can also dirty buildings and other structures,
leading to increased maintenance costs. To reduce damage to automotive paint caused by acid rain and acidic dry
deposition, some manufacturers use acid-resistant paints, at an average cost of $5 for each new vehicle (or a
total of $61 million per year for all new cars and trucks sold in the U.S.)  The Acid Rain Program will reduce
damage to materials by limiting SO2 emissions.  The benefits of the Acid Rain Program are measured, in
part, by the costs now paid to repair or prevent damage--the costs of repairing buildings, using acid-resistant
paints on new vehicles, plus the value that society places on the details of a statue lost forever to acid rain.
<a name="health"></a>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Health</h3>
<hr>
  Based on health concerns, SO2 has historically been regulated under the Clean Air Act.  Sulfur dioxide
interacts in the atmosphere to form sulfate aerosols, which may be transported long distances through the air. 
Most sulfate aerosols are particles that can be inhaled.  In the eastern United States, sulfate aerosols make up
about 25 percent of the inhalable particles.  According to recent studies at Harvard and New York Universities,
higher levels of sulfate aerosols are associated with increased morbidity (sickness) and mortality from lung
disorders, such as asthma and bronchitis.  By lowering sulfate aerosol levels, the Acid Rain Program will
reduce the incidence and the severity of asthma and bronchitis. When fully implemented by the year 2010,
the public health benefits of the Acid Rain
Program will be significant, due to decreased mortality, hospital admissions,
and emergency room visits.<p>
     Decreases in nitrogen oxide emissions are also expected to have a beneficial impact on health effects by reducing the
nitrate component of inhalable particulates and reducing the nitrogen oxides available to react with 
volatile organic compounds and form ozone.  Ozone impacts on human health include a number of morbidity and 
mortality risks associated with lung disorders.
<hr>
<h3>Clean Air for Better Life</h3>
<hr>
   By reducing SO2 emissions by such a significant amount, the Clean Air Act promises to confer numerous
benefits on the nation.  Scientists project that the 10 million-ton reduction in SO2 emissions should significantly
decrease or slow down the acidification of water bodies and will reduce stress to forests.  In addition, visibility will be significantly
improved due to the reductions, and the lifespan of building materials and structures of cultural importance should
lengthen.  Finally, the reductions in emissions will help to protect public health.

<title>Wind Plants of the Netherlands</title>

<head><b><h1>Wind Plants of the Netherlands</h1></b></head><p>

<body>

For a nation known worldwide for its mastery of the wind in 

the eighteenth century, modern wind technology got off to a 

slow start in the Netherlands. Wind energy has finally begun 

to grow in the Netherlands after being stymied for nearly a 

decade by mis-guided government programs.<p>



Despite the highest population density outside Bangladesh, 

the Netherlands has one of the worlds' most ambitious wind 

programs. Officially the Netherlands is striving to install 

1,000 MW of wind generating capacity by the year 2000. 

Unfortunately only 200 MW will be installed by the end of 

1995 and it's likely the Dutch will miss their target..<p>

The polder mill <i>Goliath</i> frames a modern wind turbine 

on land reclaimed from the sea near Eemshaven in the Dutch 

province of Groningen. The 26-meter diameter Micon (250 kW) 

turbine is the last in a string of 40 identical turbines on 

an interior dike near the gas-fired power station at Eemshaven.<p>

<title>Wind Plants of Yorkshire, England</title>

<head><b><h1>Wind Plants of Yorkshire, England</h1></b></head><p>

<body>

Though Britain has the best wind resources in Europe, wind development 

only began in earnest in the early 1990s when dairyman Peter Edwards 

installed ten wind turbines on his farm in Cornwall. Subsequently, most 

development in the United Kingdom has been concentrated in England, 

Wales, and Cornwall. <p>



There is currently 170 MW of installed capacity, but the third tranche 

of Britain's Non Fossil Fuel Obligation has awarded contracts for 300 

MW of new wind power plants in England and Wales. Another 100 MW of 

contracts were awarded in Scotland.<p>

 

<center><img align=bottom src="ukroyd.gif"><p>

<h3>Car Park at Royd Moor</h3></center><p>



Tourists enjoying a beautiful summer evening on Royd Moor. The car 

park (parking lot) provides a comfortable place for viewing the 13 

Bonus 450 kW wind turbines on the site in the southern Pennine chain. 

The hill top site offers spectacular views of southern Yorkshire. The 

37-meter turbines stand in two rows on the paddock. <p>



Wind development in Britain is following a far different pattern from 

that in California or elsewhere in Europe. Unlike northern Europe, where most of the wind turbines are being installed singly or in small clusters, wind turbines have been installed in 

England and Wales in small wind power plants of 10 to 100 turbines. These wind plants are far smaller than those in California where it's not uncommon to install 300 turbines at one time.<p>



British wind plants are models of uncluttered, aesthetically pleasing 

development. Many, such as this one on Royd Moor, include car parks 

for visitors, and provide access for ramblers (hikers). <p>

<TITLE>NEPP Chapter 5</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>Chapter 5: Invest in Science and Technology Advances</H2>
<HR><P>
<I>(Note: Figures referenced in this chapter have not been included at this time.)</I>
<P>
Advances in science and technology contribute to the Nation's goals of economic growth, environmental quality, and national security. The Administration is pursuing a broad agenda of scientific research and technology development, effectively using national assets such as the national laboratory system and ensuring that scientific discoveries and technological advances move rapidly into U.S. and global markets.<BR>
<P>
Science and technology provide the essential foundation for economic prosperity. Investments in research and development (R&D) that spawn new technologies increase long-term productivity and high-wage job growth. This is especially true for energy technologies. Basic technologies, such as the electric motor, the internal combustion engine, and <a name="ifl"></a>incandescent and fluorescent lighting, have had a profound effect on the way we live and work today. Emerging technologies, like<a name="cells"></a>fuel cells, photovoltaics, <a name="gels"></a>aerogels, and <a name="wave"></a>radio-wave lighting, may have an equally profound effect on the way Americans live in the next century. <BR>
<P>
The technologies that we use to transform energy and materials into goods and services affect the amount of natural resources consumed, the types and amount of wastes produced, and the proportion of high-paying, high-tech jobs created in the economy. Because energy is so important to economic progress, energy R&D provides some of the highest national paybacks available for public expenditure. Advances in energy science and technology are critical to achieving the long-term economic, environmental, and national security goals of this Nation.<BR>
<P>
The Administration's science and technology policy emphasizes effective investments in energy R&D that will keep America in the forefront of providing sustainable energy technology for domestic and global markets. The demand for solutions through science and technology will only become more acute as the world population increases and competition for limited resources intensifies. Recent projections suggest that world demand for energy could increase by 50 percent over the next 25 years,5 and energy R&D must respond to these global pressures and opportunities. <BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="5.1">The Federal Role in Supporting Science and Technology</H4></a>
The Federal Government has traditionally supported a balanced portfolio of basic and applied research in a variety of disciplines. That balance is evident in energy R&D, where Federal support ranges from conducting long-term and high-risk energy research to assisting technology development and facilitating rapid diffusion of new technologies into the marketplace.<BR>
<P>
The Administration's energy R&D agenda is part of the larger national policy framework.  This policy framework is rooted in a strong belief that basic science provides the essential underpinnings for technology advances and that government can play a critical role in accelerating the development and deployment of technologies that serve the Nation's economic, environmental, and national security needs.<BR>
<P>
Whether conducted by private firms or government, R&D is an investment in the future and must compete with current spending priorities. Industry is the largest supporter of R&D in the Nation, providing about 52 percent of the total national R&D investment. However, it is estimated that more than 95 percent of the $107 billion industry will spend on R&D in 1995 will be for very low-risk projects. <BR>
<P>
While the private sector has always been more focused on near-term R&D, it is increasingly relinquishing its sponsorship of more basic and long-term research. Troublesome trends in private-sector R&D suggest that government must maintain its robust commitment to basic and applied R&D if the Nation is to retain its status as the world leader in energy-related science and technology. The recent Yergin Task Force report concludes that private-sector R&D in energy and energy-related areas has declined substantially over the past 10 years. At the same time, R&D spending by U.S. firms has shifted sharply toward near-term development (See Figure 16).<BR>
<P>
The Government must partner with industry to maintain the long-term research base that will support tomorrow's applied R&D by offsetting ominous trends toward shorter R&D time horizons. Federal support will help the United States remain competitive in the large and growing domestic and international market for sustainable, productivity-enhancing technologies. The cornerstone of the Administration's strategy is expansion and improvement in peer-reviewed competitive research, placing a high priority on cost-shared partnerships at all levels of applied R&D in efficient end-use energy technologies, renewable energy systems, fossil-fuel combustion systems, and nuclear technologies. Stakeholder involvement throughout the planning process provides the link to the marketplace. In an era of constrained Federal budgets, the Administration continues to pursue innovative efforts to enhance and leverage national science and technology assets.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="5.2">Basic Science and Energy Research: Building a Foundation for a Sustainable Energy Future</H4></a>
Advances in basic science improve our understanding of real-world phenomena and provide the basis for both revolutionary breakthroughs in technology and informed national policies that anticipate and mitigate the effects of energy choices on society. But such basic advances in knowledge or technology are not adequately rewarded in the market. The Administration continues its firm commitment to basic science and energy research where long-term potential for great scientific discovery compensates for a lack of immediate commercial interest.<BR>
<P>
Under this guiding premise, seven areas of basic research are of particular importance in helping to find new ways to conserve resources, develop new energy sources, control pollution, reduce waste in manufacturing, assess and predict the impacts of global climate change, develop innovative approaches to cleaning up hazardous waste sites, and to define the long-term human health and environmental risks from energy production and use. The seven basic research areas are the following:<BR>
<P>
Materials Science. New discoveries about the nature and properties of materials will result in significant energy savings and productivity gains. Research sponsored by the Department of Energy has resulted in such breakthroughs as metallic glasses; pollution-preventing lead-free solder; materials that offer superior properties for corrosion resistance, welding and joining, and high-rate and superplastic metal forming; solar photovoltaic cells; high-temperature ceramics and ceramic matrix composites; lightweight materials for batteries and fuel cells; and high-temperature alloys and superconducting materials.<BR>
<P>
Geosciences. Research focused on the behavior and properties of the outermost layers of the Earth's crust has contributed significantly to the development of underground imaging, computer modeling, experimental simulation, and remote sensing. These advances are critical to the discovery of new energy resources and the enhanced recovery of existing reserves, ranging from conventional fossil fuels to alternative energy sources such as geothermal and gas hydrides. <BR>
<P>
Energy Biosciences. Energy-related biotechnologies show great promise for improving energy productivity and environmental performance. Developing tomorrow's energy-related biotechnologies requires improving our basic understanding of biological processes. Research focuses on the basic mechanisms affecting plant productivity, conversion of biomass and other organic materials into fuels and chemicals by microbial systems, and the ability of biological systems to replace energy-intensive processes.<BR>
<P>
Chemical Sciences. Critical research into chemical properties and interactions provides insight into the chemistry involved in combustion processes, enabling increased combustion efficiency and improved environmental performance, as well as the development of new catalysts and catalytic processes. Catalytic processes help produce nearly 75 percent of chemical and petroleum products (by dollar value), and they are central to the prevention and remediation of environmental pollution and the conversion of solar energy to clean hydrogen fuels.<BR>
<P>
Biological and Environmental Science. Research on the environmental, physical, and safety risks related to the development and use of energy can help policymakers identify, understand, and anticipate the health and environmental effects of energy use. Fundamental research in physical, chemical, and biological processes contributes to the development of advanced monitoring and analysis systems that provide the foundation for addressing major biological, medical, and environmental problems.<BR>
<P>
Supercomputing and Modeling. Advancing the state of the art in computational techniques, such as the use of massively parallel supercomputing, can help probe basic questions regarding the effects of energy systems on the environment as well as aid research into new techniques and methods of energy production and conversion. These efforts can help solve mysteries both "large" (for example, by analyzing environmental and climatic phenomenon) and "small" (such as by developing and analyzing advanced materials at the molecular and subatomic levels and mapping the human genome).<BR>
<P>
Future Energy Sources. Research into fundamentally new, advanced energy sources such as hydrogen technologies and fusion energy can have substantial future payoffs. Because of ongoing research, hydrogen may serve someday as an energy carrier like electricity or as an end-use fuel like natural gas, or both. Similarly, the Nation's fusion program has made steady progress and last year set a record of producing 10.7 megawatts of power output at a test reactor supported by the Department of Energy. This development has significantly enhanced the prospects for demonstrating the scientific feasibility of fusion power, moving us one step closer to making this energy source available sometime in the next century.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="5.3">Technology Research and Development: Linking Science to Sustainable Energy Goals</H4></a>
Advances in science provide a critical foundation for a sustainable energy future, particularly as subsequent technology developments help maximize energy productivity, prevent pollution, and enhance national security. Strengthening the linkage between science and the market is important, not to displace the impetus of private R&D efforts but rather to accelerate the introduction of knowledge and technologies that respond to the Nation's goals and to the needs of markets. Appropriate partnerships with the private sector, and other methods to enhance the linkage between science and the marketplace, can maximize the contribution of Federal investments in science and technology research to attain sustainable energy goals.<BR>
<P>
Many of the specific technologies that are critical for a sustainable energy future are described elsewhere in this document. The overall strategy that motivates the Administration's technology R&D portfolio reflects the goals established in the Energy Policy Act of 1992<a name="box"></a>. Three other operational goals also guide our research agenda:<BR>
<P>
<ul><li>Encourage holistic, systems-level processes and technologies that support integrated resource efficiency, pollution prevention, and industrial ecology. These emerging concepts and techniques require industrywide participation in creative partnerships with government agencies to get beyond the pilot stage. If widely adopted, they have the potential to change the landscape of industrial America.<BR>
<P>
<li>Develop appropriate cost-sharing arrangements with industry to speed the development of specific technologies that increase energy efficiency, increase the use of clean-burning natural gas, and enhance the performance and lower the cost of renewable energy sources and other supply technologies that are smaller, cheaper, and less polluting. These programs focus on technologies with the highest potential payback from the standpoint of multiple national energy goals, where the private sector is less capable of providing the necessary R&D resources and where cost sharing ensures a high probability of market acceptance.<BR>
<P>
<li>Maintain leadership in technology research for future energy resource options that have not reached the commercial stage but hold the most promising long-term economic, environmental, and national security gains. For example, continued research into technologies that could accelerate the adoption of hydrogen energy systems could someday revolutionize the way we produce, distribute, store, and use energy.</ul>
<H4><a name="5.4">Enhancing and Leveraging National Assets</H4></a>
The U.S. science and technology enterprise is the largest in the world and has been recognized as one of the Nation's premier assets, a treasure that we must sustain and build on for the future. The scope of this scientific establishment is truly impressive, and it includes public and private institutions, individual researchers, and facilities and instrumentation located throughout the Nation. These investments in the capacity to do long-term, fundamental research deliver a steady stream of new knowledge and maintain our global leadership in science and technology. The Administration's policy is to continue strong support for strategic national science and technology assets, so they can serve our needs today and respond to the challenges of tomorrow.<BR>
<P>
In these times of constrained budgets, the Administration is ensuring that the national science and technology enterprise will meet our Nation's future needs by finding and adopting new and better ways to leverage scarce resources. These include pursuing tighter linkages between our public-sector, university-based, and private-sector research; collaborating with other nations on large-scale scientific initiatives; and coordinating and streamlining the Federal research system to maximize efficiency.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="5.5">The National Laboratories</H4></a>
The Department of Energy's national laboratories make up the largest research system of its kind in the world and form the backbone of the Nation's scientific and technological enterprise. They offer the expertise of 18,000 engineers and scientists performing world-class research in the pursuit of national security, an affordable, sustainable and productive energy future, and enhanced environmental quality. These laboratories feature centralized, generally large-scale facilities that perform R&D for which there is a strong public purpose and that cannot be maintained by academia or the private sector.<BR>
<P>
More than 15,000 industry, university, and government-sponsored scientists currently conduct unique, cutting-edge experiments at state-of-the-art Federal research facilities, including high energy and nuclear physics accelerators, neutron and light sources, and smaller facilities such as electron microscopy centers. The demand for the use of facilities such as the Department of Energy's accelerators for high energy and nuclear physics research, neutron sources, magnetic fusion facilities' supercomputers, and synchrotron light sources exceeds their availability. The Department's synchrotron light sources, alone, are used by more than 3,000 government, university, and private-sector researchers each year for work in the areas of semiconductors, polymers, alloys, superconductors, magnetic materials, structural biology, and pharmaceuticals. Administration policy encourages increasing access to these highly sought-after resources by providing additional funding to increase significantly and immediately the experimentation time available to researchers.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="5.6">The University Research Infrastructure</H4></a>
University capabilities are another important component of the Nation's science and technology assets. Universities are critical to maintaining our science and technology leadership because of their primary role in educating the next generation of scientists and engineers, their ability to provide low-cost, high-quality research, and their relative freedom from national security-related barriers to the flow of knowledge. While the national laboratories excel at "big science" and in areas where the ability to form large interdisciplinary research teams is essential, universities contribute substantially to the Nation's other important science goals. Research and development conducted at U.S. universities accounted for 5.7 percent of the total fiscal year 1993 R&D expenditures of $160.8 billion. The Department of Energy's direct investments in the universities are complemented by its support for the national user facilities at national laboratories. <BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="5.7">Maintaining Science and Technology Excellence</H4></a>
The intellectual resources of our national laboratories and the larger scientific community are far too valuable for future generations to lose. The Administration is committed to preserving national research capabilities through continued support of the research infrastructure. Key strategic areas needing support include robotics, alloys, ceramics, semiconductors, fuel cells, building technologies, bioremediation, batteries, and biomass and other renewable energy resources, in addition to the more traditional fields of high energy physics and nuclear physics.<BR>
<P>
Continued success in meeting our national science, energy, national security, and environmental quality goals also depends on the quality and quantity of our scientific and technical workforce. Thus, science, mathematics, and engineering education is a key component of maintaining U.S. excellence in science and technology and, by extension, international economic and technological competitiveness.<BR>

Linking, Coordinating, Streamlining. The National Science and Technology Council is the primary vehicle used to coordinate the use of the Nation's R&D infrastructure to meet current needs. Through the use of this structure, for example, the Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce are effectively coordinating their activities with the three major U.S. automakers and their supplier companies in the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, and the Department of Energy coordinates biofuels research with the Department of Agriculture. In addition, advances in information technology are creating new opportunities to link the research capabilities at each of the national laboratories to each other and to the university and private-sector R&D community. <BR>
<P>
Focusing on National Needs, Revisiting Structural Relationships. Changing world and domestic conditions present increasing challenges for successfully leveraging our national science and technology assets. In response to these realities, and with input from a variety of sources, the Administration is moving to strategically align science and technology actions with our national security, environmental quality, and economic productivity goals. This alignment will end unnecessary redundancies within the Federal science and technology enterprise and will yield savings by reforming contract and procurement practices, by reducing layers of management, and by privatizing, delegating, or eliminating assets that are no longer critical to the Nation's needs.<BR>
<P>
International Collaborations. Encouraging international collaboration on a variety of larger scale, high-cost, and experimental facilities is one way to leverage our Nation's research capabilities in selected areas. Although international collaboration on R&D projects risks diffusion of control of the research focus and many user facilities are already overburdened by excess demand, there are nonetheless great opportunities for the United States to share information, costs, and expertise with the larger international community<a href="ch7.html"> (See Chapter 7).<BR></a>
<P>
<H4><a name="5.8">Access and Communication: Capitalizing on Science Investments</H4></a>
To be more effective in bringing the results of scientific research and technology development to the market and to <a name="nation"></a>help our Nation capitalize on R&D investments</a>, Administration policy emphasizes communication and cooperation among public- and private-sector participants. Building on prior Administrations' efforts to improve technology transfer, the Administration is taking further steps to enhance cooperation among States, local governments, and community resources. The goal is to bring science and technology to successful market application through the formation of a seamless network of information and service providers.<BR>
<P>
This more decentralized approach to leveraging existing infrastructure will ensure that Federal science and technology, coupled with private-sector and university science and technology, will quickly find its way into the marketplace. Specifically, the Administration is working to improve the communication and possible synergy across the continuum of basic science, applied R&D, and commercial development by;<BR>
<P>
<ul><li>Making scientific results and breakthroughs more accessible to applied researchers for conversion to technologies<BR>
<P>
<li>Improving public access to information on new technologies<BR>
<P>
<li>Improving access to and the quality of science, mathematics, and engineering education<BR>
<P>
<li>Providing scientists with feedback on market needs and demands<BR>
<P>
<li>Improving industry access to cooperative technology programs of State and local governments, which are investing close to $400 million per year in these efforts.</ul>
 
R&D partnerships are an important vehicle for bringing scientists, engineers, and commercial developers together in productive undertakings. Large partnerships and R&D consortia offer extremely high leverage in bridging the gap between basic science and commercial products to benefit U.S. industry and the Nation. The traditional linear model of the research, development, and demonstration continuum has given way to a more enlightened and realistic model that integrates basic science, applied research, and commercial development into a blended, iterative process with better feedback from consumers and users throughout the process. This system relies on "real time" interactions among the participants, each bringing his or her own unique perspectives to problem solving.</BODY><HR>

<H2>Chapter 7: Engage the International Market</H2>
<HR><P>
<I>(Note: Figures referenced in this chapter have not been included at this time.)</I>
<P>
The fundamental goals of U.S. energy policy are to maximize energy productivity, prevent pollution, and help shield our Nation from global energy risks. Promoting these goals internationally can ensure U.S. economic competitiveness and create new export markets for U.S. energy technologies and services. Global economic development depends on international markets that support reliable, secure, affordable, and clean energy systems. All nations, including the United States, benefit from effective international engagement that promotes a global sustainable energy future. <BR>
<P>
Energy demand worldwide will continue to grow with population and economic activity. This is especially true in the developing countries, where potential increases in energy consumption per capita are large. The Energy Information Administration now expects energy consumption in the developing countries to almost equal that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries by 2010 (see Figure 17). Other forecasts suggest that energy use in the non-OECD countries could rise to 60 percent or more of total world consumption by 2020.8 Fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), which currently account for 87 percent of primary world energy consumption, will comprise the bulk of the growth in energy demand, especially in the developing countries. If current patterns of energy production continue over the next several decades, carbon dioxide emissions will grow roughly in line with energy consumption. Finally, the concentration of available world oil resources in the Middle East will lead to a growing dependence upon that volatile region to supply the world's oil needs.<BR>
<P>
The Administration's policy is to protect U.S. security interests, ensure U.S. economic competitiveness, and create new markets for U.S. exports, while working to limit global environmental damage from international energy development. This is implemented through policies of multilateral cooperation to coordinate energy and environmental goals, as well as policies that support the competitive position of U.S. industries abroad.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="7.1">Coordinating International Energy and Environmental Policy</H4></a>
A more integrated global economy and the global aspects of many environmental issues increase the value of international cooperation in policy development and implementation. The Administration actively engages other countries, on a bilateral or multilateral basis where appropriate, to strengthen international energy policies and to counter global environmental threats. The Department of Energy conducts the bulk of these activities, interacting with its cabinet- or ministerial-level counterparts in industrialized and developing countries.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="7.2">Strengthening Energy Policies Here and Abroad</H4></a>
The Administration promotes global energy markets by encouraging developing countries to adopt policies that will encourage private investment in energy projects, support the free and efficient operation of energy markets, and remove barriers to investment by U.S. firms in these markets. U.S. participation in bilateral and multilateral forums aids these efforts. The United States also provides advice and assistance to countries in the privatization and opening of their energy sectors to investment by U.S. firms. Examples of actions taken by the Administration to further international energy policy goals include the following:<BR>
<P>
<ul><li>The Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission Energy Committee. This body has encouraged the Russian government to create a commercial and legislative framework to attract international participation in oil and gas resource development, which will strengthen the commercial presence of U.S. energy companies in Russia. Russian oil production has declined from its peak of 11.7 million barrels per day in 1987 to about 6.3 million barrels per day in 1994. The Russian Federation is now considering legislation on oil and gas production sharing agreements and amendments to its underground resources law. By actively promoting the adoption of a stable policy environment that will encourage foreign participation, the Administration is helping the Russians to maximize oil and gas recovery in an efficient and environmentally benign way.<BR>
<P>
<li>Financing. U.S. and multilateral lending agencies have made available loans, grants, and insurance totaling roughly $6 billion to Russia, central Europe, and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. <BR>
<P>
<li>The Summit of the Americas.  At the Summit of the Americas in December 1994, 34 democratically elected leaders of the Western Hemisphere agreed to adopt sustainable energy policies emphasizing energy efficiency and development of indigenous conventional and renewable energy resources. The summit countries and the private sector will initiate cooperative actions to increase access to reliable, clean, and least-cost energy services through activities and projects that meet economic, social, and environmental requirements within the context of national sustainable development goals and national legal frameworks.</ul>
<H4><a name="7.3">Preparing for Global Energy Supply Disruptions</H4></a>
A recent Commerce Department study concluded that our country's heavy reliance on imported oil threatens to impair our national security. Policies that effectively deal with potential disruptions in international oil markets can reduce economic and security risks. The Administration's current policy relies on market forces to allocate supply in the event of a disruption and would supplement supply through an early drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in large volumes and in coordination with our allies and trading partners.<BR>
<P>
The Clinton Administration recently moved to strengthen U.S. energy security policy by reviewing and reaffirming U.S. policy for responding to oil supply disruptions. The effectiveness of any U.S. response to an oil disruption is greatly enhanced by multilateral coordination with our trading partners. Since its creation in 1974, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has developed effective response mechanisms for limiting economic losses from disruptions in world oil supplies. The United States has worked with the IEA to encourage members to establish emergency oil reserves and to coordinate emergency response measures and information dissemination. The Administration recently succeeded in amending IEA policy for addressing oil disruptions by expressing a preference for market-oriented response measures to replace the outdated international oil-allocation system that has been in place for nearly two decades.<BR>
<P>
A key strategy of the U.S. Government is to prepare for energy emergencies by maintaining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at levels adequate to reduce macroeconomic impacts and price increases that result from oil supply disruptions. The U.S. Government recognizes the global dimensions of energy supplies and works within the IEA framework to encourage crude oil stockpiling so that global markets are more resistant to supply shocks. The current inventory in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is 592 million barrels of crude oil, equal to 74 days of net imports. The current drawdown capacity is 3.1 million barrels per day, with a goal of 3.9 million barrels by 1998. <BR>
<P>
The final element of the Administration's program of guarding against disruptions is to provide accurate and timely information to enhance the transparency and functioning of markets-a key to energy and economic stability. To meet this need, the United States works with other nations to monitor and analyze domestic and international energy supply events. The goal is to track potential or emerging situations and to ensure widespread exchange and dissemination of information on market situations to combat price fluctuations caused by rumor.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="7.4">Responding to Global Environmental Challenges</H4></a>
In response to the increasingly global nature of environmental degradation, governments are cooperating to develop strategies for addressing international environmental issues. In the last decade, global agreements have been reached that address ozone depletion, climate change, biodiversity, and international shipments of hazardous waste. The trend toward international agreements to protect the environment reflects both the transboundary character of the pollution damage and the need to establish environmental protection measures that treat trade competitors fairly. Given the environmental impacts of energy production and use in countries around the world, energy policy plays a key role in international discussions. Where global environmental risks warrant international solutions, the Administration pursues strong, fair, and balanced approaches in cooperation with other nations.<BR>
<P>
Several principles guide the U.S. approach to addressing international environmental problems. First, policies should be based on sound scientific evidence. Second, responses should be based on international cooperation and include the participation of all countries concerned. Third, environmental protection measures taken under international cooperative arrangements should be cost-effective and use market mechanisms. Finally, technology development programs should emphasize products and services that could address environmental problems in the context of market development and export opportunities for U.S. technologies. <BR>
<P>
Framework Convention on Climate Change. The link between global energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and potential impacts on the Earth's climate requires effective international solutions. The Administration has led international efforts to make the Framework Convention a strong and relevant institution. The Convention entered into force in March 1994, and the first Conference of the Parties to the Convention took place in Berlin in March 1995. The U.S. Government has been an active participant in developing proposals for the operation of the Convention, which requires that parties periodically review the adequacy of existing commitments. While the Administration believes that new steps need to be taken to fulfill the objective of the Convention-the stabilization of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at levels that would not dangerously interfere with the natural climate system-the U.S. delegation has made it clear that steps should be taken by all parties to the Convention, involve all greenhouse gases, all sources and sinks, as well as all economic sectors.<BR>
<P>
Toward this end, the United States has led the international effort to establish an international "joint implementation" pilot program. Joint implementation is a mechanism by which parties will be able to share emissions reduction activities. For example, a developed country could invest in emissions reductions in a developing country where reductions are far less expensive than in the developed country and where host countries could gain the advantages of the technology transfer. The Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency are comanagers of the U.S. pilot program called the U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation. This program made its first-round selection of projects for inclusion in the initiative in February 1995.<BR>
<P>
Cooperation on Joint Implementation. The U.S. Government has signed a number of statements of intent to cooperate on joint implementation projects that would reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases, while attracting private investment for sustainable development. Agreements have been signed with India, Pakistan, Costa Rica, and Chile. Negotiations are under way for a regional statement of intent with the Central American countries.<BR>
<P>
Cooperation on Climate Change Through the U.S. Country Studies Program. The U.S. Government is helping other signatories to the Framework Convention to meet their commitments through the U.S. Country Studies Program. This interagency program supports financial and technical assistance for 55 studies of developing countries and countries in transition that do not have the financial and technical resources to develop their own inventories of greenhouse gases, which is required by the Convention. The countries also are encouraged to look at their vulnerabilities to climate change, possible adaptation measures in sectors such as agriculture and forestry, and mitigation actions that could involve fuel switching and increased use of energy efficiency in all sectors of their economies. <BR>
<P>
Convention on the Law of the Sea. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which entered into force in November 1994, has important implications for U.S. energy needs. The continental shelf provisions of the convention serve U.S. interests both in regard to oil and gas development off our coast as well as the interests of U.S. companies operating abroad. The navigation provisions of the convention-innocent passage in the territorial sea, transit passage in straits used for international navigation, and archipelagic sealane passage in legal archipelagoes-are essential to the transportation of oil and gas resources.<BR>
<P>
The Administration led efforts to reform the deep seabed part of the convention in 1994, correcting the fundamental flaws that resulted in nonsignature by the United States in the early 1980s and opening the way to U.S. accession. The convention and the amending deep seabed mining agreement now await Senate advice and consent to accession and ratification by the United States.
<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="7.5">Exporting Our Success: U.S. Technology for Sustainable Development</H4></a>
One of the most important challenges facing the United States over the next decade will be to compete effectively in international markets for energy and related environmental technologies. Energy industries are a vital component of the Administration's export policies. These industries help the Nation to maintain technological leadership through research, development, and demonstration initiatives, and to compete in international markets that support high-technology, high-wage jobs for market winners. Maintaining the U.S. share of international energy markets will require strong, coordinated, effective support from the Federal Government. Not only will these exports create high-paying jobs in the United States, but the technologies most likely to gain international market shares can also strengthen our own economy and increase our standard of living. <BR>
<P>
In working toward sustainable international energy development, the Administration will encourage continued improvement of alternative energy and energy-efficiency technologies; worldwide use of U.S. energy technologies; broad dissemination of environmental technologies; and strong partnerships with energy officials around the world. This strategy will lead to ever-expanding deployment of these highly competitive, efficient, and environmentally sound U.S. technologies.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="7.6">Promoting Sustainable Global Energy Markets</H4></a>
As the economies of the developing world industrialize, higher incomes create demand for modern consumer technologies. Because of both industrialization and consumer demands, energy systems in these countries will need to expand rapidly to keep pace with increased energy needs. The estimated international market potential for U.S. energy technologies is more than $200 billion through 2010 <a name="table"></a>.<BR>
<P>
Concern for environmental issues will also affect the competitiveness of energy technologies. Expanding use of alternative energy technologies such as wind, solar, biomass, and other non-fossil fuel technologies is gradually leading to improvements in the technologies and to cost reductions. The international market for these technologies will gradually expand over the next decade, accelerating cost improvements that will benefit both their manufacturers and their domestic users.<BR>
<P>
The deployment of state-of-the-art energy technologies can provide countries with an important boost to diversify their energy consumption and to use resources more efficiently. These technologies can be particularly helpful to developing countries where energy demand is rising rapidly. The U.S. Government works with developing and newly privatizing nations to promote energy strategies that encourage markets for alternative energy supplies, including natural gas and renewables. <BR>
<P>
The United States is a recognized leader in the manufacture of many state-of-the-art energy technologies. Technology projects developed to meet opportunities overseas can also be used back home, thereby increasing the competitiveness of domestic industries. By partnering with domestic industry and foreign countries, the U.S. Government can demonstrate environmentally sound and clean energy technologies abroad, providing information and trade opportunities to advance export markets for U.S. technologies. These partnerships also enable developing countries to provide affordable energy to their citizens and to reduce the environmental degradation that accompanies many energy production and end-use processes.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="7.7">Competing in International Technology Markets</H4></a>
Fierce commercial competition is beginning to dominate both domestic and foreign markets. Combined with strong support for their exporting firms, our traditional competitors are expanding their commitment to research, development, and demonstration. The newly industrializing countries of Asia are gaining market shares in many product lines, and countries such as China and Russia soon could become major players in the international marketplace. <BR>
<P>
President Clinton announced the National Export Strategy in October 1993, which provides a roadmap for expanding U.S. exports to foreign markets. The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee has identified the energy and environmental industrial sectors as two of the priority sectors of the U.S. economy that could provide the impetus for competitive technologies and increased exports. A followup document, Environmental Technologies Exports: Strategic Framework for U.S. Leadership, provides direction and goals for U.S. action in the area of environmental and clean energy technologies. <BR>
<P>
In addition to identifying major export sectors, the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee also identified the major markets on which the Administration's trade promotion resources are focused. These major export markets, called the big emerging markets, are the Chinese Economic Area, Indonesia, India, South Korea, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, and Poland. For the energy sector, countries with substantial energy resources, such as Russia and Venezuela, were also identified as important markets for U.S. exports. Overseas demonstration projects range from photovoltaic electricity technologies in Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia to clean coal technologies in Poland to waste remediation and pollution prevention technologies in Mexico, Russia, and Eastern Europe. <BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="7.8">Supporting U.S. Energy Technology</H4></a>
The Administration continues to work with industry to expand export opportunities for U.S. energy technologies. These efforts, which have already helped U.S. companies increase exports, provide a strong foundation for lasting commercial relationships.<BR>
<P>
Presidential Trade Missions for Sustainable Development. Presidential trade missions are coordinated by the Administration and give U.S. companies unparalleled access to energy ministries and private markets. For example, Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary led three missions during the past year: to India in July 1994, Pakistan in September 1994, and China in February 1995. These three trade missions resulted in agreements for private-sector energy projects exceeding $10 billion. These missions and followup activities promote commercial transactions that will deliver clean, affordable energy to fuel the economic growth of developing countries with U.S. technology, capital, and expertise. Long-term market success is promoted through major conferences sponsored during the missions that disseminate information about technologies available from the United States and the economic, financial, and regulatory issues that support increased trade and investment. The varied menu of technology and expertise offered will enable these countries to develop more diversified, efficient, and secure energy systems to meet their rapidly growing energy needs.<BR>
<P>
Competitive Export Financing. The financial community must be mobilized in support of U.S. firms bidding on major energy and environmental projects abroad. The Federal Government sponsors project-financing conferences and workshops in key markets, bringing project developers, decisionmakers, U.S. suppliers, and financiers together to discuss financing issues, including risk factors such as the legal and regulatory framework that underpins the projects. The Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Trade Development Administration also provide financing opportunities and insurance for U.S. exports to developing and newly privatizing countries.<BR>
<P>
Opening Markets and Removing Barriers to U.S. Exports and Services. The U.S. Government is actively involved in negotiating and monitoring international trade agreements and compliance that are critical to improving the competitiveness of U.S. energy and related industries. The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement, as well as the GATT Government Procurement Code, the Subsidies Code, and other specialized negotiations, all affect the ability of U.S. energy and environmental technology companies to enter world markets. Technical understanding of various traded technologies is key to effectively negotiating the removal of trade barriers.<BR>
<P>
Joint U.S.-Foreign Energy-Efficiency Centers. Joint energy-efficiency centers have been established in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and China. Through these institutions, the United States helps other nations develop efficiency legislation and regulations; advances U.S. technologies and methods through training and demonstrations; promotes joint ventures between U.S. companies and foreign industry; and promotes policy reform and the adoption of integrated resource planning and demand-side management.<BR>
<P>
Cost-Sharing Collaborations for Renewable Energy Systems. Several programs help promote rural electrification in countries where access to the electric grid is neither available nor economically feasible. In Brazil, Mexico, India, China, Pakistan, and Indonesia, the Administration facilitates cost-shared collaborations between U.S. companies and the host-country partners to provide cost-effective renewable energy applications for home and village-sized systems. The U.S. companies provide the technology and products, as well as community training for installation and maintenance of the systems. These pilot projects have attracted the attention of independent power producers and multilateral development banks interested in financing cost-effective renewable energy projects. At present, approximately 10 percent of energy loans to Southeast Asia go to finance renewable energy projects.</BODY><HR>

<H2>Sustainable Energy Strategy: Clean and Secure Energy for a Competitive Economy</H2>
<HR><P>
Energy is a primary mover of industrial economies, high living standards, environmental challenges, and geopolitical struggles. While clearly important in crisis situations, energy policy remains a national priority even when no immediate crisis focuses national attention. <BR>
<P>
As the Nation looks toward the 21st century, a new era is taking shape an era in which dynamic energy markets and advanced energy technologies have the potential to alleviate many of the economic, environmental, and national security concerns that have driven energy issues over the past decades. We are unlikely to realize the full potential of this new era, however, without a national energy policy that continually guides our markets and technologies toward the goals of affordable, clean, reliable, and secure energy. National policy that maximizes energy productivity, prevents pollution, and helps shield our Nation from global energy risks can improve our standard of living today and enhance our quality of life tomorrow.<BR>
<P>
This document presents  the Clinton Administration's national energy policy. The policy is built upon the bipartisan consensus that has emerged in the U.S. Congress, most recently embodied in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The policy is implemented by the Department of Energy and other Federal agencies, and it actively engages State and local government and the private sector, where much of the dynamism of our society resides.<BR>
<P>
In the United States, the private sector determines most features of energy production and use.  This is appropriate, given the poor record of direct government intervention to set prices or to allocate resources in energy markets. The Administration's energy policy emphasizes and reinforces the dominant role of the private sector and supports expanding the role of markets in several key areas.  However, there remains an important role for the Government in preventing abuse of the environment, providing some national insurance against import disruption, and conducting research and development efforts in partnership with the private sector.<BR>
<P>
The Administration pursues a rational and focused energy policy informed by past experiences both positive and negative.  By prioritizing Federal support, we bolster research and development into new energy technologies that have the potential to transform our economy and restore the environment, while cutting back funding for mature technologies and collaborating with industry to avoid "picking winners." We support privatization and extending competition in energy markets where government no longer needs to play a prominent role, but we stand behind our energy producers and technology vendors as they meet fierce competition abroad.  We are reinventing Federal environmental regulation but are firmly opposing efforts to roll back a generation of progress on protecting the environment. The Administration's energy policy reflects a common sense approach that helps both energy consumers and producers, gives a high return to the taxpayer, respects our environment, and looks toward the future.<BR>
<P>
In developing its energy policy, the Administration conducted numerous public meetings across the country to listen to the concerns and ideas of individuals and organizations most involved with energy issues, as well as citizens concerned about the energy future. A separate volume summarizes public input.<BR>
<P>
In addition to public meetings, the Departments of Energy, Commerce, State, and Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency have actively participated in the deliberations of the President's Council on Sustainable Development. This advisory body consists of Cabinet officials, business leaders, and the heads of environmental, labor, and community groups. Although the Council will submit final recommendations to the President later this year, the Administration's energy policy reflects much of the Council's efforts over the past 2 years.<BR>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's energy policy responds to the concerns of today and the challenges of tomorrow. It recognizes the interrelationship between energy, the economy, and the environment and the importance of the international marketplace to our economic future. The Administration will continue to work with Congress and the people to attain our economic, environmental, and national security goals.<BR>

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
<HR><P>
<P>
Our Nation's progress depends on our ability to use our energy resources in ways that strengthen our competitive economy, protect our environment, and keep our Nation secure. The Clinton Administration has embarked upon a sustainable energy policy that improves our standard of living today and expands our Nation's opportunities for tomorrow.<BR>
<P>
Although Americans tend to focus on energy issues only in periods of energy crises, as a Nation we should be concerned about energy at all times. Energy's continuing importance is grounded in three central facts:<BR>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Energy Fuels a Competitive Economy. Our standard of living and industrial productivity require reliable and competitively priced energy supplies. U.S. businesses and consumers directly spend more than $500 billion per year on energy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Energy Affects the Quality of the Environment. The United States has made significant strides in reducing the environmental impacts of energy production and use. These impacts include air and water pollution; nuclear, toxic, and other waste disposal; disruption of wilderness and natural ecosystems; and greenhouse gas emissions. But to make additional progress in reducing environmental risks, we need new, more cost-effective approaches to address the problems we have already tackled, along with innovative methods to counter emerging risks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Energy Affects Our National Security. Disruptions in global oil markets and energy price shocks have been followed by three recessions in the past 20 years. Energy policy can help reduce the economic and national security risks of relying on oil produced in unstable regions of the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
The concept of "sustainable development"-development that meets the needs of today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs-guides the formulation of the Administration's energy policy and motivates three strategic goals: <BR>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Maximize energy productivity to strengthen our economy and improve living standards.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Prevent pollution to reduce the adverse environmental impacts associated with energy production, delivery, and use.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Keep America secure by reducing our vulnerability to global energy market shocks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
Sustainable energy policy pursues all three goals, because actions that further one goal at the expense of the others can increase the economic, environmental, or security risks borne by future generations.
<BR><P>
 
When markets do not maximize energy productivity, adequately protect the environment, or reflect national security considerations, Administration policy aligns market forces and technology development with the goals of sustainable development. These efforts yield immediate and significant benefits for consumers and firms and lay the foundation for sustained progress.<BR>
<P>
The Administration pursues a wide range of programs to attain the goals of national energy policy. The following are the strategic components of sustainable energy policy:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Increase the Efficiency of Energy Use<a href="ch3a.html"> (Chapter 3)</a>. A fundamental tenet of sustainable development is to use resources efficiently. The Administration pursues market and technology programs that help our citizens use energy more efficiently and maximize energy productivity and value. These programs help improve  energy efficiency in all critical market segments-commercial and residential buildings, transportation, industry, utilities, and government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Develop a Balanced Domestic Energy Resource Portfolio <a href="ch4a.html">(Chapter 4)</a>. The Administration is committed to enhancing the competitiveness of domestic oil producers, expanding the role of clean, efficient, and domestically produced natural gas, encouraging the continued development of renewable energy resources, reducing the environmental impacts of coal, and maintaining the safe contribution of nuclear energy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Invest in Science and Technology Advances<a href="ch5.html"> (Chapter 5)</a>. Technological progress enables us to expand our resources, improve efficiency, and reduce the environmental impacts of producing, transporting, and consuming energy. The Administration's science and technology policy complements private sector research and development efforts with public investments in areas where the long-term economic, environmental, or social objectives are not adequately or immediately rewarded in the marketplace.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Reinvent Environmental Protection <a href="ch6.html">(Chapter 6)</a>. Americans solidly support a cleaner and healthier environment, and as a Nation, we have enjoyed substantial progress in protecting our environment and decreasing public health risks over the past two decades. By combining market forces and technology, the Administration has undertaken many initiatives to increase energy efficiency, prevent pollution, reduce costs, enhance flexibility, and strengthen accountability. Taken as a whole, these initiatives are the first steps in reinventing environmental protection to achieve a more sustainable system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Engage the International Market <a href="ch7.html">(Chapter 7)</a>. The development of international markets for energy and technology both poses risks and presents opportunities for our Nation. Through international technology and development programs, participation in multilateral activities, support for privatization and competitive markets abroad, and a strong commitment to U.S. companies that export the energy technologies that will enable sustainable development, the Administration can expand high-wage jobs in the United States and help other nations develop in ways that will ease the burden of energy development on the global environment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Chapter 1: Ensure a Competitive, Clean, and Secure Energy Future </H2>
<HR>
Our Nation's progress depends on our ability to use energy resources in ways that help the economy grow, protect the environment, and keep our Nation secure. A sustainable energy policy improves our standard of living today and expands future opportunities by maximizing energy productivity, preventing pollution, and reducing our vulnerability to global energy disruptions.<BR>
<P>
Each day, Americans depend on the benefits of energy, usually without considering the role that energy plays in our quality of life. Absent an energy crisis-lines at the gas pump or sudden blackouts-few Americans think about how national energy policy helps to improve our economy, our environment, or  our national security.<BR>
<p>
But energy is fundamental to progress, and energy policy is crucial for three main reasons: energy fuels a competitive economy, energy utilization affects the environment, and energy use may affect our national security. The need for a rational and forward-looking energy policy does not disappear when our attention to energy wanes. Indeed, a time of relative stability offers a significant opportunity to build a sustainable national energy policy-one that recognizes the links between the economy and the environment, considers the future impacts of today's decisions, and promotes investment to enhance future opportunities. As our experience with several energy crises and our ongoing concerns for the environment attest, the future does not always take care of itself. Smart policy decisions can make a difference in how well we realize our national goals.<BR>
<p>
Since January 1993, the Clinton Administration has been developing and implementing a sustainable energy policy-one that delivers real benefits to our citizens today and that expands opportunities for future generations. The Administration's policy is informed by the successes and the failures of 20 years of Federal efforts to respond to immediate energy crises. But in contrast to past approaches, the Administration has adopted a longer run perspective to fashion policy that addresses the economic, environmental, and security risks that our Nation will continue to face in the next century.<BR>
<p>
<H4><a NAME ="1.1">Energy Policy and Everyday Life</a></H4>
National energy policy affects each American every day. Consider four examples from everyday life: turning on the lights at home, filling up the tank at the gas station, adjusting a thermostat in the office, and starting a motor on the assembly line. How does energy policy affect us in these ordinary activities?<BR>
<p>
Although residential customers turning on the lights need not know whether the electricity is produced from coal, nuclear power, natural gas, or windpower, the rates they pay and the quality of the air they breathe reflect policies that influence the electric utility's choice of fuels, generating technologies, and investments in pollution controls. Sometime in the future, their bills could change as a result of proposed market reforms that could allow customers to choose their electricity supplier in the way that they choose long-distance telephone service-but analysts disagree about whether residential electric rates will rise as a result or whether competition will help keep prices down.<BR>
<p>
A motorist filling the tank may remember waiting in gas lines during the 1970s and may recall the shock of having to pay sharply rising prices for gasoline. But many people do not realize that in real terms (compared with the prices of other goods) gasoline prices now are at their lowest level since World War II, due in part to government actions to decontrol oil prices that began in the late 1970s. The gasoline the motorist is pumping was likely derived from imported crude oil, given that imports now constitute roughly half of domestic oil consumption.1,2 A decade of low world oil prices has benefited consumers but has hurt domestic oil producers and halved employment in this industry. At the same time, government regulation has spawned impressive technological advances: to drive a mile, the average motorist now uses about 60 percent of the gasoline he or she used 20 years ago, and that mile of travel now emits a minute fraction of the tailpipe emissions produced then. However, increased driving has kept gasoline consumption-and oil imports-steadily growing and has limited progress in reducing overall air pollution.<BR>
<p>
An office worker probably is unaware that many commercial building owners have invested heavily in energy-efficient heating, air-conditioning, and lighting systems that have improved working conditions while drastically lowering energy bills. Many of the new technologies-such as more thermally efficient windows-resulted from federally funded research and development efforts. Much of this investment has occurred because some regulated utilities were allowed to make a profit by helping building owners reduce energy consumption, often aided by government programs that helped owners and tenants gauge the economic benefits of energy-efficient investments.<BR>
<p>
Finally, the assembly line worker might not know that industrial motors use more than 20 percent of the electricity generated in the United States, even though current electric motors are vastly more efficient than those used just a decade ago. The company might be considering entering into a partnership with the Department of Energy to install more efficient equipment, both to save money and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. Maybe the firm also is considering generating its own electricity with process waste heat-but has shelved the plan until new rules of the market grow out of regulatory reform efforts. Or perhaps the company is examining new pollution prevention ideas, hoping to save money on environmental compliance costs if environmental rules grant it more flexibility in choosing the means of reaching pollution reduction goals.<BR>
<p>
<H4><a name="1.2">Energy and National Progress</H4></a>
The preceding examples illustrate the intrinsic importance of energy in everyday life and, when multiplied to the scale of the entire economy, how energy policy can affect our national well-being. They also reveal some of the dynamic changes that are occurring below the surface in many energy markets, some of which may accelerate in the coming years. And they vividly illuminate the three basic reasons why Americans need to be concerned about energy: our economy depends on energy, energy production and use can damage the environment, and current patterns of energy use may affect national security.<BR>
<p>
<H4><a name="1.3">Energy Fuels a Competitive Economy</H4></a>
Our standard of living and industrial productivity require reliable and competitively priced energy. In 1993, American businesses and consumers directly spent $505 billion per year on energy, or about 8 percent of the gross domestic product. Industrial facilities purchased $121 billion worth of energy every year, while the average family spent more than $2,000 per year on utility, transportation, and other fuels. At $56 billion per year, energy imports accounted for almost 10 percent of total product imports. On the other side of the ledger, U.S. firms export billions of dollars worth of energy technology, sustaining thousands of high-paying domestic jobs.<BR>
<p>
Several aspects of our energy use pose risks to our economy. Some energy markets do not perform efficiently-leading consumers and firms to spend too much money and waste energy resources. Low world oil prices have led not only to a surge in oil imports that could make some sectors vulnerable to oil price increases, but also to a major decline in the domestic oil industry. Low energy prices also have blunted the incentive to conduct long-term research to develop new, more efficient technologies that will improve the economics of energy use in the future. <BR>
<P>
<H4><a NAME ="1.4">Energy Affects the Quality of the Environment</H4></a>
The United States has made significant strides in reducing the environmental impact of energy use, relying on a regulatory system that focuses on specific energy technologies such as powerplants and automobiles. For example, although the use of fossil fuels increased 13 percent from 1975 to 1993, emissions of sulfur dioxide decreased by 22 percent and emissions of lead decreased by 97 percent. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 will further reduce many air pollutants from fossil fuel use, such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, which contribute to acid rain.<BR>
<p>
Despite the progress made in reducing some energy-related emissions, other pollutants have remained difficult and expensive to address under the existing regulatory structure and with current technology. Many of our large urban areas continue to experience regional haze and smog as a result of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted from energy use. Increasing energy use threatens to erode the progress made under the Nation's current environmental control system, while new environmental risks are emerging, such as the potential for global energy use to contribute to climate change. Increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases due to rising carbon dioxide and methane emissions from energy use are likely to alter the Earth's climate system, although scientists do not agree on the timing and nature of potential climate changes or on the scope and severity of the problems associated with a changing climate system.<BR>
<p>
To make additional progress on reducing environmental risks, the Nation needs new, more cost-effective approaches to address the problems we have already tackled, as well as innovative methods to counter emerging risks. We must develop new technologies for preventing pollution and must harness market forces more effectively in an effort to improve the U.S. and global environment.<BR>
<p>
<H4><a NAME ="1.5">Energy Affects National Security</H4></a>
Because the United States relies on oil for more than 40 percent of its energy needs, disruptions in world oil markets can have serious economic and national security implications. Energy policy has reduced, but not eliminated, the risks from relying heavily on global oil supplies concentrated in potentially unstable regions of the world. <BR>
<p>
In 1994, about 50 percent of the oil consumed in the United States was imported, a figure that could rise to more than 60 percent by 2010 according to the Energy Information Administration. By 2010, two-thirds of the oil traded on the international market will originate in the Persian Gulf, an area that has experienced conflict in recent years. <BR>
<p>
The experience of the past 20 years suggests that the international oil market is prone to disruptions and price shocks and that macroeconomic policies may aggravate the adverse effects on the U.S. economy. Even though domestic and international energy markets operate much more efficiently than was the case 20 years ago, the United States still faces economic and security risks from current patterns of oil consumption and production.<BR>
<p>
<H4><a NAME ="1.6">Goals of Sustainable Energy Policy</H4></a>
Although everyone has a stake in the energy future, energy policy tends to receive national attention only in crisis situations. But policies fashioned in response to a crisis tend to focus narrowly on the immediate predicament, while failing to recognize and deal effectively with the underlying cause of the crisis itself.<BR>
<p>
Certainly energy policy should aim to avoid crises. But energy policy should also address risks that threaten to undercut progress over the long term. Because energy is so deeply intertwined with everyday life, energy policy is a tool that can help our economy grow, improve our environment, and enhance national security today, while protecting us from future threats. This is the basis for a sustainable energy policy.<BR>
<p>
Sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In some cases, competitive markets meet the criteria of sustainability, while in other cases markets fall short.<BR>
<p>
Where energy markets fall short of sustainability-where they fail to adequately protect the environment, where they do not generate sufficient progress in science and technology, where they do not recognize fully the economic and security risks of certain elements in the overall energy picture-energy policy can help ensure sustainable economic progress.<BR>
<p>
Sustainable development policy also reflects a long-term perspective that helps balance the short-term orientation of private markets. We currently enjoy the benefits of actions taken decades ago-investments in science, technology development, environmental protection, and national security-and we have an obligation to provide future generations with a foundation to realize greater progress.<BR>
<p>
To pursue the overall objective of sustainable development, the Clinton Administration's energy policy has three strategic goals:
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Maximize Energy Productivity to strengthen our economy and improve living standards. Getting more out of the energy we use will keep costs of energy services such as light, heat, and mobility at levels that our citizens can afford and at which our businesses can thrive. And as we develop new technologies to increase energy productivity, we can seize global market opportunities in technology exports, creating high-paying jobs and improving the Nation's balance of trade.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Prevent Pollution to reduce the adverse environmental impacts associated with energy production, delivery, and use. Americans cherish a clean environment, and we have made tremendous strides in improving the quality of our land, air, and water. However, as U.S. and global energy needs grow, we must continue to press for more cost-effective and less polluting ways to produce and use energy and explore new approaches to reduce environmental risks, keep our economy strong, and maintain our global leadership in protecting the environment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Keep America Secure by reducing our exposure to events beyond our control. The United States depends on reliable and competitively priced energy supplies to fuel stable economic growth. However, our economy relies on oil for 40 percent of our energy needs, which are being met increasingly by potentially unstable sources of world oil supply. While existing energy policy and improved macroeconomic policies can help reduce the economic harm from supply disruptions, our economy continues to be vulnerable to oil price shocks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
Sustainable energy policy pursues all three goals, because actions that further one goal at the expense of the others can increase the economic, environmental, or security risks borne by future generations. These goals have guided the Administration in developing a sustainable energy policy.<BR>
<p>
<H4><a NAME ="1.7">Delivering on the Goals: Energy Policy for a Sustainable Future</H4></a>
Although market limitations warrant policy action in some cases, sustainable energy policy should not displace market forces or impair well-functioning markets. In fact, market forces can be powerful tools to promote sustainable development. Where markets are not maximizing energy productivity, adequately protecting the environment, or reflecting national security considerations, Administration policy tries to align market forces with the goals of sustainable development. These efforts yield immediate and significant benefits for consumers and firms and lay the foundation for sustained progress.<BR>
<p>
The Administration's long-term energy strategy focuses on advancing technologies to promote a transition toward more sustainable energy systems. Over time, the state of technology exerts enormous leverage on how energy affects the Nation's economy, environment, and security. In the coming decades, our quality of life will depend significantly on the scientific and technological advances supported by today's energy policies.<BR>
<p>
Government can play a positive role in improving markets and stimulating technological advances in a variety of energy sectors. Specific policies must be tailored to the unique circumstances of the markets-whether they be the markets that supply energy, the economic sectors that use energy, or the markets that provide the technologies of energy production and use. Policies must also reflect lessons learned from previous failures, whether they were counterproductive regulatory approaches or ill-advised technology development projects. Finally, policies must take advantage of the unique capabilities of State and local governments, communities, and the private sector. Although national energy policy requires an active Federal role, many of the programs and activities are conducted at the State and local level or with private firms that generate immediate and local benefits.<BR>
<p>
The Administration has initiated a wide range of programs to attain the goals of sustainable national energy policy. These programs, described in subsequent chapters, reflect five key strategies:
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Increase the Efficiency of Energy Use <a href="ch3a.html"> (Chapter 3)</a>. Efficient resource use is a fundamental tenet of sustainable development. The economic, environmental, and national security implications of inefficient energy use motivate market and technology programs that help energy consumers find the most efficient ways to use energy and to maximize energy productivity and value. The Administration is committed to improving energy efficiency in all critical market segments-commercial and residential buildings, transportation, industry, utilities, and government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Develop a Balanced Domestic Energy Resource Portfolio <a href="ch4a.html">(Chapter 4)</a>. Markets that provide critical energy resources for the Nation must also attain our national economic, environmental, and security goals. The Administration is committed to enhancing the competitiveness of domestic oil producers, expanding the role of clean, efficient, and domestically produced natural gas, encouraging the continued development of renewable energy resources, reducing the environmental impacts of coal, and maintaining the safe contribution of nuclear energy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Invest in Science and Technology Advances<a href="ch5.html"> (Chapter 5)</a>. Technological progress enables us to improve the efficiency and reduce the environmental impacts of producing, transporting, and consuming energy. Markets tend to underprovide the resources for science and technology development in sectors where immediate returns are not evident or where benefits are not captured fully by those who invest in research or development. The Administration's science and technology policy complements the private sector with public investments in areas where the long-term economic, environmental, or social objectives are not adequately or immediately rewarded in the marketplace.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Reinvent Environmental Protection<a href="ch6.html"> (Chapter 6)</a>. Americans solidly support a cleaner and healthier environment, and as a Nation, we have enjoyed substantial progress in protecting our environment and decreasing public health risks over the past two decades. However, the current system of environmental protection can be reformed to increase benefits and decrease costs-while still reflecting the fundamental environmental values of our citizens. By combining market forces and technology, the Administration has embarked on many initiatives to increase energy efficiency, prevent pollution, reduce costs, enhance flexibility, and strengthen accountability.

<H2>Chapter 2: Energy and U.S. Economic Productivity, Environmental Quality, and National Security </H2>
<HR><P>
<I>(Note: Figures referenced in this chapter have not been included at this time.)</I><P>
 
Energy policy is motivated by the economic, environmental, and national security implications of energy production and use. An analysis of recent trends indicates that our Nation has made substantial progress in several key areas, while in other areas, energy-related risks have grown.<BR>
<P>
How well is our energy system performing in terms of meeting the goals of economic productivity, environmental quality, and national security? Recent data show that the Nation has made significant progress in several areas, but some trends continue to work against the attainment of national goals. This chapter describes the main forces that shape our energy picture, discusses economic, environmental, and national security implications of the current path of energy development, and explains how risks and opportunities define the scope and intent of the Administration's energy policy.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="2.1">U.S. Energy Production and Use</H4></a>
 
An overall description of the U.S. energy system includes all of the purchases of fuel and power by consumers, business, and industry (that is, energy demand quantified in dollars or energy units) and all of the sales of fuel and power by market providers (that is, energy supply quantified in dollars or energy units). By definition, demand equals supply in both dollar and energy terms.<BR>
<P>
Energy demand depends on the energy service requirements of consumers and firms and on the technologies they use to turn fuel and power into heat, light, mobility, and other services. Energy supply is determined by the natural resources (renewable or nonrenewable) that provide energy and the technologies used to extract, convert, and distribute energy products to end-users. As shown in Figure 1, total U.S. energy consumption increased more than 25 percent in the past two decades, with expanded use of electricity in residential and commercial buildings contributing most to this growth. The energy sources that fueled the growing demand for electricity were mostly nuclear power and coal, as shown in Figure 2. Oil imports also increased more than one-third to meet the increasing need for fuel in the transportation sector and to offset declining domestic production. The overall growth in energy demand, however, was outstripped by the 65-percent growth of the U.S. economy over the same period.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="2.2">Energy and Economic Productivity</H4></a>
 
Reliable and competitively priced energy supply has played a critical role in supporting U.S. economic growth and the high standard of living now enjoyed by most Americans. In 1993, the United States produced and imported raw energy resources worth roughly $159 billion-primary energy that was mostly in the form of fossil fuel extracted from the earth (see Figure 3). Energy producers converted these resources to end-use energy worth $505 billion, split between $307 billion of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuels and $198 billion worth of electric power. Domestic energy production and distribution represent about 8 percent of total gross domestic product (GDP). In addition to the $505 billion spent directly on fuels and power in 1993, energy users spent hundreds of billions of dollars annually on equipment, vehicles, buildings, and other energy-using goods.<BR>
<P>
Energy is also a major component of our international balance of trade. In 1994, net U.S. oil imports of $46 billion and net imports of natural gas worth $4.5 billion represented 7.5 percent of total domestic imports. The impact on the balance of trade was partly offset by the net export of $2.5 billion worth of coal and billions of dollars worth of exports of energy technology and related products. To put these numbers in perspective, the trade deficit in 1994 was $151 billion.<BR>
<P>
Energy supply markets and demand markets have changed considerably over the past 25 years. On the supply side, greater competition has led to expanded production of coal, natural gas, and renewable energy under conditions of stable or even falling energy prices.<BR>
<P>
On the demand side, as technology has become more efficient and the U.S. economy has shifted away from energy-intensive industry, the amount of energy that we use to produce a dollar's worth of GDP-the energy intensity of the economy-has declined, as it has in most other industrialized economies. This trend of U.S. GDP growth outpacing energy use is expected to continue for at least the next 15 years (see Figure 4). <BR>
<P>
The increased demand for energy services has been partially offset by more efficient use of energy in all three major end-use sectors. The net result of this mix of trends has been relatively stable or slowly growing energy demand in most sectors. <BR>
<P>
In 1992, the United States accounted for nearly one-quarter of world energy consumption; however, its share of world energy demand has been declining. In the next several decades, the United States is likely to face increasing competition for the world's energy resources, particularly from the rapidly expanding economies of East Asia. The Energy Information Administration's International Energy Outlook 1995 forecasts that, by 2010, energy use in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries will be about 26 percent above 1992 levels, while the non-OECD countries will increase their energy use by almost 48 percent; other projections indicate even more rapid growth in demand in developing countries. Increased global energy demand could lead to higher real energy prices in the United States as a result of our trade in energy, especially oil.<BR>
<P>
Compared with other developed countries, the United States and Canada remain the most energy-intensive, in part because of dispersed geographic development (increasing transportation distances) and more severe or varied climates (requiring both heating and air-conditioning in many regions). These indigenous factors are reinforced by relatively low U.S. energy prices that reflect natural abundance, a mature energy infrastructure, and low energy taxes. Energy prices in the United States are considerably lower than those of most other industrialized countries, which has helped energy-intensive industries but has muted the incentives for greater reductions in our economy's energy intensity. For example, as shown in Figure 5, gasoline prices in the United States are lower than in other industrialized nations, contributing to high rates of motor-vehicle use.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="2.3">Energy and the Environment</H4></a>
 
Energy transformation and consumption are the primary sources of most harmful air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Although considerable progress has been made over the past two decades in limiting or reducing air pollutants (see Figure 6), significant air-quality problems persist in some areas. Because our environmental regulatory system tends to focus on individual technologies, we have made more progress reducing the pollution produced per unit of energy use (or per unit of energy service delivered) compared with the slower pace of reducing overall levels of pollution (see Figure 7).<BR>
<P>
The global climate changes likely to result from increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases pose another potentially serious environmental problem related to the production and use of energy. Unlike the case with several other energy-related air pollutants, emissions of carbon dioxide (the principal greenhouse gas) from energy use have been generally rising over the past 10 years and are expected to continue to rise (see Figure 8).3 Although many uncertainties remain regarding the magnitude, timing, and regional effects of such global climate changes, there is mounting evidence that climate changes could begin to occur early in the next century and that, if current trends continue, these changes could ultimately have significant harmful effects on economic growth, human health, and the stability of vital ecosystems.<BR>
<P>
Energy production and use also have other important impacts on the environment, such as energy-related water pollution, including oil spills; nuclear, toxic, and other waste disposal problems; and disruption of sensitive land and natural ecosystems.<BR>
<P>
Existing environmental laws and regulations help reduce the adverse effects of many of these energy-related environmental impacts. However, some pollutants are not controlled, and progress toward a cleaner environment has been accompanied by increasing costs. Because these high costs could limit further progress, the Administration is committed to the development of new technologies and new approaches to environmental regulation that will help minimize the costs of pollution reductions. In particular, the Administration has initiated a shift toward more performance-based regulation that can achieve environmental goals at a lower cost by giving industries more flexibility in selecting compliance strategies.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="2.4">Oil Use, World Markets, and Energy Security</H4></a>
 
Petroleum has provided the largest share of energy for the United States since 1950, although its share of total primary energy consumption has declined from a peak of 49 percent in 1977 to about 40 percent in 1994. Since the United States became a net importer in 1948, U.S. oil imports rose to nearly 50 percent of domestic requirements in 1977, fell to roughly 30 percent of domestic needs in 1985, and have risen steadily in the past decade to once again reach the 50 percent level (see Figure 9).<BR>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. domestic oil production has been declining since 1970. Today, proved U.S. oil reserves represent only about 2 percent of the world total, while the United States consumes more than one-fourth of world oil production. As shown in Figure 10, almost two-thirds of world oil reserves are located in the Middle East (nearly 20 percent of world oil reserves are located in Iran and Iraq alone), and another 12 percent are located in Africa and the former Soviet Union. These regions recently have experienced considerable social and political turmoil. According to the Energy Information Administration, the Persian Gulf will become the dominant source for oil traded on the world market, accounting for two-thirds of global oil trade within a decade (see Figure 11). This concentration could increase the sensitivity of world oil prices to the political and social situation in the Middle East, raising the prospects for future oil market disruptions and price shocks.<BR>
<P>
The last three sharp increases in the world oil price (1974, 1979, and 1990) were each followed by periods of negative economic growth (see Figure 12). Beyond the direct economic impact of consumers and producers paying a higher price for an important commodity, the resulting increases in the overall price level and perceived risk of inflation have challenged monetary and fiscal policy authorities to formulate appropriate responses to world oil price increases. Shortcomings in previous economic policy reactions have amplified the negative impacts of oil price increases and helped to trigger recessions. Because fiscal and monetary policies may not respond appropriately to future sharp increases in world oil prices, sudden and pronounced increases in oil prices could contribute to recession in the United States.<BR>
<P>
Is the United States more or less secure compared to the situation in the 1970s? Greater diversification of import sources, the existence of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a more efficient global market, the emergence of futures markets, and the removal of harmful price and allocation controls suggest that the United States is less vulnerable to the economic damages of supply disruptions than was the case 20 years ago. However, other indicators-the increasing concentration of global oil from potentially unstable regions, domestic consumption patterns, and production trends-imply that unstable global energy markets may still compromise our economic and national security goals.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="2.5">Alternative Energy Futures</H4></a>
 
The trends that are shaping the Nation's energy future suggest that we face substantial challenges in meeting our economic, environmental, and national security goals. These trends also indicate that the Nation has found ways to improve energy productivity, prevent pollution, and enhance national security.<BR>
<P>
The Administration's energy policy is not predicated on a single projection of our energy future. Instead, it is based on an appraisal of risks and opportunities evident in current patterns of energy development, and it focuses on areas where the opportunities to reduce risks are greatest.<BR>
<P>
The major risks that threaten the attainment of our national goals include rapid growth in global energy demand, unstable world oil supplies, growing recognition of international environmental threats, and a slowdown in investments to develop and deploy new energy technologies. These trends could lead to the following scenarios:
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Growth in U.S. and world energy demand could strain the capacity of energy suppliers to expand production, resulting in sustained energy price increases. Midrange projections of growth in world energy demand generally assume that economic growth continues at about 2 percent annually in industrialized countries, with nonindustrialized countries growing about 3 to 4 percent annually. But growth during 1993 and 1994 exceeded these rates in most parts of the world. If such growth persists, world energy supplies could become tight within the next decade.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>International conflict or social turmoil in unstable oil-producing regions could disrupt global oil markets and rapidly increase oil prices. Continuing political and social upheaval in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa could lead to significant and prolonged disruptions in the ability or willingness of the countries in these regions to supply oil to the international market. Resulting high oil prices, combined with inadequate monetary and fiscal policy responses in industrialized nations, could impair U.S. and global economic growth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Clear evidence of significant global climate changes or other energy-related environmental problems could precipitate widespread public demand for more stringent measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or other environmental risks from energy production and use. Many scientists believe that stronger evidence could emerge in the next decade or two indicating that human-induced climate changes would result in large adverse impacts. Although it is difficult to forecast how the international community would respond, nations that are less dependent on carbon-intensive fuels or that have developed and begun to deploy the technologies needed to reduce such dependence are likely to have an advantage.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Reduced investments in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies could place the United States at a competitive disadvantage in global energy technology markets. Such a trend could result from the relatively low overall rate of private savings and investment in the United States or from less research and development (R&D) investment in the energy sector.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
These risks are evident in current trends, but are not forecasts of future events. Plausible scenarios of energy futures bracket a range of possibilities. Scenarios can be envisioned in which energy risks threaten our economy, environment, and national security, while equally plausible scenarios emphasize the positive trends that could reduce risks over time. The four scenarios describe the dominant risks evident in current trends, which provide the fundamental motivations for Administration energy policy. By focusing national energy policy on the most prevalent risks, the Administration's energy policy enhances the prospects for a clean, competitive, affordable, and secure energy future.

<BODY>
<H2>Chapter 3:  Increase the Efficiency of Energy Use</H2>
<HR><P>
<I>(Note: Figures referenced in this chapter have not been included at this time.)</I><P>
 
Increased energy efficiency has provided the Nation with significant economic, environmental, and
security benefits over the past 20 years. To make further progress toward a sustainable energy
future, Administration policy encourages investments in energy efficiency and fuel flexibility in
key economic sectors. By focusing on market barriers that inhibit economic investments in
efficient technologies and practices, these programs help market forces continually improve the
efficiency of our homes, our transportation systems, our offices, and our factories.<BR>
<P>
In the past 20 years, the U.S. economy has grown by almost 65 percent. But the energy resource
that has satisfied the lion's share of our growing need for energy services was neither pumped nor
mined from the earth but, instead, was found in our homes, factories, and vehicles. The increased
efficiency of energy use-better insulated homes, more efficient manufacturing processes, and
better mileage in cars-has allowed us to reap the benefits of energy while using far less energy
than we otherwise would have. Fuel diversity has also increased over the past 20 years, as oil use
has fallen dramatically in the industrial, buildings, and electric utility sectors through efficiency,
fuel substitution, and increased use of fuel-flexible systems. Along the way, the Nation has
reduced its cumulative energy bill by more than $2 trillion and substantially reduced the
environmental burdens and security risks associated with using energy.<BR>
<P>
Figure 13 compares the sectoral changes in energy intensity that occurred from 1975 to 1991, and
it breaks the transportation and buildings sectors into their two major components. With the
exception of freight transportation, all parts of the economy showed declines in energy intensity
ranging from 14 to 27 percent. Freight transportation showed a 5-percent increase in energy
intensity largely because of declining load factors that more than offset the gains in vehicle
efficiency.<BR>
<P>
Much of this efficiency resource was tapped because people and companies often found that it was
cheaper to save energy than to buy it. Investing in efficient technologies allowed them to reduce
wasteful energy use and get the energy services they needed at less overall cost. Market forces
have provided incentives to use energy more efficiently. <BR>
<P>
However, many of the efficiency gains realized over the past 20 years were the result of
government policies to encourage, facilitate, and, in some instances, require investments in cost-
effective efficiency technologies. By addressing barriers to economically desirable investments in
energy efficiency, these policies continue to produce significant economic payoffs for all
Americans.<BR>
<P>
The opportunities for further gains are abundant. Studies have shown that efficient deployment of
existing technologies could save a substantial portion of the energy we currently use, while
lowering overall costs. Continued development of new technologies would compound potential
savings in the future. Not only would lowered energy use directly benefit the environment, but
such efficiency gains could also obviate the need for more expensive controls that would otherwise
be required to attain environmental goals. <BR>
<P>
Major opportunities still exist for substituting alternative fuels for oil in the transportation sector
and for introducing fuel-flexible technologies. These developments would create fuel competition
in the transportation sector and help diversify the energy sources that serve our transportation
needs.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.1">The Federal Role in Improving Energy Efficiency and Flexibility</H4></a>
Despite the progress already made and the many remaining opportunities, the pace of overall
efficiency gains has slowed over the past decade. Gains by alternative fuels are also slow; for
example, nonpetroleum-based fuels still represent only 3 percent of transportation energy use. Low
energy prices have contributed to the reduced pace of efficiency gains; conversely, efficiency gains
have deterred suppliers from raising energy prices. But these low prices have also limited our
attentiveness to cost-effective efficiency opportunities and have blunted the incentive for pursuing
them.<BR>
<P>
In this era of low prices, the Federal Government and the private sector can maximize energy
productivity by identifying and removing market barriers that inhibit cost-effective investments in
efficiency and flexibility. These barriers exist in varying degrees in all energy-use
markets-residential and commercial buildings, transportation, and industry-and remain a primary
target of energy policy. They include inadequate market information and incentives, lack of
accessible financing, inappropriately regulated markets, and fragmented technology and service
markets. By effectively addressing these barriers, energy policy can boost energy efficiency,
increase economic productivity, create jobs, and contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment.<BR>
<P>
Government and the private sector also can increase energy efficiency in the long run by investing
in research and development (R&D) efforts. Government support is necessary because of the
high-risk nature of such technology development, the inability of private manufacturers to capture
the full benefits of such research, and the benefits to the general public (such as reduced pollution
and enhanced national security) that accrue from the application of these technologies.<BR>
<P>
Energy efficiency and fuel flexibility are key objectives on the path to a sustainable energy future,
and barriers to their achievement threaten sustainability. The Administration supports overcoming
barriers to energy efficiency and fuel flexibility by enhancing market forces and accelerating
technology development. <BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.2">Enhancing Market Forces</H4></a>
The ability of market forces to motivate economically desirable energy-efficiency investments can
be impaired by poor information, certain government regulations, the conflicting motivations of
owners and renters, inadequate financing, inaccessible accounting of external benefits or costs, and
many other factors. Energy policies that focus on specific "market imperfections" can improve the
effectiveness of market forces and lead to lasting improvements in energy and economic
efficiency. These procompetition policies can be as simple as providing better information to
energy users, and as complex as restructuring the electric utility industry. <BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.3">Accelerating Technology Development and Adoption</H4></a>
Continual improvements in the efficiency and fuel flexibility of energy-using technologies helps
enable sustainable development. But industry support of technology development is often hindered
by a focus on short-term profitability, a lack of resources, the inability of individual firms to
capture the full benefits of specific technology improvements, or the general underinvestment in
research that benefits the common good more than the corporate bottom line. And widespread use
of new technology is often prevented or delayed by persistent market or institutional barriers to
investment. Consequently, the second main strategy for improving energy efficiency and flexibility
entails support for the accelerated research, development, and deployment of new technologies.
This includes direct support of R&D as well as other policies to encourage or require the adoption
of new technologies.<BR>
<P>
Combinations of these strategies have proven highly effective in all energy markets. The remainder
of this chapter describes energy policy in each major market sector.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.4">Transportation: Improving Efficiency and Introducing Alternatives</H4></a>
Efficient transportation services sustain a vibrant economy and ensure the personal mobility of the
general population. Increasing transportation efficiency and fuel flexibility are cornerstones of the
Administration's transportation sector energy policy. These policies are critical to achieving the
Administration's goals of improving U.S. energy security and environmental quality, while also
reducing the economic risks posed by this sector's heavy dependence on oil.<BR>
<P>
Transportation-related goods and services make up approximately 17 percent of U.S. gross
domestic product (GDP), and our entire economy relies heavily on low-cost, highly flexible, and
rapid mobility of goods and services. U.S. transportation fuels are taxed at lower levels and have
the lowest delivered prices in the developed world (see Figure 5 in Chapter 2). In 1993, the average Federal and State gasoline tax was $0.37 per gallon (split about equally between Federal and State taxes). The average U.S. pump price of gasoline in 1994, at $1.17 per gallon, was its lowest in real terms since before World War II. <BR>
<P>
The transportation sector accounts for almost two-thirds of total U.S. petroleum consumption,
with cars and trucks alone accounting for more than 20 percent of total U.S. energy use. Last year
the United States used 38 percent more oil in transportation than was produced in U.S. oil fields.
Energy use in transportation has risen slowly over the past 15 years, as increased vehicle-miles
traveled (VMT) have more than offset increased average vehicle fuel economy. On average, every
American travels nearly 8,800 miles per year in a light-duty vehicle, and per capita VMT is
growing at a rate of more than 2 percent per year. Rapid growth in heavy-truck and airline travel
has also increased the demand for transportation energy. Increased use of heavy trucks
substantially outpaced modest efficiency gains, while in the airline industry, a rapid surge in
passenger-miles traveled offset a substantial increase in per-passenger fuel economy. Most
importantly, the transportation sector has not altered its virtually total dependence on petroleum.<BR>
<P>
Transportation energy use is the Nation's largest source of air pollution, with highway vehicles
alone accounting for 26 percent of U.S. emissions of volatile organic compounds, 
32 percent of emissions of oxides of nitrogen (the two principal precursors of ozone pollution in
urban areas), and 62 percent of total carbon monoxide emissions. The transportation sector
accounts for 32 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.<BR>
<P>
To meet near-term objectives, the Administration's transportation energy policy encourages
increased efficiency in the existing stock of vehicles, promotes the expanded use of efficient
technologies in new vehicles, targets opportunities to reduce travel demand, and spurs the market
development of alternative transportation fuels. To ensure that the transportation system meets the
needs of the United States over the long term, the Administration has focused on developing
vehicle and fuel technologies that will substantially improve vehicle efficiency and enhance fuel
flexibility in this sector.<BR>
<P>
The Administration continues to develop policies to reduce the environmental impact of
transportation energy use. In implementing the Climate Change Action Plan, the Administration
established a Federal Advisory Committee to make recommendations by the fall of 1995 on
policies that cost-effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles.
While the committee focuses on policies that reduce greenhouse gases, these same policies are
likely to address other strategic goals such as energy security, improved performance of the U.S.
transportation system, and environmental concerns other than climate change.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.5">Promoting Near-Term Efficiency Improvements</H4></a>
The Administration supports measures to promote fuel-economy improvements and to maintain
fuel-economy levels in the face of declining real fuel prices. These include the corporate average
fuel economy (CAFE) standard and the "gas guzzler tax," which applies to cars getting less than
21 miles per gallon. The current CAFE standard is 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles and 20.5
miles per gallon for light trucks. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
has initiated a rulemaking to set the light-truck standard in the future at its maximum feasible level.
Supporting these policies are education programs designed to ensure a well-informed marketplace.
For example, NHTSA is also developing rules to require fuel-economy labels for tires as an aid to
consumers, and the Federal Government's Gas Mileage Guide continues to assist consumers in
comparing the fuel efficiency of new cars and trucks. <BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.6">Developing Markets For Alternative Fuels</H4></a>
The Administration supports the development of markets for nonpetroleum-based alternative
fuels, including encouraging infrastructure investment and alternative-fuel vehicle technologies.
Alternative fuels include compressed natural gas, propane, electricity, methanol, and ethanol. These fuels are used in vehicles today, and some are used as nonpetroleum inputs to gasoline. The
environmental and energy security benefits of this market support will increase through time as
more advanced vehicle and fuel technologies become commercially available and as the refueling
infrastructure expands. <BR>
<P>
Current policies support an orderly market evolution under challenging conditions that include
perceived high risks, uncertain costs, and limited infrastructure for the distribution and use of
alternative transportation fuels. The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a number of programs and
policy goals that are being implemented by the Department of Energy, the Department of
Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These programs have been
supplemented by new initiatives to further increase Federal agency purchases of alternative-fuel
vehicles and to support local efforts to bolster the use of alternative fuels through coordinated
Federal, local, and private efforts. <BR>
<P>
Current Federal programs and market developments are expected to lead to 2.5 million alternative-
fuel vehicles on the road by 2010.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.7">Reducing the Demand for Travel</H4></a>
The Administration supports increased efficiency in transportation systems to reduce travel
demand. Even with successful development of high-efficiency and alternative-fuel vehicle
technologies, stemming the rapid growth in annual VMT may be necessary to further reduce oil
use and air pollution over the long run. If recent growth trends are maintained into the future,
Americans will be driving twice as many miles in 2015 as we do today. Even given expected
reductions in the annual growth rates, the Energy Information Administration projects that VMT
will be more than 50 percent higher in 2010 than it was in 1990. A number of Administration
initiatives are designed to improve the efficiency of travel and to provide Americans with effective
modes of alternative travel. The Climate Change Action Plan includes new efforts to promote
telecommuting and to reform the tax code to allow commuters to choose between employer-
subsidized parking and cash. The Environmental Protection Agency has established the voluntary
Transportation Partners program, which assists localities in implementing and receiving credit for
transportation efficiency measures that reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other air pollutants
by reducing demand for vehicle travel. The Administration is supporting considerable research to
develop "intelligent transportation systems," and experimental programs, such as the Department
of Transportation's Congestion Pricing Pilot Program, to improve understanding of the feasibility,
costs, and benefits of an array of strategies for increasing transportation system efficiency. <BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.8">Developing Technologies for a New Generation of Vehicles</H4></a>
Transportation technologies are key in the Administration's strategy for realizing energy security,
economic, and environmental goals. The Administration supports a policy of long-term, highly
focused R&D to improve vehicle fuel economy and <a name="alter"></a>alternative-fuel technologies and to make these technologies available to manufacturers and, ultimately, consumers.<BR>
<P>
On the vehicle side, the Administration's long-term development efforts include programs like the
government-industry <a name="png"></a>Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, which targets breakthrough technologies capable of increasing vehicle fuel efficiency by as much as three times current levels. To help achieve these potentials, the Government supports efforts such as the development of advanced materials, improved electric and hybrid vehicles, advanced battery concepts, fuel-cell vehicles, and lightweight vehicle body designs.<BR>
<P>
On the fuel side, Administration policy focuses on reducing the feedstock and production costs of
renewable fuels, such as hydrogen and biomass-based ethanol, and increasing the efficiency and
performance of alternative-fuel vehicle technologies. Hydrogen is used today as an input to a
variety of chemical processes and is generally produced from natural gas. Hydrogen can also be
extracted from water through electrolysis, using electricity generated from renewable resources,
biomass, and coal. The costs of producing, transporting, and storing hydrogen on vehicles must
decline before this clean-burning alternative can gain a share of the vehicle market.<BR>
<P>
Ethanol from various biomass sources is another promising long-term opportunity. Research is
under way to develop commercially competitive ethanol from low-energy-input crops and wastes
with desirable environmental attributes. The Department of Energy and the Department of
Agriculture coordinate research to lower the cost of producing starch-derived ethanol and
agricultural oil-based biodiesel fuels. Initially, these technologies would be commercialized by
using fiber and agricultural waste sidestreams from current production as feedstocks, but they
could ultimately evolve into independent domestic energy industries.<BR>
<P>
In addition to addressing energy security concerns, biofuels production creates new alternatives for
agricultural crops. Expanded biofuel production will add value to crops, increase farm income, and
build economic opportunity for rural communities. In addition to increasing on-farm economic
activity, biofuel production would also stimulate "upstream" industries that supply inputs to
farmers and would increase production in "downstream" sectors that process agricultural products
into final goods.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.9">Remaining Challenges and Opportunities</H4></a>
The transportation-related programs and policy initiatives outlined above represent a
comprehensive effort to capitalize on a range of opportunities to achieve national energy policy
goals. Nonetheless, there remain some further opportunities, issues not fully addressed, and
significant challenges to making the programs successful. The Administration continues to
examine new ways to increase efficiency in transportation, encourage the use of domestic
alternative fuels, and work with State and local governments to help manage the growing demand
for travel in ways that will enhance the overall economic and environmental performance of the
U.S. transportation system.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.10">Buildings: Overcoming the Barriers to Investments in Efficiency</H4></a>
Energy use in buildings accounts for 35 percent of total primary energy demand, 42 percent of
total energy costs, and 35 percent of all U.S. carbon emissions. Because utility bills are a
substantial part of family budgets, residential building energy use affects what kind of housing we
can afford and how comfortable and healthy we are at home. Energy use in the commercial sector
represents a cost to business and can have a substantial bearing on employee productivity. Recent
studies have concluded that the overall potential for reducing energy use in buildings through cost-
effective investments is on the order of 30 percent by 2015, with an overall enhancement of indoor
air quality, employee satisfaction, and comfort.<BR>
<P>
The Administration supports a strong, multifaceted effort to encourage cost-effective investments
in energy efficiency and to speed the development and introduction of new, efficient technologies
for buildings. Extensive barriers stand in the way of economically desirable energy-efficiency
investments in buildings. By enhancing the effectiveness of markets, developing new technologies, coordinating with State and local governments, strengthening codes and standards, and providing direct investment support to selected market segments, the Administration's energy policy substantially decreases building energy use and related costs.<BR>
<P>
Current Federal programs for building efficiency are estimated to result in $31.5 billion in annual
energy savings for consumers by 2010.</BODY>

<HR>
<I>(Note: Figures referenced in this chapter have not been included at this time.)</I><P>
 
<H4><a name="3.11">Enhancing the Effectiveness of Markets for Efficiency Investments</H4> </a>
Markets remain the primary vehicle for energy decisions. However, reforms in both regulated and
unregulated markets can significantly improve the performance by which markets deliver
convenient, reliable, and affordable energy to the buildings sector. The Administration supports
market-oriented efforts to promote cost-effective investments in energy efficiency. <BR>
<P>
Recent changes in Federal law and State regulation have initiated substantial changes that will lead
to increasingly competitive and less regulated markets for the supply of electricity and natural gas.
The Administration strongly supports these developments where they are likely to improve the
overall productivity and efficiency of the utility sector and provide energy users with better price
signals and more types of utility service from which to choose. The Administration expects that
appropriate changes in the utility sector will lead to the further evolution of utility and independent
efforts to increase end-use efficiency and load management as a means of meeting the consumer
demand for reliable and affordable energy services.<BR>
<P>
Utility Integrated Resource Planning.  Regulated electric and natural gas utilities provide more than
86 percent of the energy used in residential and commercial buildings. However, retail utility rates
often differ markedly from both the marginal costs of supplying electricity and natural gas and the
marginal social costs of using energy. Therefore, consumers often do not receive accurate energy
price signals. Utility demand-side management programs, which exist in a number of States to
encourage efficiency investments, may partly compensate for the distortions created by regulated
prices in this sector. In the 5-year period ending in 1993, with the regulatory and technical support
of Federal and State government agencies, utilities spent almost $9 billion on residential and
commercial demand-side management programs. These programs will save consumers several
billion dollars annually over the next decade.<BR>
<P>
To bolster the effectiveness of utility ratepayer funds spent on the development of residential and
commercial technologies, the Federal Government has supported the establishment of a
consortium of utilities willing to coordinate their efforts in this area. The first project of this
consortium was the support of a "Golden Carrot" competition among manufacturers of
refrigerators, which resulted in the design and production of refrigerators that are 30 percent more
efficient than the current standard for comparably sized conventional units. Similar approaches are
being used for products such as high-efficiency gas and geothermal heat pumps in the Department
of Energy's Technology Introduction Partnerships.<BR>
<P>
Residential Energy-Efficiency Financing. Information on the energy efficiency of a new or
existing home is generally not available to prospective buyers, and home prices and mortgage
financing options generally are not differentiated to reflect the lower energy costs of energy-
efficient housing. The Department of Energy, together with the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, private lenders, builders, and others, has helped develop and apply home energy-
rating systems that provide buyers and sellers of residential real estate with information regarding
the energy performance of homes and the economics of potential improvements. This effort is
coupled with programs to expand the availability of mortgages that explicitly recognize the link
between lower energy bills and a homeowner's ability to afford monthly mortgage payments.<BR>
<P>
Efficiency Investments in Commercial Buildings. Energy costs in commercial buildings typically
represent less than 2 percent of the total costs of the businesses or public institutions that occupy
them, which limits sustained management attention to energy-efficiency opportunities. Lacking
standardized methods for measuring and verifying the resulting energy savings, vendors of
energy-efficiency technology and energy-performance contractors are only slowly gaining market
shares in the commercial building sector. Combined with limited monitoring by building
managers and little market information on investment options, many commercial buildings harbor
profitable but yet unrealized efficiency gains.<BR>
<P>
Beginning with the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star programs (including Green
Lights and Energy Star Buildings) that target efficient commercial lighting investments and other
profitable building energy-efficiency upgrades, and continuing with the Rebuild America initiative
and other Department of Energy programs, the Federal Government has been extremely effective
at encouraging commercial building owners and tenants to lower energy consumption and bills.
Voluntary agreements to examine operations, combined with public recognition of the
environmental benefits of lowering energy use, have proven to be a powerful extra incentive for
profitable investment in energy-efficient technologies for commercial building. These programs
are coordinated with utility and State efforts to maximize the impact of modest Federal resources.<BR>
<P>
Energy-Efficiency Product Labeling.  Building energy users, especially individual consumers,
often lack the basic price and performance information necessary to make sound energy
investment and use decisions. Since the late 1970s, the Federal Government has required
performance labels on major energy-using products or building materials to help consumers make
more informed decisions. Major appliances and other home equipment have had such labels since
the program's inception, but efficiency labels for windows have only recently become widely
available. A variety of labeling and recognition programs are currently under development with the
building products industry.<BR>
<P>
Although commercial building managers and equipment purchasers tend to have access to more
information than do individual consumers, there continue to be significant gaps in this information.
For example, office equipment is a major source of increasing energy demand in this sector, but
there is still very little information available on the comparative energy efficiency and use of
different products. To fill this void the Environmental Protection Agency developed the voluntary
Energy Star office equipment labeling program. The personal computer industry has widely
adopted this program, which recognizes and highlights products with superior energy
performance.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.12">Developing New Technologies To Improve Building Efficiency</H4></a>
The Administration supports efforts to develop<a name="nt"></a><a href="ch3bx3.html"> new technologies</a> that can improve energy efficiency in buildings. The building construction industry is highly fragmented, with more than 157,000 home builders, 342,000 home improvement contractors, and tens of thousands of commercial building contractors. As a result, the industry does not support the R&D or training necessary to develop and rapidly adopt new technologies. R&D in the construction industry is just 0.5 percent of revenues, compared with 3.4 percent of revenues for other industries, on average.  Since the mid-1970s, the Federal Government has supported the successful development of a number of building energy technologies that are now in widespread use or beginning to enter the marketplace. This support remains a key element in reducing energy demand from the building sector.<BR>
<P>
The major technologies now under development in private industry and national laboratories with
the support of the Department of Energy include the gas-fired absorption (GAX) heat pump,
electrochromic window glazings, the sulfur lamp, and the 30/30 roof. Compared with other high-
efficiency heating and cooling technologies, the GAX heat pump has several significant
advantages. The system is approximately 40 percent more efficient than current technology and is
expected to reduce primary energy use for space heating, space cooling, and water heating in U.S.
residences by 0.3 quad by 2020, while reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other
environmental pollutants by more than 40 percent. Powered by natural gas, the GAX heat pump
could also reduce the electric utility peaks associated with summer cooling loads by about 18
gigawatts.<BR>
<P>
Electrochromic window glazings that switch between opacity and transparency when an electrical
charge is applied may be used to control the level of direct solar radiation admitted to a building's
interior. Such windows could offer significant energy savings and may become commonplace.<BR>
<P>
The recently developed sulfur lamp can replace conventional high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps
in many commercial applications. National annual energy savings from achieving a 10-percent
share of the U.S. HID lamp market by the year 2000 would amount to 8.7 billion kilowatthours,
worth $600 million to U.S. industry and other consumers of HID lamps. Another example is the
30/30 roof, so named for its R-30 insulation rating and expected life of 30 years. Widespread
installation of such roofs would save a minimum of 20 percent of the energy used for heating and
cooling commercial buildings across the Nation, with many buildings achieving savings of 50
percent or more. <BR>
<P>
To date, a total Federal investment of $600 million in buildings research has resulted in $23 billion
in energy savings.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.13">Cooperating With State and Community Programs That Encourage Building Efficiency</H4></a>
The Administration supports cooperative programs that effectively encourage or require improved
efficiency in buildings by linking Federal efforts with the considerable capabilities and unique
authorities of State, regional, and local government agencies.<BR>
<P>
State Programs. The Department of Energy helps fund State programs that support energy
efficiency in residential markets, and works in partnerships with State energy offices in critical
areas such as updating and enforcing building energy codes, supporting home energy rating
systems, and establishing related financing programs. Direct State support for energy-efficiency
projects has decreased considerably as a result of the gradual expenditure of oil overcharge monies
that have been used for years as a funding source for States. However, Federal financial assistance
continues to enable States to implement a broad range of unique and effective conservation
programs. <BR>
<P>
Community Programs.  In several areas, communities play a key role in leading or coordinating
the implementation of important building energy-efficiency measures. For example, the heat-
absorbing nature of many buildings and pavement surfaces can raise outdoor temperatures by 5 to
10 degrees Fahrenheit in many communities. Reducing such temperature increases can improve
outdoor comfort, reduce smog and related health effects (heat is a major contributor to smog
formation), and reduce the energy required for cooling. Without community-level action, there is
little incentive for individual building owners to invest in the lighter surfaces and strategic tree
planting that would benefit the entire community. The Administration, through its Cool
Communities initiative, provides the technical information and support needed by local
governments to promote the use of "cool" or reflective building and paving surfaces through
planning or zoning actions. <BR>
<P>
Urban development or redevelopment can also create opportunities for coordinating heating,
cooling, and electric loads in ways that substantially reduce overall energy use. District heating and
cooling systems, sometimes called community energy systems, use the "waste" heat from
electricity generation to heat or cool nearby buildings.<BR>
<P>
Recently, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, and other agencies have
assisted communities that have been devastated by natural disasters, such as the Midwestern
floods of 1993, to rebuild in more sustainable ways. This technical assistance helps communities
relocate in less vulnerable areas and build infrastructure and housing that is more energy-efficient
and makes greater use of renewable resources. This new program helps communities in
immediate distress to apply their rebuilding efforts toward a long-term vision of a more secure and
prosperous life.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.14">Establishing Minimum Efficiency Standards for New Buildings and Appliances</H4></a>
Although the Administration recognizes that policies that use market forces or market-based
incentives are preferable in most circumstances, appropriate regulatory intervention can achieve
efficiency gains that will benefit consumers, businesses, and the Nation. This strategy is employed
where market barriers are particularly severe and where durable investments in equipment or
buildings will dictate energy performance over long periods of time.<BR>
<P>
Building Codes and Standards. Since the mid-1970s, most State and many local building codes
have imposed significant energy-efficiency requirements on new homes and commercial
buildings, and model codes have been upgraded several times. However, despite considerable
efforts by professional organizations, national building code organizations, and Federal agencies, a
considerable gap remains between what is considered to be economically desirable building
construction and actual practice. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires States to ensure that new
nonresidential buildings meet or exceed the efficiency standards recommended by the American
Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and it requires
States to consider requiring new homes to meet or exceed the Model Energy Code of the Council
of American Building Officials (CABO). The Department of Energy assists States and local code
jurisdictions in upgrading their building standards and improving their implementation and
enforcement. Effectively implementing updated building codes will produce substantial long-term
benefits.<BR>
<P>
Implementation of ASHRAE commercial standards is expected to reduce energy bills by $2.1
billion annually by 2010.<BR>
<P>
Effective October 1994, the Department of Housing and Urban Development  established thermal
performance requirements for manufactured housing, such as trailer homes. The Rural Housing
and Community Development Service of the Department of Agriculture is reviewing these
requirements for conformity with Department of Agriculture standards for such housing in an
effort to reduce potentially duplicative regulatory requirements on the manufactured housing
industry while maintaining adequate thermal design and construction.<BR>
<P>
Appliance and Equipment Efficiency Standards. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a number
of States established efficiency standards for major home appliances, and appliance manufacturers
petitioned the Federal Government to establish uniform preemptive national standards in the
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act in 1987. There are now national efficiency standards
for most categories of home appliances and equipment, and the Department of Energy periodically
reviews and updates these standards. The efficiency standards are established at levels where
higher purchase prices are fully offset by energy cost savings to consumers in a few years of
operation.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.15">Supporting Efficiency Investments</H4></a>
Despite Federal and other efforts to improve markets focused on the energy efficiency of
buildings, major barriers to the rapid and widespread use of economically desirable efficiency
technologies in some market segments warrant direct support. The Administration is using Federal
facilities to demonstrate leadership in energy efficiency. In addition, where appropriate, the
Administration assists low-income households in private and public buildings to weatherize and,
in some cases, to help defray high energy bills.<BR>
<P>
Federal Energy Management. The Federal Government is the largest user of energy in the United
States and probably the single largest purchaser of energy-efficient products and services. Federal
facilities ranging from offices to military apartments to hospitals use about 2.5 percent of all
energy used in commercial and residential buildings. The Federal Government has the
responsibility to set an excellent example in its own facilities and transfer lessons learned to
industry, other governments, and communities. <BR>
<P>
To "reinvent" Federal energy use, the Administration has begun to implement programs to reduce
Federal energy consumption in 2005 by 30 percent per square foot in Federal buildings, relative to
an agency's 1985 energy use. The specific actions for realizing these savings include changes in
procurement practices for everything from computers to new buildings, new ways to fund
efficiency investments, and incentives and training for energy managers.<BR>
<P>
These initiatives are being coordinated at the Federal level by the Department of Energy's Federal
Energy Management Program. About $250 million per year is being invested to improve the
energy efficiency of existing Federal buildings, which will save taxpayers billions of dollars in
future government costs. In addition to these direct investments, agencies may now use special
"energy savings performance contracts" that allow private companies to make the up-front
investments and be paid over time through the resulting cost savings. Federal agencies are also
being encouraged to participate in utility-sponsored efficiency programs. The energy code for new
Federal building construction is being revised to conform to the model codes that are familiar to
private contractors. Finally, a "procurement challenge" for Federal purchases of everything from
computers to light bulbs will encourage further energy and costs savings.<BR>
<P>
On average, every dollar invested in efficiency improvements through the Federal Energy Management Program results in $3 in savings.<BR>
<P>
Assistance to Low-Income Households. Most low-income households do not have access to the
financing necessary to support cost-effective home efficiency improvements. There are
approximately 27 million low-income households, which use about 24 percent of total energy in
the residential sector. These homes tend to be older, in worse states of repair, and substantially less
energy efficient than the rest of the housing stock. Furthermore, low-income households are
especially vulnerable to rapid price increases or severe weather that forces up utility costs. Utility
and fuel bills account for 14 percent of low-income household expenditures, compared with under
5 percent for all U.S. households. <BR>
<P>
To help low-income households achieve lasting reductions in their energy bills, the Federal
Government has supported the direct weatherization of low-income households since the mid-
1970s. Funds provided by Congress through the Department of Energy have been supplemented
by funds from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, State oil-overcharge monies,
and utilities. Through 1994, it is estimated that more than 4 million homes have been weatherized.
Ninety percent of the households served by the Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance
Program have annual incomes under $15,000. For two-thirds of the households, income is under
$8,000. In 1992, the Department of Energy completed a careful evaluation of the actual energy and
cost savings resulting from the weatherization of low-income homes. Results indicated that the net
benefits of the program significantly exceeded its costs.<BR>
<P>
Energy costs for public and assisted housing, paid by the Federal Government through the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, are about $4 billion per year. These units are
substantially less energy efficient than similar market-rate dwellings and the energy costs represent
a sizable portion of their Department of Housing and Urban Development operating subsidies. To
increase the quality and affordability of low-income housing, the Department of Energy and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development have recently joined in Energy Partnerships for
Affordable Homes with the goal of 30 percent energy-efficiency gains in more than 1 million
Department of Housing and Urban Development-assisted housing units by the year 2000.<BR>
<P>
Additionally, since 1979 Congress has provided funds to the States through the Department of
Health and Human Services to assist low-income households pay energy bills, especially bills for
essential energy services, such as heating. The program has enabled hundreds of thousands of
households to avoid cutoffs of energy supplies and has enabled many others to afford minimal
levels of comfort in their homes. The program has been especially vital during periods of rapidly
rising energy costs, such as the steep rise in fuel oil costs during the 1990-91 winter, or the severe
cold of the 1993-94 winter. Currently, the Federal Government provides about $1.3 billion per
year for this purpose, which is supplemented by many utilities and some States.<BR>
<P>
Assistance for Schools, Hospitals, and Other Public Buildings. The Administration supports
efficiency investments in public and nonprofit schools and hospitals through a matching grant
program for these institutions. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, these funds were
supplemented substantially by oil-overcharge funds available to States. This program has
supported efficiency investments of $1.8 billion since 1979, and the affected institutions report
savings of $5.6 billion through fiscal year 1994. </BODY>

<H4><a name="3.16">Remaining Challenges and Opportunities</H4></a>
Utility sector restructuring and improved technologies for monitoring and controlling building
energy use will likely lead to major changes in building energy markets over the next decade. The
overall effects of these changes are impossible to predict at this time, but utility support of
demand-side management programs has already been reduced or refocused in some areas and
may undergo major near-term changes as utilities compete more effectively in less regulated
markets. A key challenge for Federal and State policymakers will be determining how to
encourage the continuation of effective utility demand-side management efforts-or comparable
efforts-in the context of these more competitive markets.<BR>
<P>
The barriers to the entry of radically new technologies, such as compact fluorescent light bulbs and
heat-pump water heaters, can be especially difficult for manufacturers to overcome and represent
another key challenge. Federal and State policymakers must strike an appropriate balance between
regulatory mandates and voluntary programs that accelerate the market entry of such technology,
especially in areas where major technology changes could result in very large efficiency and
economic gains for most consumers and the Nation.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.17">Industry: Using Energy-Efficient Technologies To Improve Productivity and Reduce Waste</H4></a>
U.S. industries form the backbone of our Nation's economic strength. The industrial sector
encompasses more than 360,000 manufacturing, forestry, agricultural, construction, and mining
facilities. These facilities employ more than 28 million people, or about one-quarter of the total
U.S. work force and produce more than $900 billion in goods and services. In producing our
material goods in an increasingly competitive global market and providing high-wage jobs,
industry consumes vast amounts of energy and creates a substantial public burden in the form of
pollution. Industry faces the ongoing challenges of improving productivity, enhancing product
quality, and complying with environmental requirements. Through strategic R&D, technology
demonstrations, information and education, industry recognition, and market facilitation, the
Administration supports industry efforts to<a name="ip"></a><a href="ch3bx4.html"> improve productivity</a> while cutting energy use, emissions, and waste generation. <BR>
<P>
Industry uses about 38 percent of the Nation's primary energy for fuel and feedstocks, for which
the manufacturing sector alone pays about $100 billion per year. This energy is consumed in
roughly equal amounts in electricity generation and in the direct use of natural gas and petroleum-
based fuels. Industry accounts for more than one-quarter of total U.S. petroleum consumption,
approximately one-third of which is for petrochemical feedstocks. <BR>
<P>
The industrial sector also has a major impact on the environment. Each year, industry produces
more than 14 billion tons of hazardous and nonhazardous waste products. Direct consumption of
fossil fuels generated about 290 million metric tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide
emissions in 1993, accounting for one-fifth of the Nation's total carbon dioxide emissions from
human activities. Including industry's share of emissions from electricity generation, industrial
energy use accounted for one-third of the carbon dioxide emissions. Industry's fuel and electricity
use also generated about 7.5 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide (38 percent of the U.S. total) and
5.3 million metric tons of nitrogen oxides (25 percent of the total).<BR>
<P>
Between 1972 and 1991, industry reduced the amount of energy required for every dollar of output
(energy intensity) by 30 percent, with two-thirds of these savings from improvements in energy
efficiency. Much of this decline in energy intensity occurred in response to higher energy prices
and increased concern about the reliability of energy supplies and markets. When energy prices
began to fall in the mid-1980s, however, the rate of efficiency improvement also slowed; between
1970 and 1980, energy intensity declined by 2.5 percent per year, but the rate of decline has
dropped to below 1 percent in recent years.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.18">Partnering With Industry in Developing New Technologies</H4></a>
A number of industries facing market challenges are curtailing R&D at a time when, in fact, there
is a strong need for U.S. industry to pursue the development and adoption of innovative, cost-
effective, environmentally superior technologies that will help the industry remain competitive in
global markets. Aside from the ordinary risk of conducting R&D, firms that would be potential
buyers of new technologies are often reluctant to invest in first-of-a-kind process equipment, even
if pilot-tested and determined to be technically sound and cost-effective. Administration policy
focuses Federal support to help sustain R&D efforts and reduce investment risks for energy
technologies that can boost overall productivity, cut end-of-pipe cleanup costs, and promote
pollution prevention.<BR>
<P>
Government-Industry Consortia Research and Commercialization. An example of government-
industry partnership is the joint effort by the Department of Energy and the American Iron and
Steel Institute to develop an energy-efficient, economically competitive, continuous process to
replace conventional steelmaking operations involving coke ovens, blast furnaces, and basic
oxygen furnaces. Another is the development of advanced fluid catalytic cracking units for the
U.S. refining industry that can reduce oil consumption by better tailoring product yields to meet
reformulated gasoline formulas and to achieve higher yields per barrel processed.<BR>
<P>
Industries of the Future. The Industries of the Future program aligns Federal investment in
technology research, development, and deployment with the needs and expectations of technology
users in the private sector. Industries of the Future focuses on seven industries that are vital to the
manufacturing sector and the health of the U.S. economy-steel, aluminum, chemicals, petroleum
refining, glass, forest and paper products, and metal casting. These industries account for about 80
percent of the energy consumed in U.S. manufacturing and more than 90 percent of U.S. Industrial waste, and they represent the biggest opportunities to increase energy efficiency and reduce the generation of waste.<BR>
<P>
Industries of the Future establishes partnerships between industry and Government to aid in the
development and application of energy efficient, environmentally beneficial technologies while also
improving industrial competitiveness. Industry participants first outline a vision that reflects the
dynamic impact of market, business, social, and regulatory drivers in their industries. The vision
defines the context within which technology development priorities are set. The industry then
develops a technology road map toward achieving the vision, which the Department of Energy
draws upon to shape an R&D program that is also aligned with the Department's mission. The
result is a Government R&D agenda that is well matched to the technology needs of our vital
process industries.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.19">Accelerating Deployment of Energy-Efficiency Technologies</H4></a>
Performance and cost information on efficient technologies is not readily accessible to all
participants in the marketplace who need it, especially small- and medium-sized companies. And
because the information needs of individual industries are so diverse and fragmented, available
information is often confusing and inconsistent and does not get to the decisionmakers who need
it. <BR>
<P>
The Administration supports programs that help transfer the results of R&D efforts to industry
and encourage the adoption of state-of-the-art technology. These programs increase awareness of
opportunities to save energy, lower costs, and reduce wastes, particularly for smaller firms; and
they help create markets for new technology and services. Specific ongoing programs are
highlighted below.<BR>
<P>
National Industrial Competitiveness through Energy, Environment, and Economics (NICE3).
NICE3 is a cost-shared grant program with businesses, States, and Federal agencies (the
Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency) to advance competitiveness by
demonstrating technology applications that increase productivity and energy efficiency and reduce
wastes. Projects are selected on the basis of economic profitability, potential energy and waste
savings, cost-efficiency, capability, degree of innovation, and resources leveraged. Twenty-nine
projects have already been funded through the NICE3 program; nine have already produced
commercially viable technologies that are currently operating in industry to reduce costs, energy
use, and industrial waste.<BR>
<P>
By the year 2000, the current NICE3 projects are projected to result in savings to industry of about
$8 billion per year. This results from a Federal investment of only $11.4 million through fiscal
year 1995.<BR>
<P>
Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Centers/Industrial Assessment Centers. This program uses the
expertise and resources of engineering faculty and students at major U.S. universities to provide
no-cost energy efficiency and waste reduction assessments for the small- and medium-sized
manufacturers that make up about 64 percent of the manufacturing sector. These firms often do
not have in-house expertise or staff to address energy efficiency or waste minimization
improvements. The average energy-efficiency audit recommends improvements that can lead to
energy savings of about 4 billion Btu, with annual dollar savings of about $40,000. Since 1976,
these university-based centers have conducted more than 5,100 industrial energy audits or
assessments, providing approximately 1,000 university students with energy management
experience. The investments made as a result of these recommendations have saved industry more
than $500 million in energy bills and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by about 300,000 metric
tons of carbon-equivalent.<BR>
<P>
By the close of 1994, Industrial Assessment Centers had conducted more than 5,000 assessments,
helping manufacturers save $517 million and 94 trillion Btu worth of energy and eliminating
200,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases (carbon equivalent)-all for a total Federal investment of
only $27 million.<BR>
<P>
Motor Challenge. There are substantial opportunities for improving the efficiency of electric motor
use, beyond improving the motor itself, through improved integration of motors, drives, and
driven equipment to optimize performance of the overall "motor system." Strengthening the
existing market capability to provide higher performance, systems-oriented products and services
is central to capturing these opportunities for greater efficiency improvements in the electric motor
system and other industrial equipment markets.<BR>
<P>
The Motor Challenge program will increase market penetration of energy-efficient industrial
electric motor systems and encourage industry to adopt a systems approach in developing,
purchasing, and managing equipment. The Motor Challenge engages industry, Government, and
utility partners in information exchange, conferences, seminars, and training activities. Showcase
demonstrations are sponsored with industry partners to demonstrate existing or new applications
of efficient electric motor systems. The Motor Challenge is also developing an electric motor
systems data base that will contain performance data on motor systems in practical applications,
and it is working with industry to develop market transformation strategies to stimulate market
demand for motor system equipment with improved efficiency. <BR>
<P>
By the year 2000, the Motor Challenge program will save 25  billion kilowatts per year. This will
reduce emissions by the equivalent of 6 million metric tons of carbon per year.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.20">Remaining Challenges and Opportunities</H4></a>
The different timeframes between R&D outcomes and regulatory requirements represent a
significant challenge for Federal programs designed to help industry develop and deploy energy-
efficient pollution prevention technologies. Innovative technologies can take a decade or more to
develop into commercial products, while the time given industry to comply with certain regulatory
requirements is often shorter. The Administration is coordinating activities that support technology
development for energy efficiency and pollution prevention with the evolving system of
environmental regulation, described more fully in Chapter 6. By supporting efficient and clean
technologies that would contribute to a more flexible and cost-effective environmental
management system, the Administration's programs will ensure that a cleaner and more
competitive industrial sector will emerge in the 21st century.<BR>

<H2>Chapter 4: Develop a Balanced Domestic Energy Resource Portfolio </H2>
<HR><P>
<I>(Note: Figures referenced in this chapter have not been included at this time.)</I><P>
 
To achieve the goals of increased energy productivity, pollution prevention, and enhanced national
security, the Nation must make the most efficient use of a diverse portfolio of domestic energy
resources that will allow us to meet our energy needs today, tomorrow, and well into the 21st
century. The Administration continues to promote the economically beneficial and environmentally
sound expansion of domestic energy resources.<BR>
<P>
Our domestic energy resources include coal, petroleum, natural gas, nuclear energy, and renewable
energy (primarily hydropower, biomass, geothermal, and wind). About 85 percent of the energy
we consume comes from fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas (see Figure 14). In the year
2010, we undoubtedly will use greater amounts of renewable energy resources, but still will rely
primarily on the energy resources that we use today. Further into the 21st century, we could rely
much more heavily on solar and other renewable resources, and our energy portfolio may include
hydrogen and fusion energy. <BR>
<P>
Sustainable development of energy resources means that we must efficiently use our existing
domestic resources today and augment the resources that are available for the future. Some
domestic resources, such as natural gas and oil, must be developed in ways that ensure these
resources are not abandoned and are economically accessible. Developing and deploying advanced
energy technologies today will ensure that we will have the necessary means to produce and use
our energy resources when we need them. Maximizing the cost-effective use of our relatively clean
energy resources, such as renewables and natural gas, will ensure that future generations will
inherit a cleaner environment.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.1">The Federal Role in Helping To Develop a Domestic Energy Resource Portfolio</H4></a>
The Federal Government has a vital role to play in the development of energy technology and in
the stewardship of our domestic natural resources. The private sector alone may not provide all of
the technology that we will need to find, produce, and use our domestic energy resources and to
compete in world energy markets. Even the largest energy companies often are unwilling to make
substantial investments in long-term and high-risk research and development (R&D). Through
partnership with industry, the Federal Government can help develop and demonstrate promising,
but still unproven, advanced energy supply and utilization technologies-especially those
technologies that have substantial public benefits such as improved environmental performance.
To the extent that the private sector cannot or will not do so, the Federal Government invests at all
stages of technology development to ensure that all Americans will have the clean and affordable
energy they will need in the future.<BR>
<P>
In the near term, Federal policy helps ensure that our energy industries remain viable, providing
jobs for Americans and energy to the Nation. By supporting our energy industries through
appropriate tax treatment, sound regulatory decisionmaking, and R&D programs that help reduce
costs, the Federal Government can help ensure that U.S. industries will continue to meet the
competitive challenges of the global economy.<BR>
<P>
To maintain economic growth and enhance national security, we must diversify our energy
resources and increase the efficiency of energy use. To ensure a cleaner environment, we must
increase our use of cleaner energy resources, such as renewables and natural gas, and we must
develop technologies that will allow us to produce and use existing energy resources in ways that
will result in fewer harmful effects on the environment.<BR>
<P>
To achieve our national goals, the Administration is working to promote the efficient development
and use of a domestic energy resource portfolio by-<BR>
<P>
<ul><li>Partnering with industry to research, develop, and deploy advanced technologies that will
allow industry to explore for, produce, develop, and use our domestic energy resources more
efficiently, more safely, with fewer harmful effects on the environment, and in more applications<BR>
<P>
<li>Providing appropriate tax and other fiscal incentives to support our domestic energy
resource industries<BR>
<P>
<li>Stimulating markets for clean energy technologies, such as natural gas and renewable
energy<BR>
<P>
<li>Reforming and streamlining regulations to make energy markets more efficient, to allow
our domestic energy resources to compete in energy markets, and to better weigh costs against
risks<BR>
<P>
<li>Promoting U.S. energy resources and advanced energy technologies abroad<BR>
<P></ul>
As discussed below, the Administration's policy is to apply the appropriate tools to each sector,
and to make the best use of taxpayer dollars by aligning budgetary priorities with national goals.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.2">Oil: Enhancing Domestic Production Capability</H4></a>
The growing level of U.S. oil consumption raises potential economic and national security
concerns. In addition to emphasizing efficient use of oil products and enhancing fuel flexibility,
national energy policy must address declining domestic production levels with minimum
interference with market forces. The Administration's policy is to improve the economics of
domestic oil production by reducing costs, in order to lessen the impact on this industry of low and
volatile prices.<BR>
<P>
Petroleum products account for nearly 40 percent of the energy consumed in the United States, and
this share is expected by most analysts to remain constant for the next decade. Investment in oil
exploration and production activity in the United States is related directly to the price of oil in
international markets as well as to costs of domestic production. Exploration and production
spending by major U.S. oil companies is increasing overseas, rather than in the United States, and
independent producers increasingly are unable to respond alone to the technically demanding and
highly volatile price environment that characterizes the oil industry.<BR>
<P>
U.S. crude oil production decreased for most of the 1970s, stabilized or increased slightly in the
early 1980s (mostly because of production in Alaska), and has been decreasing since 1986. Oil
fields are being abandoned at an increasingly high rate, resulting in the loss of billions of barrels of
oil reserves each year.<BR>
<P>
At the same time, industry cost-cutting since 1986 has yielded domestic finding costs similar to
foreign finding costs, and technical innovation is increasing production efficiency. Still, the
domestic oil industry is characterized mainly by marginal, high-cost production. The few areas of
high production at lower per-barrel costs-parts of Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and deep
formations in the Rockies and elsewhere-have not offset the decline in the domestic resource base.
With declining industry profitability caused by low prices and high price volatility, long-term
industry R&D spending dropped by $400 million per year between 1985 and 1992, and the
decline is continuing. The consequences of this decline in private R&D not only are being felt
today, but will be especially severe after the turn of the century if the introduction of new
exploration and production technologies effectively stops. <BR>
<P>
The price of oil is set by the world market; the U.S. Government cannot exert much influence on
this critical component of industry revenues. Consequently, the best opportunity for the Federal
Government to improve the economics of domestic oil production is to help reduce costs.
Throughout the Federal Government, the Administration is pursuing various ways of lowering
costs, including R&D support, and targeted tax and regulatory reform.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.3">Partnering With Industry To Develop Advanced Supply Technologies</H4></a>
Continued development and deployment of <a name="ad"></a>advanced technology can ameliorate the decline in domestic oil production through enhanced recovery in existing fields and increased ability to find new sources. Advanced technologies reduce operating costs, improve process reliability, develop flexible processes, and meet environmental requirements. <BR>
<P>
The Administration supports government- industry cost-sharing partnerships to meet high-priority needs. The Department of Energy's oil R&D program addresses these needs, which include maintaining access to valuable reserves threatened by shut-in, recovering more of the oil resource in the ground, finding oil in geologically difficult areas, and complying with environmental requirements.<BR>
<P>
By 2010, it is estimated that domestic oil production linked to the deployment of advanced
exploration and production technologies supported by the Administration will be 1 million barrels
per day.<BR>
<P>
Through the Department of Energy's Advanced Computation Technology Initiative (ACTI), the
Federal Government also is making available to domestic oil and gas producers extraordinary
computational and modeling skills developed by the Department's weapons laboratories as part of
their national security mission. These cutting-edge computer technologies can aid in the search for
new resources and can optimize extraction from existing reservoirs.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.4">Providing Appropriate Incentives To Increase Domestic Exploration and Production</H4></a>
Although limited by the need to reduce the Federal budget deficit, financial incentives can provide
support and reduce barriers to selected promising activities that the private sector deems too risky
to develop or that are at risk of premature abandonment during periods of depressed market prices.
Financial incentives can take many forms, including reductions in Federal income taxes, reduced
royalty rates for natural gas or oil production on Federal lands, and assistance to the industry in
improving access to capital markets.<BR>
<P>
One of our best opportunities for adding large new oil reserves can be found in the central and
western Gulf of Mexico, particularly in deeper water. Royalty relief can be a key to timely access
to this important resource. The Administration supports targeted royalty relief to encourage the
production of domestic oil and natural gas resources in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico. This step
will help to unlock the estimated 15 billion barrels of oil-equivalent in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico, providing new energy supplies for the future, spurring the development of new
technologies, and supporting thousands of jobs in the gas and oil industry and affiliated industries.<BR>
<P>
The Administration also supports a royalty rate reduction for onshore heavy-oil wells to improve
ultimate recovery and increase the domestic oil reserve base. The Department of the Interior's
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has proposed a rulemaking that would provide royalty relief
for heavy-oil wells. This relief would reduce the abandonment rate for marginally economic
heavy-oil wells and would increase reserves by up to 40 million barrels of oil.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.5">Reforming Regulations To Reduce Uncertainties and Costs</H4></a>
Throughout the Federal Government, the Administration is working to streamline regulations
governing all industries and, in particular, the oil industry. These reforms will have significant
benefits for natural gas producers as well. Virtually all aspects of the oil industry are governed by
regulations concerning environmental issues, exploration and production activities, royalties, and
taxes. The current Federal and State regulatory framework lacks incentives for cost-effective
pollution control and innovation and adoption of promising technologies. These regulations are
often complex, duplicative, and inflexible. Industry faces increased regulatory uncertainty and high
compliance costs, while Federal, State, and local governments also spend more than necessary on
implementing and enforcing regulations.<BR>
<P>
The Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS), which manages the
leasing of Federal outer continental shelf (OCS) petroleum and natural gas resources, is reviewing
its regulations in the following areas: (1) deepwater production rules governing subsea installations
and the flaring or venting of small amounts of gas; (2) blowout, safety, and pollution prevention
equipment; (3) conservation and diligent development requirements; (4) management of
directional survey drilling; (5) requirements regarding construction and removal of platforms; (6)
daily pollution inspection requirements; and (7) training. Regulatory changes may be appropriate
for all of these areas, and MMS is studying proposals to address these issues.<BR>
<P>
MMS has completed a negotiated rulemaking process for gas valuation on Federal leases and
initiated similar efforts for Indian leases. MMS issued final regulations facilitating company
recoupment of certain payments associated with OCS leases and is examining regulations to
reduce or eliminate certain reporting requirements and to make it easier and cheaper for companies
to properly report and pay royalties. MMS is looking at changes to lease terms and royalty rates
that would encourage more domestic production.<BR>
<P>
The Royalty Management Program, which governs the collection of royalty revenues from Federal
onshore and offshore lands, is being reviewed in the following areas: (1) valuation of natural gas
from unitized properties, and the responsibilities of payers and lessees; (2) procedures for
obtaining refunds and credits for excess royalty payments from OCS production; (3) penalties and
assessments for improper reporting; and (4) streamlining of the MMS administrative appeals
process.<BR>
<P>
The BLM has conducted a sweeping review of its oil and gas leasing program to make its onshore
leasing program more efficient and responsive. In April 1995, the review team published its
report, which contained a list of proposals for improving the onshore oil and gas leasing program.
Examples of these proposals include the following: simplifying unitization and communications
agreements; simplifying requirements related to oil sampling and to gas flaring and venting;
eliminating duplicate bonding requirements; developing a pilot program for environmental
compliance self-certification; and selectively increasing bonding amounts for problem-prone
operations.<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy also is funding the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission in an
effort to streamline regulations governing the exploration and production of oil and natural gas on
Federal lands. The Commission has convened a working group to examine State and Federal
requirements on Federal lands and to recommend ways to reduce duplication, share information
and resources, and reduce costs. This 3-year effort focuses on the States with the greatest amount
of production from Federal land: California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.6">Removing Artificial Market Barriers</H4></a>
The Administration supports lifting the ban on the export of Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil.
ANS crude oil is geographically convenient to only 20 percent of U.S. refining capacity. Since the
North Slope reached full production in the mid-1970s, ANS crude oil that cannot be used on the
West Coast has had to be shipped more than 13,000 miles to Gulf Coast markets. Confronted with
this expensive option, ANS producers have been forced to sell ANS crude on the West Coast at
prices considerably lower than the oil's value to refiners. Historically, this discount also has helped
to depress California crude oil prices.<BR>
<P>
Removing the ban on exporting ANS crude oil will allow the marginal supply of ANS crude to
seek its true value in world markets. It will create additional employment, raise royalty collection
for the Federal Government and revenues for the States of Alaska and California, and lift domestic
oil production by roughly 100,000 barrels per day. ANS exports will contribute to energy
production and economic growth, without employment dislocation, environmental degradation, or
significant increases in retail petroleum product prices. In the event of an oil emergency, the
President could terminate the exports.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.7">Supporting Exploration and Production of New Supplies in Environmentally Sensitive Ways</H4></a>
The Administration supports exploration for and production of oil and natural gas in areas that are
not environmentally sensitive. For example, through technology R&D and appropriate financial
incentives, the Administration is <a name="expp"></a>supporting exploration and production of oil and natural gas in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. More than 40 million acres of public lands are covered by oil and gas leases, and BLM has issued competitive oil and gas leases on more than 4 million acres of public lands and has approved more than 4,300 drilling permits in the past 2 years.<BR>
<P>
The Administration continues to oppose opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)
and certain Outer Continental Shelf areas for oil and natural gas development. ANWR is just one
part of the Alaska North Slope oil exploration and development picture. There are extensive State
and Federal lands that can be developed without the need for development in ANWR, and the
Alaska Department of Natural Resources' Oil and Gas Division estimates that about 6.2 billion
barrels of oil remain to be developed on the North Slope outside of ANWR.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.8">Reforming the Regulatory Structure Governing Refining Activities</H4> </a>
The Administration's policy is to simplify the complex regulatory structure governing refining
activities and capital investment. This will speed investment in clean, efficient, and competitive
refining technologies.<BR>
<P>
U.S. refining capacity increased by almost 50 percent during the 1970s, but fell during the 1980s
and has remained in the range of 15 million to 16 million barrels per day so far in the 1990s. The
configuration of the industry has changed substantially over this period. While U.S. refining
capacity today is close to what it was in the mid-1970s, the number of operable refineries has
dropped by one-third, reflecting the trend away from smaller, more inefficient refineries, and the
capacity to process heavier, high-sulfur crude oils has increased significantly. On a capacity basis,
the ability to remove sulfur from petroleum products has doubled. The net result is that U.S.
refineries are able to process heavier, higher sulfur crude oils and make a wider range of light
petroleum products than they could in the 1970s or even in the 1980s. <BR>
<P>
Today's refineries are cleaner, and the products they manufacture are less damaging to the
environment. Lead has been phased out of gasoline; and, as a result of the lowering of its vapor
pressure, gasoline is less likely to emit toxic substances such as benzene. Sulfur content in diesel
fuel and residual oils is substantially lower. <BR>
<P>
Virtually all of these improvements have resulted from Federal and State environmental regulation,
but such regulations have become expensive. The National Petroleum Council estimated that
capital expenditures of $37 billion (1990 dollars) will be needed in the refining industry between
1991 and the year 2000 for product quality and stationary source regulatory compliance.<BR>
<P>
The challenge of the 1990s for the petroleum refining industry is to find ways to become more
efficient and clean and to reduce the costs of environmental compliance. If the regulatory burden
on domestic refiners drives the industry offshore, energy security concerns will intensify.<BR>
<P>
Addressing these issues, the Environmental Protection Agency's Common Sense Initiative is
designed to identify "cheaper, cleaner, smarter" ways of achieving our environmental objectives.
The initiative brings together industry, the States, the Federal Government, and public interest
groups to identify and implement both short- and long-term opportunities to simplify
environmental regulations and policies. In the oil refinery sector, the initiative will identify the
permit, regulatory, and statutory areas of flexibility that will increase the refining industry's
flexibility and lower its costs, without sacrificing environmental performance.<BR>
<P>
Additionally, the Department of Energy's Refinery of the Future initiative is assisting the refining
industry to hasten the transition from responding to command and control environmental
regulation to developing and adopting pollution-avoidance and resource conservation technologies.
The Department will assist industry in developing and deploying novel or improved high-priority
process technologies and an advanced technology base that will (1) maintain or enhance industry
competitiveness, (2) foster the evolution of more economic approaches for reducing effluent
hazardous and nonhazardous waste streams, (3) improve overall refinery energy efficiency, and
(4) promote greater flexibility in utilization of alternative energy, feedstock, and raw material
inputs.</BODY><HR>

<H4><a name="4.9">Natural Gas: Increasing Efficient Utilization</H4></a>
The Administration's policy is to maximize the economic, environmental, and national security
benefits of increased use of natural gas. To implement this policy, the Administration focuses on
collaboration with industry to develop advanced natural gas technologies, provide incentives for
increased exploration and production, stimulate end-use markets, and continue regulatory reforms
that reduce costs and increase efficiency.<BR>
<P>
Natural gas provides approximately 24 percent of the energy consumed in the United States,
heating 57 percent of U.S. homes and serving 175 million consumers. Approximately 45 percent
of natural gas delivered to end-users is used to provide energy in the industrial sector, 14 percent is
used to generate electricity, and 16 percent is used in the commercial sector. In 1993, more than
300,000 Americans were employed in the search for and production of crude oil and natural gas,
while an additional 196,000 Americans were employed by U.S. natural gas utilities. <BR>
<P>
The United States has a vast <a name="recgas"></a><a href="ch4bx3.html">recoverable natural gas resource</a> base. In its 1992 study, the National Petroleum Council estimates a technically recoverable gas resource base for the lower 48 States of 1,295 trillion cubic feet (tcf), sufficient gas to meet U.S. demand at current levels for about 60 years. The U.S. Geological Survey projects that technically recoverable onshore natural gas reserves in the United States are about 1,074 tcf, 11 percent higher than their 1989 estimate.  Moreover, our North American Free Trade Agreement partners, Canada and Mexico, also have large supplies of natural gas that can help us to reduce the growth of oil imports from unstable
sources.<BR>
<P>
Natural gas has fewer harmful effects on the environment than other fossil fuels. Natural gas has
virtually no sulfur emissions, lower emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), and extremely low
particulate emissions. Natural gas has approximately 30 percent lower carbon dioxide emissions
than oil and 45 percent lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal on an energy-equivalent basis.
Finally, natural gas combustion does not generate solid waste. Increased use of natural gas is a
cornerstone of the Administration's Climate Change Action Plan, as one of the measures used to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.<BR>
<P>
Over the past two decades, natural gas markets have become increasingly competitive, largely
because of Federal legislation and regulatory reforms. The sale of natural gas at the wellhead has
been deregulated, and the interstate transportation of natural gas has been opened to third parties.
These reforms have provided natural gas consumers with the ability to shop for the most
economic gas supplies.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.10">Partnering With Industry To Develop Advanced Natural Gas Technologies</H4></a>
Through the Department of Energy's natural gas supply R&D program, the Administration is
investing in a new generation of technologies to reduce the cost, ensure long-term supply, and
increase the use of natural gas.<BR>
<P>
In the 21st century, natural gas supply will depend increasingly on drilling and producing from
reservoirs that are more difficult to develop because of their depth and size, hardness of the rock,
lack of permeability, or the quality of the natural gas they contain. New advanced drilling system
technology to induce fractures or to locate and drill through natural fractures is needed to convert
such natural gas resources into proved reserves. These technologies will address both the technical
barriers in such areas as 3-D seismology, horizontal drilling, and fracture detection, as well as the
cost savings associated with drilling faster and with less damage to the reservoir.<BR>
<P>
By 2010, it is estimated that domestic natural gas production linked to deployment of advanced
exploration and production technologies supported by the Administration will be 2 trillion cubic
feet per year, or about 10 percent of current U.S. consumption<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy's natural gas R&D program focuses increasingly on the development
and deployment of the best and most efficient natural gas end-use technologies, such as natural
gas-fired space air-conditioning equipment for residential and commercial applications; natural
gas-fueled vehicles that are more reliable, produce lower emissions, and have longer cruising
ranges than the current generation vehicles; high-efficiency, industrial gas turbines with low
nitrogen oxide emissions to meet future electricity generation needs; and fuel cells that chemically
convert natural gas to electricity at efficiencies of 50 to 60 percent.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.11">Providing Appropriate Incentives To Increase Exploration and Production</H4></a>
The Administration supports providing appropriate revenue-neutral incentives to increase natural
gas exploration and production. The Administration is exploring a royalty rate reduction for
onshore marginal natural gas wells, similar to the "Stripper Program" rule currently in effect for
oil, that will conserve resources, improve ultimate recovery of finite resources, increase the
domestic natural gas reserve base, and promote the production of natural gas.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.12">Stimulating Markets for Natural Gas Use</H4></a>
The two markets with the largest growth potential for natural gas are transportation vehicles and
electricity generation. The Administration is working to stimulate these markets by purchasing
natural gas vehicles for Federal fleets, by providing tax incentives, and by encouraging the use of
natural gas for electric power generation.<BR>
<P>
As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Federal Government is providing leadership in
purchasing alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs), including natural gas vehicles, for Federal fleets. In
1993, by executive order, the President increased the AFV targets. By the end of fiscal year 1994,
the Federal Government had purchased 6,700 natural gas vehicles. Using fiscal year 1995 funds,
the Federal Government plans to purchase an additional 9,250 natural gas vehicles. These
purchases represent 59 percent of planned Federal AFV stock, and 20 percent of natural gas
vehicles nationwide.<BR>
<P>
To promote further the penetration of natural gas vehicles into the transportation sector, the Federal
Government provides tax deductions for AFV purchases, including natural gas vehicles, of up to
$2,000 per vehicle, and for AFV refueling facilities of up to $100,000 per location.<BR>
<P>
It is likely that at least half of all new electricity generation capacity to be added in the United States
over the next 20 years will be natural gas-fired. New gas turbines and combined-cycle technology
are making gas the fuel of choice for many utilities, and these technologies have been improved
through Federal R&D efforts. However, a principal impediment to increasing utility market
penetration by natural gas is electric utilities' concern about reliable, long-term natural gas supplies.
The Administration, through the Department of Energy and the Energy Information
Administration, is working to allay these concerns by providing timely data on the availability and
deliverability of domestic natural gas supplies.<BR>
<P>
By 2010, commercial deployment of advanced natural gas power technologies supported by the
Administration is projected to attain 16 gigawatts of electric capacity investment per year in
domestic and export markets.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.13">Reforming Regulations To Reduce Costs and Increase Efficiency</H4></a>
The Administration supports continued regulatory reform throughout the Federal Government to
reduce the cost of natural gas exploration and production and to increase efficiency in natural gas
markets. The regulatory reforms described in the Oil section of this chapter apply to the
exploration and development of natural gas as well. In addition, the Administration has explored
regulatory reforms that could expand the role of natural gas in end-use markets.<BR>
<P>
Sales of natural gas occur in markets where regulation influences consumers' decisions regarding
the commercial attractiveness of the fuel. The Administration will continue to promote a
competitive natural gas industry that offers more and better choices to energy consumers. To this
end, the Administration supports regulatory reforms to ensure a more robust secondary market for
interstate natural gas pipeline transportation capacity, to promote efficient and fair pricing of natural
gas transportation service, and to expedite the construction of new facilities to ensure reliable
natural gas delivery. The Department of Energy continues to support, on a collaborative basis,
States that are examining their regulations to bring the benefits of competition to retail natural gas
markets.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.14">Electricity: Promoting Competition in the National Interest </H4></a>
The electric power sector is the largest direct energy consumer in the United States, using 36
percent of all primary energy consumed in 1994, while providing power worth approximately
$200 billion annually to residential, commercial, and industrial users. The electric power
sector-including investor-owned, municipal and cooperatively owned, independent, and federally
owned power-has a combined capital investment of several hundred billion dollars, making this
sector one of the largest and most important economic sectors in the United States.<BR>
<P>
Over the past two decades, U.S. demand for electricity grew by about 3 percent per year, but this
growth in demand is expected to be slower between now and 2010, averaging slightly more than 1
percent per year. To meet the growing demand for electricity between 1975 and 1994, electric
utilities increased their annual consumption of primary energy by 10.5 quads. As shown in Figure
15, greater use of coal and nuclear power accounted for all of the increase, while also displacing
more than 2 quads of oil use per year. Currently, more than half the Nation's electricity is generated from coal, a share that most analysts expect to remain essentially steady for the next decade or two.  Nuclear power supplies 22 percent of total generation. Natural gas and renewables (including hydroelectric power) each account for about 10 percent, and the shares of both natural gas and nonhydroelectric renewables are expected to increase steadily over the next decade.<BR>
<P>
The U.S. electricity industry is in a period of fundamental change. The next several years will see a
transformation of the industry, affecting its organizational structure, the products and services it
delivers to customers, and the Federal and State institutions that regulate it. The transformation of
the industry and its regulatory institutions is being driven by a combination of forces, including the
following:<BR>
<P>
<ul><li>Broad recognition that the electricity-generation sector no longer is a natural monopoly and could be substantially deregulated<BR>
<P>
<li>Statutory changes, such as the Energy Policy Act of 1992, that promote increased
competition in bulk power markets<BR>
<P>
<li>Large disparities in electric rates from utility to utility, which encourage customers to seek
access to lower cost suppliers<BR>
<P>
<li>New low-cost generation technologies, which offer cheaper power and reduce the
economic value of existing traditional generation equipment<BR>
<P>
<li>The generally successful overall experience in recent years with reduced regulation in other
industries (for example, telecommunications and natural gas)</ul>
 
<H4><a name="4.15">Restructuring the Industry To Link Competition with National Goals</H4></a>
The Administration believes that prudent restructuring of the electricity industry should increase
competition, reduce consumers' electricity-related costs, maintain environmental protection, and
enhance economic productivity. Although complete deregulation of the industry is not possible
because transmission and distribution networks are still natural monopolies, there are significant
opportunities to increase competition in the industry. Many proposals for increasing competition
are now being considered at the State level. Meanwhile, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) has begun to consider appropriate changes in Federal regulations to
accommodate greater competition under the existing statutory framework. On March 29, 1995, the
FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that addresses key issues involved in moving
toward a more competitive wholesale electricity marketplace.<BR>
<P>
The Administration supports the scope and direction of the Commission's proposed rulemaking as
a constructive, even essential, starting point for enabling greater competition. Significant national
issues must be addressed under the general rubric of competition and restructuring as individual
State and Federal regulatory reform efforts evolve. These fall into two main categories: the near-
term transitional issues of stranded assets and the long-term design issues of stranded benefits.<BR>
<P>
Stranded Assets. Stranded assets (sometimes called stranded costs) refer to prudent investments
incurred or contracts entered under the existing regulatory framework whose costs are unlikely to
be recovered under more competitive market conditions. Examples include high-cost generating
units and some above-market contracts for wholesale power and fuels. These one-time transition
costs could be borne by investors or consumers, or both, depending on the restructuring policy
pursued. The extent to which the owners of these assets are forced to absorb the loss in economic
value or are able to recover costs in electricity rates during a transition period will partly determine
the structure of the emerging competitive industry. Because resolving the debate over stranded cost
recovery will accelerate the introduction of competition in the electricity industry, the
Administration supports restructuring proposals that address stranded cost issues in a fair and
equitable manner.<BR>
<P>
State and Federal regulators exploring competition have solicited ideas and suggestions regarding
appropriate mechanisms for potential recovery of stranded assets. One potential national issue is
the performance of nuclear power stations in competitive markets and the subsequent implications
for civilian radioactive waste disposal policy in the near term. The Administration will continue to
evaluate moves toward competition in terms of their impact on the civilian waste disposal
program.<BR>
<P>
Stranded Benefits. Stranded benefits refer to systemwide and social objectives currently served by
the regulated market that may be vulnerable under more competitive electricity markets. These
long-term design goals include ensuring system reliability, promoting end-use efficiency and
renewable energy investments, providing sufficient electricity-related R&D, encouraging
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, incorporating environmental considerations into resource
selection, and making minimum levels of service available to low-income consumers. The
Administration will support proposals for restructuring that promote the continued achievement of
these important electricity-related public policy objectives.<BR>
<P>
Many analysts question the ability of a competitive industry to provide a high level of efficiency
investments and services currently supported by utilities' integrated resource planning and demand-
side management efforts. Under some scenarios of market evolution, service providers vying for
differentiated market niches could promote aggressive efficiency measures by offering innovative
energy service contracts that would overcome traditional market barriers to demand-side
investments. Under other scenarios, however, intense commodity competition for the cheapest
electric power would deter innovative service providers, and market barriers would continue to
inhibit cost-effective energy-efficiency investments. Until more information emerges from State-
level competitive experiments, the Administration will support only those restructuring efforts
designed to enable high levels of cost-effective energy-efficiency investments.<BR>
<P>
The same commitment also extends to ensuring a strong market for renewable energy investments
and an appropriate level of electricity-related R&D conducted by a more competitive sector. The
Administration will continue to work with States, the FERC, Congress, the industry, and
consumer and environmental interests to ensure that greater competition in the electricity
marketplace serves the needs of consumers, investors, and the environment now and into the
future.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.16">Examining the Statutory Framework</H4></a>
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established the statutory framework that enables the market to
move toward greater competition. Recently, some utilities and other stakeholders have proposed
abolishing two key statutes that circumscribe and, detractors claim, unnecessarily hinder more
rapid movement toward a competitive market. The first is the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 (PUHCA), which significantly constrains the investments, financing mechanisms, and
corporate structures available to electric utility companies. The second is Section 210 of the Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), which encourages cogeneration and renewable energy
by requiring utilities to purchase electricity from designated generating sources at rates established
by State regulators under Federal guidelines.<BR>
<P>
Both statutes have played important roles in limiting anticompetitive behavior by utility
monopolies. Although market conditions have changed substantially since their inception, these
statutes continue to provide important safeguards and incentives that benefit consumers during the
present phase of industry evolution. As a clearer picture of industry structure and competitive
operation emerges from State actions and the FERC's ongoing regulatory reforms, however,
modifications of these statutes or their implementing regulations may become warranted. Given
the current status of industry restructuring proposals and the significant potential for greater
competition under the existing statutory framework, the Administration opposes the repeal of
Section 210 of PURPA at this time. However, the Administration will continue to assess the
prospects for changing regulatory implementation or undertaking statutory reforms of PURPA
and PUHCA in view of the national objectives of reliable, clean, and economic energy resources.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.17">Renewable Energy: Increasing Long-Term Investments</H4></a>
The Administration's energy policy promotes the development and deployment of renewable
energy resources and technologies in the United States and abroad. By helping to reduce costs and
by stimulating market adoption of U.S. renewable energy technologies, energy policy can
accelerate the environmental, economic, and security benefits of increased use of renewable
resources.	<BR>
<P>
The United States has an abundance of renewable energy resources. Renewable energy-which
includes photovoltaic, solar thermal, biomass (wood, wood waste, refuse, agricultural
commodities, both traditional and new, and agricultural waste), wind, geothermal, and hydropower technologies-accounts for approximately 10 percent of the electricity generated in the United States. Renewable resources also can be used as feedstocks from which to derive alternative transportation fuels, such as those derived from biomass. In addition, solar energy systems for space heating, water heating, and process heat augment energy supply by reducing demand for conventional energy resources.<BR>
<P>
During the last 15 years, intensive work by industry and the Department of Energy's national
laboratories has steadily increased the reliability of renewable energy systems while dramatically
lowering their costs. These systems are gradually becoming commercially competitive with
conventional power sources. Today, wind-generated electricity is nearly competitive with
conventional electric power in several regions; the United States has regained its lead in world
photovoltaic shipments; the geothermal heat pump industry is striving for 12 percent of the U.S.
space-conditioning market; the bioenergy industry is working to become a major new source of
electric power and transportation fuels (and a major new source of income for U.S. farmers and an
impetus for rural economic development); and hydrogen energy is being developed as a major
energy carrier for the future.<BR>
<P>
One indication of the global potential for renewable energy can be found in recent energy scenarios
developed by the Shell International Petroleum Company. In the "Sustainable Growth" scenario,
emerging renewable technologies progress along their learning curve, first capturing niche markets
and then gradually expanding to become broadly competitive during the early decades of the next
century. In this scenario, renewable energy resources would contribute 20 percent of commercial
worldwide energy by 2020, a contribution that could grow to more than 50 percent in the later part
of the 21st century as technologies mature and diffuse into the marketplace. <BR>
<P>
While such a scenario represents only a possibility-and not a prediction-it does suggest that great
potential exists for renewable energy resources. The primary challenge to expanding the role of
renewable energy resources in the domestic energy portfolio is the need to further reduce costs to
ensure that competitive renewable energy technology is available in expanding domestic and
international energy markets.<BR>
<P>
Programs supporting renewable electric supply will contribute 0.6 quad of primary energy in the
year 2000, saving $4 billion in annual fuel costs and reducing 7 million metric tons of carbon-
equivalent emissions.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.18">Partnering With Industry To Develop Lower Cost Renewable Resource Technologies</H4></a>
The Administration supports fundamental and applied research that helps the renewable industry
develop technologically advanced products. The Department of Energy's renewable energy R&D
programs support fundamental research in areas such as aerodynamics, solid-state physics,
reservoir engineering, combustion processes, and fermentation. Such research has contributed to
major advances in wind energy, photovoltaics, geothermal energy, biomass utilization, and liquid
fuels production. Applied research into thin reflective membrane deposition, airfoil design, and
solar module fabrication has reduced costs and increased productivity from solar thermal power
plants, wind turbines, and flat plate photovoltaic arrays.<BR>
<P>
In addition to renewable electric systems, technology programs are expected to produce nonelectric
energy contributions equivalent to 60 million barrels of imported oil per year in the year 2000 and
twice that amount in 2010. For example, the Department of Energy is advancing the development
of alternative transportation fuels. Through the Biofuels Program, the Department is working with
industry to develop transportation fuels from domestic biomass resources, to displace imports and
enhance rural economic development. The largest research program in this area focuses on
producing ethanol from agricultural and forestry residues, waste paper, and low-value industrial
wastes. The goal of the program is the commercial production of 600 million gallons of biomass
fuels by the year 2000, rising to 16.8 billion gallons by 2020, displacing more than 320 million
barrels of imported oil each year.<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy's Hydrogen Research Program works with industry and a scientific
advisory panel to develop safe, practical, and competitive hydrogen technologies to meet energy
needs. In fiscal year 1996, the program will operate a hydrogen delivery system using metal
hydride storage for mobile applications and scale up a laboratory-sized hydrogen storage and
production plant that will be suitable for export to developing countries in remote areas.<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy's Geothermal Electric RD&D program will reduce the cost of high-
temperature geothermal electricity by 20 percent in the years ahead, and by up to 40 percent for
moderate-temperature resources. It will help U.S. industry expand its domestic generating capacity
to 4,000 megawatts by the year 2000, while capturing 1,000 megawatts annually in international
markets. The movement of technologies into the marketplace requires additional investment in
applied research, development, and deployment of products to facilitate rapid return of embedded
investment costs to the point where industry and markets can take over. <BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy's Photovoltaic Systems Program supports private sector research to
develop roofing materials and windows that incorporate photovoltaics and can produce electricity.
These efforts are pursued in close collaboration with industry in programs with the Utility PV
Group.</BODY><BR>

<H4><a name="4.19">Stimulating Markets for Renewable Resources </H4></a>
The Administration is working throughout the Federal Government to identify and overcome
market barriers and accelerate market acceptance of cost-effective renewable energy technologies.
Integrated Resource Planning programs assist States in evaluating the contribution that renewables
can make to energy supply and environmental protection. Other Federal programs focus the
purchasing power of Federal agencies and help aggregate markets to provide market pull for
advanced technologies such as alternatively fueled vehicles, photovoltaic systems, and geothermal
heat pumps.<BR>
<P>
One important example is the Solar Enterprise Zone (SEZ) that has been proposed for the
Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site. Formerly used for weapons tests, this facility has an
excellent solar resource and efforts are under way to convert it to a solar power generation and
equipment manufacturing site. The Enron and Amoco corporations have proposed a joint 100-
megawatt photovoltaic manufacturing and generation project for the site.<BR>
<P>
The collaborative Biomass Power for Rural Development Initiative between the Department of
Energy and the Department of Agriculture is designed to demonstrate the economic and
environmental viability and sustainability of integrated feedstock production and power conversion
technologies through partnerships with farm communities to produce reliable supplies of biomass
feedstocks and cost-competitive electric power. A request for proposals has already garnered more
than 350 applications.<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy's Wind Energy Program provides incentives to utilities, manufacturers,
and third-party funders to develop multimegawatt wind energy farms using state-of-the-art
machines. In fiscal year 1996, the program will stimulate up to 150 megawatts of new installed
capacity, make six new advanced wind turbines available, and participate in up to 20 new cost-
shared partnerships.<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy also is helping U.S. renewable energy equipment and services firms
compete internationally by conducting trade missions and sustainable development demonstrations
in large, newly emerging privatized markets to stimulate market pull for these technologies.
Markets for photovoltaic, wind, and geothermal electric systems are emerging as especially
important. Special emphasis is placed on markets in Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, Africa,
and Eastern Europe.<BR>
<P>
Through partnerships with industry and international financial institutions such as the World Bank,
the Department of Energy has been able to leverage small commercialization investments in
renewable energy technologies to expanding overseas markets. The Department's Solar
International Program uses a variety of strategies to secure a greater U.S. market share by
addressing trade and other market barriers that continue to impede the acceptance of renewable
technologies abroad.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.20">Coal: Reducing Environmental Impacts</H4></a>
The Administration's policy is to help industry develop cleaner and more efficient uses for coal as
part of the U.S. energy portfolio. Because the primary risks of coal use are environmental rather
than economic or security-related, technology development and deployment that reduce
environmental impacts are critical to sustaining coal's contribution to U.S. energy needs.<BR>
<P>
The United States relies on coal for  22 percent of its total energy consumption. Fifty-five percent
of U.S. electricity is generated from coal, and EIA projects that coal will hold this market share
through at least 2010. Domestic coal resources are sufficiently large to sustain economic
production at high levels for several hundred years. In fact, the United States has more proved
reserves of coal on an energy-equivalent basis than the rest of the world has oil. In terms of market
price for delivered energy, coal is also our least expensive energy source, providing economical
energy for electric power and industrial needs.<BR>
<P>
Internationally, coal will continue to be a major source of fuel for electric power generation. Many
developing countries, such as China and India, will continue to use inexpensive, abundant,
indigenous coal to meet growing domestic needs. This trend could greatly increase the use of coal
worldwide as economies in these countries continue to expand.<BR>
<P>
In recent years, the major, long-term environmental concern about coal use has changed from acid
rain to greenhouse gas emissions primarily carbon dioxide from combustion and, to a lesser
extent, methane from mining operations. Coal accounts for more than one-third of U.S. human-
made carbon dioxide emissions, or about 4 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.21">Supporting Clean Coal Technology Development</H4></a>
Technological improvements over the past two decades have reduced significantly the
environmental impacts of coal combustion, and that trend is expected to continue for many of the
conventional regulated air pollutants. Today's technology can capture more than 95 percent of
sulfur dioxide emissions and 99.5 percent of particulates released from coal combustion. Nitrogen
oxide emissions, which are an important contributor to ozone (smog) formation, can be reduced
substantially by new burner technology and other emission controls. Many newer coal
technologies produce a benign solid waste or, in some cases, commercially marketable
byproducts. While no economic technologies currently exist to remove carbon dioxide from stack
gases, high-efficiency technology can cost-effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of
energy supplied.<BR>
<P>
Thus, while major environmental improvements have been made in our ability to use coal, the
biggest impediment to using coal in a sustainable energy future, particularly in developing
countries, is the cost of pollution control. Success in developing cleaner, more efficient and cost-
effective technology, coupled with persuading countries to implement environmental regulatory
systems that are responsive to economic and health constraints, will determine coal's ultimate role.<BR>
<P>
The long-term risk of investing in new technologies that have not been demonstrated in multiple
commercial applications inhibits the new technology market to such an extent that Federal
resources have been needed to help fund commercial demonstration efforts. The Department of
Energy's cost-shared Clean Coal Technology Demonstration Program, to which industry has
contributed $2 for every $1 of Federal money invested, has evolved from an early focus on
emission control systems to an emphasis in its later rounds on highly efficient, environmentally
superior advanced power systems. With thermal efficiencies that will approach 50 percent as these
technologies mature, compared with 35 percent for current state-of-the-art technologies, these clean
coal technologies can have a measurable effect on reducing carbon emissions. Emissions of acid
rain precursors from these advanced technologies are also well below those required for new
sources under the Clean Air Act and are especially valuable under the sulfur dioxide emission caps
established under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. <BR>
<P>
The emission-control technologies of the early rounds of Clean Coal Technology are now being
commercialized, and the advanced power systems of the later rounds also will reach commercial
status within a decade. Recent studies by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Coal
Council conclude that continued Federal support is needed to ensure that these advanced
technologies will be available. In the future, the Department of Energy will focus its coal R&D
program on advanced electric power technologies with efficiencies of 60 percent and 10 to 20
percent lower generating costs, making a new generation of power systems available through
government-industry cost-shared investments. <BR>
<P>
By 2010, commercial deployment of advanced coal power systems supported by the
Administration is projected to account for 56 gigawatts of capacity per year in both domestic and
export markets.<BR>
<P>
The Administration supports the efforts of U.S. vendors of clean coal technologies to export
equipment and services, because one key to commercial success would be expanding foreign
markets for these U.S. equipment makers. The use of clean and efficient U.S. generation
equipment, including clean coal technology, will help reduce the global environmental impacts
from expanded coal-fired generation and create U.S. jobs to develop and build these advanced
power systems.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.22">Improving Environmental Outcomes From Mining Operations	</H4></a>
If not done properly, the mining of coal can also have severe impacts on the environment. The
1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established the Federal Office of Surface
Mining and Enforcement (OSM) within the Department of the Interior to develop and implement
deferral reclamation standards for all coal surface mines in the United States. The Act also
provided States with the authority and funding to implement State programs that meet the minimal
Federal requirements.<BR>
<P>
Although controversy has plagued the implementation of the Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act since its inception, much progress has been made during the last 15 years in
cleaning up abandoned mines and in implementing standards for the environmentally safe mining
of  coal. To improve the relationship between State and Federal regulators, OSM has developed its
Shared Commitment policy with States and tribes to move its regulatory program to a higher level
of success. The goal is to ensure that OSM, the States, and tribes will work together in an
environmentally safe manner and that land and water will be restored after mining ceases.<BR>
<P>
OSM has also initiated its Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative. The initiative is a cooperative
effort between several Federal, State, and private agencies to restore streams in the Appalachian
region that have been plagued for decades by severe acid mine drainage from both abandoned and
current coal mining operations.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.23">Nuclear Energy: Increasing Safety and Preserving Options</H4></a>
The Administration's policy is to maintain the safe operation of existing nuclear plants in the
United States and abroad and to preserve the option to construct the next generation of nuclear
energy plants. The policy is implemented by working with industry to enhance safety and by
continuing to press for safe storage of spent nuclear fuel.<BR>
<P>
Nuclear energy supplies more than 20 percent of the Nation's electricity supply. Measured levels of safety at U.S. nuclear plants continue to improve, and production costs continue to decrease, as
plants increase their efficiency and production capability. Many of these plants are expected to seek
renewed licenses from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for an additional 20 years of
operation. However, some of them will close at, or even before, the end of their current license
terms.<BR>
<P>
The continued use of nuclear energy as a part of our energy resource portfolio depends on ensuring
the safe operation of the Nation's nuclear plants and providing an acceptable means of spent fuel
disposal. In addition, industry must acquire sufficient experiential data on long-term materials
degradation during plant lifetimes, as well as experience in implementing NRC requirements for
relicensing U.S. nuclear energy plants, to avoid premature shutdowns, fewer license renewals, and possible delays in orders for advanced nuclear energy plants.<BR>
<P>
Globally, a significant threat to nuclear safety is the continued operation of older Soviet-designed
reactors in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Many Soviet-designed plants
lack the high standards of safety demonstrated by the design, construction, and operation of
Western nuclear energy plants. <BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.24">Working With Industry To Maintain Safety Levels and Preserve Future Options</H4></a>
The Administration's policy is to increase operational safety at existing nuclear plants. The
Department of Energy will continue to assist utilities in extending the safe, efficient, economical,
and reliable operational lifetimes of existing nuclear energy plants in the United States. All such
activities will be cost-shared with industry on at least a 50-50 basis. The Department also will
assist industry in preserving the nuclear option for future generations by participating in the
development of improved, standardized, and certified advanced light-water reactor designs that
offer improved active and passive safety systems, simplified construction and operation, and
greater economy.<BR>
<P>
In May 1995, the NRC issued a new procedure for applying to extend the license of a nuclear
energy plant, now set at 40 years. The NRC's rule streamlines and simplifies the operating license
renewal process by eliminating unnecessary requirements, reducing the number of plant systems
and components subject to review, and focusing attention on significant safety issues. <BR>
<P>
The Administration has made achieving the greatest possible degree of global nuclear safety a top
priority. The Department of Energy will lead U.S. participation in international efforts to enhance
nuclear safety in Russia, Ukraine, and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to improve the
safety of Soviet-designed reactors. Current efforts are focused on improving operational safety,
reducing near-term risks, enhancing regulatory regimes, and establishing an effective nuclear
safety culture in the workplace. The Department of Energy will also encourage two-way
technology transfer by facilitating commercial ventures between U.S. companies and countries
with Soviet-designed reactors to upgrade the knowledge and operational experience of nuclear
plant operators in the United States and abroad.<BR>
<P>
The Administration also promotes improving the safety of nuclear energy abroad by actively
supporting the U.S. nuclear industry's pursuit of the multibillion dollar international nuclear energy export market. Because of the demonstrated quality of U.S. nuclear technologies and expertise, substantial opportunities to export U.S. nuclear energy equipment and services exist in many parts of the world, particularly the Pacific Rim, Central and Eastern Europe, and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. These technologies and services would include orders for upgrades of nuclear safety systems and other plant components, emergency-related equipment, personnel training programs, environmental cleanup at nuclear facilities, and nuclear waste management.<BR>
<P>
By 1999, the Department of Energy's cost-shared nuclear energy program will produce four NRC-
certified advanced light-water reactor designs with passive safety systems and simplified

<P>
<H4><a name="4.25">Resolving the Problem of Spent Fuel Disposal</H4></a>
The accumulation of high-level radioactive wastes from commercial nuclear power installations in
the United States could severely limit the contribution of nuclear energy to the Nation's energy
portfolio. The Administration's policy is to expedite the characterization of a geological repository
as a safe method for high-level waste disposal, and if determined to be safe, to build a geological
repository to accept commercial nuclear waste. <BR>
<P>
Ten countries that use nuclear energy to provide a substantial fraction of their energy needs have
selected deep geological repositories for final spent fuel disposal. A consensus appears to have
emerged in the international community that this is the method of choice. By the end of 1998, the
Department of Energy's Civilian Radioactive Waste Management program will have assessed the
technical suitability of the Yucca Mountain candidate site as a geologic repository and, if the site is
suitable, will license and operate a repository by 2010. Currently, utilities are relying on existing or
incremental spent-fuel storage capacity. To provide a standard technology for the safe storage,
transportation, and disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel and to minimize fuel handling, the
Department of Energy is developing multipurpose canisters for potential use by utilities on their
sites and, subsequently, at storage and disposal facilities.<BR>
<P>
Steady and sustained progress on the U.S. repository effort will reinforce the worldwide
fundamental agreement on geologic disposal and help strengthen other nations' resolve to pursue
geologic disposal as the preferred long-term radioactive waste management solution. Our Nation's
commitment to geologic disposal is essential to maintaining confidence in the integrity of our
domestic once-through fuel cycle, which supports the Administration's opposition to international
reprocessing alternatives. In addition to providing geologic disposal for spent fuel from civilian
reactors, the repository will be designed to accept other high-level radioactive wastes, consistent
with the Administration's nonproliferation goals and its opposition to the reprocessing of spent
nuclear fuel.</BODY><BR><HR><P>

<H2>Chapter 6: Reinvent Environmental Protection</H2>
<HR><P>
Energy production and use pose significant environmental challenges. Policy approaches must align energy and environmental issues to ensure that economic growth and environmental protection are achieved together. The Administration is reinventing environmental protection, creating regulatory systems that are more flexible and accountable, emphasizing pollution prevention over "end-of-pipe" cleanup, and fostering the development of new energy-efficient technologies to meet both economic and environmental goals. <BR>
<P>
Over the past two decades, energy policy and environmental policy evolved along essentially separate tracks, but growing recognition of the links between energy use and environmental impact has prompted a convergence of energy and environmental policy in the past several years. For example, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 have exerted a profound influence on electric utilities and transportation fuels, while the Energy Policy Act of 1992 emphasized the environmental benefits of increasing energy efficiency and expanding the use of renewable energy.<BR>
<P>
The Administration has accelerated this integration of energy and environmental policy because of the potential economic, environmental, and national security benefits that can flow from adopting a more systemic perspective. The ultimate goal is to create a 21st century America in which economic incentives, environmental objectives, and technological innovation are aligned so that economic growth improves-rather than diminishes-environmental quality.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="6.1">Environmental Protection: Challenges and Opportunities for Reform</H4></a>
Much of the present environmental protection system still relies on the command-and-control approach that has evolved over two decades. This approach has resulted in tremendous improvements in air and water quality, but at increasingly high costs as the era of "end-of-pipe" controls begins to yield diminishing economic returns for many key pollutants. This does not mean that such controls are unimportant or cannot be cost-effective. However, there is a recognition that additional environmental protection can often be obtained far more cheaply by examining pollution-creating processes and activities for abatement opportunities and by focusing on preventing pollution rather than on cleaning it up.<BR>
<P>
The current regulatory system sometimes undermines energy policy goals. For example, environmental regulations sometimes require technologies that increase operating energy demands while disregarding the environmental implications of the extra power generated to run the equipment. Or the regulations may simply shift pollution from one medium to another, necessitating additional cleanup. Efficient energy technologies are sometimes discriminated against under environmental regulations, even though they reduce energy use and waste.<BR>
<P>
New technologies offer the best prospects for simultaneous environmental and economic gains-but markets and regulatory systems need to encourage their development and adoption. The specificity and rigidity of many of our Nation's environmental statutes and regulations have blocked the adoption of more creative environmental solutions, have driven up compliance costs unnecessarily, and have stifled innovation in technologies and practices. The Administration recognizes the need to move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to regulation and to engage industry in deciding how to most efficiently and flexibly reach environmental goals.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="6.2">A New Approach to Environmental and Energy Policy</H4></a>
The Administration supports an innovative slate of policies to further environmental and energy goals, including reinventing the regulatory system, encouraging cost-effective pollution prevention, and fostering the development of new energy-efficient technologies. The principles at the heart of the Administration's approach to environmental protection are common sense, cost-effectiveness, and a firm commitment to strong environmental goals combined with flexibility in how we reach those goals. The three components of the Administration approach are the following:<BR>
<P>
<ul><li>Reinvent the regulatory system to increase flexibility and adopt performance-based approaches to augment or replace command-and-control measures. Additional flexibility can improve environmental performance and cut costs to industry. This must require new accountability mechanisms to ensure that goals are attained.
<BR>
<P>
<li>Encourage cost-effective pollution prevention through partnerships with industry that identify innovative methods for improving environmental performance and provide incentives for pursuing new approaches. An array of voluntary programs that encourage energy efficiency, renewable energy resources, emissions offsets, and other investments has gained enthusiastic industry support and is producing demonstrable benefits in cost-effective pollution reduction.<BR>
<P>
<li>Foster the development of technologies that will increase environmental protection as well as provide U.S. industry with new technologies for export into the global market. Because flexible approaches to pollution prevention tend to blur the traditional distinctions between environmental and energy technologies, Federal research and development programs and partnerships focus heavily on technologies that simultaneously increase productivity, reduce pollution or waste, and cut energy use.</ul>
<H4><a name="6.3">Reinventing Environmental Regulation</H4></a>
Administration policy increases the flexibility with which we achieve our environmental objectives, without sacrificing accountability or environmental quality. The Reinventing Environmental Regulation initiative announced by President Clinton in March 1995 outlined a new approach to regulatory action, one that recognizes that pollution is often a sign of economic waste and that focuses efforts on<a name="cospoll"></a>cost-effective pollution prevention. Regulations that provide flexibility-but require accountability-can provide greater protection at a lower cost. The initiative also emphasizes collaborative processes over adversarial ones for decisionmaking and compliance. <BR>
<P>
The initiative includes 25 high-priority actions directed both at improving the regulatory system and at generating the building blocks for the regulatory system of the future. These actions, which are being applied across many industries, will have a direct impact on energy production and use and will result in more competitive industries and lower energy costs.<BR>
<P>
Improvements in the Current System. The Administration is undertaking a number of initiatives to make the present regulatory system more flexible and effective. Efforts such as increased open-market air-emissions trading and one-stop emission reports can reduce industry costs while maintaining existing levels of environmental compliance.<BR>
<P>
Reexamining existing regulations to maximize environmental quality while eliminating excessive burdens on industry has led the Administration to refocus the implementation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act on high-risk wastes, to consolidate Federal air-quality rules, and to pursue regulatory negotiation and consensus-based rulemaking. In addition, priorities for enforcement of regulations will now be based on risk. <BR>
<P>
These actions will directly affect the energy-related industries by decreasing costs and making environmental compliance simpler through increased flexibility. At the same time, environmental quality will be ensured and efforts will be focused on the highest areas of risk.<BR>
<P>
Building Blocks for a New System. Setting performance standards and allowing the regulated community to find the best way to meet those standards can get results more cheaply, quickly, and cleanly than mandating design standards or specific technologies. This promotes both lower cost environmental protection and innovation in pollution prevention and control technology. Performance standards can also reward energy-efficiency investments that also reduce pollution. Accountability and responsibility must accompany this increased flexibility to ensure that our Nation's environmental goals are being met.<BR>
<P>
Where environmental and economic goals can be best reconciled by giving maximum flexibility to industry, the most flexible tool is the concept of performance agreements between business and regulators. The Environmental Protection Agency has developed a coordinated series of demonstration projects designed to provide facilities, industrial sectors, communities, and Federal agencies with opportunities to implement alternative management strategies.<BR>
<P>
<ul><li>Project XL. Through Project XL (Excellence and Leadership), the Federal Government, working in cooperation with States and selected firms, will test a new approach to environmental management. The goal of this initiative is to improve the environmental performance of U.S. industries by providing the option of following an alternative path to existing regulatory-driven compliance. The pilot program will require reductions in discharges below current regulatory standards in exchange for greater flexibility in achieving environmental objectives.</ul>
 
The key elements of this initiative are performance, flexibility, accountability, and partnerships. The components of the process are: (1) an environmental review of the facility; (2) development of an alternative strategy to achieve emissions reductions beyond current standards; (3) community involvement throughout the strategic planning and goal-setting process; (4) Environmental Protection Agency approval, whereupon the plan replaces many existing regulatory requirements; (5) establishment of alternative monitoring and reporting mechanisms to allow auditing and regular public reporting of the facility's environmental performance.<BR>
<P>
<ul><li>Alternative strategies for sectors. Through the use of industry covenants and other enforceable agreements, the Environmental Protection Agency and several industries will demonstrate how adjustments and modifications in environmental regulatory requirements can achieve more cost-effective environmental results. The industries involved in the Common Sense Initiative will provide the first opportunities to test this approach. Coordination with petroleum refiners through this initiative to reduce the cost of compliance and increase productivity assists the industry, ensures environmental quality, and helps keep energy prices affordable.</ul>
 
In addition to performance-based standards, the Administration is examining new tools for both government and industry to use in implementing new environmental management systems. Tools such as third-party audits for industry compliance and multimedia permitting will streamline compliance procedures.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="6.4">Encouraging Pollution Prevention in the Energy Sector</H4></a>
The Administration is exploring ways that the Federal Government can work with industry and market forces to encourage environmental improvement while stimulating markets. In some areas, market forces can simultaneously contribute to environmental protection, increased productivity, and continuous improvement in technologies and practices.<BR>
<P>
Cost-effective energy-efficiency investments, for example, can save money, reduce pollution, and reduce the need for expensive additional pollution controls. Likewise, some renewable energy sources can displace the need for fossil fuels that have greater environmental impact.<BR>
<P>
Unfortunately, markets often do not sufficiently encourage these investments, primarily because of two factors. First, the market price of energy does not always reflect the full costs of use, including environmental impacts, which leads to underuse of efficient technologies. Second, information on the latest technologies is not always readily available, preventing market participants from making the best decisions.<BR>
<P>
Where markets do not fully recognize the environmental benefits of increased energy efficiency, voluntary programs can help create incentives for technology development, stimulate energy-efficiency investments, and disseminate information. Voluntary programs have emerged as a key tool in addressing environmental problems without statutory mandates. For example, carbon dioxide is the dominant greenhouse gas, but is not currently subject to regulatory requirements. The Administration has pioneered a voluntary market approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively. <BR>
<P>
Climate Change Action Plan.  Climate change raises complex environmental and energy issues. It also offers an opportunity for new approaches, because few Federal regulations limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Climate Change Action Plan initiated a host of voluntary programs, including Climate Challenge and Climate Wise, that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost productivity and profits.<BR>
<P>
<ul><li>Climate Challenge. Under this voluntary program, which was developed jointly by the Department of Energy and the electric utility industry, utilities agree to reduce, avoid, or sequester greenhouse gas emissions using flexible individualized plans to achieve the reductions in the most cost-effective way. The program recognizes that utilities are in the best position to determine how to reduce emissions cost-effectively in their own systems. To date, 450 utilities have joined the Climate Challenge program, pledging to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. <BR>
<P>
<li>Climate Wise. Climate Wise, which is being carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, is designed to stimulate industrial emission reductions. Industrial companies representing almost 4 percent of U.S. industrial energy use have become partners in Climate Wise and have pledged to reduce emissions significantly over the next several years.</ul>
 
Information programs also play a key role in encouraging the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Under the authority contained in Section 1605 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Department of Energy has issued guidelines for anyone, including participants in Climate Challenge, Climate Wise, and other voluntary programs, to record the results of emission-reduction actions. This mechanism allows industry partners to demonstrate that they have attained the performance goals to which they have agreed, and it provides a way for any business or organization to record the greenhouse gas emissions from their operations and consider efforts to reduce emissions.<BR>
<P>
Environmental benefits are also realized through other Administration programs to enhance efficiency and increase productivity while reducing environmental impacts. Examples of voluntary programs established by the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency are the Motor Challenge and Green Lights programs <a href="ch3a.html">(see Chapter 3)</a>, which increase energy efficiency while decreasing the environmental impacts of excess energy use.<BR>
<P>
The Climate Change Action Plan was constructed to meet the U.S. goal of returning net greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, using economic growth, energy price, and Federal budget assumptions based on 1993 projections. Because these projections have shifted, and since the Plan relies heavily on the performance of voluntary programs whose outcomes are subject to market uncertainty, the Administration will conduct an assessment of the Plan's progress in the fall of 1995.<BR>
<P>
Clean Cities Program. An example of partnerships at the community level is the Clean Cities program. This program leverages the Federal purchase of alternative-fuel vehicles into a coordinated effort to overcome infrastructure barriers for alternative-fuel vehicles while assisting local governments with environmental mandates. In this voluntary program, cities that are not in compliance with the Clean Air Act are encouraged to partner with the Federal Government to establish fleets of alternative-fuel vehicles. While this program was designed to provide the market pull for private-sector infrastructure investment in alternative fuels <a href=ch3a.html>(see Chapter 3)</a>, it is targeted to assist cities that are working to comply with Federal air pollution standards. <BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="6.5">Fostering Technology Development</H4></a>
The Administration supports research and development on energy technologies that improve environmental performance, and assists in commercializing these technologies to help industry increase competitiveness and decrease pollution. An environmental technology strategy that helps industry shift from waste management toward pollution prevention, more efficient resource use, and industrial ecology models will increase long-term economic growth and improve and sustain the environment. The Administration's environmental technology strategy helps companies become more competitive by lowering their energy and resource needs while reducing or eliminating their waste cleanup or disposal costs. Nationally, the strategy will spur economic growth by capturing the rapidly growing market for clean technologies and shifting money from consumption of resources to investment in new plants and equipment. Globally, it will help developing countries to use sustainable technologies in many industrial and service sectors more rapidly.<BR>
<P>
As energy and environmental policies converge, technology is one clear bridge between the two. A wide array of technologies can improve environmental performance, not just conventional pollution-abatement technology. Technologies that increase the efficiency of energy use or minimize waste in energy production invariably reduce the environmental impacts associated with those activities. These include technologies that increase energy efficiency, reduce materials consumption, improve product quality and durability, and provide substitutes for energy-intensive products and processes. Where market forces are slow to stimulate these developments, the Administration has embarked upon a <a name="nets"></a>National Environmental Technology Strategy to accelerate the adoption of environmentally superior technology. <BR>
<P>
The National Environmental Technology Strategy outlined in Bridge to a Sustainable Future is a set of policies and programs that will establish a new course for the development and use of environmental technologies into the next century. The strategy expands the environmental tool kit, replacing those instruments that are no longer effective with a new set of tools designed to meet today's challenges and tomorrow's needs.</BODY><HR>

1. Except where another source is directly or indirectly identified, the statistics used in Chapters 1 and 2 are from published Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports or from the data bases used to develop those reports. The primary sources of data are the following EIA reports: Annual Energy Outlook 1995 [DOE/EIA-0383(95)], January 1995; International Energy Annual 1993 [DOE/EIA-0219(93)], May 1995; Annual Energy Review 1994 [DOE/EIA-0384(94)], July 1995; International Energy Outlook 1995 [DOE/EIA-0484(95)], June 1995. EIA is an independent statistical agency within the Department of Energy; other than providing its most recent data, EIA played no role in the formulation of value judgments or development of policies presented in this document.<BR>
<P>
2. Different crude oils and petroleum products have different energy (or heat) content. For example, 1 gallon of distillate fuel oil contains almost 11 percent more energy than 1 gallon of motor gasoline, and 1 barrel of imported crude oil contains about 2.7 percent more energy than 1 barrel of domestically produced crude oil. Therefore, computations of petroleum import dependence differ depending on whether the measure is volume or energy content.<BR>
<P>
In terms of volume, the United States imported 8.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products in 1994, and we exported 0.9 million barrels per day. Net petroleum imports were thus 8.0 million barrels per day. Also during 1994, U.S. consumption of gasoline, fuel oil, and other petroleum products totaled 17.7 million barrels per day. Therefore, on the basis of volume, net imports accounted for 45 percent of consumption.<BR>
<P>
In terms of energy content, however, import reliance was more than 49 percent. This is because the 8.0 million barrels per day of net petroleum imports over the year contained 17.1 quadrillion Btu (quads) of energy, and the 17.7 million barrels per day of consumed petroleum products contained 34.7 quads.<BR>
<P>
3. Energy-related CO2 emissions published in the Annual Energy Review 1995 are 92 million metric tons higher than those estimated in the Climate Change Action Plan published in October 1993.  Most of this difference is attributed to differences in assessments regarding the impact of the Plan.  EIA prorates the impact of the Plan based on the funding received in fiscal year 1995, which was substantially less than the Administration's request.  Other factors contributing to EIA's projection of higher CO2 emissions include higher economic growth and lower energy price assumptions than those used in 1993.  An update of the Plan is scheduled for the fall of 1995.<BR>
<P>
4. For an analysis of gains in energy savings since 1972, see U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Policy, Energy Conservation Trends: Understanding the Factors Affecting Energy Conservation Gains and Their Implications for Policy Development [DOE/PO-0034], April  1995. That study concluded that the U.S. economy used 30.6 quads less in 1991 than if the overall energy intensity of the U.S. economy had remained at its 1972 level. The annual primary energy savings in 1991 were worth approximately $250 billion, and the cumulative energy savings over the 1972-91 period were worth approximately $2.5 trillion (in 1991 dollars).<BR>
<P>
5. See, for example, World Energy Council (WEC) Commission, Energy for Tomorrow's World-the Realities, the Real Options and the Agenda for Achievement (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993), which analyzes four energy cases "believed to cover the broad range of likely outcomes for global energy demand and supply to 2020."<BR>
<P>
6. This framework is described in key Administration policy documents such as Science in the National Interest, Technology for America's Economic Growth, and Technology for a Sustainable Future. <BR>

<HR>
During the 1970s, the Department of Energy developed the low-E window coating, which remains transparent to visible light but reduces heat gains.  By 1993, about one-third of residential and one-fifth of commercial building window sales employed low-E coatings, resulting in energy savings to U.S. building owners of more than $1.8 billion. <BR>
<P>
The flame retention head oil burner, which results in a 10-percent reduction in consumption of oil in residential furnaces and boilers, was developed with Department of Energy support. This technology has captured virtually 100 percent of the oil heating market in the United States.<BR>
<P>
An advanced supermarket refrigeration system developed by the Department of Energy is now marketed by all major manufacturers,  has a  50-percent market share, and offers a 20-percent energy savings over the conventional system. <BR>
<P>
A transpired solar collector, developed with Department of Energy support, preheats incoming building ventilation air, and reduces heating loads to conventional equipment.  The panel collectors transfer 75 percent of the heat of incident solar energy.  The panels sell for $10 per square foot and can pay for themselves in as little as 3 years.</body>

Energy is second in cost only to personnel in many government and business operations.  Reducing energy use goes straight to the bottom line. If  employee productivity is increased simultaneously, the benefits can more than double. At the U.S. Post Office in Reno, Nevada, improvements in lighting reduced energy costs and, more significantly, directly improved mail sorting efficiency by 6 percent. This is one of numerous examples of increased productivity as a direct result of energy efficiency.</body><HR>

<title>Answers to Questions about Tehachapi Wind Turbines </title>
<head><b><h2>Answers to  Common Questions about Wind Turbines in  the Tehachapi-Mojave Wind Resource Area </h2></b></head><p>
<body>
<center><h4>  Copyright by Paul Gipe. All rights reserved.<BR> </h4></center>   

The Tehachapi-Mojave Wind Resource Area is in the Tehachapi Mountains of Southern California about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. The following questions and their answers are from a brochure distributed to visitors of the Tehachapi Pass. <P>

<B>Why Are They Here?<BR>
</B>Because the Tehachapi Pass is one of the windiest areas in the world. Wind turbines have also been installed in the San Gorgonio Pass southeast of Los Angeles, and in the Altamont Pass east of San Francisco.<P>

<B>How Many Wind Turbine Are There?<BR></B>
Of the nearly 16,000 wind turbines in the state more than 5,000 are in the Tehachapi Pass. <P>

<B>What Do They Do?</B><BR>
Collectively the wind turbines generate electricity much like a conventional power plant except that their fuel--the wind--is both free and inexhaustible. Since they are open-air power plants the term "wind power plant" or "wind power station" is more descriptive than the term, "wind 

farm," sometimes used.<P>

<B>When is the Best Time To See Them Turning?</B><BR>The wind normally peaks during the afternoon when heating on the nearby Mojave desert is greatest. (During the early morning hours winds are usually light.) Spring and early summer are the windiest seasons when winds can reach gale force for several days on end.<P>

<B>What Kind of Electricity Do They Produce?</B><BR>
The wind turbines generate electricity identical to that produced by the local electric utility. The electricity is carried from Tehachapi on the utility's transmission lines.<P>

<B>Who Uses The Electricity?</B><BR>
Customers of Southern California Edison Company. The wind power plants sell their electricity to SCE. The utility then distributes the electricity as it would that from any of its own power plants. On a moderately windy day Tehachapi's wind turbines will meet the needs of the entire Antelope Valley and export electricity to Los Angeles.<P>

<B>How Much Energy Do They Produce?</B><BR>
Tehachapi's wind power plants generate more than 1 Terawatt-hours (1,000 million kilowatt-hours) yearly--enough electricity to meet the needs of more than 500,000 Southern Californians.<P>

<B>How Many Kinds Are There?</B><BR>
There are more than two dozen different kinds of wind turbines operating in 
California today. Most use a propeller that spins about a horizontal axis. 
The hoop-shaped Darrieus or "Eggbeater" turbines account for 5% of the state's wind machines. <P>

<B>Who Makes Them?</B><BR>
California's wind turbines were made by firms in the U.S., Canada, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, and the Netherlands.<P>

<B>Who Paid For Them?</B><BR>
Private and institutional investors. (The utility only buys the electricity.) Some wind turbines have been installed by the wind companies themselves with conventional financing from banks and leasing companies.<P>

<B>What Do They Cost To Operate?</B>
Studies by electric utilities have found that it costs about 1 cent per kilowatt-hour to operate and maintain modern wind power plants. For comparison, it costs twice as much to operate, maintain and fuel nuclear-powered and coal-fired plants. <P>

<B>Are Wind Turbines Used Anywhere Else?</B><BR>
Wind power plants are in regular commercial service in California, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, India, and the Netherlands. Wind turbines in California produce about 40% of the world's wind-generated electricity.<P>

<B>Do All the Wind Turbines Operate at the Same Time?</B><BR>
Seldom. It's unlikely that all of the machines will be operating at the same time because of variations in the wind and differences between turbines. Most turbines in the Tehachapi Pass will be spinning when there are winds between 15 and 50 mph (7 m/s and 25 m/s). Often there will be turbines out of service for routine maintenance. <P>

<B>How Strong is the Wind in the Tehachapi Pass?</B><BR>
The winds through the pass average from 14  to 20 miles per hour (7 m/s to 9 m/s) from one year to the next. Wind speeds vary with the terrain, season, and time of day. <P>

<B>Do the Turbines Operate Automatically?</B><BR>
Yes. Each wind turbine has its own electronic "brain" and thinks for itself. They turn themselves on when conditions are right, and they turn themselves off when the winds are too strong, or when they sense a problem. Most turbines change directions as the wind changes. The Eggbeater or Darrieus turbines accept the wind from all directions.<P>

<B>Are They Computer Controlled?</B><BR>
Though all wind turbines are capable of "thinking" for themselves, some at the larger, more modern wind power plants are connected to a central computer. An operator at the console is then able to turn the turbines on and off at will, similar to that at most modern power plants. (There must be wind before the turbines will spin.)<P> 

<B>How Long Do They Last?</B><BR>
No one knows for sure. The turbines are designed to operate 20 years. During that time the blades, transmissions, generators, and other moving parts will be rebuilt or replaced. Because of California's dry climate the metal structure supporting the turbines should last indefinitely. <P>

<B>Is Wind Energy Economic?</B><BR>
Yes. The technology has advanced dramatically since 1981, when the first wind turbines were installed in the state. The cost of wind turbines has dropped from about $4,000 per kilowatt to about $1,100 per kilowatt today. Meanwhile their productivity has increased by nearly three times. <P>

<B>Do the Wind Turbines Lower Electric Rates?</B><BR>
Not directly. Instead they help hold off higher rates by stabilizing electricity costs and by providing fuel diversity. Electric utility systems insure low costs and reliability by using a mix of generating sources to maximize the advantages of each technology. Wind power plants are now an integral part of this mix.<P> 
<B>Do Wind Turbines Help Clean the Air?</B><BR>
Yes. By producing electricity cleanly California's wind power plants reduce pollutant gases that contribute to smog, acid rain, and global warming.Each year Tehachapi's wind power plants prevent the emission of more than 3 billion (3,000 million) pounds of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particulates, and carbon dioxide that would otherwise be produced.<P> 

<B>What are the Air Quality Benefits Worth?</B><BR>
The air quality benefits alone are worth from 1 cent/kWh to 14 cents/kWh. These benefits are not incorporated into the price paid for wind-generated electricity. (Nor are these costs charged to conventional sources.) <P>

<B>How Does Wind Rank Among the California's Power Plants?</B><BR>
Wind power plants produce about 1% of the state's electricity. As a state with 10% of the nation's population and the world's seventh largest economy, California uses a staggering amount of electricity. California emits nearly as much global warming gases as the entire nation of France. <P>

<B>How Much Energy Could Wind Turbines Provide?</B><BR>
The California Energy Commission estimates that wind energy could provide 10% of the state's electricity. To reach this goal properly-spaced wind turbines would need to occupy about 0.1% of the state. They "use" even less land.<P>

<B>Do Wind Turbines Cause Urban Growth?</B><BR>
No. They help preserve open space. A study by the University of California's Department of Environmental Design found that wind power plants, because they represent long-term capital investments in the rural economy, may preclude the "parceling out" of land for large-scale real-estate development<P>

<B>Can the Land Still Be Used For Other Purposes?</B><BR>
Yes. Grazing, farming, and recreational land uses can coexist with wind power plants. Cattle grazing remains an important land use among the 6,000 wind turbines in the Altamont Pass. In Tehachapi the Pacific Crest Trail winds its way among the wind turbines atop Cameron Ridge. And within some wind power plants in Northern Europe, where land is at a premium, the land is tilled to the base of each tower. In Denmark farmers and homeowners install wind turbines, like those used near Tehachapi, in their back yards to meet their own needs.<P>

<TITLE>The Greenhouse Blues</TITLE>

<PRE>


               GREENHOUSE BLUES


               "A permanent modern scenario: apocalypse looms,
               and it doesn't occur... Apocalypse has become an
               event that is happening, and not happening.  It
               may be that some of the most feared events, like
               those involving the irreparable ruin of the
               environment, have already happened.  But we don't
               know it yet, because the standards have changed. 
               Or because we do not have the right indexes for
               measuring the catastrophe.  Or simply because this
               is a catastrophe in slow motion.  
               
                                   -- Susan Sontag [1]


     The 1990 edition of the Worldwatch Institute's annual State of
the World [2] claims we have about 40 years to establish a sustainable
economy -- or be engulfed in a self-perpetuating spiral of ecological
and economic decline.  It's an odd, precise figure, the sort usually
discounted as a product of apocalyptic excess.  These days, though, it
seems to warrant extra consideration.  For one thing, the elements of
the projected catastrophe -- from pollution, extinction, and
population growth to deforestation and the ecological costs of energy
production -- have become depressingly familiar.  For another, the
power, inertia, and sheer dilapidation of the global economy have
begun to sink in, as have the depth and power of institutionalized
militarism.

     Twenty years after the first Earth Day, we are then perhaps only
40 years from the abyss.  If the greenhouse theorists are right -- and
the bulk of the evidence suggests that they are -- local ecological
crises must be seen in the light of, and indeed as elements of, the
even more threatening catastrophe of climatic destabilization.  This
aggregation offers the perverse satisfaction of rendering equivocation
and half-measures absurd, but it may also set the stage for a tragic
denouement that has been centuries in the making.

     Death, to misquote Samuel Johnson, concentrates the mind
wonderfully, and it's for just this reason that global warming makes
so potent a subject of reflection.  The frames within which it is
presented reveal, with rare clarity, the presumptions and prejudices
of the framers.  This is true in the media battle between those who
emphasize the near-consensus among scientists on the warming and those
whose stories abet equivocation and business-as-usual.  And it's true
in the environmental movement, where the warming, though unproven, is
taken dead seriously, and the debate centers on its political and
cultural significance.

THE SCOPE OF THE THREAT
     The major consequences of a rapid greenhouse warming have been
envisioned in detail: dying reefs, withering forests, seas of refugees
(many of them leaving the United States), extinction, drought, and
crushingly violent storms.  Still, and despite the clarity of such
foresight, uncertain and prospective events are difficult to force
onto the policy agenda -- especially in the United States, where much
of the ruling elite regards the costs of prevention as a threat more
dire than the warming itself.    

     The bulk of the greenhouse warming is caused by carbon dioxide
(CO2), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and methane, gases which have been
called "nontraditional" pollutants because they take their toll not by
despoiling isolated regions but by accumulating globally and
destabilizing the biosphere as a whole.  CO2, which because of its
sheer abundance is the most damaging of the greenhouse gases, is an
unavoidable product of fossil-fuel consumption -- and the cheap, easy
energy available from fossil fuels has played a major and largely
unappreciated role in the history of industrial capitalism.  Now, it
seems imperative to drastically reduce the use not only of methane and
CFCs, but of the fossil-fuels as well, even though this reduction
implies a radical break with the energy economy that has underlain
capitalism from its very earliest days.  As the Gulf War has once
again shown, this break will not come easily.

     There is -- and this is crucial -- much that can be done, though
not an indefinite time to do it in.  This is clear from the gap
between "bad case" and "good case" scenarios, both supplied by the
World Resources Institute [3].  In the bad case, no substantive effort
is made to slow C02 emissions, increase energy efficiency, or speed
solar development, although CFC production and use is brought in line
with the Montreal Protocol.  The outcome?  By 2020, an average global
temperature of from 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit greater than it was
a century ago, and by 2075 a rise of 5.8 to 17.5 degrees!  If coal use
increases as well -- a real possibility, particularly in China -- the
warming could soon reach a truly staggering magnitude.  (Even this
isn't the worst case scenario, since there's a possibility of a "super
greenhouse effect" set off by a relatively small warming and a series
of "positive feedbacks" on it.  Melting permafrost ice, for example,
could release massive amounts of methane, an extremely powerful
greenhouse gas.)

     In the "good case" scenarios, such as they are, strong global
efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions allow the atmosphere to
stabilize.  Oil, gas, and coal prices are sharply increased, per
capita energy use declines in industrialized countries, and support
for solar development is radically increased.  Tropical countries not
only stop decimating their rain forests but begin large-scale
reforestation efforts.  And so on.  The World Resources Institute
model indicates that, even if all these heroic efforts had begun in
1988, there would still be a warming of 3 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit by
2075, when the temperature would level off.  Such a temperature
increase, over such a short period of time, is unprecedented in human
history, and could well be large enough to cause massive ecological
and social disruptions.  According to the First Assessment Report [4]
of the scientific committee of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), the U.N. agency chartered with the task of coordinating
global warming policy, the "state of scientific knowledge" indicates
that such a "stabilization" is the best that can be expected, and
would require "an immediate reduction in global man-made [CO2] emis-
sions by 60 to 80%."  

     So, if greenhouse theory is valid, the whole global economy must
be restructured, fundamentally and soon.  The longer marketeers push
their phony optimism, the longer politicians dispute, equivocate, and
lie, the longer technicians strain for faith in the viability of half
measures, the worse the odds will get.  Not that these are the last
days -- humans are adaptable and will likely survive (which is more
than can be said for lots of other species).  But each moment wasted
is another step along a path to an ugly and inauspicious future.

     As the predictions of greenhouse theory have become familiar,
they -- like ecology in general -- have emerged as key social metrics.
We now know, for example, that ours is not a "sustainable" society,
and as the ecological crisis worsens this charge becomes damning in a
manner that somehow exceeds all prior accusations.  It's no wonder,
then, that ecological and climactic science are clotted with politics,
or that the media frames imposed on greenhouse theory often emphasize
"uncertainty," cost, and the putative dangers of "over-reaction."  The
issues here are difficult, for science resists reduction to ideology,
even as it can offer ideology its firmest ground.  Witness the
influence of John Sununu, architect of U.S. greenhouse policy and
probably the first high U.S. official to hold a PhD in fluid dynamics,
a PhD he uses to disguise a corrupt and technocratic optimism as
legitimate scientific skepticism.

     The outlines of at least the immediate future are clear.  The
Bush Administration has distinguished itself by the vehemence of its
opposition to meaningful anti-greenhouse policies, while every other
wealthy industrial country has taken at least tentative steps toward
stabilizing or reducing CO2 emissions by the year 2000.  Germany, New
Zealand, Denmark, and Australia have committed themselves to emission
reductions of at least 20 percent by 2005, and though this is cause
for hope, global negotiations have been all but paralyzed by the U.S.
delegation. (The first U.N. session, held February 1991 in Chantilly
Virginia, was spent, by U.S. insistence, on procedural matters.  All
substantive proposals were deferred.)  Meanwhile, in the Third World,
particularly India and China, efforts to engage the greenhouse issue
have been caught up in charges of "environmental colonialism."  And in
the old Soviet bloc, particularly the Soviet Union itself, rapid
progress does not appear likely.  All in all, it's fair to say that
the politics of the greenhouse are inseparable from the politics of
the larger world system -- which suffers its fossil-fuel dependency as
only one element in a rich variety of debilitating legacies.

ENVIRONMENTAL OPTIMISM, ECOLOGICAL DESPAIR
     The most compelling of the new greenhouse books are probably
Stephen Schneider's Global Warming: Are We Entering the Greenhouse
Century?, Michael Oppenheimer and Robert Boyle's Dead Heat: The Race
Against the Greenhouse Effect and Bill McKibben's The End of Nature
[5].  Taken together, they form a grim syllabus, not only about global
warming but also about the depth of the environmental movement's break
with systemic political analysis.  Each chooses, in its own manner and
for its own reasons, to present the erosion of climatic stability by
the fossil-fuel economy -- coal and oil! -- with barely a nod to the
political, economic, or ideological dynamics of the society within
which it developed.

     Stephen Schneider, head of Interdisciplinary Climate Systems at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research, is among the most famous
of the greenhouse scientists, and serves well to reveal the contours
of mainstream environmentalism.  Schneider cuts an interesting figure
-- the liberal public scientist as statesman of the greenhouse age. 
His world is big science and big government, and though he spends a
good deal of time debating Reaganesque bureaucrats and politicians, he
doesn't allow himself to lose hope.  Trained in the habits of
rationalism, he sees an emergency and thinks the need for a
cooperative global response will soon be undeniable.  He is a
pragmatist, as he believes the times require.

     In Scientific American's special "Managing Planet Earth" issue,
Schneider argued that conversion to a post-greenhouse economy would
cost "hundreds of billions of dollars every year for many decades,
both at home and in financial and technical assistance to developing
nations," yet he was confident that this was a realistic possibility. 
Anticipating a pessimistic reading, he argued that pessimism was too
easy, that not long ago "a massive disengagement of NATO and Warsaw
Pact forces in Europe also seemed inconceivable." [6]  And so it did,
to many.  But today, with the flush of post-Cold War euphoria long
past, the case for pessimism is again obvious.  It is well known that
world military expenditures, at almost a trillion dollars per year,
could feed and educate the entire human race.  They could also build a
post-greenhouse economy.  The question is whether they'll ever be
spent doing so.  

     Optimism can be dangerous.  When the Worldwatch Institute's ten-
hour series, The Race to Save the Planet -- which took five years and
$7 million to produce -- was recently broadcast in the San Francisco
Bay Area, one local critic remarked that it devoted so much time to
upbeat segments (designed, presumably, to avoid spreading doom and
gloom) that it left the impression that the situation wasn't that grim
after all.  The producers had stumbled in the great, precarious tug-
of-war of ecologic politics, which, despite widespread grassroots
activism and an increasingly coherent analysis, is torn between
despair on the one side and liberal optimism on the other.  

     Here's an extreme dose of inspirational liberal optimism, from
Dead Heat, written by Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist at the
Environmental Defense Fund, and Robert Boyle.  This text was reprinted
(as "Techno-Hope") in the 1990 Earth Day issue of Mother Jones:

     The change began in 1992 when the nations of the world, under the
     guidance of the United Nations Environmental Program, signed an
     agreement to limit greenhouse gases.  Cynics scoffed at a
     "toothless" accord, but they failed to notice the underlying
     currents.  Battered by foreign economic invasion and constrained
     by a limited budget, the United States canceled the Super
     Collider, the Space Station, and Star Wars and diverted billions
     to research and education.  By the mid-1990s, it had concluded a
     series of treaties with the Soviet Union, which led gradually to
     a mutual reduction of forces.  But the expected blow to the
     defense contractors never materialized because the government
     poured some of the billions of dollars saved into procurement of
     solar energy sources, and several large companies quickly
     converted to renewable-energy development.  The trend accelerated
     when the Great Drought of the late nineties struck and industry
     began the total phaseout of fossil fuels.  Now rich nations
     compete to supply smaller countries with solar cells rather than
     weapons.

     
     One must ask the purpose of such prose.  Should it be excused as
bad exhortatory fiction, or is it true to the dreams of Washington
environmentalists?  If this the hope they can imagine, it's no wonder
that "radical environmentalism," as it has emerged in the last decade,
has chosen pessimism.  

     Examples of radical pessimism are easy to come by, but Bill
McKibben's The End of Nature is distinguished by its vivid evocation
of greenhouse crisis and by its relentless despair.  McKibben is an
apostle of deep-ecological radicalism.  Not being a scientist, he need
not posture at objectivity -- yet neither does he accept political and
economic views.  To even name this society as "capitalist" and insist
that the distinctions made thereby are significant strikes him as
absurd.  The warming is only the last in a long series of attacks on
the environment, and politics too small a thing to place against the
end of wilderness.  We can and should resist -- with direct action, by
consuming less, wearing sweaters around the house, not having children
-- but it won't be enough, not really.  Soon we'll find ourselves
almost alone, with only the plants and animals we've chosen to save,
on a desiccated and lonely world.

     It's a view so tragic as to be almost absurd, were it not for its
desire to face the whole grim truth.  With the U.S. Administration
bent on resisting any real greenhouse treaty, there's a strong
temptation to see the measures being taken elsewhere -- like Germany's
commitment to a 25 percent cut in CO2 production by the year 2005 --
as substantial alternatives.  But are they?  The Third World is now
well along on the road of fossil-fuel industrialism -- will the
Europeans pay to help it go solar instead?  In the next 40 years? 
McKibben knows of the calls for massive military cuts and a crash
campaign of conversion to a post-greenhouse economy; he just doesn't
think it's going to happen.

"UNCERTAINTY" AS IDEOLOGY
     In February 1990, when President Bush addressed the UN's climatic
change panel, many environmentalists were bitterly disappointed.  They
had allowed campaign rhetoric about a "White House effect" to seduce
them into hope for emergency initiatives, and now Bush, instead of
giving voice to any spirit of emergency, had insisted that greenhouse
policy "be consistent with economic growth and free-market
principles." [7]
          
     Just days before Bush delivered his speech, revisions had
transformed it from one that emphasized the seriousness of global
warming to one that emphasized scientific uncertainties and made no
recommendations for action.  In the preceding months, the media had
taken the same turn, buzzing with reports that scientists (except for
a few greenhouse radicals) in fact doubted the warming predictions. 
On December 13, 1989, for example, The New York Times ran a cover
feature on the "greenhouse skeptics," and Forbes -- which subsequently
began advertising itself as "The magazine that's not afraid to take a
little heat" -- ran an expose on "The Global Warming Panic" (in its
1989 Christmas issue.) 

     The backstage maneuvering had been going on for some time, with
both greenhouse theorists and skeptics pressing their arguments in
Washington as the time for Bush's speech approached.  In September
1989, for example, Richard S. Lindzen of M.I.T and Jerome Namais of
the Scripps Institute of Oceanography wrote the White House, arguing
that current global warming forecasts "are so inaccurate and fraught
with uncertainty as to be useless to policy makers."  Sununu and Bush,
according to press reports, "welcomed the input." [8]

     Lindzen and Namais are both noted meteorologists and members of
the National Academy of Sciences.  Lindzen, who is perhaps the leader
of the anti-greenhouse scientists, has made major contributions to
atmospheric theory.  Their views carry weight.  Yet Lindzen's theories
are, by his own words, of a "theological or philosophical" nature [9],
and reduce to a faith in the existence of atmospheric dynamics, yet
undiscovered, of sufficient magnitude to counter the known effects of
the greenhouse gases.  That such faith can be used to justify U.S.
intransigence in U.N. greenhouse negotiations indicates how strong the
political currents running below the surface of "objective" science
can be.  More specifically, it demonstrates the ideological uses, not
only here but in a variety of debates over cancer and toxicity, of the
"uncertainty" of scientific data.  (Incidentally, one of Lindzen's
chief claims -- that water vapor may diminish rather than amplify
global warming -- was refuted by research published only a month after
Bush's speech. [10])

     Uncertainty plays such a key role in scientifically loaded policy
debates because it converts the question "What is to be done?" into
"Should anything be done at all?"  Witness Warren Brookes' Forbes
article, which asks whether greenhouse warming is "the 1990s version
of earlier scares: nuclear winter, cancer-causing cranberries and $100
oil?" and goes on to assert that "just as Marxism is giving way to
markets, the political `greens' seem determined to put the world
economy back into the red, using the greenhouse effect to stop
unfettered market-based expansion." [11]  Further, Brookes says, even
though "60% of the public is convinced [global warming] will worsen,"
in reality "the evidence of that alleged trend is under increasingly
sharp and solid attack."

     Is it indeed?  This claim, common in the popular press, directly
contradicts the scientific consensus and the conclusions of the U.N.
IPCC's scientific committee.  (The United States has its greatest veto
power in the policy committee).  Yet because climatic dynamics are
both complex and poorly understood, uncertainty can always be made to
seem plausible simply by citing data selectively.  Brookes, for
example, is careful to focus on U.S. statistics, rather than the
global statistics that would contradict his chosen view.

     All scientists acknowledge uncertainties in the atmospheric
models.  The real debate turns on the meaning of that uncertainty, and
its ideological uses.  These uses are both conscious and deliberate,
as demonstrated by a White House memo to the American IPCC delegation,
which was leaked to the press in April 1990.  The memo's list of
"debates to avoid" included whether "there is or is not" global
warming and how much warming could be expected.  "In the eyes of the
public," it went on, "we will lose this debate.  A better approach is
to raise the many uncertainties that need to be understood on this
issue." [12]

     "Uncertainty" has a different meaning in the laboratory than in
the White House press room.  Though scientists argue over the details,
the scientific community accepts the thrust of greenhouse theory for 
the simple reason that it dovetails with routine laboratory physics. 
Carbon dioxide, methane and the CFCs do trap heat; that's why they're
called greenhouse gases.  The rising atmospheric concentrations of
these gases are not in dispute; nor is the geological record, which
indicates that increases in CO2 correlate with increased temperatures. 
And though the earth's metabolism incorporates many buffers -- ice
sheets, forests, oceans, clouds -- there's no scientific reason to
believe that these buffers will neutralize the vast seas of CO2 that
will be spewed into the air in the coming century.  

     The summer of 1988, with its wilting heat wave and corresponding
spike of greenhouse fear, was ages ago in ideological time.  (Though
globally 1990 was the hottest year on the recent record books.)  The
anti-greenhouse counter-revolution began in 1989, and today, as oil,
recession, and militarism push hope, ecology and Eastern Europe off
the front page, it's wise to brace for a wave of denial and lies. 
Even before the Gulf War, with ecology still in the media foreground,
the greenhouse debate had begun to thicken with equivocation.  Now,
stonewalling is official U.S. policy.  

     The near future of the debate is reasonably predictable.  It is
only necessary to project current trends, and to review the history of
another atmospheric crisis -- the destruction of the ozone layer by
chlorinated chemicals.  Here, too, laboratory science predicted the
threat.  Here, too, the difficulty of proving atmospheric damage made
it possible for interested powers to frame a scientific near-consensus
as controversy -- even though it was already clear in 1973 that CFCs
damaged the ozone layer.  Only the discovery of the Antarctic ozone
hole finally turned the tide.  (If indeed it has been turned at all. 
The 1990 revision to the Montreal Protocol allows half again the CFCs
produced in the past 50 years to be produced in the next ten! [13])

     Sherwood Rowland, the scientist whose lab discovered the ozone-
shredding properties of CFCs, once commented "It is quite common on
the scientific side of industry to believe that there aren't any real
environmental problems, that there are just public relations
problems." [14]  It's an astute remark.  Public relations, not
physics, is the paradigm science of the modern age, and it's difficult
to imagine it counting for more than it does today, when 76 percent of
the American people describe themselves as environmentalists. 

     Why, finally, is prudence so difficult, even in the face of a
more-than-plausible catastrophe?  There are many answers, but rising
above the fog is the insistence that the economy be left unfettered
unless it can be "proved" that the ecological costs of inaction are
absolutely intolerable.  Meanwhile, 1990 was the hottest year to date,
the year that dying coral reefs (global warming is the chief suspect)
became big news, and the fourth straight record year for coal
production.

FOSSIL-FUEL DEPENDENCY
     The fossil-fuel economy is expensive, very expensive.  In the
United States, subsidies to the automobile alone are about as large as
the military budget -- amounting to $2,200 per car per year, or $400
billion a year! [15]  (The U.S. truck and auto fleet now exceeds 180
million vehicles, up from 108 million in 1970.  That's one for every
1.7 Americans, up from one for every 2.4 per in 1970).  In fact, the
real auto subsidy is much larger: although the $400 billion figure
includes highway and road construction and repair, as well as other
direct support services like police protection and paramedical aid, it
does not include indirect costs like the estimated $47 billion the
United States has annually spent patrolling the Persian Gulf -- a
figure that has recently been substantially increased.  And then there
are the billions that go to Big Oil each year as tax shelters and
depletion allowances, the health costs associated with the burning of
fossil fuels, and the costs of the strategic petroleum reserve and
oil-spill cleanups.  The cost of this last item alone vastly exceeds
the entire solar-energy budget.  As for the ultimate costs of oil and
coal dependence, these defy calculation.

     The fossil fuels benefit from fantastic, almost unaccountable
subsidies -- paid in dependence, demoralization, and catastrophe, as
well as in cash.  In the 1970s, it seemed that a scarcity of oil might
force a transition to a new energy economy, but in the last few years
more fossil fuel has been discovered than has been extracted from the
ground.  This trend leaves state regulation standing alone, without
increased energy prices to buttress environmental policies -- a
situation that will likely remain for the indefinite future.  Just
before the war OPEC held a meeting that focused on Western European
moves to reduce pollution by curbing the use of oil.  Calling this "a
serious challenge," a Saudi official said that OPEC economists would
study the environmental concerns of Western Europe and the effects
they might have on the use of oil. [16]  Now, after the war, price
stability -- at a level advantageous to the winners -- is the order of
the day, and there's little chance that the cost of oil will go high
enough to force a real energy transition.

     The New York Times Magazine recently claimed that "many people,
throughout the world, believe that the implications -- scientific,
economic, medical, social, technological and political -- of LA's
environmental confrontation foreshadow the showdown awaiting the
entire world." [17]  It's a plausible claim.  If even Los Angeles, one
of the world's richest cities, can't control its air pollution, can
there be any hope in the larger global "showdown"?  At issue, of
course, is the auto-industrial economy, or rather, the car.  Cars mean
individual freedom, and given the social and physical structure of the
modern world, and especially of its cities, it's not hard to see why. 
Roads jam and commutes grow ever longer, but instead of real mass
transit (which is hard to build for the low-density cities of the
automobile age) we get "auto environments" -- quieter cars, CD
stereos, recorded novels, cellular phones, and even microwave ovens.  

     Even technical fixes, long scorned by eco-radicals as means of
avoiding substantive changes, are considered threats -- to the point
where it's hard to imagine a technology as revolutionary as, say,
insulation, being used to anything approaching its potential.  In late
1988 a mild EPA report on greenhouse policy became instantly
controversial, recommending as it did auto efficiency standards of 40
miles per gallon, plantation-grown wood as a fossil-fuel substitute,
and the aggressive pursuit of solar power.  Such initiatives pose no
threat to capitalism, at least not in the abstract, though they seem
to threaten this particular capitalism, with all its ties -- in
history, ideology and infrastructure -- to cheap fossil fuels.  

     If there is to be a conversion to a post-greenhouse economy, the
power of the fossil-fuel sector must be broken.  This, obviously, is a
tall order, for we inhabit a world in which "cheap" fossil fuels face
us on every side, objectified as cities, factories, ruling elites.  It
will take work to get out of here, and luck, and planning.  But, at
least in the United States, free-market ideology is so strong, and
planning held in such ill esteem, that even government research and
development funds for computer and networking technologies are
threatened.  One need be no friend of the high-tech path to see that,
if the dogmatic allure of minimal government can endanger developments
such as these, solar power and light rail are far from any
renaissance.

PREVENTION VERSUS ADAPTATION
     In the greenhouse literature, conversion strategies aimed at
reducing the production of greenhouse gases (i.e. carbon taxes aimed
to phase out fossil-fuels) go by the name of "prevention," while
muddling along as the climate changes (i.e. building dikes against
rising seas) is known as "adaptation."  Environmentalists support
prevention, while mainstream economists, following their own failing
god, usually advocate "freeing" the market to reshape society (and
nature) to the new climate.  Usually, the debate is restrained, and
the likely specifics of adaptation -- political chaos, for example, or
ferocious storms -- disappear in a cloud of genteel generalization. 
And though everyone knows that some adaptation will be inevitable,
environmentalists don't like to admit it, justifiably fearing that
such an admission will help force prevention from the agenda.  It's
easier, after all, to breed drought-resistant crops (the Israelis are
already doing so) than to convert to a sustainable economy; easier to
insure against a possible rise in sea level by raising the height of
offshore drilling platforms (Shell Oil is already doing so) than to
reduce oil consumption.

     Stephen Schneider has weighed into the prevention-vs-adaptation
debate with the notion of "active adaptation," in which preventive
measures are used to slow the warming and a planned post-greenhouse
infrastructure is phased in as the existing infrastructure wears out. 
It's a fine idea, if a bit abstract, and he tries to make it practical
as well by arguing that the adaptations necessary to stabilize the
atmosphere -- conservation, reforestation, and all the rest -- would
be economically beneficial in themselves, regardless of any threat of
global warming.

     The U.S. economics establishment, for its part, is wasting no
time in combatting moves to make prevention strategies appear
reasonable.  The New York Times, in a front-page story by economics
writer Peter Passell, entitled "Cure for Greenhouse Effect: The Costs
Will Be Staggering," [18] sketched the drift of official opinion. 
"Crude initial estimates," Passell opines, indicate that for at least
the next 50 years it will be cheaper to adapt to greenhouse warming
than to attack its causes.  He then presents a number of economists,
all regally unconcerned by the "externalities" ignored by their models
-- storms, starvation, extinction -- and suffering little strain
extending their traditional views to emerging conditions.  Harvard's
Thomas Shelling argues that increasing costs for irrigation and flood
control will raise the price of food by only 20 percent, that the
quality of life 100 years from now will depend as much on technology
and capital as on the amount of CO2 in the air, and that "if money to
contain carbon dioxide emissions comes out of other investment, future
civilizations could be the losers."  In another article, Passell is
even more sanguine.  Citing Department of Agriculture estimates that a
doubling of atmospheric CO2 would cost $170 billion annually in
reduced agricultural productivity, he concluded, "That's a lot of
money.  But it amounts to just 1 percent of current world income.  As
[Bush's Council of Economic Advisors] argues, it is in the same
ballpark as the costs of government regulations that now distort food
production and reduce its total value.  To put it another way, freer
markets in agriculture, the Council suggests, could more than offset
greenhouse-effect losses." [19]

     There are more examples, equally appalling.  The anti-prevention
economists tend to the political right, and generally see the economy
as conforming to some idealized notion of free-market efficiency.  In
reality, the economy is anything but efficient, as is shown by the
work of physicist and alternative energy analyst Amory Lovins.

A "LEAST COST" ENERGY ECONOMY?
     Lovins, best known for his Soft Energy Paths [20], takes a
position so far from the traditional standard that it's hard to
believe he's describing the same world.  While many economists argue
that conversion to a post-greenhouse world is unaffordable, especially
in the Third World, Lovins insists that it would be far cheaper to cut
greenhouse gas emissions by increasing energy efficiency than to
continue along the present path.  Further, he sees energy efficiency
as a prerequisite for sustainable development, and believes that "far
from being costly, abating global warming should, on the whole, be
immensely profitable.  Improving energy productivity can save the
world upwards of a trillion dollars per year -- as much as the global
military budget."  

     Lovins isn't crazy.  He's simply worked out the "inefficiencies"
in world energy markets, in detail, and concluded that the world can
be saved by being rationally frugal.  Talking about a 1981 book, Least
Cost Energy: Solving the CO2 Problem, which he coauthored, Lovins
says,  "We began by documenting the potential to save about three-
fourths of the energy used in 1973 to run the West German economy...
We then imagined, a century hence, an entire world industrialized to
that level: a world of eight billion people, with a fivefold gross
increase in the World Product and a tenfold increase in developing
countries' economic activity.  Yet if, in such a world, energy were
used in ways that saved money with 1980 prices and technologies, total
energy use would fall to a third of today's level... Of course, a
world with eight billion people industrialized to a West German
standard may be unrealistic or undesirable for other reasons.  Our
point was that an energy policy built on efficiency would enable the
Earth to support a prosperous civilization that was not plagued by
acid rain, global warming, urban smog, nuclear proliferation and
deforestation." [21]

     And what of Lovins' view that the market makes a good vehicle for
such discipline?  It makes his work interesting in two respects. 
First, by showing just how far today's economy diverges from one based
on "least cost" energy, he proves the ideological nature of analyses
that treat the existing economy as the product of "efficient" market
forces.  Second, his faith in the market prompts a key question: Why,
after all, is our present society so monumentally inefficient?  Is it,
as Lovins believes, because powerful institutional forces prevent the
market from imposing economic discipline?  Or is it, as green radicals
have long claimed, the very success of the market -- in particular its
success in "externalizing" social and ecological costs -- that is to
blame?  

     Certainly the captains of industry skip out on the bill whenever
they can, but this doesn't prove the market compels them to do so, for
today's economy is structured as much by militarism and state subsidy
as by direct market force.  What part, then, does the market play?  Is
this even an important question, or is it enough to know that
countries and corporations alike find profit and comparative advantage
in wasted energy?  If some new energy policy could change the rules of
the game, making it more profitable to pursue a solar transition than
to continue along the present disastrous path, would that policy stand
a chance of being implemented?  Lovins believes that it would, and
perhaps he's right.  But is such an energy policy possible, given the
degree to which the rich and powerful have bound their interests to
the fossil fuels?  Is it possible soon enough?

THE POLITICS OF EMERGENCY
     Like ecological crisis in general, the greenhouse crisis compels
us to ask, first of all, what will work.  Unfortunately, this isn't a
simple question, even in the best of cases -- and judging by the rush
to parlay the greenhouse crisis into a rebirth for nuclear power, it
doesn't appear that much rational, clear-headed pragmatism will come
of this emergency.  Just how much room remains for cheap maneuvering
is clear from the wave of articles we've suffered in the last few
years on a "new generation" of "passively safe" reactors.  The anti-
nuclear battle, it seems, will have to be fought once again, and this
time the battle lines will not be clearly drawn.  Senator Wirth caught
the spin of greenhouse nuclear boosterism just right when he argued, a
few years back, that it's time for the country to get over the
"nuclear measles."  "The environmentalists will come around," he
added.  "They can't help but come around." [22]

     And some environmentalists have come around.  William Reilly,
director of the Environmental Protection Agency, is one of them, and
so is Schneider, who finds himself compelled to advocate "inherently
safe" nukes -- in a book published by the Sierra Club! [23]  Thus,
environmentalists take up the spirit of emergency, but sometimes only
deepen the fogs of false necessity that obscure the real choices. 
Lovins, with his insistence on simple economics, is rather clearer,
noting that "investing in nuclear power rather than in far cheaper
energy-efficient technologies will make global warming worse." [24] 
It's a point that alone justifies the end of the nuclear industry.  It
also shows how, amidst apocalyptic storms, the "least cost" argument
can be a welcome tonic -- the more you spend on nukes, the less you
have for fluorescent bulbs, weatherstripping, solar research and mass
transit.  

     It's from the strength of such simple economics, ultimately, that
"Third Wave Environmentalism" draws its charms.  The Third Wavers,
from the Worldwatch Institute to the Environmental Defense Fund to the
EPA, seek to yoke the market to the goal of ecological reform -- and
to avoid stickier political issues -- by arguing that the best hope
lies in modulating existing markets with new taxes (like carbon taxes)
and in creating new markets in abstract goods like tradable "pollution
rights."  With such markets in place, both companies and countries
could profit by controlling pollution, for any unused space in their
pollution allocations could be sold to the highest bidder.  The goal
of such devices is to "internalize" ecological costs into the economic
calculus, and to thereby avoid the absurdities that occur when
bureaucracies attempt to micromanage economies.  In other words, Third
Wavers want to use the market to force the larger economy to adapt to
natural limits.

     The historical background here is crucial -- traditional
pollution-control measures have failed, and just about everyone admits
it.  Further, in the wake of the Eastern Bloc catastrophe, state-
centered "planning" is held in poor repute indeed.  The Third Wavers,
without faith in democratic forms of planning (if they have even heard
of them) see the market as the sole alternative to bureaucratic
command-and-control.  These days, there are even radical Third-Wavers, 
dreaming of markets that, though still capitalist, have become both
ecologically efficient and democratically accountable. [25]  It's a
desperate dream, to be sure, for it relegates popular opposition to
the margins of a market-oriented politics.  "Substantive democracy" is
just not in the cards.  Democracy may be possible, even necessary, but
ecological realism demands that the old dream of liberation yield to
the "socialization of the market."   

     Can Third-Wave environmentalism work?  The test must come in the
real social world.  Could a global market in CO2-emissions rights, as
Bush has half-seriously proposed, really help?  The first problem is
determining just how much CO2 each country would have the "right" to
generate in the first place.  If any matter was ever complicated, this
is it, but it's fair to say that, in general, the issue is split
between the North and the South, with the North preferring quotas
based on GNP and the South preferring quotas based on population. 
This is a rather basic disagreement, and it's hard to imagine it being
overcome without social changes that go far beyond those imagined by
Third Wave reformers.

     In fact, it's difficult to be optimistic about the prospects for
any kind of regulation, direct or market-mediated, as long as the core
institutions of society -- the market, militarism, property and wage
relations, the fossil-fuel economy -- are taken as surface phenomena
amenable to easy manipulation by bureaucratic agencies.  Consider Los
Angeles again, or any traffic-clotted U.S. city.  What institutions
were central to its construction?  Well, there's the auto-industrial
complex, for starters, but also the real-estate market.  How shall
they be regulated?  Fossil Fuels Policy Action, a small and not
particularly Third Wave organization, proposes a "paving moratorium."
[26]  It's a simple, lovely idea, and we may perhaps measure our
condition by checking to see if we can take it seriously. 

THE THIRD WORLD
     The greenhouse debate has split the planet between the
industrialized nations and countries like China and India that claim
that, since they currently generate only a fraction of the greenhouse
gases, they should be substantially aided for cooperating in ways that
will impede their development.  As things stand, their claim is more
than reasonable.  The habits of the average North American release
five tons of CO2 into the atmosphere each year, while the global
average, an average that includes North Americans, is only half a ton.
  
     From an ecological perspective, everything depends on the Third
World following a post-greenhouse path.  If it doesn't, conservation
gains in the industrialized countries will be swamped by deforestation
and increased greenhouse gas production in the Third World -- where
the rate of growth of energy production, much of it based on burning
dirty coal, is twice the global average.  Unfortunately, helping the
Third World carve out a radical new development path is no more than a
rhetorical priority in the North, where all the real effort is going
into the post-Cold War scramble for position.

     At least environmentalists now understand this situation,
something that was not true as recently as five years ago.  In fact,
both the left and the liberal wings of the environmental movement now
see Third World debt as an ecological issue -- along with pollution,
population, energy production, agriculture, and the rest of it. 
Today, all serious reviews of the greenhouse crisis agree there's no
real solution that doesn't define a new kind of development, one
attractive enough to derail the considerable momentum of heavy-metal
industrialism.  All of which serves to complicate life for liberal
politicians like Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, who recently
became the first U.S. Senator to write (with coauthor Jack Waugh) a
greenhouse book, World on Fire: Saving an Endangered Earth. [27]  Its
most interesting moment comes when Mitchell tries to wedge
"sustainable development" into the political agenda.  He makes the
main point, that "even dramatic improvements in energy efficiency will
not be sufficient to protect the environment -- if they are confined
to the industrialized world," then goes on to call for "retiring the
debt of developing countries" and for "technology-transfer, subsidies
and loans" designed to "take developing counties beyond the levels of
efficiency justified on the basis of free market prices."  Brave
words, these, from a Senator who toured the Persian Gulf before the
war, posing with Bush and adding a much-needed bipartisan gloss to his
threats of war.

     Public relations, as always, is part of the problem.  The
"development community" -- the World Bank and its kin -- is abuzz with
talk of "sustainable development," but thus far the reality has been
considerably less inspiring than the rhetoric.  It's the same story
with the debt crisis.  Certainly the Brady Plan for "debt relief" aims
not to lift the debt now crushing the Third World, but only to reduce
it enough to avoid open revolt, and thus to continue the agonizing
process by which the debt crisis is indefinitely, and profitably,
protracted.  The workings of the debt-management machinery are
familiar enough -- new loans and a new market, this time a market in
discounted debt.  The discounts reflect domestic austerity and
international "confidence," and the debt market that sets them seems
natural enough in a market-fixated society.  Will it, however, ease
the burden enough to allow humane development paths?  This is an
altogether different matter.  Much of the Third World is sinking into
ecological and social chaos, yet the international response is
constrained by the prerogatives of the banks.  The banks!  This will
change only when, in the words of one New York Times commentary, a
Washington "consensus" develops that "the problems afflicting [the]
debtors pose a threat to regional political and economic stability."
[28]  How, under such conditions, can the Third World be asked to
sacrifice for the common good? 

     The bottom line is that the Third World is profoundly constrained
by economic and political dependency on the cores of international
power.  The industrial nations, with their control of capital and
technology, hold the keys to a global post-greenhouse economy.  If
ecological disaster is to be avoided, they must act soon, decisively
and in a way that doesn't simply seek to modernize the terms of Third
World dependency.  It's difficult to see this happening without a
successful and radical campaign for ecological conversion here at
home.

     And where is that campaign?  Stalled as usual, though conversion
activists remain optimistic about "the long run."  There are, to be
sure, grounds for optimism -- if the US economy continues its decline,
as is likely, pressure for a green "New Deal" of some sort will build. 
But will it be green enough to stop the warming?  Think concretely. 
What authority would enforce the depreciation of oil company stocks? 
If this is politically impossible, then what politics and what market
structure could motivate the redeployment of the capital now tied up
in fossil fuels?  Over what time period?  What about the overall
infrastructure, so much of which wouldn't fit into a post-greenhouse
world?  Who would take the loss?  The government?  Is the financing of
a solar transition in the Third World to be left to the World Bank? 
What, finally, will it take to get something more than fatal half-
measures? 

ECOLOGY AFTER THE COLD WAR
     Earth Day 1990 brought a spasm of liberal self-congratulation, a
"Good Earthkeeping Seal of Approval," and a victory in the dolphin
battle -- but little by way of structural reform.  Still, 1990 will
remain as a milestone, marking the passing of the Cold War as clearly
as it marks a watershed in environmental history.  The next decade may
not be a happy one, but it will see the emergence of a new kind of
ecological politics.

     Not that there isn't already a radical green politics, or that it
hasn't already marked the political landscape.  But, far too often,
the radicals place their faith in abstract ideals like "nature" and
"personal responsibility," and are innocent of any coherent, sensible 
explanation for ecological crisis.  Fortunately, a mature red/green
politics is also, finally, emerging -- "fortunately" because the need
for it is acute.  Why do we go to war for oil?  Why is economic growth
so chaotic and compulsive?  Why does technology always seem to betray
its promise?  These questions simply find no good answers in the moral
and biocentric catagories of traditional environmentalism.

     The ecology movement has been deeply marked by the silences and
fears of Cold War culture, and it will take time for it to learn the
significance (and limits) of the socialist tradition.  Many if not
most ecological radicals still see "politics" as synonymous with self-
serving compromise, and "capitalism" as merely an ideological category
of a justly moribund left.  Their view -- that communism and
capitalism are only variations on a system of exterminist
industrialism -- is not without merit, but it's hard to see it as the
basis of an adequate politics, if only because its name for the beast,
"industrialism," suggests inadequate correctives.

     It is a measure of the times that, in the last few years, an 
essay called The End of History [29] and a book called The End of
Nature both took proud places in the march of literary events.  In the
first, a State Department functionary named Francis Fukuyama invoked
Hegel's philosophy of history to claim the "triumph of liberal
democracy" as an event of such significance that now "there will be
neither art nor philosophy, just the perpetual caretaking of the
museum of human history."  In the second, a young man described the
likely outcomes of greenhouse warming, then went on to dismiss all
politics as insignificant, and to compose an ode to despair.     

     McKibben tells the tale of environmental radicals throughout the
developed world, who can squeeze neither their fears nor their hopes
into the old moulds.  That they reject "socialism" along with official
environmentalism is not altogether bad news, for the "real" socialism
we have known has no just claim to our loyalty.  But neither is it
good news, for environmentalism, radical or otherwise, has a distance
to go before it can take up the challenges of the ecological crisis.  

     The distinctive culture and ideas of the greens -- deep ecology,
romantic naturalism, the claim to be "neither right nor left, but out
front," animal rights, direct action, the too-simple Luddism that sees
only evil in advanced technology -- are easy to ridicule.  But recall
that the ecology movement evolved in a world where socialism, and left
radicalism in general, were lost in the shadows of the Eastern Bloc,
and that by virtue of its independence it has been able to claim key
cultural and technological problems as its own, and to develop its own
increasingly radical language.  Left greens should remember this, even
as they call upon their traditions to study the economic and political
aspects of the crisis, deepen the notion of radical democracy, and
mark the currents in these all pervasive and almost invisible
capitalist waters.

     The coming devastation will breed a vast hatred.  It may even be
that the ideas of the green hard core -- ecological misanthropy most
notable among them -- are poised for a breakout into larger domains. 
Fortunately, this is not the only possibility, and radical outrage is
not likely to remain eternally constrained within the anti-communist
frameworks of Cold War analysis.  The ecology movement is full of
those just now discovering the pleasures of romanticism, and believing
it the essence of true revolution.  Far more important than their
illusions, though, is the probability that capitalism -- like the
atmosphere -- may soon cease to seem a part of a natural, eternal
world.  

     It's hard to be realistic about the ecological crisis without
yielding to the formidable logic of a very grim situation.  Still, it
is wrong to follow McKibben in attributing the tragedy of the times to
some inescapable trajectory towards an ecological holocaust.  It is,
rather, because our trajectory is not inescapable, because there is so
much that could be done, and because so little of it is being done
that this is such a dark time.  This paralysis is the real tragedy.
I'd like to thank Bill McKibben, who's book pissed me off so much I
had to write this, and the San Francisco Socialist Review Collective,
which really bent over backwards to help me get it right.

<CENTER><H1>Chernobyl and Soviet Reactors</H1>Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper 22<P>December 1995</CENTER><P><HR><B>
<UL><LI>The Chernobyl accident was the result of a flawed reactor design that
was operated outside authorised procedures.
<LI>The resulting steam explosion and fire released 3-4 per cent of
the reactor core into the atmosphere.<LI>31 people were killed, and there have since been ten deaths fromthyroid cancer due to the accident.
<li>Other similar reactors continue to operate, at the Chernobyl site and also
in Russia and Lithuania.</UL></B>
<HR><P>The April 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the
Ukraine was the product of a very flawed Soviet reactor design
coupled with serious mistakes made by the plant operators who during a test,
violated procedures intended to ensure safe operation of the plant. <P>

The accident destroyed the reactor, killed 31 people almost immediately (28
from radiation exposure), caused radiation sickness in a further 200-300, and 
contaminated large areas of Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and beyond.<P>

About 130,000 people received significant radiation doses (ie above
internationally accepted ICRP limits) and are being closely monitored.  
A much larger number received some radiation exposure from the accident. 
About ten deaths from thyroid cancer have occurred, and further deaths from
leukaemia and other cancers are expected. <P>The Chernobyl accident was a
unique event and the only time in the history of commercial nuclear power that
radiation-related fatalities occurred. <P>
The Soviet-designed RBMK-type reactor of 950 MWe unit uses a large mass of
graphite to moderate the reaction and water flowing through channels
holding the fuel elements to cool it.  There is no containment structure on
this kind of reactor. 
<P><B>WHAT HAPPENED</B><P>On 25 April the reactor crew at Chernobyl 4 began
preparing for a test to determine how long turbines would spin and supply
power following a complete shut down of the reactor.  Similar tests had
already been carried out successfully at Chernobyl and other plants.<P>

A series of operator mistakes including the disabling of automatic shutdown
mechanisms preceded the attempted test early on 26 April. 
As water flow diminished, power output increased.  
When the operator moved to shut down the reactor from its unstable condition
arising from his previous errors, a peculiarity of the design caused the power
to surge dramatically.<P> 

The fuel elements ruptured and the resultant steam lifted off the 
cover plate of the reactor, releasing fission products to the atmosphere.  
A second explosion threw out fragments of burning fuel and graphite from the
core and allowed air to rush in, causing the graphite to burst into flames.  
The graphite burned for 9 days, causing the main  release of radioactivity
into the environment. <P>

Some 5000 tonnes of boron, dolomite, sand, clay and lead were dropped on to
the burning core by helicopter in an effort to extinguish the blaze 
and limit the release of radioactive particles.<P>

<B>IMMEDIATE IMPACT</B>
<P>It is estimated that about 3 to 4% of the total radioactive material
in the Chernobyl 4 reactor core was released from the plant. Most of this 
was deposited as dust close by, the rest was carried by wind over the 
Ukraine and Europe.<P>

The main casualties were among the firefighters who
attended the initial small fires on the roof of the turbine building, 
which were all put out in a few hours.<P>

The next task was cleaning up the radioactivity at the site so 
that the remaining three reactors could be restarted, and the 
damaged reactor shielded more permanently.  According to Soviet 
estimates 600,000 people involved in the recovery and clean up immediately 
after the accident received high doses of radiation.

<P>Some children in the surrounding areas were exposed to radiation 
doses sufficient to lead to thyroid cancers, (which themselves 
are not usually fatal if diagnosed and treated early).  Early
radiation exposure was due to iodine-131; later, caesium-137 was the main
hazard.<P>

Initially some 45 000 residents were evacuated from a 10 km radius of the
plant.  In May 1986, all those living within an 30 kilometre radius of the
plant - a further 100 000 people, had been relocated.<P>

<B>ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH EFFECTS</B>

<P>Several organisations have reported on the impacts of the Chernobyl
accident, but all have found difficulties in assessing the significance 
of what they have observed because of the paucity of reliable 
statistical information on health matters prior to 1986. <P>

In 1989 the World Health Organisation (WHO) raised concerns that local
medical scientists were not well versed in radiation effects and had
incorrectly attributed various biological and health effects to 
radiation exposure.  A Red Cross team in 1990 raised similar concerns
regarding thyroid problems encountered in the population.<P>

An IAEA study involving more than 100 experts in 1991 was more 
substantial, and in the absence of pre 1986 data used a control 
population to compare those exposed to radiation.  They found 
significant health disorders in both control and exposed groups, 
but at that stage none was radiation related. 

<P>Studies in the Ukraine, Russia and Belarus since have confirmed 
a risingincidence of thyroid cancer among exposed children.  Late in 
1995, WHO linked nearly 700 cases of thyroid cancer among children and
adolescents to the Chernobyl accident, and among these some ten deaths are
attributed to radiation from it. <P>Psycho-social effects among those
affected by the accident are emerging as a major concern, and are similar to
those arising from other major disasters such as earthquakes, fires amd
floods. <P>

<B>CHERNOBYL TODAY</B><P>The Chernobyl unit 4 is now enclosed in a 
concrete sarcophagus which allows continuing operation of the other 
reactors at the plant. However, the structure has been weakened by
radioactivity.  A feasibility study is examining remedial work including
possible replacement of the whole structure.<P>

Numerous safety deficiencies remain in the other reactors at Chernobyl.
However, worsening energy shortages necessitate the continued operation 
of those reactors. <P>The Ukraine is dependent upon, and deeply in 
debt to, Russia for energy supplies, particularly oil and gas, and 
these have been drastically reduced.  Continued operation of its 
nuclear power stations, which supply about 30% of its electricity, 
has become even more important and the country is pursuing the 
development of nuclear fuel cycle facilities which will increase its 
energy independence.<P>

<B>SOVIET-DESIGNED REACTORS</B><P>
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) the safety 
of nuclear power plants in the former Eastern bloc is a problem of 
continuing concern.  The current energy demand in these countries is 
such that there is little flexibility to allow for closing even those 
plants which are of most concern. <P>There are currently 63 nuclear 
plants in operation in the former Eastern bloc countries and others 
under construction.  They include:

<UL>
<LI>11 first generation VVER-440/230 pressurised water reactors which 
have serious design deficiencies (4 in Bulgaria, 4 in Russia, 2 in 
Slovakia, 1 in Armenia).  Four such units in 
eastern Germany have been permanently shut down. 
<LI>14 second generation VVER-440/213 pressurised water reactors with 
some major design deficiencies which have been partly remedied.  
(Two more in Finland have been greatly modified.) 
<LI>20 third generation VVER-1000 pressurised water reactors with a 
full containment structure.  These have some instrumentation and control
system deficiencies.
<LI>15 RBMK light water graphite reactors such as at Chernobyl, in 
operation in (and unique to) Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania.  The five 
oldest of these were commissioned in the 1970s at Kursk (2), 
Leningrad (2) and Chernobyl (1), and are of most concern. 
<LI>4 small GBWR reactors in eastern Siberia, constructed in the 1970s.
</UL>

Significant assistance has been initiated by the OECD, IAEA and 
Commission of the European Communities to bring these reactors up to 
western safety standards, or at least to effect significant 
improvements.  This involves plant modifications, identification and 
remedying of safety deficiencies, training of staff and audits of the 
status of plant components. <P>

The national, bilateral and international safety initiatives being 
undertaken are concentrating on the first generation of Soviet-built
VVER-440/230 pressurised water reactors and the RBMK reactors, which 
have  the most serious deficiencies.

<P>Modifications have already been made to overcome deficiencies in the 
15 RBMK reactors still operating.  In these, originally the nuclear 
chain reaction and power output would increase if cooling water were 
lost, in contrast to Western designs.  It was this effect which caused 
the uncontrolled power surge that led to the destruction of Chernobyl 
unit 4.  Automated inspection equipment has also been installed in 
these reactors. <P>

The other  class of reactors which has been the focus of 
international attention for safety upgrades is the VVER-440/230 
reactors.  One of these, in Armenia, was restarted late in 1995 after 
a six-year shutdown.  However it had been substantially upgraded 
and an IAE A inspection had then approved it. <P>

<CENTER><H3>Chernobyl Accident Health Effects - WHO Facts & Figures</H3></CENTER>
<P>The following is the text of a briefing paper issued in May 1995 
to officials of the World Health Organisation on the known health 
effects of the 1986 Chernobyl accident.<P>

<CENTER><H4>THE CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT</H4>26 April 1986</CENTER><P>

In connection with the anniversary of the Chernobyl accident I have 
received a number of requests for information about the health effects 
that have followed the accident.  The following is an extract from a recent
report giving details of the health effects that have been verified so 
far and those that might be expected in the future, which may prove 
useful to members of WHO's European Centre for Environment and Health.<P>

"In the accident about 200 persons among the operating staff and the 
fire fighting crew suffered acute effects of radiation.  About 115,000
residents were moved from the 30 km radius exclusion zone surrounding 
the reactor, and there is the possibility that an additional 200,000 
or more will be relocated in the future.  Some 650,000 persons involved 
in the clean up of the plant site and the 30 km zone were exposed.  
Very extensive areas ofthe former Soviet Union and beyond its 
frontiers were affected by radioactive fallout. <P>

"At the present time, nine  years later, many of the expected 
potential health effects of exposure to radiation have not become 
apparent because of the latencies for some radiation-induced cancers.  
The full impact of the accident will become apparent only after several
decades.  So far the health consequences are as follows:

<UL>
<LI>acute radiation sickness and burns to the skin from beta 
radioactivity to some 200 persons, causing 28 deaths from acute 
radiation syndrome; 
<LI>childhood thyroid cancer in children living in Belarus,
the northern districts of the Ukraine and parts of the border of the 
Russian Federation with Belarus and the Ukraine.  So far nearly 500 
cases of childhood thyroid cancer have been detected in a 
population of about 3 million children particularly at risk;
<LI>psycho-social effects from stress-related conditions, through 
lifestyle changes, to near complete social disintegration of communities. 
Some 10 million persons live in the most affected regions.
</UL>

<P>On the basis of past experience of exposure to radiation further 
effects may be observed.  The tissue most sensitive to radiation 
exposure, in addition to the thyroid and bone marrow, is the breast of 
young women. Populations within 100 km would be particularly at risk.  
The isotopes of iodine could contribute to breast dose at certain 
stages of development or during and after pregnancy. <P>

"The effects of beta-emitting hot particles on the induction skin and 
lung cancers is also a matter for concern.  Such hot particles were 
observed as far afield as Finland and animal experiments have shown 
them to be capable of inducing lung tumours."<P>

Due to the size of the exposed population, hitherto unrecognised effects 
of radiation resulting from the incorporation of the less well studied 
fission products may well become evident in due course.

<HEAD><TITLE>Plans For New Reactors Worldwide</TITLE></HEAD><CENTER><H1>Plans For New Reactors Worldwide</H1>Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper 19<P>February 1995</CENTER><P><HR><B><UL><LI>Nuclear power capacity worldwide is increasing steadily but not dramatically, with 36 reactors under construction in 12 countries.<LI>Most planned reactors are in the Asian region.<LI>Further capacity is being created by plant upgrading.<li>Plant life extension programs are receiving serious attention.</UL></B><HR>Although some countries, notably Japan and the Republic of Korea,intend to continue major nuclear power construction programs,the rate of growth of installed nuclear generating capacity overthe next ten to fifteen years is expected to be low. One country,Italy, has completely abandoned its nuclear power program andothers have cancelled or indefinitely suspended partially constructedand planned power reactors and/or imposed a moratorium on anynew nuclear construction.<P><B>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</B><P>The International Atomic Energy (IAEA) Agency estimates that bythe year 2000 worldwide installed nuclear capacity will have increasedby 9.5 to 12%, leading to a total installed capacity of some 370-380GWe.  These IAEA estimates, and other recent industry estimatesof nuclear power growth over the near term, are based only onfirm orders and known plans for plant expansion, life extensionor closure.  They do not involve any extrapolation of theoreticalmodels, so are generally conservative and not subject to the largeuncertainties that resulted in speculative projections by thenuclear industry in past decades.<P>Some 36 power reactors are currently being constructed in 12 countriesin the world (Table, p4), notably France, the Republic of Korea,Japan and eastern Europe.  Two of these, Monju and Kakrapar 2,have achieved initial criticality.  Construction is well-advancedon many of them and, based on reported progress and allowing fordelays in countries such as India, 31 with a total net capacityof 25,000 MWe are expected to be in operation before the year2000.  This excludes the third and fourth Mochovce reactors inSlovakia and three of the five reactors at Romania's first nuclearpower station.  <P>In addition, if the necessary financing is available, three almost-completed950 MWe PWRs in the Ukraine could be commissioned within a fewyears, replacing some of the existing nuclear capacity there andArmenia has begun to return to service its two closed 400 MWereactors, with one unit planned to be restarted in 1995.<P><B>INCREASED CAPACITY</B><P>Increased nuclear capacity in some countries is resulting fromthe uprating of existing plants.  Power reactors in Belgium, Swedenand Germany, for example, have had their generating capacity increased. In Switzerland, where there is a ten-year moratorium on nuclearpower construction, a program is being undertaken to increasethe capacity of its five reactors by 10%.<P>Finland plans to boost the capacity of the Olkiluoto plant, whichhas two 710 MWe Swedish BWRs commissioned in 1978 and 1980,  by250 MWe (17.6%) to 1670 MWe.  The engineering program will costA$ 260 million.  <P><B>LONGER TERM PLANS</B><P>After the year 2000 and until orders are placed or constructioncommenced, forecasts of installed nuclear capacity become muchless certain.  When the present construction programs are completed,most significant nuclear power growth is expected to continueonly in the Asian region.  The International Energy Agency (IEA)forecasts that the growth rate of electricity output from nuclearpower will be 1.3% per year for the period 1991 to 2010.  TheIEA predicts that the nuclear share of world electricity outputwill decrease from 17.5% in 1991 to 13.2% in 2010.<P> <P>ANSTO's nuclear power reactor data files show that seven countrieswith existing nuclear power programs (the UK, Russia, China, India,Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) and four countries without anynuclear capacity at present (Indonesia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran)have announced firm plans to build new power reactors.  This doesnot include North Korea, where the declared intention to introduceLWR technology is presently under international negotiation. In all, 73 power reactors with a total net capacity of 60,700MWe are planned, none in North or South America.  In addition,orders have been placed in 1995 for two reactors in South Koreaand one in Iran.<P>In western Europe, Nuclear Electric, the UK nuclear utility, hasannounced plans for Sizewell C (2 x 1,288 MWe, PWRs) and HinkleyPoint C (1,110 MWe, PWR).  However, the intention of the UK Governemntto privatise Nuclear Electric makes implementation of these plansdependent on private sector financing.  In France, where furtherreactor orders had been expected in the later half of the decade,the national utility announced in June that it will order no newgenerating capacity, nuclear or conventional, until at least theyear 2000.  Sites have, however, been designated for new powerreactors and new reactor construction is expected to be resumedsome time next decade.<P>In eastern Europe, the Russian government in December 1992 approveda nuclear power construction program up to the year 2010.  Inaddition to the two reactors presently being completed, a further12, with a total capacity of 9,200 MWe, are planned to be operatingby 2010. Most are at existing sites.  Several of the oldest Russianreactors are expected to be retired next decade and it is Russia'sannounced intention to replace retired nuclear capacity by newconstruction at the same site, to optimise the use of establishedinfrastructure and personnel.  Obtaining the approval of localand regional authorities, which have been responsible for thesuspension of a number of nuclear power plant projects in recentyears, may be difficult.<P>Most planned reactors are in the Asian region.  Nuclear poweris intended to play a major role in the future electricity supplymix in both South Korea and Japan. <P>In addition to the seven reactors under construction,  South Koreaplans to bring a further seven, with a total capacity of 6,700MWe, into operation by the year 2006.  Two 950&#160;MWe reactorswere ordered early in 1995; these are expected to be the 17thand 18th to go on line, in 2001-2.  Japan has plans and, in mostcases, designated sites and announced timetables for a further19 power reactors, totalling 22,000 MWe, but only two of thesehave completed the governmental approval process.  Fulfillingthe necessary conditions for approval can take over a decade.<P>India has announced plans for twelve power reactors (4,400 MWe)but financing difficulties are expected to continue to cause considerabledelays.  <P>China has begun the next phase of its nuclear power program. Civil construction work has started at its third nuclear powerstation (2 x 600 MWe, PWRs), and an agreement with Russia fortwo 953 MWe PWRs has been signed.  In 1995 China signed an agreementwith France to construct and a second nuclear power station <BR>(2 x 900 MWe, PWRs) in Guangdong Province.  Power reactors inother Chinese provinces are under active consideration. <P>Indonesia has recently announced that the feasibility study forits first power reactor has been completed and that constructionof the 600 MWe unit could begin as early as 1996. <P>Egypt and Turkey have for decades included a nuclear power plantin their electricity plans.  A site has been selected in eachcountry and a number of feasibility and other studies carriedout.  Construction remains unlikely.  <P>Nuclear power plant construction in Iran was suspended in 1979but in 1995 Iran signed an agreement with Russia to complete a1000 MWe PWR at Bushehr.  Iran also has an earlier agreement withRussia for the supply of two 410 MWe power reactors and one withChina for the supply of a nuclear power station with two 300&#160;MWePWRs.  <P><B>PLANT LIFE EXTENSION</B><P>Most nuclear power plants have a nominal design lifetime of 20to 40 years, but it is now believed they can operate longer andmajor programs exploring plant life extension are being undertaken. When the oldest commercial nuclear power stations in the world,Calder Hall and Chapelcross in the UK, were built in the 1950s,it was assumed that they would have a useful lifetime of 20 years. They are now authorised to operate for 40 years and the operatoris seeking to extend their lives even further.  <P>The technical and economic feasibility of replacing major reactorcomponents, such as steam generators in PWRs and pressure tubesin Candu HWRs, has been demonstrated.  The possibilities of componentreplacement and licence renewals extending the lifetimes of existingplants are very attractive to utilities, especially in view ofthe public acceptance difficulties involved in constructing replacementnuclear capacity.  <P>On the other hand, economic, regulatory and political considerationshave led to the premature closure of some power reactors, particularlyin the United States.  The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency has predictedthat 19.3 GWe of nuclear capacity (35 units) will be taken outof service in OECD/NEA member countries between 1994 and 2010.<P><I>Sources:   Nuclear Services Section,  External Affairs, ANSTO.    9/94, updated 5/95</I><P><I>NucNet News #191/95</I><P><B>POWER REACTORS UNDER CONSTRUCTION </B><PRE WIDTH=132>YEAR*       COUNTRY             REACTOR             TYPE        MWe         1995        Japan               Monju               FBR         250         1995        India               Kakrapar 2          HWR         202         1995        Romania             Cernavoda 1         HWR         620         1995        Russia              Kursk 5             BWR         925         1995        USA                 Watts Bar 1         PWR         1177        1997        Argentina           Atucha 2            HWR         692         1996        France              Chooz B1            PWR         1455        1996        France              Chooz B2            PWR         1455        1996        India               Kaiga 1             HWR         202         1996        Japan               Kashiwazaki 6       BWR         1315        1996        Korea RO            Yonggwang 4         PWR         950         1996        Russia              Kalinin 3           PWR         950         1997        Slovak Republic     Mochovce 1          PWR         388         1997        Czech Republic      Temelin 1           PWR         892         1997        France              Civaux 1            PWR         1450        1997        India               Kaiga 2             HWR         202         1997        India               Rajasthan 3         HWR         202         1997        India               Rajasthan 4         HWR         202         1997        Japan               Genkai 4            PWR         1127        1997        Japan               Kashiwazaki 7       BWR         1315        1997        Korea RO            Wolsong 2           HWR         650         1997        Romania             Cernavoda 2         HWR         620         1998        Slovak Republic     Mochovce 2          PWR         388         1998        Czech Republic      Temelin 2           PWR         892         1998        France              Civaux 2            PWR         1450        1998        Korea RO            Ulchin 3            PWR         950         1998        Korea RO            Wolsong 3           HWR         650         1999        Brazil              Angra 2             PWR         1245        1999        Slovak Republic     Mochovce 3          PWR         388         1999        Korea RO            Ulchin 4            PWR         950         1999        Korea RO            Wolsong 4           HWR         650         1999        Pakistan            Chashma 1           PWR         300         2000        Slovak Republic     Mochovce 4          PWR         388         2001        Romania             Cernavoda 3         HWR         620         2002        Romania             Cernavoda 4         HWR         620         2002        Romania             Cernavoda 5         HWR         620         </PRE>* Latest announced year of commercial operation.<P><HR><A HREF="index.htm">Return to Index</A><P>

     1992 IPCC Supplement  -  Scientific Assessment, Summary


The 1992 Supplement is an interim report, it is not as
well-structured as the 1990 Assessment, and there are almost
no references.  I tried to select what I presumed to be generally
interesting points, this is a personal judgment.  Information
pertaining to the same topic often appears at two or three places
in the Supplement, I tried to collect it.  I tried to retain the
meaning and often the wording of the original but, alas, English
is not my first language. Any errors or misconceptions are mine.

[1]  Major Conclusions

Findings of scientific research since 1990 either confirm or do
not justify alteration of the major conclusions of the 1990 IPCC
Scientific Assessment, in particular the following :

o  Emissions resulting from human activities are substantially
increasing the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2),
methane (CH4), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and nitrous oxide
(N2O).
o  The sensitivity of global mean surface temperature to doubling
CO2 is unlikely to lie outside the range 1.5 to 4.5 oC,  with a
best estimate, based on model results and taking into account the
observed climate record, of 2.5 oC.
o  Due to our incomplete understanding, there are many
uncertainties in the predictions, particularly with regard to the
timing, magnitude and regional patterns of climate change.
o  Global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6
oC over the last 100 years.
o  The size of this warming is broadly consistent with predictions
of climate models, but it is also of the same magnitude as natural
climate variability. Thus the observed increase could be largely
due to this natural variability; alternatively this variability
and other human factors could have offset a still larger
human-induced greenhouse warming.
o  The unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect
from observations is not likely for a decade or more.


[2]  Gases and Aerosols   (includes radiative forcing)

o  CO2:  The best estimate for global fossil fuel emissions in
1989 and 1990 is 6.0 (5.5-6.5) GtC  (gigatonnes of carbon = 10^9
tonnes of C), compared to 5.7 (5.2-6.2) GtC in 1987.  Despite new
informationregarding rates of deforestation, there is no strong
reason to revise the IPCC 1990 estimate of annual average net flux
to the atmosphere of 1.6 (0.6-2.6) GtC from land-use change during
the decade of the 1980s.  The estimated total release of carbon in
the form of CO2 from oil well fires in Kuwait during 1991 was
0.065 GtC, about one percent of total annual anthropogenic
emissions.  Over the last decade, the fraction of CO2 emissions
which remains in the atmosphere is estimated to have been  46 %
(39-53 %).  The imbalance (of order 1-2 GtC/year) between sources
and sinks, that is, the "missing CO2 sink", has not yet been
resolved.

o  Sulphur:  The cooling effect of sulphate aerosols (particles,
not to be confused with propellants used in 'aerosol sprays')
resulting from sulphur emissions may have offset a significant
part of the greenhouse warming in the Northern Hemisphere during
the past several decades.  For clear-sky conditions alone, the
cooling caused by current rates of emissions has been estimated to
be about 1 W/m^2  (averaged over the Northern Hemisphere), which
should be compared with the estimate of 2.5 W/m^2 for the heating
due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions up to the present. 
In addition, sulphate aerosols may affect the radiation budget
through changes in cloud optical properties.

There are large regional variations in the effects of the
aerosols.  The effect is negligible in the Southern Hemisphere. 
The globally averaged magnitude of the effect of sulphate aerosols
has not yet been calculated accurately and further work is needed. 
The aerosols are very short-lived in the atmosphere, their effect
on global warming rapidly adjusts to increases or decreases in
emissions.  While partially offsetting the greenhouse warming, the
sulphur emissions are also responsible for acid rain and other
environmental effects.

o  Stratospheric ozone and CFCs:  Depletion of O3 in the lower
strato-sphere during the 1980s has caused a reduction in radiative
forcing which is believed to be comparable in magnitude  to the
increase in radiative forcing due to CFCs (globally-averaged) over
the last decade or so.  The effect at high latitudes is
particularly pronounced.  The worldwide consumption of CFCs 11,
12, and 113 is now 40 % below 1986 levels.  Further reductions are
mandated by the 1990 London Amendments to the Montreal Protocol. 
Even if the 1990 London Amendments were to be implemented by all
nations, the abundance of stratospheric chlorine and bromine will
increase over the next several years.

o  Tropospheric ozone:  There is evidence to indicate that O3
levels in the troposphere up to 10km altitude above the few
existing ozonesonde stations in Europe have increased by up to 10
% per decade over the past decades.  There is not an adequate
global set of observations to quantify the magnitude of the
increase in radiative forcing.  However, it has been calculated
that a 10 % uniform global increase in tropospheric O3 would
increase radiative forcing by about 0.1 W/m^2. Little new
information is available regarding the tropospheric O3 precursors  
(CO, non-methane hydrocarbons, NOx), their budgets remain
uncertain.

o  Methane:  Whilst the rates of increase in the atmospheric
concentrations of many greenhouse gases have continued to grow or
remain steady, those of methane and some halogen compounds have
slowed. The rate for methane has declined from about 20 ppbv/year
in the late 1970s to possibly as low as 10 ppbv/year in 1989.  No
completely satisfactory hypothesis has yet been forwarded to
explain these observations.  There has been some progress
regarding the sources of the methane emissions, e.g., some data
indicate that global emissions from rice paddies may amount to
less than previously estimated.  But there are still many
uncertainties in accurately quantifying the magnitude of emissions
from individual sources.  The latest estimate of the atmospheric
lifetime of methane is about 11 years.

o  Nitrous oxide (N2O):  Nylon production, nitric acid production
and automobiles with three-way catalysts have been identified as
possibly significant anthropogenic global sources of N2O. 
However, the sum of all known anthropogenic and natural sources is
still barely sufficient to balance the calculated atmospheric sink
or to explain the observed increase in the atmospheric abundance
of N2O.

o  Global Warming Potentials:  Gases can exert a radiative forcing
both  directly and indirectly.  Direct forcing occurs when the gas
itself is a greenhouse gas; indirect forcing occurs when chemical
transformation of the original gas produces or destroys a gas or
gases which themselves are greenhouse gases.  The concept of the
Global Warming Potential (GWP) has been developed as a measure of
the possible warming effect of each gas relative to CO2.  For many
gases, the practical utility of the GWP depends on adequate
quantification of the indirect effects as well as the direct. The
direct components of the GWPs have been recalculated, taking into
account revised estimated lifetimes, for a set of time horizons
ranging from 20 to 500 years, with CO2 as a reference gas. 
Because of incomplete understanding of chemical processes, most of
the indirect GWPs reported in IPCC (1990) are likely to be in
substantial error.  Working Group I is not yet in a position to
recommend revised numerical values.  For methane, it is known that
the indirect GWP is positive and could be comparable in magnitude
to its direct value.  Recalculated GWP values for selected key
gases for the 100 year time horizon  (note that GWPs depend on the
time horizon) :

                            Direct GWP   Sign of the indirect GWP
      Carbon dioxide              1          none
      Methane (CH4)              11          positive
      Nitrous oxide (N2O)       270          uncertain
      CFC-11                   3400          negative
      CFC-12                   7100          negative
      HCFC-22                  1600          negative
      HFC-134a                 1200          none


[3]  Climate Observations

o  The anomalously high global mean surface temperatures of the
late 1980s have continued into 1990 and 1991 which are the warmest
years in the record.   

o  Average warming over parts of the Northern Hemisphere
mid-latitude continents has been found to be largely characterized
by increases in minimum (night-time) rather than maximum (daytime)
temperatures.  These changes appear to be partly related to
increases in cloudiness but other factors cannot be excluded such
as a direct cooling effect of aerosols on maximum temperatures in
sunny weather, an influence of increasing concentrations of
greenhouse gases and some residual influence of urbanisation on
minimum temperatures.  Only 25 % of the gobal land area has been
analysed, a more complete study is needed.

o  There has been considerable interest in mid-tropospheric
temperature observations made since 1979 from the Microwave
Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the TIROS-N satellites.  The MSU data
have a truly global coverage but there is only a short record (13
years) of measurements; the surface and the radiosonde data are
less spatially complete but have much longer records (over 130 and
near 30 years respectively).  Globally-averaged trends in MSU,
radiosonde and surface data sets between 1979 and 1991 differ
somewhat (0.06, 0.17, and 0.18 oC per decade, respectively),
although the differences are not statistically significant. 
Satellite sounders, radiosonde and surface instruments all have
different measurement characteristics; in addition, geographical
and temporal variations in mid-tropospheric and surface
temperatures are not expected to be identical.  Despite this,
correlations between global annual values of the three data sets
are quite high.

o  The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 is expected to
lead to transitory stratospheric warming.  With less certainty,
because of other natural influences, surface and troposheric
cooling may occur during the next few years.  Individual volcanic
eruptions, such as that of El Chichon (1982) or Mount Pinatubo,
should have negligible effect on the long-term trend.

o  Some influence of solar variations on time-scales associated
with several sunspot cycles remains unproven but is a possibility. 
The existence of strong correlations between characteristics of
the solar activity cycle and global mean temperatures has been
reported.  The only immediately plausible physical explanation of
these correlations involves variability of the sun's total
irradiance on time-scales longer than that of the 11-year activity
cycle.  Since precise measurements of the irradiance are only
available for the last decade, no firm conclusions regarding the
influence of solar variability on climate change can be drawn.
   

[4]  Modelling and Scenarios
o  The consistency between observations of global temperature
changes over the past century  and model simulations of the
warming due to greenhouse gases over the same period  is expected
to improve  if allowance is made for the increasing evidence of a
cooling effect due to sulphate aerosols and stratospheric ozone
depletion.  This has not yet been done.

o  There continues to be slow improvement in the ability of models
to simulate present climate, although further improvement in the
model resolution and the parametrization of physical processes are
needed.  Since the last report, further evidence has accumulated
that atmospheric models are capable of reproducing a range of
aspects of atmospheric variability.  Confidence in regional
climate patterns based directly on GCM (general circulation
models) output remains low and there is no consistent evidence
regarding changes in variability or storminess.  Given the present
incomplete knowledge of climate, the possibility of surprises
cannot be ruled out.

o  Transient (time-dependent) simulations with coupled ocean-
atmosphere models (CGCMs), in which neither aerosols nor ozone
changes have been included, suggest a rate of global warming that
is consistent, within the range of uncertainties, with the 0.3 oC
per decade warming rate quoted by IPCC (1990) for Scenario A
(Business-as-Usual) of greenhouse gas emissions.  The simulated
rate of change of sea level  _due to oceanic thermal expansion
only_ ranges from 2 to 4 cm per decade, again consistent to the
previous report.  CGCMs produce variability on decadal time-scales
similar in some respects to that observed.  Much further
development and validation of coupled models is required.

o  A set of updated scenarios have been developed for use in
modelling studies which describe a wide range of possible future
emissions in the absence of coordinated policy change to climate
change.

Some of their assumptions are :

      Scenario   Population   Economic Growth   Economic Growth
                  by 2100       1990-2025         1990-2100

      IS92a         11.3          2.9 %             2.3 %
      IS92b         11.3          2.9 %             2.3 %
      IS92c          6.4          2.0 %             1.2 %
      IS92d          6.4          2.7 %             2.0 %
      IS92e         11.3          3.5 %             3.0 %
      IS92f         17.6          2.9 %             2.3 %

In addition, each scenario includes assumptions on energy
supplies, emission controls, sources and sinks of greenhouse
gases, forest biomass and deforestation.  IS92e and IS92f result
in higher CO2 emissions than SA90  (Scenario A, Business as Usual,
from IPCC 1990). IS92a and IS92b result in slightly lower,  IS92d
and IS92c in much lower CO2 emissions than SA90.  The revised
scenarios for CFCs are much lower than in SA90.  Scenarios must be
used with great caution, scenario outputs are not predictions of
the future.  Population and economic growth, structural changes in
economies, technological advance, or developments such as those in
the republics of the former  Soviet Union are among the factors
which could exert major influence on future levels of CO2
emisssions.


[5]  Key Uncertainties and Further Work Required

Prediction of the timing, magnitude and regional patterns of
climate change is affected by uncertainties which continue to be
rooted in the inadequate understanding of :

o  Sources and sinks of greenhouse gases and aerosols (resulting
from sulphur emissions), including their indirect effects on
global warming.
o  Clouds  (their feedback effect on greenhouse gas-induced global
warming, also the effect of aerosols on clouds and their radiative
properties)  and other elements of the atmospheric water budget. 
o  Oceans, which through their thermal inertia and possible
changes in circulation, influence the timing and pattern of
climate change.
o  Polar ice sheets, whose response to climate change also affects
predictions of sea level rise.
o  Land surface processes and feedbacks, including hydrological
and ecological processes which couple regional and global
climates.

Reduction of these uncertainties requires, among others, improved
observations of climate-forcing variables and of the relevant
variables of the climate system, better understanding of
climate-related processes, more detailed knowledge of past climate
changes, and improved international exchange of climate data. 
Scenarios depend not only on factors which can be addressed by the
natural sciences but also on factors such as population and
economic growth and energy policy where there is much uncertainty
and which are the concern of the social sciences.  Natural and
social scientists need to cooperate closely in the development of
scenarios of future emissions.

<head><b><h1>Wind Plants of Denmark</h1></b></head><p>

<body>

The Scandinavian country of Denmark contains the largest concentration of 

wind turbines outside California and Germany. Nearly one percent of the nation's 5 million

inhabitants own a wind turbine or own a share in a wind turbine. Denmark's 

3,700 wind turbines generate more than 1 Terawatt-hour (1,000,000,000 kWh) electricity per year, about 3.5% of national consumption. In some provinces, such as that

on the west coast of Jutland, wind turbines now provide as much as 7% of the

region's electricity.<p>



Unlike California, where all the wind turbines are installed in massive <i>wind power plants</i>

75% of the wind power capacity in Denmark is installed in single units or in small clusters. Most of the wind turbines in Denmark are owned cooperatively.<p>

<title>Wind Plants of India</title>

<head><b><h1>Wind Plants of India</h1></b></head><p>

<body>



India is surpassed only by Germany as one of the world's 

fastest growing markets for wind energy. By the mid 1990s 

the subcontinent was installing more wind generating 

capacity than North America, Denmark, Britian, and the 

Netherlands.<p>

<h3>Vestas V15s, Okha, Gujarat</h3></center><p>



The ten machines near Okha in the province of Gujarat were 

some of the first wind turbines installed in India. These 

15-meter Vestas wind turbines overlook the Arabian Sea.<p>

Solitary mobile neutronstravelling at various speeds originate from fission reactions. Slow neutrons can in turn readily cause fission in atoms of someisotopes, e.g.  U-235, and fast neutrons can readily cause fissionin atoms of others, e.g.  Pu-239.  Sometimes atomic nuclei simplycapture neutrons.<P><B>Nuclear reactor:</B>  A device in which a nuclear fission chainreaction occurs under controlled conditions so that the heat yieldcan be harnessed or the neutron beams utilised.

The unit is strictly: KilogramSeparative Work Unit, and it measures the quantity of separative work(indicative of energy used in enrichment) when feed and product quantitiesare expressed in kilograms.<P>For instance, to produce one kilogram of uranium enriched to 3% U-235requires 3.8 SWU if the plant is operated at a tails assay 0.25%, or 5.0SWU if the tails assay is 0.15% (thereby requiring only 5.1 kg instead of6.0 kg of natural U feed).<P>About 100-120,000 SWU is required to enrich the annual fuel loading for atypical 1000 MWe light water reactor.  Enrichment costs are related toelectrical energy used.  The gaseous diffusion process consumes some 2400kWh per SWU, while gas centrifuge plants require only 100-200 kWh/SWU.<P><B>Sievert (Sv)</B>:  Unit indicating the biological damage causedby radiation.  One Joule of beta or gamma radiation absorbed perkilogram of tissue has 1 Sv of biological effect; 1 J/kg of alpharadiation has 20 Sv effect and 1 J/kg of neutrons has 10 Sv effect.<P><B>Stable: </B> Incapable of spontaneous radioactive decay.<P><B>Tailings: </B> Ground rock remaining after particular ore minerals(e.g.  uranium oxides) are extracted.<P><B>Tails:  </B>Depleted uranium (cf. enriched uranium), with about0.3% U-235.<P><B>Thermal reactor: </B>  A reactor in which the fission chainreaction is sustained primarily by slow neutrons (as distinctfrom Fast Neutron Reactor).<P><B>Transuranic element: </B>  A very heavy element formed artificiallyby neutron capture and subsequent beta decay(s).  Has a higheratomic number than uranium (92).  All are radioactive.  Neptunium,plutonium and americium are the best-known.<P><B>Uranium: </B> A mildly radioactive element with two isotopeswhich are fissile (U235 and U-233) and two which are fertile (U-238and U-234).

<P>
<U><B>IPCC Working Group I 1995 Summary for Policymakers</B></U>

<P>
Considerable progress has been made in the understanding of climate
change science since 1990 and new data and analyses have become
available.
<P>
<B>Greenhouse gas concentrations have continued to increase</B>

<P>
Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations since pre-industrial
times (i.e. since about 1750) have led to a positive <I>radiative
forcing of climate, tending to warm the surface and to produce
other changes of climate.</I> 
<P>
<I>&#176; The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases,
inter alia</I> carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous
oxide (N2O) have grown significantly: by about 30%, 145%, and
15%, respectively (values for 1992). These trends can be attributed
largely to human activities, mostly fossil fuel use, land-use
change and agriculture.
<P>
&#176; The growth rates of CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations were
low during the early 1990s. While this apparently natural variation
is not yet fully explained, recent data indicate that the growth
rates are currently comparable to those averaged over the 1980s.
<P>
&#176; The direct radiative forcing of the long-lived greenhouse
gases (2.45 Wm-2) is due primarily to increases in the concentrations
of CO2 (1.56 Wm-2), CH4 (0.47 Wm-2) and N2O (0.14 Wm-2) (values
for 1992).
<P>
&#176; Many greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for a long
time (for CO2 and N2O, many decades to centuries), hence they
affect radiative forcing on long time-scales.
<P>
&#176; The direct radiative forcing due to the CFCs and HCFCs
combined is 0.25 Wm-2. However, their <I>net </I>radiative forcing
is reduced by about 0.1 Wm-2 because they have caused stratospheric
ozone depletion which gives rise to a negative radiative forcing.
<P>
&#176; Growth in the concentration of CFCs, but not HCFCs, has
slowed to about zero. The concentrations of both CFCs and HCFCs,
and their consequent ozone depletion, are expected to decrease
substantially by 2050 through implementation of the Montreal Protocol
and its Adjustments and Amendments.
<P>
&#176; At present some long-lived greenhouse gases (particularly
HFCs (a CFC substitute), PFCs and SF6) contribute little to radiative
forcing but their projected growth could contribute several per
cent to radiative forcing during the 21st century.
<P>
&#176;If carbon dioxide emissions were maintained at near current
(1994) levels, they would lead to a nearly constant rate of increase
in atmospheric concentrations for at least two centuries, reaching
about 500 ppmv (approaching twice the pre-industrial concentration
of 280 ppmv) by the end of the 21st century.
<P>
&#176; A range of carbon cycle models indicates that stabilisation
of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 450, 650 or 1000 ppmv could
be achieved only if global anthropogenic CO2 emissions drop to
1990 levels by, respectively, approximately 40, 110 or 240 years
from now, and drop substantially below 1990 levels subsequently.
<P>
&#176; Any eventual stabilised concentration is governed more
by the accumulated anthropogenic CO2 emissions from now until
the time of stabilisation, than by the way those emissions change
over the period. This means that, for a given stabilised concentration
value, higher emissions in early decades require lower emissions
later on. Among the range of stabilisation cases studied, for
stabilisation at 450, 650 or 1000 ppmv accumulated anthropogenic
emissions over the period 1991 to 2100 are 630 GtC, 1030 GtC,
and 1410 GtC respectively (&#177; approximately 15% in each case).
For comparison the corresponding accumulated emissions for IPCC
IS92 emission scenarios range from 770 to 2190 GtC.
<P>
&#176; Stabilisation of CH4 and N2O concentrations at today's
levels would involve reductions in anthropogenic emissions of
8% and more than 50% respectively.
<P>
&#176; There is evidence that tropospheric ozone concentrations
in the Northern Hemisphere have increased since pre-industrial
times because of human activity and that this has resulted in
a positive radiative forcing. This forcing is not yet well characterised,
but it is estimated to be about 0.4 Wm-2 (15% of that from the
long-lived greenhouse gases). However the observations of the
most recent decade show that the upward trend has slowed significantly
or stopped.
<P>
<B>Anthropogenic aerosols tend to produce negative radiative forcings</B>

<P>
&#176; Tropospheric aerosols (microscopic airborne particles)
resulting from combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning and
other sources have led to a negative direct forcing of about 0.5
Wm-2, as a global average, and possibly also to a negative indirect
forcing of a similar magnitude. While the negative forcing is
focused in particular regions and subcontinental areas, it can
have continental to hemispheric scale effects on climate patterns.
<P>
&#176; Locally, the aerosol forcing can be large enough to more
than offset the positive forcing due to greenhouse gases.
<P>
&#176; In contrast to the long-lived greenhouse gases, anthropogenic
aerosols are very short-lived in the atmosphere, hence their radiative
forcing adjusts rapidly to increases or decreases in emissions.
<P>
<B>Climate has changed over the past century</B> 
<P>
At any one location year-to-year variations in weather can be
large, but analyses of meteorological and other data over large
areas and over periods of decades or more have provided evidence
for some important systematic changes.
<P>
&#176; Global mean surface air temperature has increased by between
about 0.3 and 0.6lC since the late 19th century ; the additional
data available since 1990 and the re-analyses since then have
not significantly changed this range of estimated increase.
<P>
&#176; Recent years have been among the warmest since 1860, i.e.,
in the period of instrumental record, despite the cooling effect
of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption.
<P>
&#176; Night-time temperatures over land have generally increased
more than daytime temperatures.
<P>
&#176; Regional changes are also evident. For example, the recent
warming has been greatest over the mid-latitude continents in
winter and spring, with a few areas of cooling, such as the North
Atlantic ocean. Precipitation has increased over land in high
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, especially during the cold
season.
<P>
&#176; Global sea level has risen by between 10 and 25 cm over
the past 100 years and much of the rise may be related to the
increase in global mean temperature.
<P>
&#176; There are inadequate data to determine whether consistent
global changes in climate variability or weather extremes have
occurred over the 20th Century. On regional scales there is clear
evidence of changes in some extremes and climate variability indicators
(e.g., fewer frosts in several widespread areas; an increase in
the proportion of rainfall from extreme events over the contiguous
states of the USA). Some of these changes have been toward greater
variability; some have been toward lower variability.
<P>
&#176; The 1990 to mid-1995 persistent warm-phase of the El Ni&ntilde;o
-Southern Oscillation (which causes droughts and floods in many
areas) was unusual in the context of the last 120 years.
<P>
<B>The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence
on global climate</B> 
<P>
Any human-induced effect on climate will be superimposed on the
background &quot;noise&quot; of natural climate variability, which
results both from internal fluctuations and from external causes
such as solar variability or volcanic eruptions. Detection and
attribution studies attempt to distinguish between anthropogenic
and natural influences. &quot;Detection of change&quot; is the
process of demonstrating that an observed change in climate is
highly unusual in a statistical sense, but does not provide a
reason for the change. &quot;Attribution&quot; is the process
of establishing cause and effect relations, including the testing
of competing hypotheses.
<P>
Since the 1990 IPCC Report, considerable progress has been made
in attempts to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic influences
on climate. This progress has been achieved by including effects
of sulphate aerosols in addition to greenhouse gases, thus leading
to more realistic estimates of human-induced radiative forcing.
These have then been used in climate models to provide more complete
simulations of the human-induced climate-change 'signal'. In addition,
new simulations with coupled atmosphere-ocean models have provided
important information about decade to century time-scale natural
internal climate variability. A further major area of progress
is the shift of focus from studies of global-mean changes to comparisons
of modelled and observed spatial and temporal patterns of climate
change.
<P>
The most important results related to the issues of detection
and attribution are:
<P>
&#176; The limited available evidence from proxy climate indicators
suggests that the 20th century global mean temperature is at least
as warm as any other century since at least 1400 AD. Data prior
to 1400 are too sparse to allow the reliable estimation of global
mean temperature.
<P>
&#176; Assessments of the statistical significance of the observed
global mean surface air temperature trend over the last century
have used a variety of new estimates of natural internal and externally-forced
variability. These are derived from instrumental data, palaeodata,
simple and complex climate models, and statistical models fitted
to observations. Most of these studies have detected a significant
change and show that the observed warming trend is unlikely to
be entirely natural in origin.
<P>
&#176; More convincing recent evidence for the attribution of
a human effect on climate is emerging from pattern-based studies,
in which the modelled climate response to combined forcing by
greenhouse gases and anthropogenic sulphate aerosols is compared
with observed geographical, seasonal and vertical patterns of
atmospheric temperature change. These studies show that such pattern
correspondences increase with time, as one would expect as an
anthropogenic signal increases in strength. Furthermore, the probability
is very low that these correspondences could occur by chance as
a result of natural internal variability only. The vertical patterns
of change are also inconsistent with those expected for solar
and volcanic forcing.
<P>
&#176; Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate
is currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging
from the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties
in key factors. These include the magnitude and patterns of long
term natural variability and the time-evolving pattern of forcing
by, and response to, changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases
and aerosols, and land surface changes. Nevertheless, the balance
of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence
on global climate.
<P>
<B>Climate is expected to continue to change in the future</B>

<P>
The IPCC has developed a range of scenarios, IS92a-f, of future
greenhouse gas and aerosol precursor emissions based on assumptions
concerning population and economic growth, land-use, technological
changes, energy availability and fuel mix during the period 1990
to 2100. Through understanding of the global carbon cycle and
of atmospheric chemistry, these emissions can be used to project
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols and
the perturbation of natural radiative forcing. Climate models
can then be used to develop projections of future climate.
<P>
&#176; The increasing realism of simulations of current and past
climate by coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models has increased
our confidence in their use for projection of future climate change.
Important uncertainties remain, but these have been taken into
account in the full range of projections of global mean temperature
and sea level change.
<P>
&#176; For the mid-range IPCC emission scenario, IS92a, assuming
the &quot;best estimate&quot; value of climate sensitivity and
including the effects of future increases in aerosol, models project
an increase in global mean surface air temperature relative to
1990 of about 2lC by 2100. This estimate is approximately one
third lower than the &quot;best estimate&quot; in 1990. This is
due primarily to lower emission scenarios (particularly for CO2
and the CFCs), the inclusion of the cooling effect of sulphate
aerosols, and improvements in the treatment of the carbon cycle.
Combining the lowest IPCC emission scenario (IS92c) with a &quot;low&quot;
value of climate sensitivity and including the effects of future
changes in aerosol concentrations leads to a projected increase
of about 1lC by 2100. The corresponding projection for the highest
IPCC scenario (IS92e) combined with a &quot;high&quot; value of
climate sensitivity gives a warming of about 3.5lC. In all cases
the average rate of warming would probably be greater than any
seen in the last 10,000 years, but the actual annual to decadal
changes would include considerable natural variability. Regional
temperature changes could differ substantially from the global
mean value. Because of the thermal inertia of the oceans, only
50-90% of the eventual equilibrium temperature change would have
been realised by 2100 and temperature would continue to increase
beyond 2100, even if concentrations of greenhouse gases were stabilised
by that time.
<P>
&#176; Average sea level is expected to rise as a result of thermal
expansion of the oceans and melting of glaciers and ice-sheets.
For the IS92a scenario, assuming the &quot;best estimate&quot;
values of climate sensitivity and of ice melts ensitivi ty to
warming, and including the effects of future changes in aerosol,
models project an increase in sea level of about 50 cm from the
present to 2100. This estimate is approximately 25% lower than
the &quot;best estimate&quot; in 1990 due to the lower temperature
projection, but also reflecting improvements in the climate and
ice melt models. Combining the lowest emission scenario (IS92c)
with the &quot;low&quot; climate and ice melt sensitivities and
including aerosol effects gives a projected sea level rise of
about 15 cm from the present to 2100. The corresponding projection
for the highest emission scenario (IS92e) combined with &quot;high&quot;
climate and ice-melt sensitivities gives a sea level rise of about
95 cm from the present to 2100. Sea level would continue to rise
at a similar rate in future centuries beyond 2100, even if concentrations
of greenhouse gases were stabilised by that time, and would continue
to do so even beyond the time of stabilisation of global mean
temperature. Regional sea level changes may differ from the global
mean value owing to land movement and ocean current changes.
<P>
&#176; Confidence is higher in the hemispheric-to-continental
scale projections of coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models than
in the regional projections, where confidence remains low. There
is more confidence in temperature projections than hydrological
changes.
<P>
&#176; All model simulations, whether they were forced with increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols or with increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases alone, show the following features:
greater surface warming of the land than of the sea in winter;
a maximum surface warming in high northern latitudes in winter,
little surface warming over the Arctic in summer; an enhanced
global mean hydrological cycle, and increased precipitation and
soil moisture in high latitudes in winter. All these changes are
associated with identifiable physical mechanisms.
<P>
&#176; In addition, most simulations show a reduction in the strength
of the north Atlantic thermohaline circulation and a widespread
reduction in diurnal range of temperature. These features too
can be explained in terms of identifiable physical mechanisms.
<P>
&#176; The direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic aerosols
have an important effect on the projections. Generally, the magnitudes
of the temperature and precipitation changes are smaller when
aerosol effects are represented, especially in northern mid-latitudes.
Note that the cooling effect of aerosols is not a simple offset
to the warming effect of greenhouse gases, but significantly affects
some of the continental scale patterns of climate change, most
noticeably in the summer hemisphere. For example, models that
consider only the effects of greenhouse gases generally project
an increase in precipitation and soil moisture in the Asian summer
monsoon region, whereas models that include , in addition, some
of the effects of aerosols suggest that monsoon precipitation
may decrease. The spatial and temporal distribution of aerosols
greatly influence regional projections, which are therefore more
uncertain.
<P>
&#176; A general warming is expected to lead to an increase in
the occurrence of extremely hot days and a decrease in the occurrence
of extremely cold days.
<P>
&#176; Warmer temperatures will lead to a more vigorous hydrological
cycle; this translates into prospects for more severe droughts
and/or floods in some places and less severe droughts and/or floods
in other places. Several models indicate an increase in precipitation
intensity, suggesting a possibility for more extreme rainfall
events. Knowledge is currently insufficient to say whether there
will be any changes in the occurrence or geographical distribution
of severe storms, e.g., tropical cyclones.
<P>
&#176; Sustained rapid climate change could shift the competitive
balance among species and even lead to forest dieback, altering
the terrestrial uptake and release of carbon. The magnitude is
uncertain, but could be between zero and 200 GtC over the next
one to two centuries, depending on the rate of climate change.
<P>
<B>There are still many uncertainties</B> 
<P>
Many factors currently limit our ability to project and detect
future climate change. In particular, to reduce uncertainties
further work is needed on the following priority topics:
<P>
&#176; estimation of future emissions and biogeochemical cycling
(including sources and sinks) of greenhouse gases, aerosols and
aerosol precursors and projections of future concentrations and
radiative properties.
<P>
&#176; representation of climate processes in models, especially
feedbacks associated with clouds, oceans, sea ice and vegetation,
in order to improve projections of rates and regional patterns
of climate change.
<P>
&#176; systematic collection of long-term instrumental and proxy
observations of climate system variables (e.g., solar output,
atmospheric energy balance components, hydrological cycles, ocean
characteristics and ecosystem changes) for the purposes of model
testing, assessment of temporal and regional variability and for
detection and attribution studies.
<P>
Future unexpected, large and rapid climate system changes (as
have occurred in the past) are, by their nature difficult to predict.
This implies that future climate changes may also involve &quot;surprises&quot;.
In particular these arise from the non-linear nature of the climate
system. When rapidly forced, non-linear systems are especially
subject to unexpected behaviour. Progress can be made by investigating
non-linear processes and sub-components of the climatic system.
Examples of such non-linear behaviour include rapid circulation
changes in the North Atlantic and feedbacks associated with terrestrial
ecosystem changes.

<B>SUMMARY FOR POLICYMAKERS</B> 
<P>
<B>SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT, WORKING GROUP III</B> 
<P>
<B>1. INTRODUCTION</B> 
<P>
Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) was restructured in November 1992 and charged with conducting
&quot;technical assessments of the socioeconomics of impacts,
adaptation, and mitigation of climate change over both the short
and long term and at the regional and global levels.&quot; Working
Group III responded to this charge by further stipulating in its
work plan that it would place the socioeconomic perspectives in
the context of sustainable development and, in accordance with
the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), provide comprehensive
treatment of both mitigation and adaptation options while covering
all economic sectors and all relevant sources of greenhouse gases
and sinks.
<P>
This report assesses a large part of the existing literature on
the socioeconomics of climate change and identifies areas in which
a consensus has emerged on key issues and areas where differences
exist. The chapters have been arranged so that they cover several
key issues. First, frameworks for socioeconomic assessment of
costs and benefits of action and inaction are described. Particular
attention is given to the applicability of cost-benefit analysis,
the incorporation of equity and social considerations, and consideration
of intergenerational equity issues. Second, the economic and social
benefits of limiting greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing sinks
are reviewed. Third, the economic, social, and environmental costs
of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions are assessed. Next, generic
mitigation and adaptation response options are reviewed, methods
for assessing the costs and effectiveness of different response
options are summarized, and integrated assessment techniques are
discussed. Finally, the report provides an economic assessment
of policy instruments to combat climate change.
<P>
In accordance with the approved work plan, this assessment of
the socioeconomic literature related to climate change focuses
on economic studies; material from other social sciences is found
mostly in the chapter on equity and social considerations. The
report is an assessment of the state of knowledge - what we know
and do not know - and not a prescription for policy implementation.
Countries can use the information in this report to help take
decisions they believe are most appropriate for their specific
circumstances.
<P>
<B>2. SCOPE OF THE ASSESSMENT</B> 
<P>
Climate change presents the decision maker with a set of formidable
complications: a considerable number of remaining uncertainties
(which are inherent in the complexity of the problem), the potential
for irreversible damages or costs, a very long planning horizon,
long time lags between emissions and effects, wide regional variation
in causes and effects, the irreducibly global scope of the problem,
and the need to consider multiple greenhouse gases and aerosols.
Yet another complication arises from the fact that effective protection
of the climate system requires global cooperation.
<P>
Still, a number of insights that may be useful to policymakers
can be drawn from the literature:
<P>
&#183; Analyses indicate that a prudent way to deal with climate
change is through a portfolio of actions aimed at mitigation,
adaptation, and improvement of knowledge. The appropriate portfolio
will differ for each country. The challenge is not to find the
best policy today for the next 100 years, but to select a prudent
strategy and to adjust it over time in the light of new information.
<P>
&#183; Earlier mitigation action may increase flexibility in moving
toward stabilization of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases (U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, Article 2).
The choice of abatement paths involves balancing the economic
risks of rapid abatement now (that premature capital stock retirement
will later be proved unnecessary) against the corresponding risk
of delay (that more rapid reduction will then be required, necessitating
premature retirement of future capital stock).
<P>
&#183; The literature indicates that significant &quot;no-regrets&quot;
opportunities are available in most countries and that the risk
of aggregate net damage due to climate change, considerations
of risk aversion, and application of the precautionary principle
provide rationales for action beyond no regrets.
<P>
&#183; The value of better information about climate change processes
and impacts and society's responses to them is likely to be great.
In particular, the literature accords high value to information
about climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases and aerosols, climate
change damage functions, and variables such as determinants of
economic growth and rates of energy efficiency improvements. Better
information about the costs and benefits of mitigation and adaptation
measures and how they might change in coming decades also has
a high value.
<P>
&#183; Analysis of economic and social issues related to climate
change, especially in developing countries where little work of
this nature has been carried out, is a high priority for research.
More generally, research is needed on integrated assessment and
analysis of decision making related to climate change. Further,
research advancing the economic understanding of nonlinearities
and new theories of economic growth is also needed. Research and
development related to energy efficiency technologies and nonfossil
energy options also offer high potential value. In addition, there
is also a need for research on the development of sustainable
consumption patterns.
<P>
A portfolio of possible actions that policymakers could consider,
in accordance with applicable international agreements, to implement
low-cost and/or cost-effective measures to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change can include:
<P>
&#183; implementing energy efficiency measures, including the
removal of institutional barriers to energy efficiency improvements;
<P>
&#183; phasing out existing distortionary policies and practices
that increase greenhouse gas emissions, such as some subsidies
and regulations, non-internalization of environmental costs, and
distortions in transport pricing;
<P>
&#183; implementing cost-effective fuel switching measures from
more to less carbon-intensive fuels and to carbon-free fuels such
as renewables;
<P>
&#183; implementing measures to enhance sinks or reservoirs of
greenhouse gases, such as improving forest management and land
use practices;
<P>
&#183; implementing measures and developing new techniques for
reducing methane, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gas emissions;
<P>
&#183; encouraging forms of international cooperation to limit
greenhouse gas emissions, such as implementing coordinated carbon/energy
taxes, activities implemented jointly, and tradable quotas;
<P>
&#183; promoting the development and implementation of national
and international energy efficiency standards;
<P>
&#183; promoting voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
<P>
&#183; promoting education and training, implementing information
and advisory measures for sustainable development and consumption
patterns that will facilitate climate change mitigation and adaptation;
<P>
&#183; planning and implementing measures to adapt to the consequences
of climate change;
<P>
&#183; undertaking research aimed at better understanding of the
causes and impacts of climate change and facilitating more effective
adaptation to it;
<P>
&#183; conducting technological research aimed at minimizing emissions
of greenhouse gases from continued use of fossil fuels and developing
commercial nonfossil energy sources;
<P>
&#183; developing improved institutional mechanisms, such as improved
insurance arrangements, to share the risks of damages due to climate
change.
<P>
<U>Contribution of Economics</U> 
<P>
&#183; Estimates of the costs and benefits of stabilizing greenhouse
gas <I>concentrations</I> are sensitive, <I>inter alia</I>, to
the ultimate target concentration, the emission path toward this
level, the discount rate, and assumptions concerning the costs
and availability of technologies and practices.
<P>
&#183; Despite its widespread use in economic policy evaluation,
Gross Domestic Product is widely recognized to be an imperfect
measure of society's well-being, largely because it fails to account
for degradation of the environment and natural systems. Other
methodologies exist that try to take these nonmarket values and
social and ecological sustainability into account. Such methodologies
would provide a more complete indication of how climate change
might affect society's well-being.
<P>
&#183; Given the interrelated nature of the global economic system,
attempts to mitigate climate change through actions in one region
or sector may have offsetting economic effects that risk increasing
the emissions of other regions and sectors (so-called leakages).
These emission leakages can be lessened through coordinated actions
of groups of countries.
<P>
&#183; The literature suggests that flexible, cost-effective policies
relying on economic incentives and instruments, as well as coordinated
instruments, can considerably reduce mitigation or adaptation
costs or increase the cost-effectiveness of emission reduction
measures.
<P>
<U>Equity Considerations</U> 
<P>
In considering equity principles and issues related to greenhouse
gas emissions, it is important for policy consideration to take
into account in particular Articles 3, 4.2a, and 11.2 of the Framework
Convention on Climate Change, Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration,
and general principles of international law.
<P>
Scientific analyses cannot prescribe how equity should be applied
in implementing the Framework Convention on Climate Change, but
analysis can clarify the implications of alternative choices and
their ethical basis.
<P>
&#183; Developing countries require support for institutional
and endogenous capacity building, so that they may effectively
participate in climate change decision making.
<P>
&#183; It is important that both efficiency and equity concerns
be considered during the analysis of mitigation and adaptation
measures. For the purposes of analysis, it is possible to separate
efficiency from equity. This analytical separation presupposes
that (and is valid, for policy purposes, only if) effective institutions
exist or can be created for appropriate redistribution of climate
change costs. It may be worthwhile to conduct analyses of the
equity implications of particular measures for achieving efficiency,
including their social considerations and impacts.
<P>
<B>3. DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORKS FOR ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE</B>

<P>
Since climate change is a global issue, comprehensive analyses
of mitigation, adaptation, and research measures are needed to
identify the most efficient and appropriate strategy to address
climate change. International decision making related to climate
change, as established by the FCCC, is a collective process in
which a variety of concerns, such as equity, ecological protection,
economics, ethics, and poverty-related issues, are of special
significance for present and future generations. Treatments of
decision making under uncertainty, risk aversion, technology development
and diffusion processes, and distributional considerations are
at present relatively poorly developed in international environmental
economics, and especially in the climate change literature.
<P>
Decision making related to climate change must take into account
the <I>unique</I> characteristics of the &quot;problem&quot;:
large uncertainties (scientific and economic), possible nonlinearities
and irreversibilities, asymmetric distribution of impacts geographically
and temporally, the very long time horizon, and the global nature
of climate change with the associated potential for free riding.
Beyond scientific uncertainties (discussed in Volume 1)) and impact
uncertainties (Volume 2), <I>socioeconomic uncertainties</I> relate
to estimates of how these changes will affect human society (including
direct economic and broader welfare impacts) and to the socioeconomic
implications of emission abatement.
<P>
The other dimension that magnifies uncertainties and complicates
decision making is <I>geographical</I>: climate change is a global
problem encompassing an incredibly diverse mix of human societies,
with differing histories, circumstances, and capabilities. Many
developing countries are in relatively hot climates, depend more
heavily on agriculture, and have less well developed infrastructure
and social structures; thus, they may suffer more than average,
perhaps much more. In developed countries, there may also be large
climate change impacts.
<P>
The literature also emphasizes that delaying responses is itself
a decision involving costs. Some studies suggest that the cost
of delay is small; others emphasize that the costs could include
imposition of risks on all parties (particularly the most vulnerable),
greater utilization of limited atmospheric capacity, and potential
deferral of desirable technical development. No consensus is reflected
in the literature.
<P>
The global nature of the problem - necessitating collective action
by sovereign states - and the large differences in the circumstances
of different parties raise consequential as well as procedural
issues. Consequential issues relate to outcomes while procedural
issues relate to how decisions are made. In relation to climate
change, the existence of an agreed legal framework involves a
collective process within a negotiated framework (the FCCC). Accordingly
decision making can be considered within three different categories
of frameworks, each with different implications and with distinct
foci: global optimization (trying to find the globally optimal
result), procedural decision making (establishing and refining
rules of procedure), and collective decision making (dealing with
distributional issues and processes involving the interaction
of numerous independent decision makers).
<P>
Application of the literature on decision making to climate change
provides elements that can be used in building collective and/or
market-oriented strategies for sharing risks and realizing mutual
benefits. It suggests that actions be sequential (temporally distributed),
that countries implement a portfolio of mitigation, adaptation,
and research measures, and that they adjust this portfolio continuously
in response to new knowledge. The potential for transfers of financial
resources and technology to developing countries may be considered
as a part of any comprehensive analytical framework.
<P>
Elements of a market-related strategy concern <I>insurance and
markets for risk</I>. Pooling risk does not change the risk, but
it can improve economic efficiency and welfare. Although insurance
capable of sharing climate change risks on a global basis currently
does not exist, one of the important potential gains from cooperating
in a collective framework, such as the Framework Convention on
Climate Change, is that of risk sharing. Creating an insurance
system to cover the risks of climate change is difficult, and
the international community has not yet established such sophisticated
instruments. This, however, does not preclude future international
action to establish insurance markets sufficient for some international
needs.
<P>
<B>4. EQUITY AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</B> 
<P>
Equity considerations are an important aspect of climate change
policy and of the Convention. In common language equity means
&quot;the quality of being impartial&quot; or &quot;something
that is fair and just.&quot; The FCCC, including the references
to equity and equitable in Articles 3.1, 4.2.a, and 11.2, provides
the context for efforts to apply equity in meeting the purposes
and the objective of the Convention. International law, including
relevant decisions of the International Court of Justice, may
also provide guidance.
<P>
A variety of ethical principles, including the importance of meeting
people's basic needs, may be relevant to addressing climate change,
but the application to relations among states of principles originally
developed to guide individual behaviour is complex and not straightforward.
Climate change policies should not aggravate existing disparities
between one region and another nor attempt to redress all equity
issues.
<P>
Equity involves procedural as well as consequential issues. Procedural
issues relate to how decisions are made while consequential issues
relate to outcomes. To be effective and to promote cooperation,
agreements must be regarded as legitimate, and equity is an important
element in gaining legitimacy.
<P>
Procedural equity encompasses process and participation issues.
It requires that all parties be able to participate effectively
in international negotiations related to climate change. Appropriate
measures to enable developing country parties to participate effectively
in negotiations increase the prospects for achieving effective,
lasting, and equitable agreements on how best to address the threat
of climate change. Concern about equity and social impacts points
to the need to build endogenous capabilities and strengthen institutional
capacities, particularly in developing countries, to make and
implement collective decisions in a legitimate and equitable manner.
<P>
Consequential equity has two components: the distribution of the
costs of damages or adaptation and of measures to mitigate climate
change. Because countries differ substantially in vulnerability,
wealth, capacity, resource endowments, and other factors listed
below, the costs of the damages, adaptation, and mitigation may
be borne inequitably, unless the distribution of these costs is
addressed explicitly.
<P>
Climate change is likely to impose costs on future generations
and on regions where damages occur, including regions with low
greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change impacts will be distributed
unevenly.
<P>
The Convention recognizes in Article 3.1 the principle of common
but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.
Actions beyond &quot;no-regrets&quot; measures impose costs on
the present generation. Mitigation policies unavoidably raise
issues about how to share the costs. The initial emission limitation
intentions of Annex I parties represent an agreed collective first
step of those parties in addressing climate change.
<P>
Equity arguments can support a variety of proposals to distribute
mitigation costs. Most of them seem to cluster around two main
approaches: equal per capita emission allocations and allocations
based on incremental departures from national baseline emissions
(current or projected). Some proposals combine these approaches
in an effort to incorporate equity concerns not addressed by relying
exclusively on one or the other approach. The IPCC can clarify
scientifically the implications of different approaches and proposals,
but the choice of particular proposals is a policy judgment.
<P>
There are substantial variations both among developed and developing
countries that are relevant to the application of equity principles
to mitigation. These include variations in historical and cumulative
emissions, current total and per capita emissions, emission intensities
and economic output, and factors such as wealth, energy structures,
and resource endowments. The literature is weak on the equity
implications of these variations both among developed and developing
countries.
<P>
In addition, the implications of climate change for developing
countries are different from those for developed countries. The
former often have different urgent priorities, weaker institutions,
and are generally more vulnerable to climate change. However,
it is likely that developing countries' share of emissions will
grow further to meet their social and developmental needs. Greenhouse
gas emissions are likely to become increasingly global, even whilst
substantial per capita disparities are likely to remain.
<P>
It is important that both efficiency and equity concerns should
be considered during the analysis of mitigation and adaptation
measures. It may be worthwhile to conduct analyses of the equity
implications of particular measures for achieving efficiency,
including their social considerations and impacts.
<P>
<B>5. INTERTEMPORAL EQUITY AND DISCOUNTING</B> 
<P>
Climate policy, like many other policy issues, raises particular
questions of equity among generations, because future generations
are not able to influence directly the policies being chosen today
that could affect their wellbeing and because it might not be
possible to compensate future generations for consequent reductions
in their well-being.
<P>
Sustainable development is one approach to intergenerational equity.
Sustainable development meets &quot;the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs.&quot; A consensus exists among economists that this does
not imply that future generations should inherit a world with
at least as much of every resource. Nevertheless, sustainable
development would require that use of exhaustible natural resources
and environmental degradation are appropriately offset - for example,
by an increase in productive assets sufficient to enable future
generations to obtain at least the same standard of living as
those alive today. There are different views in the literature
on the extent to which infrastructure and knowledge, on the one
hand, and natural resources, such as a healthy environment, on
the other hand, are substitutes. This is crucial to applying these
concepts. Some analysts stress that there are exhaustible resources
that are unique and cannot be substituted for. Others believe
that current generations can compensate future generations for
decreases in the quality or quantity of environmental resources
by increases in other resources.
<P>
Discounting is the principal analytical tool economists use to
compare economic effects that occur at different points in time.
The choice of discount rate is of crucial technical importance
for analyses of climate change policy, because the time horizon
is extremely long, and mitigation costs tend to come much earlier
than the benefits of avoided damages. The higher the discount
rate, the less future benefits and the more current costs matter
in the analysis.
<P>
Selection of a social discount rate is also a question of values
since it inherently relates the costs of present measures, to
possible damages suffered by future generations if no action is
taken. How best to choose a discount rate is, and will likely
remain, an unresolved question in economics. Partly as a consequence,
different discount rates are used in different countries. Analysts
typically conduct sensitivity studies using various discount rates.
It should also be recognized that the social discount rate presupposes
that all effects are transformed to their equivalent in consumption.
This makes it difficult to apply to those nonmarket impacts of
climate change which for ethical reasons might not be, or for
practical reasons cannot be, converted into consumption units.
<P>
The literature on the appropriate social discount rate for climate
change analysis can be grouped into two broad categories. One
approach discounts consumption by different generations using
the &quot;social rate of time preference,&quot; which is the sum
of the rate of &quot;pure time preference&quot; (impatience) and
the rate of increase of welfare derived from higher per capita
incomes in the future. Depending upon the values taken for the
different parameters, the discount rate tends to fall between
0.5% and 3.0% per year on a global basis - using this approach.
However, wide variations in regional discount rates exist, but
these may still be consistent with a particular global average.
<P>
The second approach to the discount rate considers market returns
to investment, which range between 3% and 6% in real terms for
long-term, risk-free public investments. Conceptually, funds could
be invested in projects that earn such returns, with the proceeds
being used to increase the consumption for future generations.
<P>
The choice of the social discount rate for public investment projects
is a matter of policy preference but has a major impact on the
economic evaluation of climate change actions. For example, in
today's dollars, $1,000 of damage 100 years from now would be
valued at $370 using a 1% discount rate (near the low end of the
range for the first approach) but would be valued at $7.60 using
a 5% discount rate (near the upper end of the range for the second
approach). However, in cost-effectiveness analyses of policies
over short time horizons, the impact of using different discount
rates is much smaller. In all areas analysts should specify the
discount rate(s) they use to facilitate comparison and aggregation
of results.
<P>
<B>6. APPLICABILITY OF COST AND BENEFIT ASSESSMENTS</B> 
<P>
Many factors need to be taken into account in the evaluation of
projects and public policy issues related to climate change, including
the analysis of possible costs and benefits. Although costs and
benefits cannot all be measured in monetary terms, various techniques
exist which offer a useful framework for organizing information
about the consequences of alternative actions for addressing climate
change.
<P>
The family of analytical techniques for examining economic environmental
policies and decisions includes traditional project level cost-benefit
analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multicriteria analysis,
and decision analysis. Traditional cost-benefit analysis attempts
to compare all costs and benefits expressed in terms of a common
monetary unit. Cost-effectiveness analysis seeks to find the lowest-cost
option to achieve an objective specified using other criteria.
Multicriteria analysis is designed to deal with problems where
some benefits and/or costs are measured in nonmonetary units.
Decision analysis focuses specifically on making decisions under
uncertainty.
<P>
In principle, this group of techniques can contribute to improving
public policy decisions concerning the desirable extent of actions
to mitigate global climate change, the timing of such actions,
and the methods to be employed.
<P>
Traditional cost-benefit analysis is based on the concept that
the level of emission control at each point in time is determined
such that marginal costs equal marginal benefits. However, both
costs and benefits may be hard, sometimes impossible, to assess.
This may be due to large uncertainties, possible catastrophes
with very small probabilities, or simply because there is no available
consistent methodology for monetizing the effects. In some of
these cases, it may be possible to apply multicriteria analysis.
This provides policy makers with a broader set of information,
including evaluation of relevant costs and benefits, estimated
within a common framework.
<P>
Practical application of traditional cost-benefit analysis to
the problem of climate change is therefore difficult because of
the global, regional, and intergenerational nature of the problem.
Estimates of the costs of mitigation options also vary widely.
Furthermore, estimates of potential physical damages due to climate
change also vary widely. In addition, confidence in monetary estimates
for important consequences (especially nonmarket consequences)
is low. These uncertainties, and the resolution of uncertainty
over time may be decisive for the choice of strategies to combat
climate change. The objective of decision analysis is to deal
with such problems. Furthermore, for some categories of ecological,
cultural, and human health impacts, widely accepted economic concepts
of value are not available. To the extent that some impacts and
measures cannot be valued in monetary terms, economists augment
the traditional cost-benefit analysis approach with such techniques
as multicriteria analysis, permitting some quantitative expression
of the trade-offs to be made. These techniques do not resolve
questions involving equity - for example, determining who should
bear the costs. However, they provide important information on
the incidence of damage, mitigation, and adaptation costs and
on where cost-effective action might be taken.
<P>
Despite their many imperfections, these techniques provide a valuable
framework for identifying essential questions that policymakers
must face when dealing with climate change, namely:
<P>
&#183; By how much should emissions of greenhouse gases be reduced?
<P>
&#183; When should emissions be reduced?
<P>
&#183; How should emissions be reduced?
<P>
These analytical techniques assist decision makers in comparing
the consequences of alternative actions, including that of no
action, on a quantitative basis - and can certainly make a contribution
to resolution of these questions.
<P>
<B>7. THE SOCIAL COSTS OF ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE: DAMAGES
OF INCREASED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS</B> 
<P>
The literature on the subject in this section is controversial
and mainly based on research done on developed countries, often
extrapolated to developing countries. There is no consensus about
how to value statistical lives or how to aggregate statistical
lives across countries. Monetary valuation should not obscure
the human consequences of anthropogenic climate change damages,
because the value of life has meaning beyond monetary valuation.
It should be noted that the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 call
for human beings to remain at the centre of sustainable development.
The approach taken to this valuation might affect the scale of
damage reduction strategies. It may be noted that in virtually
all of the literature discussed in this section the developing
country statistical lives have not been equally valued at the
developed country value, nor are other damages in developing countries
equally valued at the developed country value. Because national
circumstances, including opportunity costs, differ, economists
sometimes evaluate certain kinds of impacts differently amongst
countries.
<P>
The benefits of limiting greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing
sinks are (a) the climate change damages avoided and (b) the secondary
benefits associated with the relevant policies. Secondary benefits
include reductions in other pollutants jointly produced with greenhouse
gases and the conservation of biological diversity. Net climate
change damages include both market and nonmarket impacts as far
as they can be quantified at present and, in some cases, adaptation
costs. Damages are expressed in net terms to account for the fact
that there are some beneficial impacts of global warming as well,
which are, however, dominated by the damage costs. Nonmarket impacts,
such as human health, risk of human mortality, and damage to ecosystems,
form an important component of available estimates of the social
costs of climate change. The literature on monetary valuation
of such nonmarket effects reflects a number of divergent views
and approaches. The estimates of nonmarket damages, however, are
highly speculative and not comprehensive.
<P>
Nonmarket damage estimates are a source of major uncertainty in
assessing the implications of global climate change for human
welfare. While some regard monetary valuation of such impacts
as essential to sound decision making, others reject monetary
valuation of some impacts, such as risk of human mortality, on
ethical grounds. Additionally, there is a danger that entire unique
cultures may be obliterated. This is not something that can be
considered in monetary terms, but becomes a question of loss of
human diversity, for which we have no indicators to measure economic
value.
<P>
The assessed literature contains only a few estimates of the monetized
damages associated with doubled CO2 equivalent concentration scenarios.
These estimates are aggregated to a global scale and illustrate
the potential impacts of climate change under selected scenarios.
Aggregating individual monetized damages to obtain total social
welfare impacts implies difficult decisions about equity amongst
countries. Global estimates are based upon an aggregation of monetary
damages across countries (damages which are themselves implicit
aggregations across individuals) that reflects intercountry differences
in wealth and income - this fundamentally influences the monetary
valuation of damages. Taking income differences as given implies
that an equivalent impact in two countries (such as an equal increase
in human mortality) would receive very different weights in the
calculations of global damages.
<P>
To enable choices between different ways of promoting human welfare
to be made on a consistent basis, economists have for many years
sought to express a wide range of human and environmental impacts
in terms of monetary equivalents, using various techniques. The
most commonly used of those techniques is an approach based on
the observed willingness to pay for various nonmarket benefits.
This is the approach that has been taken in most of the assessed
literature.
<P>
Human life is an element outside the market, and societies may
want to preserve it in an equal way. An approach that includes
equal valuation of impacts on human life wherever they occur may
yield different global aggregate estimates than those reported
below. For example, equalizing the value of a statistical life
at a global average could leave total global damage unchanged
but would increase markedly the share of these damages borne by
the developing world. Equalizing the value at the level typical
in developed countries would increase monetized damages several
times, and would further increase the share of the developing
countries in the total damage estimate.
<P>
Other aggregation methods can be used to adjust for differences
in the wealth or incomes of countries in calculations of monetary
damages. Because estimates of monetary damage tend to be a higher
percentage of national GDP for low-income countries than for high-income
countries, aggregation schemes that adjust for wealth or income
effects are expected to yield higher estimates of global damages
than those presented in this report.
<P>
The assessed literature quantifying total damages from 2-3&#176;C
warming provides a wide range of point estimates for damages,
given the presumed change in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.
The aggregate estimates tend to be a few percent of world GDP,
with, in general, considerably higher estimates of damage to developing
countries as a share of their GDP. The aggregate estimates are
subject to considerable uncertainty, but the range of uncertainty
cannot be gauged from the literature. The range of estimates cannot
be interpreted as a confidence interval, given the widely differing
assumptions and methodologies in the studies. As noted above,
aggregation is likely to mask even greater uncertainties about
damage components.
<P>
Regional or sectoral approaches to estimating the consequences
of climate change include a much wider range of estimates of the
net economic effects. For some areas, damages are estimated to
be significantly greater and could negatively affect economic
development. For others, climate change is estimated to increase
economic production and present opportunities for economic development.
For countries generally having a diversified, industrial economy
and an educated and flexible labour force, the limited set of
published estimates of damages are of the order one to a few percent
of GDP. For countries generally having a specialized and natural
resource-based economy (e.g., heavily emphasizing agriculture
or forestry), and a poorly developed and land-tied labour force,
estimates of damages from the few studies available are several
times larger. Small islands and low-lying coastal areas are particularly
vulnerable. Damages from possible large-scale catastrophes, such
as major changes in ocean circulation, are not reflected in these
estimates. There is little agreement across studies about the
exact magnitude of each category of damages or relative ranking
of the damage categories. Climate changes of this magnitude are
not expected to be realized for several decades, and damages in
the interim could be smaller. Damages over a longer period of
time might be greater.
<P>
IPCC does not endorse any particular range of values for the marginal
damage of CO2 emissions, but published estimates range between
$5 and $125 (1990 U.S.) per tonne of carbon emitted now. This
range of estimates does not represent the full range of uncertainty.
The estimates are also based on models that remain simplistic
and are limited representations of the actual climate processes
in being and are based on earlier IPCC scientific reports. The
wide range of damage estimates reflects variations in model scenarios,
discount rates, and other assumptions. It must be emphasized that
the social cost estimates have a wide range of uncertainty because
of limited knowledge of impacts, uncertain future technological
and socioeconomic developments, and the possibility of catastrophic
events or surprises.
<P>
<B>8. GENERIC ASSESSMENT OF RESPONSE STRATEGIES</B> 
<P>
A wide range of technologies and practices is available for mitigating
emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other
greenhouse gases. There are also many adaptation measures available
for responding to the impacts of climate change. All these technologies,
practices, and measures have financial and environmental costs
as well as benefits. This section surveys the range of options
currently available or discussed in the literature. The optimal
mix of response options will vary by country and over time as
local conditions and costs change.
<P>
A review of <B>CO2</B> mitigation options suggests that:
<P>
&#183; A large potential for cost-effective <B>energy conservation
and efficiency improvements </B>in energy supply and energy use
exists in many sectors. These options offer economic and environmental
benefits in addition to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
Various of these options can be deployed rapidly due to small
unit size, modular design characteristics, and low lifetime costs.
<P>
The options for <B>CO2</B> <B>mitigation in energy use</B> include
alternative methods and efficiency improvements, among others
in the construction, residential, commercial, agriculture, and
industry sectors. Not all cost-effective strategies are based
on new technology; some may rely on improved information dissemination
and public education, managerial strategies, pricing policies,
and institutional reforms.
<P>
&#183; Estimates of the technical potential for <B>switching to
less carbon-intensive fuels</B> vary regionally and with the type
of measure and the economic availability of reserves of fossil
and alternative fuels. These estimates also have to take account
of potential methane emissions from leakage of natural gas during
production and distribution.
<P>
&#183;<B> Renewable energy technologies</B> (e.g., solar, hydroelectric,
wind, traditional and modern biomass, and ocean thermal energy
conversion) have achieved different levels of technical development,
economic maturity, and commercial readiness. The potential of
these energy sources is not fully realized. Cost estimates for
these technologies are sensitive to site-specific characteristics,
resource variability, and the form of final energy delivered.
These cost estimates vary widely.
<P>
&#183;<B> Nuclear energy</B> is a technology that has been deployed
for several decades in many countries. However, a number of factors
have slowed the expansion of nuclear power, including: (a) wary
public perceptions resulting from nuclear accidents, (b) not yet
fully resolved issues concerning reactor safety, proliferation
of fissile material, power plant decommissioning, and long-term
disposal of nuclear waste, as well as, in some instances, lower-than-anticipated
levels of demand for electricity. Regulatory and siting difficulties
have increased construction lead times, leading to higher capital
costs for this option in some countries. If these issues, including
<I>inter alia</I> the social, political, and environmental aspects
mentioned above, can be resolved, nuclear energy has the potential
to increase its present share in worldwide energy production.
<P>
&#183;<B> CO2 capture and disposal</B> may be ultimately limited
for technical and environmental reasons, because not all forms
of disposal ensure prevention of carbon reentering the atmosphere.
<P>
&#183;<B> Forestry </B>options, in some circumstances, offer large
potential, modest costs, low risk, and other benefits. Further,
the potential modern use of biomass as a source of fuels and electricity
could become attractive. Halting or slowing deforestation and
increasing reforestation through increased silvicultural productivity
and sustainable management programmes that increase agricultural
productivity, the expansion of forest reserves, and promotion
of ecotourism are among the cost-effective options for slowing
the atmospheric build-up of CO2. Forestry programmes raise important
equity considerations.
<P>
There is also a wide range of available technologies and practices
for reducing emissions of <B>methane </B>from such sources as
natural gas systems, coal mines, waste dumps, and farms. However,
the issue of reduction of emissions related to food supply may
imply trade-offs with rates of food production. These trade-offs
must be carefully assessed, as they may affect the provision of
basic needs in some countries, particularly in developing countries.
<P>
Most <B>nitrous oxide</B> emissions come from diffuse sources
related to agriculture and forestry. These emissions are difficult
to reduce rapidly. Industrial emissions of <B>nitrous oxide and
halogenated compounds</B> tend to be concentrated in a few key
sectors and tend to be easier to control. Measures to limit such
emissions may be attractive for many countries.
<P>
The slow implementation of many of the technologically attractive
and cost-effective options listed above has many possible explanations,
with both actual and perceived costs being a major factor. Among
other factors, capital availability, information gaps, institutional
obstacles, and market imperfections affect the rate of diffusion
for these technologies. Identifying the reasons specific to a
particular country is a precondition to devising sound and efficient
policies to encourage their broader adoption.
<P>
Education and training as well as information and advisory measures
are important aspects of various response options.
<P>
Many of the emission-reducing technologies and practices described
above also provide other benefits to society. These additional
benefits include improved air quality, better protection of surface
and underground waters, enhanced animal productivity, reduced
risk of explosions and fire, and improved use of energy resources.
<P>
Many options are also available for <B>adapting </B>to the impacts
of climate change and thus reducing the damages to national economies
and natural ecosystems. Adaptive options are available in many
sectors, ranging from agriculture and energy to health, coastal
zone management, offshore fisheries, and recreation. Some of these
provide enhanced ability to cope with the current impacts of climate
variability. However, possible trade-offs between implementation
of mitigation and adaptation measures are important to consider
in future research. A summary of sectoral options for adaptation
is presented in Volume 2.
<P>
The optimal response strategy for each country will depend on
the special circumstances and conditions which that country must
face. Nonetheless, many recent studies and empirical observations
suggest that some of the most cost-effective options can be most
successfully implemented on a joint or cooperative basis among
nations.
<P>
<B>9. COSTS OF RESPONSE OPTIONS</B> 
<P>
It must be emphasized that the text in this section is an assessment
of the technical literature and does not make recommendations
on policy matters. The available literature is primarily from
developed countries.
<P>
<U>Cost Concepts</U> 
<P>
From the perspective of this section on assessing mitigation or
adaptation costs, what matters is the net cost (total cost less
secondary benefits and costs). These net costs exclude the social
costs of climate change, which are discussed in Section 7. The
assessed literature yields a very wide range of estimates of the
costs of response options. The wide range largely reflects significant
differences in assumptions about the efficiency of energy and
other markets, and about the ability of government institutions
to address perceived market failures or imperfections.
<P>
Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may yield additional
economic impacts (for example, through technological externalities
associated with fostering research and development programmes)
and/or environmental impacts (such as reduced emissions of acid
rain and urban smog precursors). Studies suggest that the secondary
environmental benefits may be substantial but are likely to differ
from country to country.
<P>
<U>Specific Results</U> 
<P>
Estimates of the cost of greenhouse gas emission reduction depend
critically upon assumptions about the levels of energy efficiency
improvements in the baseline scenario (that is, in the absence
of climate policy) and upon a wide range of factors such as consumption
patterns, resource and technology availability, the desired level
and timing of abatement, and the choice of policy instruments.
Policymakers should not place too much confidence in the specific
numerical results from any one analysis. For example, mitigation
cost analyses reveal the costs of mitigation relative to a given
baseline, but neither the baseline nor the intervention scenarios
should be interpreted as representing likely future conditions.
The focus should be on the general insights regarding the underlying
determinants of costs.
<P>
The costs of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases at levels and within a time frame that will prevent dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the climate system (the ultimate
objective of the FCCC) will be critically dependent on the choice
of emission timepath. The cost of the abatement programme will
be influenced by the rate of capital replacement, the discount
rate, and the effect of research and development.
<P>
Failure to adopt policies as early as possible to encourage efficient
replacement investments at the end of the economic life of a plant
and equipment (i.e., at the point of capital stock turnover) imposes
an economic cost to society. Implementing emission reductions
at rates that can be absorbed in the course of normal stock turnover
is likely to be cheaper than enforcing premature retirement now.
<P>
The choice of abatement paths thus involves balancing the economic
risks of rapid abatement now (that premature capital stock retirement
will later be proved unnecessary) against the corresponding risk
of delay (that more rapid reduction will then be required, necessitating
premature retirement of future capital stock.)
<P>
Appropriate long-run signals are required to allow producers and
consumers to adapt cost-effectively to constraints on greenhouse
gas emissions and to encourage research and development. Benefits
associated with the implementation of any &quot;no-regret&quot;
policies will offset, at least in part, the costs of a full portfolio
of mitigation measures. This will also increase the time available
to learn about climate risks and to bring new technologies into
the market place.
<P>
Despite significant differences in views, there is agreement that
energy efficiency gains of perhaps 10% to 30% below baseline trends
over the next two to three decades can be realized at negative
to zero net cost. (Negative net cost means an economic benefit).
With longer time horizons, which allow a more complete turnover
of capital stocks, and which give research and development and
market transformation policies a chance to impact multiple replacement
cycles, this potential is much higher. The magnitude of such &quot;no-regret&quot;
potentials depends upon the existence of substantial market or
institutional imperfections that prevent cost-effective emission
reduction measures from occurring. The key question is then the
extent to which such imperfections and barriers can be removed
cost-effectively by policy initiatives such as efficiency standards,
incentives, removal of subsidies, information programmes, and
funding of technology transfer.
<P>
Progress has been made in a number of countries in cost-effectively
reducing imperfections and institutional barriers in markets through
policy instruments based on voluntary agreements, energy efficiency
incentives, product efficiency standards, and energy efficiency
procurement programmes involving manufacturers, as well as utility
regulatory reforms. Where empirical evaluations have been made,
many have found the benefit-cost ratio of increasing energy efficiency
to be favourable, suggesting the practical feasibility of realizing
&quot;no-regret&quot; potentials at negative net cost. More information
is needed on similar and improved programmes in a wider range
of countries.
<P>
Infrastructure decisions are critical in determining long-term
emission<STRIKE>s</STRIKE> and abatement costs because they can
enhance or restrict the number and type of future options. Infrastructure
decisions determine development patterns in transportation, urban
settlement, and land use and influence energy system development
and deforestation patterns. This issue is of particular importance
to developing countries and many economies in transition where
major infrastructure decisions will be made in the near term.
<P>
If a carbon or carbon-energy tax is used as a policy instrument
for reducing emissions, the taxes could raise substantial revenues,
and how the revenues are distributed could dramatically affect
the cost of mitigation. If the revenues are distributed by reducing
distortionary taxes in the existing system, they will help reduce
the excess burden of the existing tax system, potentially yielding
an additional economic benefit (double dividend). For example,
those European studies which are more optimistic regarding the
potential for tax recycling show lower and, in some instances,
slightly negative costs. Conversely, inefficient recycling of
the tax revenues could increase costs. For example, if the tax
revenues are used to finance government programmes that yield
a lower return than the private sector investments foregone because
of the tax, then overall costs will increase.
<P>
There are large differences in the costs of reducing greenhouse
gas emissions among countries because of their state of economic
development, infrastructure choices, and natural resource base.
This indicates that international cooperation could significantly
reduce the global cost of reducing emissions. Research suggests
that, in principle, substantial savings would be possible if emissions
are reduced where it is cheapest to do so. In practice, this requires
international mechanisms ensuring appropriate capital flows and
technology transfers between countries. Conversely, a failure
to achieve international cooperation could compromise unilateral
attempts by a country or a group of countries to limit greenhouse
gas emissions. However, estimates of so called leakage effects
vary so widely that they provide little guidance to policymakers.
<P>
There has been more analysis to date of emission reduction potentials
and costs for developed countries than for other parts of the
world. Moreover, many existing models are not well-suited to study
economies in transition or economies of developing countries.
Much work is needed to develop and apply models for use outside
developed countries (for example, to represent more explicitly
market imperfections, institutional barriers, and traditional
and informal economic sectors). In addition, the discussion below
and the bulk of the underlying report deal with costs of response
options at the national or regional level in terms of effect on
GDP. Further analysis is required concerning effects of response
options on employment, inflation, trade competitiveness, and other
public issues.
<P>
A large number of studies using both top-down and bottom-up approaches
(see box for definitions) were reviewed. Estimates of the costs
of limiting fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions (expressed as
carbon) vary widely and depend upon choice of methodologies, underlying
assumptions, emission scenarios, policy instruments, reporting
year, and other criteria. For specific results of individual studies,
see Chapter 9.
<P>
<B>OECD Countries</B>. Although it is difficult to generalize,
top-down analyses suggest that the costs of substantial reductions
below 1990 levels could be as high as several percent of GDP.
In the specific case of stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels,
most studies estimate that annual costs in the range of -0.5%
of GDP (equivalent to a gain of about $60 billion in total for
OECD countries at today's GDP levels) to 2% of GDP (equivalent
to a loss of about $240 billion) could be reached over the next
several decades. However, studies also show that appropriate timing
of abatement measures and the availability of low-cost alternatives
may substantially reduce the size of the overall bill.
<P>
Bottom-up studies are more optimistic about the potential for
low or negative cost emission reductions, and the capacity to
implement that potential. Such studies show that the costs of
reducing emissions by 20% in developed countries within two to
three decades are negligible to negative. Other bottom-up studies
suggest that there exists a potential for absolute reductions
in excess of 50% in the longer term, without increasing and perhaps
even reducing total energy system costs.
<P>
The results of top-down and bottom-up analyses differ because
of such factors as higher estimates of no-regrets potential and
technological progress, and earlier saturation in energy services
per unit GDP. In the most favourable assessments, savings of 10-20%
in the total cost of energy services can be achieved.
<P>
<B>Economies in transition</B>. The potential for cost-effective
reductions in energy use is apt to be considerable, but the realizable
potential will depend upon what economic and technological development
path is chosen, as well as the availability of capital to pursue
different paths. A critical issue is the future of structural
changes in these countries that are apt to change dramatically
the level of baseline emissions and the emission reduction costs.
<P>
<B>Developing countries</B>. Analyses suggest that there may be
substantial low-cost fossil fuel carbon dioxide emission reduction
opportunities for developing countries. Development pathways that
increase energy efficiency, promote alternative energy technologies,
reduce deforestation, and enhance agricultural productivity and
biomass energy production can be economically beneficial. To embark
upon this pathway may require significant international cooperation
and financial and technology transfers. However, these are likely
to be insufficient to offset rapidly increasing emissions baselines,
associated with increased economic growth and overall welfare.
Stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions is likely to be costly.
<P>
It should be noted that analyses of costs to economies in transition
and developing countries typically neglect the general equilibrium
effects of unilateral actions taken by developed countries. These
effects may be either positive or negative and their magnitude
is difficult to quantify.
<P>
It should also be noted that estimates of costs or benefits of
the order of a few percent of GDP may represent small differences
in GDP growth rates, but are nevertheless substantial in absolute
terms.
<P>
Preservation and augmentation of carbon sinks offer a substantial
and often cost-effective component of a greenhouse gas mitigation
strategy. Studies suggest that as much as 15-30% of 1990 global
energy-related emissions could be offset by carbon sequestration
in forests for a period of 50-100 years. The costs of carbon sequestration,
which are competitive with source control options, may differ
among regions of the world.
<P>
Control of emissions of other greenhouse gases, especially methane
and nitrous oxide, can provide significant cost-effective opportunities
in some countries. About 10% of anthropogenic methane emissions
could be reduced at negative or low cost using available mitigation
options for such methane sources as natural gas systems, waste
management, and agriculture.
<P>
<B>10. INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT</B> 
<P>
Integrated assessment models combine knowledge from a wide range
of disciplines to provide insights that would not be observed
through traditional disciplinary research. They are used to explore
possible states of human and natural systems, analyze key questions
related to policy formulation, and help set research priorities.
Integration helps coordinate assumptions from different disciplines
and allows feedbacks and interactions absent from individual disciplines
to be analyzed. However, the results of such analyses are no better
than the information drawn from the underlying economic, atmospheric,
and biological sciences. Integrated assessment models are limited
both by the underlying knowledge base upon which they draw and
by the relatively limited experiential base.
<P>
Most current integrated assessment models do not reflect the specific
social and economic dynamics of the developing and transition
economies well; for example, none of the existing models addresses
most market imperfections, institutional barriers, or the operation
of the informal sector in these countries. This can lead to biases
in global assessments when mitigation options and impacts on developing
or transition economies are valued as if their economies operated
like those in the developed countries.
<P>
While relatively new, integrated assessment models of climate
change have evolved rapidly. Integrated assessment models tend
to fall into two categories: <I>policy evaluation</I> and <I>policy
optimization</I> models. Policy evaluation models are rich in
physical detail and have been used to analyze the potential for
deforestation as a consequence of interactions between demographics,
agricultural productivity, and economic growth, and the relationship
between climate change and the extent of potentially malarial
regions. Policy optimization models optimize over key variables
(e.g., emission rates, carbon taxes) to achieve formulated policy
goals (e.g., cost minimization or welfare optimization).
<P>
Key uncertainties in current integrated assessments include the
sensitivity of the climate system to changes in greenhouse gas
concentrations, the specification and valuation of impacts where
there are no markets, changes in national and regional demographics,
the choice of discount rates, and assumptions regarding the cost,
availability, and diffusion of technologies.
<P>
<B>11. AN ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF POLICY INSTRUMENTS TO COMBAT
CLIMATE CHANGE</B> 
<P>
Governments may have different sets of criteria for assessing
international as well as domestic greenhouse policy instruments.
Among these criteria are efficiency and cost-effectiveness, effectiveness
in achieving stated environmental targets, distributional (including
intergenerational) equity, flexibility in the face of new knowledge,
understandability to the general public, and consistency with
national priorities, policies, institutions and traditions. The
choice of instruments may also partly reflect a desire on the
part of governments to achieve other objectives, such as sustainable
economic development, meeting social development goals and fiscal
targets, or influencing pollution levels that are indirectly related
to greenhouse gas emissions. A further concern of governments
may lie with the effect of policies on competitiveness.
<P>
The world economy and indeed some individual national economies
suffer from a number of price distortions which increase greenhouse
gas emissions, such as some agricultural and fuel subsidies and
distortions in transport pricing. A number of studies of this
issue indicate that global emission reductions of 4-18%, together
with increases in real incomes, are possible from phasing out
fuel subsidies. For the most part, reducing such distortions could
lower emissions and increase economic efficiency. However, subsidies
are often introduced and price distortions maintained for social
and distributional reasons, and they may be difficult to remove.
<P>
Policy instruments may be identified at two different levels:
those that might be used by a group of countries and those that
might be used by individual nations unilaterally or to achieve
compliance with a multilateral agreement.
<P>
A group of countries may choose from policy measures and instruments
including encouragement of voluntary actions and further research,
tradable quotas, joint implementation (specifically activities
implemented jointly under the pilot phase), harmonized domestic
carbon taxes, international carbon taxes, nontradable quotas,
and various international standards. If the group did not include
all major greenhouse gas emitters, then there might be a tendency
for fossil fuel use to increase in countries not participating
in this group. This outcome might reduce the international competitiveness
of some industries in participating countries as well as the environmental
effectiveness of the countries' efforts.
<P>
At both the international and national levels, the economic literature
indicates that instruments that provide economic incentives, such
as taxes and tradable quotas/permits, are likely to be more cost-effective
than other approaches. Uniform standards among groups of countries
participating in an international agreement are likely to be difficult
to achieve. However, for one group of countries there has been
agreement on the application of some uniform standards.
<P>
At the international level, all of the potentially efficient market-based
instruments could be examined during the course of future negotiations.
A tradable quota system has the disadvantage of making the marginal
cost of emissions uncertain, while a carbon tax (and related instruments)
has the disadvantage of leaving the effect on the level at which
emissions are controlled uncertain. The weight given to the importance
of reducing these different types of uncertainty would be one
crucial factor in further evaluating these alternative instruments.
Because of the lack of appropriate scientific knowledge, there
would remain a high degree of uncertainty about the results of
limiting emissions at specific levels. The adoption of either
a tradable quota scheme or international taxes would have implications
for the international distribution of wealth. The distributional
consequences would be the subject of negotiation. To insure the
practicability of such instruments, there is a need for additional
studies on the possible design of tradable quotas and harmonized
taxes and on the institutional framework in which they might operate.
<P>
Individual countries that seek to implement mitigation policies
can choose from among a large set of potential policies and instruments,
including carbon taxes, tradable permits, deposit refund systems
(and related instruments), and subsidies, as well as technology
standards, performance standards, product bans, direct government
investment, and voluntary agreements. Public education on the
sustainable use of resources could play an important part in modifying
consumption patterns and other human behaviour. The choice of
measures at the domestic level may reflect objectives other than
cost-effectiveness, such as meeting fiscal targets. Revenue from
carbon taxes or auctioned tradable permits could be used to replace
existing distortionary taxes. The choice of instruments may also
reflect other environmental objectives, such as reducing non-greenhouse
pollution emissions, or increasing forest cover, or other concerns
such as specific impacts on particular regions or communities.
<P>
<B>Box 1: Top-Down and Bottom-Up Models</B> 
<P>
Top-down models are aggregate models of the entire macroeconomy
that draw on analysis of historical trends and relationships to
predict the large-scale interactions between the sectors of the
economy, especially the interactions between the energy sector
and the rest of the economy. Top-down models typically incorporate
relatively little detail on energy consumption and technological
change compared with bottom-up models.
<P>
In contrast, bottom-up models incorporate detailed studies of
the engineering costs of a wide range of available and forecast
technologies and describe energy consumption in great detail.
However, compared with top-down models, they typically incorporate
relatively little detail on nonenergy consumer behaviour and interactions
with other sectors of the economy.
<P>
This simple characterization of top-down and bottom-up models
is increasingly misleading as more recent versions of each approach
have tended to provide greater detail in the aspects that were
less developed in the past. As a result of this convergence in
model structure, model results are tending to converge, and the
remaining differences reflect differences in assumptions about
how rapidly and effectively market institutions adopt cost-effective
new technologies or can be induced to adopt them by policy interventions.
<P>
Many existing models are not well suited to study economies in
transition or those of developing countries. More work is needed
to develop the appropriate methodologies, data, and models and
to build the local institutional capacity to undertake analyses.

<title> Wind Plants of California's 

San Gorgonio Pass </title>

<head><b><h1>Wind Plants<p>

 of California's San Gorgonio Pass</h1></b></head><p>

<body>



The San Gorgonio Pass near Palm Springs hosts the third 

largest concentration of wind turbines in California. There 

are more than 3,500 wind turbines located in the pass, many 

massed on the floor of the Whitewater Wash (an ephemeral 

stream) against the dramatic backdrop of Mount San Jacinto.<p>



<center><img align=bottom src="sgpcal.gif"><p>



<h3>Wind Turbines on Whitewater Wash</h3></center><p>





Many of the wind turbines on the Wash were installed during the height of 

California's great <i>wind rush</i> in the early 1980s. The wind turbines 

in these wind plants were installed much closer together than in modern 

arrays, creating a veritable <i>forest.</i> These older turbines are also 

less reliable and operate less frequently than contemporary designs. <p>



Some of the older turbines have already been removed as wind companies 

begin to <i>repower</i> the aging wind plants with newer more cost 

effective wind turbines.<p>



Only two hours east of Hollywood, the wind turbines near 

Palm Springs have appeared in several movies, including 

<i>Rain Man.</i><p>

<title>Wind Plants of California's Tehachapi Pass</title>
<head><b><h1>Wind Plants<p>
 of California's Tehachapi Pass</h1></b></head><p>
<body>
The Tehachapi Pass is the world's largest producer of wind-generated electricity. The more than 5,000 wind turbines in the Tehachapi-Mojave wind resource area of Kern County generate approximately 1.3 Terawatt-hours (1,300,000,000 kWh) per year. This is enough electricity to meet the residential needs of more than 500,000 Southern Californians or nearly one million Europeans.<p>

The Tehachapi Pass is two hours north of Los Angeles and is frequently used by Hollywood producers for its dramatic scenery as in the movie <i>Terminal Velocity.</i><p>

<center><img align=bottom src="tehcal.gif"><p>
<h3>Lunch break on the PCT</h3></center><p>

Every May the Kern Wind Energy Association and the Kern-Kaweah Chapter of the Sierra Club lead a hike on the Pacific Crest Trail to view the spring wildflowers and the wind turbines. The hikers shown here have stopped for lunch 
atop Cameron Ridge, which affords spectacular views of the area's wind power plants, the Tehachapi Mountains, and the Mojave Desert.<p>

The rotors on these Micon wind turbines are 19 meters in diameter and drive 108 kW generators. The site is operated by Cannon Energy. <p>

<h3>Subject: 1. Introduction and Intent
</h3>
The intent of this FAQ is to provide some basic information on gasolines and
other fuels for spark ignition engines used in automobiles. The toxicity and
environmental reasons for recent and planned future changes to gasoline are
discussed, along with recent and proposed changes in composition of gasoline.
This FAQ intended to help readers choose the most appropriate fuel for
vehicles, assist with the diagnosis of fuel-related problems, and to
understand the significance of most gasoline properties listed in fuel
specifications. I make no apologies for the fairly heavy emphasis on
chemistry, it is the  only sensible way to describe the oxidation of
hydrocarbon fuels to produce energy, water, and carbon dioxide.<p>

<h3>
Subject: 3. What Advantage will I gain from reading this FAQ?
</h3>
This FAQ is intended to provide a fairly technical description of what
gasoline contains, how it is specified, and how the properties affect the
performance in your vehicle. The regulations governing gasoline have
changed, and are continuing to change. These changes have made much of the
traditional lore about gasoline obsolete. Motorists may wish to understand
a little more about gasoline to ensure they obtain the best value, and the
most appropriate fuel for their vehicle. There is no point in prematurely
destroying your second most expensive purchase by using unsuitable fuel,
just as there is no point in wasting hard-earned money on higher octane
fuel that your automobile can not utilize. Note that this FAQ does not
discuss the relative advantages of specific brands of gasolines, it is
only intended to discuss the generic properties of gasolines.
<p><hr>
<h3>
Subject: 4. What is Gasoline?
<p>
<b>4.1  Where does crude oil come from?.
</b>
</h3>
The generally-accepted origin of crude oil is from plant life up to 3
billion years ago, but predominantly from 100 to 600 million years ago [1].
"Dead vegetarian dino dinner" is more correct than "dead dinos".
The molecular structure of the hydrocarbons and other compounds present
in fossil fuels can be linked to the leaf waxes and other plant molecules of
marine and terrestrial plants believed to exist during that era. There are
various biogenic marker chemicals such as isoprenoids from terpenes,
porphyrins and aromatics from natural pigments, pristane and phytane from
the hydrolysis of chlorophyll, and normal alkanes from waxes, whose size
and shape can not be explained by known geological processes [2]. The
presence of optical activity and the carbon isotopic ratios also indicate a
biological origin [3]. There is another hypothesis that suggests crude oil
is derived from methane from the earth's interior. The current main
proponent of this abiotic theory is Thomas Gold, however abiotic and
extraterrestrial origins for fossil fuels were also considered at the turn
of the century, and were discarded then.
<p>
<h3>
4.2  When will we run out of crude oil?
</h3>
It has been estimated that the planet contains over 1.4 x 10^15 tonnes of
petroleum, however much of this is too dilute or inaccessible for current
technology to recover [4]. The petroleum industry uses a measure called
the Reserves/Production ratio (R/P) to monitor how production and
exploration are linked. This is based on the concept of "proved" reserves
of crude oil, which are generally taken to be those quantities which
geological and engineering information indicate with reasonable certainty
can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic
and operating conditions. The Reserves/Production ratio is the above
reserves divided by the production in the last year, and the result is the
length of time that those remaining reserves would last if production were
to continue at the current level [5]. It is important to note those
definitions, as the price of oil increases, marginal fields become "proved
reserves", thus we are unlikely to "run out" of oil, as more fields will
become economic as the price rises. If the price exceeds $30/bbl then
alternative fuels may become competitive, and at $50-60/bbl coal-derived
liquid fuels are economic, as are many biomass-derived fuels and other
energy sources [6]. One barrel of oil equals 0.158987 m3. The current price
for Brent Crude is approx. $18/bbl. The R/P ratio has increased from 27
years (1979) to 43.1 years (1993) [5]. Now, some numbers. <p>

<h3>
4.3  What is the history of gasoline?
</h3>
In the late 19th Century the most suitable fuels for the automobile
were coal tar distillates and the lighter fractions from the distillation
of crude oil. During the early 20th Century the oil companies were
producing gasoline as a simple distillate from petroleum, but the
automotive engines were rapidly being improved and required a more
suitable fuel. During the 1910s, laws prohibited the storage of gasolines
on residential properties, so Charles F. Kettering ( yes - he of ignition
system fame ) modified an IC engine to run on kerosine. However the
kerosine-fuelled engine would "knock" and crack the cylinder head and
pistons. He assigned Thomas Midgley Jr. to confirm that the cause was
from the kerosine droplets vaporising on combustion as they presumed .
Midgley demonstrated that the knock was caused by a rapid rise in
pressure after ignition, not during preignition as believed [7]. This
then lead to the long search for anti-knock agents, culminating in
tetra ethyl lead [8]. Typical mid-1920s gasolines were 40 - 60 Octane [9].
<p>
Because sulfur in gasoline inhibited the octane-enhancing effect
of the alkyl lead, the sulfur content of the thermally-cracked refinery
streams for gasolines was restricted. By the 1930s, the petroleum
industry had determined that the larger hydrocarbon molecules (kerosine)
had major adverse effects on the octane of gasoline, and were developing
consistent specifications for desired properties. By the 1940s catalytic
cracking was introduced, and gasoline compositions became fairly consistent
between brands during the various seasons.
<p>
The 1950s saw the start of the increase of the compression ratio, requiring
higher octane fuels. Lead levels were increased, and some new refining
processes ( such as hydrocracking ), specifically designed to provide
hydrocarbons components with good lead response and octane, were introduced.
Minor improvements were made to gasoline formulations to improve yields and
octane until the 1970s - when unleaded fuels were introduced to protect
the exhaust catalysts that were also being introduced for environmental
reasons. From 1970 until 1990 gasolines were slowly changed as lead was
phased out. In 1990 the Clean Air Act started forcing major compositional
changes on gasoline, and these changes will continue into the 21st Century
because gasoline is a major pollution source.
<p>
<h3>
4.4  What are the hydrocarbons in gasoline?
</h3>
Hydrocarbons ( HCs ) are any molecules that just contain hydrogen and
carbon, both of which are fuel molecules that can be burnt ( oxidised )
to form water ( H2O ) or carbon dioxide ( CO2 ). If the combustion is
not complete, carbon monoxide ( CO ) may be formed. As CO can be burnt
to produce CO2, it is also a fuel.
<p>
The way the hydrogen and carbons hold hands determines which hydrocarbon
family they belong to. If they only hold one hand they are called
"saturated hydrocarbons" because they can not absorb additional hydrogen.
If the carbons hold two hands they are called "unsaturated hydrocarbons"
because they can be converted into "saturated hydrocarbons" by the
addition of hydrogen to the double bond. Hydrogens are omitted from the
following, but if you remember C = 4 hands, H = 1 hand, and O = 2 hands,
you can draw the full structures of most HCs.
<p>
Gasoline contains over 500 hydrocarbons that may have between 3 to 12
carbons, and gasoline used to have a boiling range from 30C to 220C at
atmospheric pressure. The boiling range is narrowing as the initial boiling
point is increasing, and the final boiling point is decreasing, both
changes are for environmental reasons. Detailed descriptions of structures
can be found in any chemical or petroleum text discussing gasolines [10].

<h3>
4.5  What are oxygenates?
</h3>
Oxygenates are just preused hydrocarbons :-). They contain oxygen, which
can not provide energy, but their structure provides a reasonable
anti-knock value, thus they are good substitutes for aromatics, and
they may also reduce the smog-forming tendencies of the exhaust gases [11].

</pre>

They can be produced from fossil fuels eg methanol (MeOH), methyl tertiary
butyl ether (MTBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), or from biomass, eg
ethanol(EtOH), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE)). Most oxygenates used in
gasolines are either alcohols ( Cx-O-H ) or ethers (Cx-O-Cy), and contain
1 to 6 carbons. MTBE is produced by reacting methanol ( from natural gas )
with isobutylene in the liquid phase over an acidic ion-exchange resin
catalyst at 100C. The isobutylene was initially from refinery catalytic
crackers or petrochemical olefin plants, but these days larger plants
produce it from butanes. Production has increased at the rate of 10 to 20%
per year, and the spot market price in June 1993 was around $270/tonne [11].
The  "ether" starting fluids for vehicles are usually diethyl ether
( liquid ) or dimethyl ether ( aerosol ). Note that " petroleum ether " is
actually a volatile hydrocarbon fraction, it is not a Cx-O-Cy compound.
<p>
Oxygenates are added to gasolines to reduce the reactivity of emissions,
but they are only effective if the hydrocarbon fractions are carefully
modified to utilise the octane and volatility properties of the oxygenates.
If the hydrocarbon fraction is not correctly modified, oxygenates can
increase the undesirable smog-forming and toxic emissions. The major
reduction in the reactivity of exhaust and evaporative emissions will occur
with reformulated gasolines, due to be introduced in January 1995, which
have oxygenates and major composition changes to the hydrocarbon component.
Oxygenates do not necessarily reduce all individual exhaust toxins, nor
are they intended to.
<p>
Oxygenates have significantly different physical properties to hydrocarbons,
and the levels that can be added to gasolines are controlled by the EPA in
the US, with waivers being granted for some combinations. The change to
reformulated gasoline requires oxygenates, but also that the hydrocarbon
composition must be significantly more modified than the existing
oxygenated gasolines to reduce unsaturates, volatility, benzene, and the
reactivity of emissions.
<p>
Oxygenates that are added to gasoline function in two ways. Firstly they
have high blending octane, and so can replace high octane aromatics
in the fuel. These aromatics are responsible for disproportionate amounts
of CO and HC exhaust emissions. This is called the "aromatic substitution
effect". Oxygenates also cause engines without sophisticated engine
management systems to move to the lean side of stoichiometry, thus reducing
emissions of CO ( 2% oxygen can reduce CO by 16% ) and HC ( 2% oxygen
can reduce HC by 10%). However, on vehicles with engine management systems,
the fuel volume will be increased to bring the stoichiometry back to
the preferred optimum setting. Oxygen in the fuel can not contribute
energy, consequently the fuel has less energy content. For the same
efficiency and power output, more fuel has to be burnt, and the slight
improvements in efficiency that oxygenates provide on some engines usually
do not completely compensate for the oxygen [12].
<p>
There are huge number of chemical mechanisms involved in the pre-flame
reactions of gasoline combustion. Although both alkyl leads and oxygenates
are effective at suppressing knock, the chemical modes through which they
act are entirely different. MTBE works by retarding the progress of the low
temperature or cool-flame reactions, consuming radical species, particularly
OH radicals and producing isobutene. The isobutene in turn consumes
additional OH radicals and produces unreactive, resonantly stabilised
radicals such as allyl and methyl allyl, as well as stable species such as
allene, which resist further oxidation [13,14].
<p>
<h3>
4.6  Why were alkyl lead compounds added?
</h3>
The efficiency of a spark-ignited gasoline engine can be related to the
compression ratio up to at least compression ratio 17:1 [15]. However any
"knock" caused by the fuel will rapidly mechanically destroy an engine, and
General Motors was having major problems trying to improve engines without
inducing knock. The problem was to identify economic additives that could
be added to gasoline or kerosine to prevent knock, as it was apparent that
engine development was being hindered. The kerosine for home fuels soon
became a secondary issue, as the magnitude of the automotive knock problem
increased throughout the 1910s, and so more resources were poured into the
quest for an effective "anti-knock". A higher octane aviation gasoline was
required urgently once the US entered WWI, and almost every possible
chemical ( including melted butter ) was tested for anti-knock ability [16].
<p>
Originally, iodine was the best anti-knock available, but was not a practical
gasoline additive, and was used as the benchmark. In 1919 aniline was found
to have superior antiknock ability to iodine, but also was not a practical
additive, however aniline became the benchmark anti-knock, and various
compounds were compared to it. The discovery of tetra ethyl lead, and the
scavengers required to remove it from the engine were made by teams lead by
Thomas Midgley Jr. in 1922 [7,8,16]. They tried selenium oxychloride which
was an excellent antiknock, however it reacted with iron and "dissolved" the
engine. Midgley was able to predict that other organometallics would work,
and slowly focused on organoleads. They then had to remove the lead, which
would otherwise accumulate and coat the engine and exhaust system with lead.
They discovered and developed the halogenated lead scavengers that are still
used in leaded fuels. The scavengers, ( ethylene dibromide and ethylene
dichloride ), function by providing halogen atoms that react with the lead
to form volatile lead halide salts that can escape out the exhaust. The
quantity of scavengers added to the alkyl lead concentrate is calculated
according to the amount of lead present. If sufficient scavenger is added
to theoretically react with all the lead present, the amount is called one
"theory". Typically, 1.0 to 1.5 theories are used, but aviation gasolines
must only use one theory. This ensures there is no excess bromine that could
react with the engine. The alkyl leads rapidly became the most cost-effective
method of enhancing octane.
<p>
The development of the alkyl leads ( tetra methyl lead, tetra ethyl lead )
and the toxic halogenated scavengers meant that petroleum refiners could
then configure refineries to produce hydrocarbon  streams that would
increase octane with small quantities of alkyl lead. If you keep adding
alkyl lead compounds, the lead response of the gasoline decreases, and so
there are economic limits to how much lead should be added.
<p>
Up until the late 1960s, alkyl leads were added to gasolines in increasing
concentrations to obtain octane. The limit was 1.14g Pb/l, which is well
above the diminishing returns part of the lead response curve for most
refinery streams, thus it is unlikely that much fuel was ever made at that
level. I believe 1.05 was about the maximum, and articles suggest that 1970
100 RON premiums were about 0.7-0.8 g Pb/l and 94 RON regulars 0.6-0.7 g
Pb/l, which matches published lead response data [17] eg.

</pre>
The alkyl lead anti-knocks work in a different stage of the pre-combustion
reaction to oxygenates. In contrast to oxygenates, the alkyl lead interferes
with hydrocarbon chain branching in the intermediate temperature range
where HO2 is the most important radical species. Lead oxide, either as
solid particles, or in the gas phase, reacts with HO2 and removes it from
the available radical pool, thereby deactivating the major chain branching
reaction sequence that results in undesirable, easily-autoignitable
hydrocarbons [13,14].
<p>
<h3>
4.7  Why not use other organometallic compounds?
</h3>
As the toxicity of the alkyl lead and the halogenated scavengers became of
concern, alternatives were considered. The most famous of these is
methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), which was used in the
USA until banned by the EPA from 27 Oct 1978 [18], but is approved for use
in Canada and Australia. It is more expensive than alkyl leads and has been
reported to increase unburned hydrocarbon emissions and block exhaust
catalysts [19]. Other compounds that enhance octane have been suggested,
but usually have significant problems such as toxicity, cost, increased
engine wear etc.. Examples include dicyclopentadienyl iron and nickel
carbonyl.
<p>
<h3>
4.8  What do the refining processes do?
</h3>
Crude oil contains a wide range of hydrocarbons, organometallics and other
compounds containing sulfur, nitrogen etc. The HCs contain between 1 and 60
carbon atoms. Gasoline requires hydrocarbons with carbon atoms between 3 and
12, arranged in specific ways to provide the desirable properties. Obviously,
a refinery has to either sell the remainder as marketable products, or
convert the larger molecules into smaller gasoline molecules.
<p>
A refinery will distill crude oil into various fractions and, depending on
the desired final products, will further process and blend those fractions.
Typical final products could be:- gases for chemical synthesis and fuel
(CNG), liquified gases (LPG), butane, aviation and automotive gasolines,
aviation and lighting kerosines, diesels, distillate and residual fuel oils,
lubricating oil base grades, paraffin oils and waxes. Many of the common
processes are intended to increase the yield of blending feedstocks for
gasolines.
<p>
Typical modern refinery processes for gasoline components include<p>
<UL>
<LI>Catalytic cracking - breaks larger, higher-boiling, hydrocarbons into
  gasoline range product that contains 30% aromatics and 20-30% olefins.
<LI>Hydrocracking - cracks and adds hydrogen to molecules, producing a
  more saturated, stable, gasoline fraction.
<LI>Isomerisation - raises gasoline fraction octane by converting straight
  chain hydrocarbons into branched isomers.
<LI>Reforming - converts saturated, low octane, hydrocarbons into higher octane
  product containing about 60% aromatics.
<LI>Alkylation - reacts gaseous olefin streams with isobutane to produce liquid
  high octane iso-alkanes.
</UL>
The changes that the Clean Air Act and other legislation ensures that the
refineries will continue to modify their processes to produce a less
volatile gasoline with fewer toxins and toxic emissions. Options include:-<P>
<UL>
<LI>Reducing the "severity" of reforming to reduce aromatic production.
<LI>Distilling the C5/C6 fraction from reformer feeds and treating that
  stream to produce non-aromatic high octane components.
<LI>Distilling the higher boiling fraction ( which contains 80-100% of
  aromatics that can be hydrocracked ) from catalytic cracker product [20].
<LI>Convert butane to isobutane or isobutylene for alkylation or MTBE feed.
</UL>
<h3>
4.9  What energy is released when gasoline is burned?
</h3>
It is important to note that the theoretical energy content of gasoline
when burned in air is only related to the hydrogen and carbon contents.
Octane rating is not fundamentally related to the energy content, and the
actual hydrocarbon and oxygenate components used in the gasoline will
determine both the energy release and the anti-knock rating.
<P>
Two important reactions are:-<P>
<OL>
<LI>          C + O2 = CO2
<LI>          H + O2 = H2O
</OL>
The mass or volume of air required to provide sufficient oxygen to achieve
this complete combustion is the "stoichiometric" mass or volume of air.
Insufficient air = "rich", and excess air = "lean", and the stoichiometric
mass of air is related to the carbon:hydrogen ratio of the fuel. The
procedures for calculation of stoichiometric air/fuel ratios are fully
documented in an SAE standard [21].
<P>
Atomic masses used are:- Hydrogen = 1.00794, Carbon = 12.011,
Oxygen = 15.994, Nitrogen = 14.0067, and Sulfur = 32.066.

For normal heptane C7H16 with a molecular weight = 100.204 <p>
<pre>           C7H16 + 11O2 = 7CO2 + 8H2O</pre>
thus 1.000 kg of C7H16 required 3.513 kg of O2 = 15.179 kg air.<p>

The chemical stoichiometric combustion of hydrocarbons with oxygen
can be written as:-
<p>
<pre>CxHy + (x + (y/4))O2  ->  xCO2 + (y/2)H2O</pre>
Often, for simplicity, the remainder of air is assumed to be nitrogen,
which can be added to the equation when exhaust compositions are required.
As a general rule, maximum power is achieved at slightly rich, whereas
maximum fuel economy is achieved at slightly lean. <p>

The energy content of the gasoline is obtained by burning all the fuel
inside a bomb calorimeter and measuring the temperature increase.
The energy available depends on what happens to the water produced from the
combustion of the hydrogen. If the water remains as a gas, then it cannot
release the heat of vaporisation, thus producing the Nett Calorific Value.
If the water were condensed back to the original fuel temperature, then
Gross Calorific Value of the fuel, which will be larger, is obtained.<p>

The calorific values are fairly constant for families of HCs, which is not
surprising, given their fairly consistent carbon/hydrogen ratios. For liquid
( l ) or gaseous ( g ) fuel converted to gaseous products - except for the
2-methylbutene-2, where only gaseous is reported. * = Blending Octane Number<p>

Because all the data is available, the calorific value of fuels can be
estimated quite accurately from hydrocarbon fuel properties such as the
density, sulfur content, and aniline point ( which indicates the aromatics
content ).<p>

It should be noted that because oxygenates contain oxygen that can
not provide energy, they will have significantly lower energy contents.
They are added to provide octane, not energy. For an engine that can be
optimised for oxygenates, more fuel is required to obtain the same power,
but they can burn slightly more efficiently, thus the power ratio is not
identical to the energy content ratio. They also require more energy to
vaporise.<p>

Obviously, for automobiles, the nett calorific value is appropriate. The
calorific value is the maximum energy that can be obtained from the fuel,
but the reality of modern SI engines is that efficiencies of 20-40% may be
obtained, this limit being due to engineering and material constraints
that prevent optimum combustion conditions being used. The CI engine can
achieve higher efficiencies, usually over a wider operating range as well.

<h3>
4.10  What are the gasoline specifications?
</h3>
Gasolines are usually defined by government regulation, where properties and
test methods are clearly defined. In the US, several government and state
bodies can specify gasoline properties. The US gasoline specifications and
test methods are listed in several readily available publications, including
the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) [24], and the American Society for
Testing Materials (ASTM) [25]. The 1994 ASTM edition has:-<p>

D4814-93a Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel.<p>

This specification lists various properties that all fuels have to comply
with, and may be updated throughout the year. Typical properties are:- <p>
<h4>
4.10.1	Vapour Pressure and Distillation Classes.
</h4>
<i>6 different classes according to location and/or season.</i><p>
As gasoline is distilled, the temperatures at which various fractions are
evaporated are calculated. Specifications define the temperatures at which
various percentages of the fuel are evaporated. Distillation limits
include maximum temperatures that 10% is evaporated (50-70C), 50% is
evaporated (110-121C), 90% is evaporated (185-190C), and the final boiling
point (225C). A minimum temperature for 50% evaporated (77C), and a maximum
amount of Residue (2%) after distillation.  Vapour pressure limits for
each class ( 54, 62, 69, 79, 93, 103 kPa ) are also specified. Note that the
EPA has issued a waiver that does not require gasoline/ethanol blends to
meet the required specifications.<p>
<h4>
4.10.2 Vapour Lock Protection Classes
</h4>
5 classes for vapour lock protection, according to location and/or season.
The limit is a maximum Vapour/Liquid ratio of 20 at test temperatures of
41, 47, 51, 56, 60C.<p>
<h4>
4.10.3 Antiknock Index   ( aka (RON+MON)/2, "Pump Octane" )
</h4>
<i>The ( Research Octane Number + Motor Octane Number ) divided by two.</i> Limits
are not specified, but changes in engine requirements according season and
location are discussed. Fuels with an Antiknock index of 87, 89, 91
( Unleaded), and 88 ( Leaded ) are listed as typical for the US.<p>

<h4>4.10.4 Lead Content</h4>
Leaded = 1.1 g Pb / L maximum, and Unleaded = 0.013 g Pb / L maximum.
<p>
<h4>
4.10.5 Copper strip corrosion
</h4>
<i>Ability to tarnish clean copper, indicating the presence of any corrosive
sulfur compounds </i>
<p>
<h4>
4.10.6 Maximum Sulfur content
</h4>
Sulfur adversely affects exhaust catalysts and fuel hydrocarbon lead
response, and also may be emitted as polluting sulfur oxides.
<p>
Leaded = 0.15 %mass maximum, and Unleaded = 0.10 %mass maximum.
<p>
Typical US gasoline levels are 0.03 %mass.
<p>
<h4>
4.10.7 Maximum Existent Gum
</h4>
<i>Limits the amount of gums present in fuel at the time of testing to
5 mg/100mls.</i> The results do not correlate well with actual engine deposits
caused by fuel vaporisation [26].
<p>
<h4>
4.10.8 Minimum Oxidation Stability
</h4>
This ensures the fuel remains chemically stable, and does not form additional
gums during periods in distribution systems, which can be up to 3-6 months.
The sample is heated with oxygen inside a pressure vessel, and the delay
until significant oxygen uptake is measured.
 <p>
<h4>
4.10.9 Water Tolerance
</h4>
<i>Highest temperature that causes phase separation of oxygenated fuels.</i>
The limits vary according to location and month. For Alaska - North of 62
latitude, it changes from -41C in Dec/Jan to 9C in July, but remains 10C all
year in Hawaii.<p>

As well as the above, there are various restrictions introduced by the Clean
Air Act and state bodies such as California's Air Resources Board (CARB) that
often have more stringent limits for the above properties, as well as
additional limits. The Clean Air Act also specifies some regions that exceed
air quality standards have to use reformulated gasolines (RFGs) all year,
starting January 1995. Other regions are required to use oxygenated
gasolines for four winter months, beginning November 1992. The RFGs also
contain oxygenates. Metropolitan regions with severe ozone air quality
problems must use reformulated gasolines in 1995 that;- contain at least
2.0 wt% oxygen, reduce 1990 volatile organic carbon compounds by 15%, and
reduce specified toxic emissions by 15% (1995) and 25% (2000). Metropolitan
regions that exceeded carbon monoxide limits were required to use gasolines
with 2.7 wt% oxygen during winter months, starting in 1992. <p>

Because phosphorus adversely affects exhaust catalysts, the EPA limits
phosphorus in all gasolines to 0.0013 gP/L.<p>

The 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) amendments and CARB phase 2 (1996)
specifications for reformulated gasoline establish the following limits,
compared with typical 1990 gasoline. Because of a lack of data, the EPA
were unable to define the CAA required parameters , so they instituted
a two-stage system. The first stage, the "Simple Model" is an interim
stage that run from 1/Jan/1995 to 1/May/1997. The second stage, the
"Complex Model" would be developed, with the following parameters likely
to be controlled - reid vapour pressure, benzene, oxygen, sulfur, olefins
distillation ( 90% Evaporated ), and aromatics. Each refiner must have
their RFG recertified using the Complex model by 1/May/1997 [27].<p>

90% evaporated        170 C              -              149 C
</pre>
These regulations also specify emissions criteria. eg CAA specifies no
increase in nitric oxides (NOx) emissions, reductions in VOC by 15% during
the ozone season, and specified toxins by 15% all year. These criteria
indirectly establish vapour pressure and composition limits that refiners
have to meet. Note that the EPA also can issue CAA Section 211 waivers that
allow refiners to choose which oxygenates they use. In 1981, the EPA also
decided that fuels with up to 2% alcohols and ethers (except methanol) were
"substantially similar" to 1974 unleaded gasoline, and thus were not "new"
gasoline additives. That level was increased to 2.7 wt% in 1991. Some other
oxygenates have also been granted waivers, eg ethanol to 3.5 wt% in
1979/1982, and tert-butyl alcohol to 3.5 wt% in 1981. <p>
<h3>
4.11 What are the effects of the specified fuel properties?
</h3>
<i>Volatility</i> <p>
This affects evaporative emissions and driveability, it is the property that
must change with location and season. Fuel for mid-summer Arizona would be
difficult to use in mid-winter Alaska. The US is divided into zones,
according to altitude and seasonal temperatures, and the fuel volatility is
adjusted accordingly. Incorrect fuel may result in difficult starting in
cold weather, carburetter icing, vapour lock in hot weather, and crankcase
oil dilution. Volatility is controlled by distillation and vapour pressure
specifications. The higher boiling fractions of the gasoline have significant
effects on the emission levels of undesirable hydrocarbons and aldehydes,
and a reduction of 40C in the final boiling point will reduce the levels of
benzene, butadiene, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde by 25%, and will reduce
HC emissions by 20% [28].<p>

<i>Combustion Characteristics
</i><p>
As gasolines contain mainly hydrocarbons, the only significant variable
between different grades is the octane rating of the fuel, as most other
properties are similar. Octane is discussed in detail in Section 6. There
are only slight differences in combustion temperatures ( most are around
2000C in isobaric adiabatic combustion [29]). Note that the actual
temperature in the combustion chamber is also determined by other factors,
such as load and engine design. The addition of oxygenates changes the
pre-flame reaction pathways, and also reduces the energy content of the fuel.
The levels of oxygen in the fuel is regulated according to regional air
quality standards.<p>

<i>Stability<p>
</i>Motor gasolines may be stored up to six months, consequently they must not
form gums which may precipitate. Gums are usually the result of
copper-catalysed reactions of the unsaturated HCs, so antioxidants and metal
deactivators are added. Existent Gum is used to measure the gum in the fuel
at the time tested, whereas the Oxidation Stability measures the time it
takes for the gasoline to break down at 100C with 100psi of oxygen. A 240
minutes test period has been found to be sufficient for most storage and
distribution systems.<p>

<i>Corrosiveness<p>
</i>Sulfur in the fuel creates corrosion, and when combusted will form corrosive
gases that attack the engine, exhaust and environment. Sulfur also adversely
affects the alkyl lead octane response and may poison exhaust catalysts. The
copper strip corrosion test and the sulfur specification are used to ensure
fuel quality. The copper strip test measures active sulfur, whereas the
sulfur content reports the total sulfur present.<p>

<h3>4.12 Are brands different?
</h3>
Yes. The above specifications are intended to ensure minimal quality
standards are maintained, however as well as the fuel hydrocarbons, the
manufacturers add their own special ingredients to provide additional
benefits. A quality gasoline additive package would include:-<p>
<UL>
<LI>octane-enhancing additives ( improve octane ratings )
<LI>anti-oxidants ( inhibit gum formation, improve stability )
<LI>metal deactivators ( inhibit gum formation, improve stability )
<LI>deposit modifiers ( reduce deposits, spark-plug fouling and
  preignition )
<LI>surfactants ( prevent icing, improve vaporisation, inhibit deposits,
  reduce NOx emissions )
<LI>freezing point depressants ( prevent icing )
<LI>corrosion inhibitors ( prevent gasoline corroding storage tanks )
<LI>dyes ( product colour for safety or regulatory purposes ).
</UL>
During the 1980s significant problems with deposits accumulating on intake
valve surfaces occurred as new fuel injections systems were introduced.
These intake valve deposits (IVD) were different to the injector deposits,
in part because the valve can reach 300C. Engine design changes that prevent
deposits usually consist of ensuring the valve is flushed with liquid
gasoline, and provision of adequate valve rotation. Gasoline factors that
cause deposits are the presence of alcohols or olefins. Gasoline
manufacturers now routinely use additives that prevent IVD and also maintain
the cleanliness of injectors. These usually include a surfactant and light
oil to maintain the wetting of important surfaces. A more detailed
description of additives is provided in Section 9.1.<p>

Texaco demonstrated that a well-formulated package could improve fuel
economy, reduce NOx emissions, and restore engine performance because, as
well as the traditional liquid-phase deposit removal, some additives can
work in the vapour phase to remove existing engine deposits without
adversely affecting performance ( as happens when water is poured into a
running engine to remove carbon deposits:-) )[30]. Most suppliers of quality
gasolines will formulate similar additives into their products, and cheaper
lines are less like to have such additives added. As different brands use
different additives and oxygenates, it is probable that important parameters,
such as octane distribution, are different, even though the pump octane
ratings are the same. <p>

So, if you know your car is well-tuned, and in good condition, but the
driveability is pathetic on the correct octane, try another brand. Remember
that the composition will change with the season, so if you lose
driveability, try yet another brand. As various Clean Air Act changes are
introduced over the next few years, gasoline will continue to change.
<h3>
4.13 What is a typical composition?
</h3>
There seems to be a perception that all gasolines of one octane grade are
chemically similar, and thus general rules can be promulgated about "energy
content ", "flame speed", "combustion temperature" etc. etc.. Nothing is
further from the truth. The behaviour of manufactured gasolines in octane
rating engines can be predicted, using previous octane ratings of special
blends intended to determine how a particular refinery stream responds to an
octane-enhancing additive. Refiners can design and reconfigure refineries to
efficiently produce a wide range of gasolines feedstocks, depending on
market and regulatory requirements.<p>

The last 10 years of various compositional changes to gasolines for
environmental and health reasons have resulted in fuels that do not follow
historical rules, and the regulations mapped out for the next decade also
ensure the composition will remain in a state of flux. The reformulated
gasoline specifications, especially the 1/May/1997 Complex model, will
probably introduce major reductions in the distillation range, as well as
the various limits on composition and emissions.<p>

I'm not going to list all 500+ HCs in gasolines, but the following are
representative of the various classes typically present in a gasoline. The
numbers after each chemical are:- Research Blending Octane : Motor Blending
Octane : Boiling Point (C): Density (g/ml @ 15C) : Minimum Autoignition
Temperature (C). It is important to realise that the Blending Octanes are
derived from a 20% mix of the HC with a 60:40 iC8:nC7 base, and the
extrapolation of this 20% to 100%. This is different from rating the pure
fuel, which often requires adjustment of the test engine conditions outside
the acceptable limits of the rating methods. Generally the actual octanes of
the pure fuel are similar for the alkanes, but are up to 30 octane numbers
lower than the blending octanes for the aromatics and olefins [31].  <p>

A traditional composition I have dreamed up would be like the following,
whereas newer oxygenated fuels reduce the aromatics and olefins, narrow the
boiling range, and add oxygenates up to about 12-15% to provide the octane.<p>

There are some other properties of oxygenates that have to be considered
when they are going to be used as fuels, particularly their ability to
form very volatile azeotropes that cause the fuel's vapour pressure to
increase, the chemical nature of the emissions, and their tendency to
separate into a separate water/oxygenate phase when water is present.
The reformulated gasolines address these problems more successfully than
the original oxygenated gasolines.<p>

Before you rush out to make a highly aromatic or olefinic gasoline to
produce a high octane fuel, remember they have other adverse properties,
eg the aromatics attack elastomers and generate smoke, and the olefins are
unstable ( besides smelling foul ) and form gums. The art of correctly
formulating a gasoline that does not cause engines to knock apart, does not
cause vapour lock in summer - but is easy to start in winter, does not form
gums and deposits, burns cleanly without soot/residues, and does not dissolve
or poison the car catalyst or owner, is based on knowledge of the gasoline
composition.<p>
<h3>
4.14 Is gasoline toxic or carcinogenic?
</h3>
There are several known toxins in gasoline, some of which are confirmed
human carcinogens. The most famous of these toxins are lead and benzene, and
both are regulated. The other aromatics and some toxic olefins are also
controlled. Lead alkyls also require ethylene dibromide and/or ethylene
dichloride scavengers to be added to the gasoline, both of which are
suspected human carcinogens. In 1993 an International Symposium on the Health
Effects of Gasoline was held [32]. Major review papers on the carcinogenic,
neurotoxic, reproductive and developmental toxicity of gasoline, additives,
and oxygenates were presented. The oxygenates are also being evaluated for
carcinogenicity, and even ethanol and ETBE may be carcinogens. It should
be noted that the oxygenated gasolines were not expected to reduce the
toxicity of the emissions, however the reformulated gasolines will produce
different emissions, and specific toxins must be reduced by 15% all year.<p>

There is little doubt that gasoline is full of toxic chemicals, and should
therefore be treated with respect. However the biggest danger remains the
flammability, and the relative hazards should always be kept in perspective.
The major toxic risk from gasolines comes from breathing the tailpipe,
evaporative, and refuelling emissions, rather than occasional skin contact
from spills. Breathing vapours and skin contact should always be minimised.<p>
<h3>
4.15 Is unleaded gasoline more toxic than leaded?
</h3>
The short answer is no. However that answer is not global, as some countries
have replaced the lead compound octane-improvers with aromatic or olefin
octane-improvers without introducing exhaust catalysts. Some aromatics are
more toxic that paraffins. Unfortunately, the manufacturers of alkyl lead
compounds have embarked on a worldwide misinformation campaign in countries
considering emulating the lead-free US. The use of lead precludes the use of
exhaust catalysts, thus the emissions of aromatics are only slightly
diminished, and other pollutants can not reduced by exhaust catalysts. <p>

The use of unleaded on modern vehicles with engine management systems and
catalysts can reduce aromatic emissions to 10% of the level of vehicles
without catalysts [33]. Alkyl lead additives can only substitute for some of
the aromatics in gasoline, consequently they do not eliminate aromatics,
which will produce benzene emissions [34]. Alkyl lead additives also require
toxic organohalogen scavengers, which also react in the engine to form and
emit other organohalogens, including highly toxic dioxin [35]. Leaded fuels
emit lead, organohalogens, and much higher levels of regulated toxins
because they preclude the use of exhaust catalysts. In the USA the gasoline
composition is being changed to reduce fuel toxins ( olefins, aromatics )
as well as emissions of specific toxins. <p>

Subject: 5. Why is Gasoline Composition Changing?</b><p>
5.1  Why pick on cars and gasoline?
</h3>
Cars emit several pollutants as combustion products out the tailpipe,
(tailpipe emissions), and as losses due to evaporation (evaporative
emissions, refuelling emissions). The volatile organic carbon (VOC)
emissions from these sources, along with nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions
from the tailpipe, will react in the presence of ultraviolet light
(wavelengths of less than 430nm) to form ground-level (tropospheric) ozone,
which is one of the major components of photochemical smog [36]. Smog has
been a major pollution problem ever since coal-fired power stations were
developed in urban areas, but their emissions are being cleaned up. Now it's
the turn of the automobile.<p>

Cars currently use gasoline that is derived from fossil fuels, thus when
gasoline is burned to completion, it produces additional CO2 that is added
to the atmospheric burden. The effect of the additional CO2 on the global
environment is not known, but the quantity of man-made emissions of fossil
fuels must cause the system to move to a new equilibrium. Even if current
research doubles the efficiency of the IC engine/gasoline combination, and
reduces HC, CO, NOx, SOx, VOCs, particulates, and carbonyls, the amount of
carbon dioxide from the use of fossil fuels may still cause global warming.
More and more scientific evidence is accumulating that warming is occurring
[37]. The issue is whether it is natural, or induced by human activities.
There are international agreements to limit CO2 emissions to 1990 levels,
a target that will require more efficient, lighter, or appropriately-sized
vehicles, - if we are to maintain the current usage. One option is to use
"renewable" fuels in place of fossil fuels. Consider the amount of
energy-related CO2 emissions for selected countries in 1990 [38].<p>

The number of new vehicles provides an indication of the magnitude of the

The USA consumption of gasoline increased from 294.4 (1982) to 335.6 (1989)
then dipped to 324.2 (1991), and has continued to rise since then to reach
335.6 million tonnes in 1993. In 1993 the total world production of crude oil
was 3164.8 million tonnes, of which the USA consumed 787.5 million tonnes
[40]. Transport is a very significant user of crude oil products, thus
improving the efficiency of utilisation, and minimising pollution from
vehicles, can produce immediate reductions in emissions of CO2, HCs, VOCs,
CO, NOx, carbonyls, and other chemicals. <p>
<h3>
5.2  Why are there seasonal changes?
</h3>
Only gaseous hydrocarbons burn, consequently if the air is cold, then the
fuel has to be very volatile. But when summer comes, a volatile fuel can
boil and cause vapour lock, as well as producing high levels of evaporative
emissions. The solution was to adjust the volatility of the fuel according
to altitude and ambient temperature. This volatility change has been
automatically performed for decades by the oil companies without informing
the public of the changes. It is one reason why storage of gasoline through
seasons is not a good idea. Gasoline volatility is being reduced as modern
engines, with their fuel injection and management systems, can automatically
compensate for some of the changes in ambient conditions - such as altitude
and air temperature, resulting in acceptable driveability using less volatile
fuel.<p>
<h3>
5.3  Why were alkyl lead compounds removed?
</h3>
" With the exception of one premium gasoline marketed on the east coast
and southern areas of the US, all automotive gasolines from the mid-1920s
until 1970 contained lead antiknock compounds to increase antiknock quality.
Because lead antiknock compounds were found to be detrimental to the
performance of catalytic emission control system then under development,
U.S. passenger car manufacturers in 1971 began to build engines designed to
operate satisfactorily on gasolines of nominal 91 Research Octane Number.
Some of these engines were designed to operate on unleaded fuel while others
required leaded fuel or the occasional use of leaded fuel. The 91 RON was
chosen in the belief that unleaded gasoline at this level could be made
available in quantities required using then current refinery processing
equipment. Accordingly, unleaded and low-lead gasolines were introduced
during 1970 to supplement the conventional gasolines already available.<p>

Beginning with the 1975 model year, most new car models were equipped
with catalytic exhaust treatment devices as one means of compliance with
the 1975 legal restrictions in the U.S. on automobile emissions. The need
for gasolines that would not adversely affect such catalytic devices has
led to the large scale availability and growing use of unleaded gasolines,
with all late-model cars requiring unleaded gasoline."[41].<p>

There was a further reason why alkyl lead compounds were subsequently
reduced, and that was the growing recognition of the highly toxic nature of
the emissions from a leaded-gasoline fuelled engine. Not only were toxic
lead emissions produced, but the added toxic lead scavengers ( ethylene
dibromide and ethylene dichloride ) could react with hydrocarbons to produce
highly toxic organohalogen emissions such as dioxin. Even if catalysts were
removed, or lead-tolerant catalysts discovered, alkyl lead compounds would
remain banned because of their toxicity and toxic emissions [42].
<h3>
5.4  Why are evaporative emissions a problem?
</h3>
As tailpipe emissions are reduced due to improved exhaust emission control
systems, the hydrocarbons produced by evaporation of the gasoline during
distribution, vehicle refuelling, and from the vehicle, become more and
more significant. A recent European study found that 40% of man-made
volatile organic compounds came from vehicles [43]. Many of the problem
hydrocarbons are the aromatics and olefins that have relatively high octane
values. Any sensible strategy to reduce smog and toxic emissions will attack
evaporative and tailpipe emissions. <p>

The health risks to service station workers, who are continuously exposed
to refuelling emissions remain a concern [44]. Vehicles will soon be
required to trap the refuelling emissions in larger carbon canisters, as
well as the normal evaporative emissions that they already capture. This
recent decision went in favour of the oil companies, who were opposed by the
auto companies. The automobile manufacturers felt the service station
should trap the emissions. The activated carbon canisters adsorb organic
vapours, and these are subsequently desorbed from the canister and burnt in
the engine during normal operation, once certain vehicle speeds and coolant
temperatures are reached. A few activated carbons used in older vehicles
do not function efficiently with oxygenates.<p>
<h3>
5.5  Why control tailpipe emissions?
</h3>
Tailpipe emissions were responsible for the majority of pollutants in the
late 1960s after the crankcase emissions had been controlled. Ozone levels
in the Los Angeles basin reached 450-500ppb in the early 1970s, well above
the typical background of 30-50ppb [45].<p>

Tuning a carburetted engine can only have a marginal effect on pollutant
levels, and there still had to be some frequent, but long-term, assessment
of the state of tuning. Exhaust catalysts offered a post-engine solution
that could ensure pollutants were converted to more benign compounds. As
engine management systems and fuel injection systems have developed, the
volatility properties of the gasoline have been tuned to minimise
evaporative emissions, and yet maintain low exhaust emissions.<p>

The design of the engine can have very significant effects on the type and
quantity of pollutants, eg unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust originate
mainly from combustion chamber crevices, such as the gap between the piston
and cylinder wall, where the combustion flame can not completely use the HCs.
The type and amount of unburned hydrocarbons are related to the fuel
composition (volatility, olefins, aromatics, final boiling point), as well
as state of tune, engine condition, and age/condition of the engine
lubricating oil [46]. Particulate emissions, especially the size fraction
smaller than ten micrometres, are a serious health concern. The current
major source is from compression ignition ( CI = diesel ) engines, and the
modern SI engine system has no problem meeting regulatory requirements.<p>

The ability of reformulated gasolines to actually reduce smog has not yet
been confirmed. The composition changes will reduce some compounds, and
increase others, making predictions of environmental consequences extremely
difficult. Planned future changes, such as the CAA 1997 Complex model
specifications, that are based on several major ongoing government/industry
gasoline and emission research programmes, are more likely to provide
unambiguous environmental improvements. The rules for tailpipe emissions
will continue to become more stringent as countries try to minimise local
problems ( smog, toxins etc.) and global problems ( CO2 ). Reformulation
does not always lower all emissions, as evidenced by the following aldehydes
from an engine with an adaptive learning management
system [33]. <p>

It's also worth noting that exhaust catalysts also emit platinum, and the
soluble platinum salts are some of the most potent sensitizers known.
Early research [49] reported the presence of 10% water-soluble platinum in
the emissions, however later work on monolithic catalysts has determined the
quantities of water soluble platinum emissions are negligible [50]. The
particle size of the emissions has also been determined, and the emissions
have been correlated with increasing vehicle speed. Increasing speed also
increases the exhaust gas temperature and velocity, indicating the emissions
are probably a consequence of physical attrition.<p>

Using the estimated fuel consumption, and about 10m3 of exhaust gas per
litre of gasoline, the emissions are 2-40ng/km. These are 2-3 orders
of magnitude lower than earlier reported work on pelletised catalysts.
These emissions may be controlled directly in the future. They are currently
indirectly controlled by the cost of platinum, and the new requirement for
the catalyst to have an operational life of at least 100,000 miles.<p>
<h3>
5.6  Why do exhaust catalysts influence fuel composition?
</h3>
Modern adaptive learning engine management systems control the combustion
stoichiometry by monitoring various ambient and engine parameters, including
exhaust gas recirculation rates, the air flow sensor, and exhaust oxygen
sensor outputs, This closed loop system using the oxygen sensor can
compensate for changes in fuel content and air density. The oxygen sensor
is also known as the lambda sensor, because the stoichiometric mass Air/Fuel
ratio is known as lambda. Typical stoichiometric air/fuel ratios are [51]:- <p>
<pre>
 6.4  methanol
 9.0  ethanol
11.7  MTBE
12.1  ETBE, TAME
14.6  gasoline without oxygenates
</pre>
The engine management system rapidly switches the stoichiometry between
slightly rich and slightly lean, except under wide open throttle conditions
- when the system runs open loop. The  response of the oxygen sensor to
composition changes is about 3 ms, and closed loop switching is typically
1-3 times a second, going between 50mV ( lambda = 1.05 (Lean)) to  900mV
(lambda = 0.99 ( Rich)). The catalyst oxidises about 80% of the H2, CO,
and HCs, and reduces the NOx [47]. <p>
<pre>
Typical reactions that occur in a modern 3-way catalyst are:-
                2H2 + O2  ->  2H2O
                2CO + O2  ->  2CO2
    CxHy + (x + (y/4))O2  ->  xCO2 + (y/2)H2O
               2CO + 2NO  ->  N2 + 2CO2
   CxHy + 2(x + (y/4))NO  ->  (x + (y/4))N2 + (y/2)H2O + xCO2
               2H2 + 2NO  ->  N2 + 2H2O
                CO + H20  ->  CO2 + H2
             CxHy + xH2O  ->  xCO + (x + (y/2))H2
</pre>
The use of exhaust catalysts have resulted in reaction pathways that can
accidentally be responsible for increased pollution. An example is the
CARB-mandated reduction of fuel sulfur. A change from 450ppm to 50ppm, which
will reduce HC & CO emissions by 20%, may increase formaldehyde by 45% [19]. <p>

The requirement that the exhaust catalysts must now endure for 10 years or
100,000 miles will also encourage automakers to push for lower levels of
known catalyst "poisons" such as sulfur and phosphorus in both the gasoline
and lubricant. Modern catalysts are unable to reduce the relatively high
levels of NOx that are produced during lean operation down to approved
levels, thus preventing the application of lean-burn engine technology.
Recently Mazda has announced they have developed a "lean burn" catalyst,
which may enable automakers to move the fuel combustion towards the lean
side, and different gasoline properties may be required to optimise the
combustion and reduce pollution. Mazda claim that fuel efficiency is
improved by 5-8% while meeting all emission regulations [52] . <p>

Catalysts also inhibit the selection of gasoline octane-improving and
cleanliness additives ( such as MMT and phosphorus-containing additives )
that may result in refractory compounds known to physically coat the
catalyst and increase pollution. <p>
<h3>
5.7  Why are "cold start" emissions so important?
</h3>
The catalyst requires heat to reach the temperature ( >300-350C ) where it
functions most efficiently, and the delay until it reaches operating
temperature can produce more hydrocarbons than would be produced during
the remainder of many typical urban short trips. It has been estimated that
70-80% of the non-methane HCs that escape conversion by the catalysts
are emitted during the first two minutes after a cold start. As exhaust
emissions have been reduced, the significance of the evaporative emissions
increases. Several engineering techniques are being developed, including the
Ford Exhaust Gas Igniter ( uses a flame to heat the catalyst - lots of
potential problems ), zeolite hydrocarbon traps, and relocation of the
catalyst closer to the engine [47]. <p>

Reduced gasoline volatility and composition changes, along with cleanliness
additives and engine management systems, can help minimise cold start
emissions, but currently the most effective technique appears to be rapid,
deliberate heating of the catalyst, and the new generation of low thermal
inertia  "fast light-up" catalysts reduce the problem, but further research
is necessary [53].<p>

As the evaporative emissions are also starting to be reduced, the emphasis
has shifted to the refuelling emissions. These will be mainly controlled
on the vehicle, and larger canisters may be used to trap the vapours emitted
during refuelling. <p>
<h3>
5.8  When will the emissions be "clean enough"?
</h3>
The California ZEV regulations effectively preclude IC vehicles, because
they stipulate zero emissions. However, the concept of regulatory forcing
of alternative vehicle propulsion technology may have to be modified to
include hybrid or fuel-cell vehicles, as the major failing of EVs remains
the lack of a cheap, light, safe, and  easily-rechargeable electrical
storage device [54,55]. There are several major projects intending to
further reduce emissions from automobiles, mainly focusing on vehicle mass
and engine fuel efficiency, but gasoline specifications and alternative
fuels are also being investigated. It may be that changes to IC engines and
gasolines will enable the IC engine to continue well into the 21st century
as the prime motive force for personal transportation. <p>
<h3>
5.9  Why are only some gasoline compounds restricted?
</h3>
The less volatile hydrocarbons in gasoline are not released in significant
quantities during normal use, and the more volatile alkanes are considerably
less toxic than many other chemicals encountered daily. The newer gasoline
additives also have potentially undesirable properties before they are even
combusted. Most hydrocarbons are very insoluble in water, with the lower
aromatics being the most soluble, however the addition of oxygen to
hydrocarbons significantly increases the mutual solubility with water.<p>

</pre>
The concentrations and ratios of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes
( BTEX ) in water are often used to monitor groundwater contamination from
gasoline storage tanks or pipelines. The oxygenates and other new additives
may increase the extent of water and soil pollution by acting as co-solvents
for HCs. <p>

Various government bodies ( EPA, OSHA, NIOSH ) are charged with ensuring
people are not exposed to unacceptable chemical hazards, and maintain
ongoing research into the toxicity of liquid gasoline contact, water and soil
pollution, evaporative emissions, and tailpipe emissions [56]. As toxicity
is found, the quantities in gasoline of the specific chemical ( benzene ),
or family of chemicals ( alkyl leads, aromatics, olefins ) are regulated.<p>

The recent dramatic changes caused by the need to reduce alkyl leads,
halogens, olefins, aromatics has resulted in whole new families of compounds
( ethers, alcohols ) being introduced into fuels without prior detailed
toxicity studies being completed. If adverse results appear, these compounds
are also likely to be regulated to protect people and the environment. <p>

Also, as the chemistry of emissions is unravelled, the chemical precursors
to toxic tailpipe emissions ( such as higher aromatics that produce benzene
emissions ) are also controlled, even if they are not toxic.<p>
<h3>
5.10 What does "renewable" fuel/oxygenate mean?
</h3>
The general definition of "renewable" is that the carbon originates from
recent biomass, and thus does not contribute to the increased CO2 emissions.
A truly "long-term" view could claim that fossil fuels are "renewable" on a
100 million year timescale :-). There is currently a major battle between
the ethanol/ETBE lobby ( agricultural, corn growing ), and the methanol/MTBE
lobby ( oil company, petrochemical ) over an EPA mandate demanding that a
specific percentage of the oxygenates in gasoline are produced from
"renewable" sources [57].  <p>

Unfortunately, "renewable" ethanol is not cost competitive when crude oil
is $18/bbl, so a federal subsidy ( $0.54/US Gallon ) and additional state
subsidies ( 11 states - from $0.08(Michigan) to $0.66(Tenn.)/US Gal.) are
provided. A judgement on the use of "renewable" oxygenates is expected in
early 1995.<p>
<h3>
5.11 Will oxygenated gasoline damage my vehicle?
</h3>
The following comments assume that your vehicle was designed to operate on
unleaded, if not, then damage like valve seat recession may also occur.
Damage should not occur if the gasoline is correctly formulated, and you
select the appropriate octane, but oxygenated gasoline will hurt your pocket.
In the first year of mandated oxygenates, it appears some refiners did not
carefully formulate their oxygenated gasoline, and driveability and emissions
problems occurred. Most reputable brands are now carefully formulated.
Some older activated carbon canisters may not function efficiently with
oxygenated gasolines, but this is a function of the type of carbon used.
How your vehicle responds to oxygenated gasoline depends on the engine
management system and state of tune. A modern system will automatically
compensate for all of the currently-permitted oxygenate levels, thus your
fuel consumption will increase. Older, poorly-maintained, engines may
require a tune up to maintain acceptable driveability.<p>

Be prepared to try several different brands of reformulated gasolines to
identify the most suitable brand for your vehicle, and be prepared to change
again with the seasons. This is because the refiners can choose the
oxygenate they use to meet the regulations, and may choose to set some fuel
properties, such as volatility, differently to their competitors. <p>

Most stories of corrosion etc, are derived from anhydrous methanol corrosion
of light metals (aluminum, magnesium), however the addition of either 0.5%
water to pure methanol, or corrosion inhibitors to methanol/gasoline blends
will prevent this. If you observe corrosion, talk to your gasoline supplier.
Oxygenated fuels may either swell or shrink some elastomers on older cars,
depending on the aromatic and olefin content of the fuels. Cars later than
1990 should not experience compatibility problems, and cars later than 1994
should not experience driveability problems, but they will experience
increased fuel consumption, depending on the state of tune and engine
management system.  <p>
<h3>
5.12 What does "reactivity" of emissions mean?
</h3>
The traditional method of exhaust regulations was to specify the actual HC,
CO, NOx, and particulate contents. With the introduction of oxygenates and
reformulated gasolines, the volatile organic carbon (VOC) species in the
exhaust also changed. The "reactivity" refers to the ozone-forming potential
of the VOC emissions when they react with NOx, and is being introduced as a
regulatory means of ensuring that automobile emissions do actually reduce
smog formation. The ozone-forming potential of chemicals is defined as the
number of molecules of ozone formed per VOC carbon atom, and this is called
the Incremental Reactivity. Typical values ( big is bad :-) ) are [45]:<p>

<h3>
5.13 What are "carbonyl" compounds?
</h3>
Carbonyls are produced in large amounts under lean operating conditions,
especially when oxygenated fuels are used. Most carbonyls are toxic, and the
carboxylic acids can corrode metals. The emission of carbonyls can be
controlled by combustion stoichiometry and exhaust catalysts.  <p>
Typical carbonyls are:-<p>
<UL>
<LI>aldehydes ( containing -CHO ),
  <UL>
	<LI>formaldehyde (HCHO) - which is formed in large amounts during lean
                          combustion of methanol [58].
	<LI>acetaldehyde (CH2CHO) - which is formed during ethanol combustion.
	<LI>acrolein (CH2=CHCHO) - a very potent irritant.
  </UL>
<LI>ketones ( containing C=0 ),
<LI>acetone (CH3COCH3)
<LI>carboxylic acids ( containing -COOH ),

	<LI>formic acid (HCOOH) - formed during lean methanol combustion.
	<LI>acetic acid (CH3COOH).

<h3>
5.14 What are "gross polluters"?
</h3>
It has always been known that the EPA emissions tests do not reflect real
world conditions. There have been several attempts to identify vehicles on
the road that do not comply with emissions standards. Recent remote sensing
surveys have demonstrated that the highest 10% of CO emitters produce over
50% of the pollution, and the same ratio applies for the HC emitters - which
may not be the same vehicles [59,60,61]. 20% of the CO emitters are
responsible for 80% of the CO emissions, consequently modifying gasoline
composition is only one aspect of pollution reduction. The new additives can
help maintain engine condition, but they can not compensate for out-of-tune,
worn, or tampered-with engines.<p>

The most famous of these remote sensing systems is the FEAT ( Fuel Efficiency
Automobile Test ) team from the University of Denver [62]. This team is
probably the world leader in remote sensing of auto emissions to identify
grossly polluting vehicles. The system measures CO/CO2 ratio, and the
HC/CO2 ratio in the exhaust of vehicles passing through an infra-red light
beam crossing the road 25cm above the surface. The system also includes a
video system that records the licence plate, date, time, calculated exhaust
CO, CO2, and HC. The system is effective for traffic lanes up to 18 metres
wide, however rain, snow, and water spray can cause scattering of the beam.
Reference signals monitor such effects and, if possible, compensate. The
system has been comprehensively validated, including using vehicles with
on-board emissions monitoring instruments.<p>

They can monitor up to 1000 vehicles an hour and, as an example,they were
invited to Provo, Utah to monitor vehicles, and gross polluters would be
offered free repairs [63]. They monitored over 10,000 vehicles and mailed
114 letters to owners of vehicles newer than 1965 that had demonstrated high
CO levels. They received 52 responses and repairs started in Dec 1991, and
continued to Mar 1992. They offered to purchase two vehicles at blue book
price.  They were declined, and so attempted to modify those vehicles, even
though their condition did not justify the expense. <p>

As observed elsewhere, over half the CO was emitted by about 10% of the
vehicles. If the 47 worst polluting vehicles were removed, that achieves
more than removing the 2,500 lowest emitting vehicles from the total tested
fleet.<p>

Surveys of vehicle populations have demonstrated that emissions systems had
been tampered with on over 40% of the gross polluters, and an additional 20%
had defective emission control equipment [64]. No matter what changes are
made to gasoline, if owners "tune" their engines for power, then the majority
of such "tuned" vehicle will become gross polluters. Professional repairs to
gross polluters usually improves fuel consumption, resulting in a low cost to
owners ( $32/pa/Ton CO year ). The removal of CO in the Provo example above
was costed at $200/Ton CO, compared to Inspection and Maintenance programs
($780/Ton CO ), and oxygenates ( $1034-$1264/Ton CO in Colorado 1991-2 ), and
UNOCALs vehicle scrapping programme ( $1025/Ton of all pollutants ).<p>

Thus, identifying and repairing or removing gross polluters can be far more
cost-effective than playing around with reformulated gasolines and
oxygenates.

6.1  Who invented Octane Ratings?
</h3>
Since 1912 the spark ignition internal combustion engine's compression ratio
had been constrained by the unwanted "knock" that could rapidly destroy
engines. "Knocking" is a very good description of the sound heard from an
engine using fuel of too low octane. The engineers had blamed the "knock"
on the battery ignition system that was added to cars along with the
electric self-starter. The engine developers knew that they could improve
power and efficiency if knock could be overcome. <p>

Kettering assigned Thomas Midgley, Jr. to the task of finding the exact
cause of knock [16]. They used a Dobbie-McInnes manograph to demonstrate
that the knock did not arise from preignition, as was commonly supposed, but
arose from a violent pressure rise _after_ ignition. The manograph was not
suitable for further research, so Midgley and Boyd developed a high-speed
camera to see what was happening. They also developed a "bouncing pin"
indicator that measured the amount of knock [7]. Ricardo had developed an
alternative concept of HUCF ( Highest Useful Compression Ratio ) using a
variable-compression engine. His numbers were not absolute, as there were
many variables, such as ignition timing, cleanliness, spark plug position,
engine temperature. etc.<p>

In 1926 Graham Edgar suggested using two hydrocarbons that could be produced
in sufficient purity and quantity [9]. These were "normal heptane", that
was already obtainable in sufficient purity from the distillation of Jeffrey
pine oil, and " an octane, named 2,4,4-trimethyl pentane " that he first
synthesized. Today we call it " iso-octane " or 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane. The
octane had a high anti-knock value, and he suggested using the ratio of the
two as a reference fuel number. He demonstrated that all the commercially-
available gasolines could be bracketed between 60:40 and 40:60 parts by
volume heptane:iso-octane.<p>

The reason for using normal heptane and iso-octane was because they both
have similar volatility properties, specifically boiling point, thus the
varying ratios 0:100 to 100:0 should not exhibit large differences in
volatility that could affect the rating test.<p>

Having decided on standard reference fuels, a whole range of engines and
test conditions appeared, but today the most common are the Research Octane
Number ( RON ), and the Motor Octane Number ( MON ).<p>
<h3>
6.2  Why do we need Octane Ratings?
</h3>
To obtain the maximum energy from the gasoline, the compressed fuel/air
mixture inside the combustion chamber needs to burn evenly, propagating out
from the spark plug until all the fuel is consumed. This would deliver an
optimum power stroke. In real life, a series of pre-flame reactions will
occur in the unburnt "end gases" in the combustion chamber before the flame
front arrives. If these reactions form molecules or species that can
autoignite before the flame front arrives, knock will occur [13,14].<p>

Simply put, the octane rating of the fuel reflects the ability of the
unburnt end gases to resist spontaneous autoignition under the engine test
conditions used. If autoignition occurs, it results in an extremely rapid
pressure rise, as both the desired spark-initiated flame front, and the
undesired autoignited end gas flames are expanding. The combined pressure
peak arrives slightly ahead of the normal operating pressure peak, leading
to a loss of power and eventual overheating. The end gas pressure waves are
superimposed on the main pressure wave, leading to a sawtooth pattern of
pressure oscillations that create the "knocking" sound.<p>

The combination of intense pressure waves and overheating can induce piston
failure in a few minutes. Knock and preignition are both favoured by high
temperatures, so one may lead to the other. Under high-speed conditions
knock can lead to preignition, which then accelerates engine destruction
[17].<p>
<h3>
6.3  What fuel property does the Octane Rating measure?
</h3>
The fuel property the octane ratings measure is the ability of the unburnt
end gases to spontaneously ignite under the specified test conditions.
Within the chemical structure of the fuel is the ability to withstand
pre-flame conditions without decomposing into species that will autoignite
before the flame-front arrives. Different reaction mechanisms, occurring at
various stages of the pre-flame compression stroke, are responsible for the
undesirable, easily-autoignitable, end gases.<p>

During the oxidation of a hydrocarbon fuel, the hydrogen atoms are removed
one at a time from the molecule by reactions with small radical species
(such as OH and HO2), and O and H atoms. The strength of carbon-hydrogen
bonds depends on what the carbon is connected to. Straight chain HCs such as
normal heptane have secondary C-H bonds that are significantly weaker than
the primary C-H bonds present in branched chain HCs like iso-octane [13,14].   <p>

The octane rating of hydrocarbons is determined by the structure of the
molecule, with long, straight hydrocarbon chains producing large amounts of
easily-autoignitable pre-flame decomposition species, while branched and
aromatic hydrocarbons are more resistant. This also explains why the octane
ratings of paraffins consistently decrease with carbon number. In real life,
the unburnt "end gases" ahead of the flame front encounter temperatures up
to about 700C due to piston motion and radiant and conductive heating, and
commence a series of pre-flame reactions. These reactions occur at different
thermal stages, with the initial stage ( below 400C ) commencing with the
addition of molecular oxygen to alkyl radicals, followed by the internal
transfer of hydrogen atoms within the new radical to form an unsaturated,
oxygen-containing species. These new species are susceptible to chain
branching involving the HO2 radical during the intermediate temperature
stage (400-600C), mainly through the production of OH radicals. Above 600C,
the most important reaction that produces chain branching is the reaction of
one hydrogen atom radical with molecular oxygen to form O and OH radicals.<p>

The addition of additives such as alkyl lead and oxygenates can
significantly affect the pre-flame reaction pathways. Anti-knock additives
work by interfering at different points in the pre-flame reactions, with
the oxygenates retarding undesirable low temperature reactions, and the
alkyl lead compounds react in the intermediate temperature region to
deactivate the major undesirable chain branching sequence [13,14]. <p>

The antiknock ability is related to the "autoignition temperature" of the
hydrocarbons. Antiknock ability is _not_ substantially related to:-<p>
<OL>
<LI>The energy content of fuel, this should be obvious, as oxygenates have
   lower energy contents, but high octanes.
<LI>The flame speed of the conventionally ignited mixture, this should be
   evident from the similarities of the two reference hydrocarbons.
   Although flame speed does play a minor part, there are many other factors
   that are far more important. ( such as compression ratio, stoichiometry,
   combustion chamber shape, chemical structure of the fuel, presence of
   antiknock additives, number and position of spark plugs, turbulence etc.)
   Flame speed does not correlate with octane.
</OL>
<h3>
6.4  Why are two ratings used to obtain the pump rating?
</h3>
The correct name for the (RON+MON)/2 formula is the "antiknock index",
and it remains the most important quality criteria for motorists [25].<p>

The initial octane method developed in the 1920s was the Motor Octane method
and, over several decades, a large number of octane test methods appeared.
These were variations to either the engine design, or the specified operating
conditions [65]. During the 1950-1960s attempts were made to internationally
standardise and reduce the number of Octane Rating test procedures.<p>

During the late 1930s - mid 1960s, the Research method became the important
rating because it more closely represented the octane requirements of the
motorist using the fuels/vehicles/roads then available. In the late 1960s
German automakers discovered their engines were destroying themselves on
long Autobahn runs, even though the Research Octane was within specification.
They discovered that either the MON or the Sensitivity ( the numerical
difference between the RON and MON numbers ) also had to be specified. Today
it is accepted that no one octane rating covers all use. In fact, during
1994, there have been increasing concerns in Europe about the high
Sensitivity of some commercially-available unleaded fuels.<p>

The design of the engine and car significantly affect the fuel octane
requirement for both RON and MON. In the 1930s, most vehicles would run on
the specified Research Octane fuel, almost regardless of the Motor Octane,
whereas most 1990s engines have a 'severity" of one, which means the engine
is unlikely to knock if a changes of one RON is matched by an equal and
opposite change of MON [19].<p>
<h3>
6.5  What does the Motor Octane rating measure?
</h3>
The conditions of the Motor method represent severe, sustained high speed,
high load driving. For most hydrocarbon fuels, including those with either
lead or oxygenates, the motor octane number (MON) will be lower than the
research octane number (RON).<p>

<h3>
6.7  Why is the difference called "sensitivity"?
</h3>
RON - MON = Sensitivity. Because the two test methods use different test
conditions, especially the intake mixture temperatures and engine speeds,
then a fuel that is sensitive to changes in operating conditions will have
a larger difference between the two rating methods. Modern fuels typically
have sensitivities around 10. The US 87 (RON+MON/2) unleaded gasoline is
required to have a 82+ MON, thus preventing very high sensitivity fuels [25]. <p>
<h3>
6.8  What sort of engine is used to rate fuels?
</h3>
Automotive octane ratings are determined in a special single-cylinder engine
with a variable compression ratio ( CR 4:1 to 18:1 ) known as a Cooperative
Fuels Research ( CFR ) engine. The cylinder bore is 82.5mm, the stroke is
114.3mm, giving a displacement of 612 cm3. The piston has four compression
rings, and one oil control ring. The intake valve is shrouded. The head and
cylinder are one piece, and can be moved up and down to obtain the desired
compression ratio.  The engines have a special four-bowl carburettor that
can adjust individual bowl air/fuel ratios. This facilitates rapid switching
between reference fuels and samples. A magnetorestrictive detonation sensor
in the combustion chamber measures the rapid changes in combustion chamber
pressure caused by knock, and the amplified signal is measured on a
"knockmeter" with a 0-100 scale [66,67]. A complete Octane Rating engine
system costs about $200,000 with all the services installed. Only one
company manufactures these engines, the Waukesha Engine Division of Dresser
Industries, Waukesha. WI 53186.<p>
<h3>
6.9  How is the Octane rating determined?
</h3>
To rate a fuel, the engine is set to an appropriate compression ratio that
will produce a knock of about 50 on the knockmeter for the sample when the
air/fuel ratio is adjusted on the carburettor bowl to obtain maximum knock.
Normal heptane and iso-octane are known as primary reference fuels. Two
blends of these are made, one that is one octane number above the expected
rating, and another that is one octane number below the expected rating.
These are placed in different bowls, and are also rated with each air/fuel
ratio being adjusted for maximum knock. The higher octane reference fuel
should produce a reading around 30-40, and the lower reference fuel should
produce a reading of 60-70. The sample is again tested, and if it does not
fit between the reference fuels, further reference fuels are prepared, and
the engine readjusted to obtain the required knock. The actual fuel rating
is interpolated from the knockmeter readings [66,67].  <p>
<h3>
6.10 What is the Octane Distribution of the fuel?
</h3>
The combination of vehicle and engine can result in specific requirements
for octane that depend on the fuel. If the octane is distributed differently
throughout the boiling range of a fuel, then engines can knock on one brand
of 87 (RON+MON/2), but not on another brand. This "octane distribution" is
especially important when sudden changes in load occur, such as high load,
full throttle, acceleration. The fuel can segregate in the manifold, with
the very volatile fraction reaching the combustion chamber first and, if
that fraction is deficient in octane, then knock will occur until the less
volatile, higher octane fractions arrive [17]. <p>

Some fuel specifications include delta RONs, to ensure octane distribution
throughout the fuel boiling range was consistent. Octane distribution was
seldom a problem with the alkyl lead compounds, as the tetra methyl lead
and tetra ethyl lead octane volatility profiles were well characterised, but
it can be a major problem for the new, reformulated, low aromatic gasolines,
as MTBE boils at 55C, whereas ethanol boils at 78C. Drivers have discovered
that an 87 (RON+MON/2) from one brand has to be substituted with an 89
(RON+MON/2) of another, and that is because of the combination of their
driving style, engine design, vehicle mass, fuel octane distribution, fuel
volatility, and the octane-enhancers used.<p>
<h3>
6.11 What is a "delta Research Octane number"?
</h3>
To obtain an indication of behaviour of a gasoline during any manifold
segregation, an octane rating procedure called the Distribution Octane
Number was used. The rating engine had a special manifold that allowed
the heavier fractions to be separated before they reached the combustion
chamber [17]. That method has been replaced by the "delta" RON procedure. <p>

The fuel is carefully distilled to obtain a distillate fraction that boils
to the specified temperature, which is usually 100C. Both the parent fuel
and the distillate fraction are rated on the  octane engine using the
Research Octane method [68]. The difference between these is the delta
RON(100C), usually just called the delta RON.<p>
<h3>
6.12 How do other fuel properties affect octane?
</h3>
Several other properties affect knock. The most significant determinant of
octane is the chemical structure of the hydrocarbons and their response to
the addition of octane enhancing additives. Other factors include:-<p>
<UL>
<LI><b>Front End Volatility - </b>Paraffins are the major component in gasoline, and
  the octane number decreases with increasing chain length or ring size, but
  increases with chain branching. Overall, the effect is a significant
  reduction in octane if front end volatility is lost, as can happen with
  improper or long term storage. Fuel economy on short trips can be improved
  by using a more volatile fuel, at the risk of carburettor icing and
  increased evaporative emissions.
<LI><b>Final Boiling Point.- </b>Decreases in the final boiling point increase fuel
  octane. Aviation gasolines have much lower final boiling points than
  automotive gasolines. Note that final boiling points are being reduced
  because the higher boiling fractions are responsible for disproportionate
  quantities of pollutants and toxins.

<LI><b>Preignition tendency - </b>both knock and preignition can induce each other.
</UL>
<h3>
6.13 Can higher octane fuels give me more power?
</h3>
Not if you are already using the proper octane fuel. The engine will be
already operating at optimum settings, and a higher octane should have no
effect on the management system. Your driveability and fuel economy will
remain the same. The higher octane fuel costs more, so you are just throwing
money away. If you are already using a fuel with an octane rating slightly
below the optimum, then using a higher octane fuel will cause the engine
management system to move to the optimum settings, possibly resulting in
both increased power and improved fuel economy. You may be able to change
octanes between seasons ( reduce octane in winter ) to obtain the most
cost-effective fuel without loss of driveability. <p>

Once you have identified the fuel that keeps the engine at optimum settings,
there is no advantage in moving to an even higher octane fuel. The
manufacturer's recommendation is conservative, so you may be able to
carefully reduce the fuel octane. The penalty for getting it badly wrong,
and not realising that you have, could be expensive engine damage. <p>
<h3>
6.14 Does low octane fuel increase engine wear?
</h3>
Not if you are meeting the octane requirement of the engine. If you are not
meeting the octane requirement, the engine will rapidly suffer major damage
due to knock. You must not use fuels that produce sustained audible knock,
engine damage will occur. If the octane is just sufficient, the engine
management system will move settings to a less optimal position, and the
only major penalty will be increased costs due to poor fuel economy.
Whenever possible, engines should be operated at the optimum position for
long-term reliability. Engine wear is mainly related to design,
manufacturing, maintenance and lubrication factors. Once the octane and
run-on requirements of the engine are satisfied, increased octane will have
no beneficial effect on the engine. The quality of gasoline, and the
additive package used, would be more likely to affect the rate of engine
wear, rather than the octane rating. <p>
<h3>
6.15 Can I mix different octane fuel grades?
</h3>
Yes, however attempts to blend in your fuel tank should be carefully
planned. You should not allow the tank to become empty, and then add 50% of
lower octane, followed by 50% of higher octane. The fuels may not completely
mix immediately, especially if there is a density difference. You may get a
slug of low octane that causes severe knock. You should refill when your
tank is half full. In general the octane response will be linear for most
hydrocarbon and oxygenated fuels eg 50:50 of 87 and 91 will give 89. <p>

Attempts to mix leaded high octane to unleaded high octane to obtain higher
octane are useless. The lead response of the unleaded fuel does not overcome
the dilution effect, thus 50:50 of 96 leaded and 91 unleaded will give 94.
Some blends of oxygenated fuels with ordinary gasoline can result in
undesirable increases in volatility due to volatile azeotropes, and that
some oxygenates can have negative lead responses. Also note that the octane
requirement of some engines is determined by the need to avoid run-on, not
to avoid knock.<p>
<h3>
6.16 What happens if I use the wrong octane fuel?
</h3>
If you use a fuel with an octane rating below the requirement of the engine,
the management system may move the engine settings into an area of less
efficient combustion, resulting in reduced power and reduced fuel economy.
You will be losing both money and driveability. If you use a fuel with an
octane rating higher than what the engine can use, you are just wasting
money by paying for octane that you can not utilise. Forget the stories
about higher octanes having superior additive packages - they do not. If
your vehicle does not have a knock sensor, then using an octane significantly
below the requirement means that the little men with hammers will gleefully
pummel your engine to pieces. <p>

You should initially be guided by the vehicle manufacturer's recommendations,
however you can experiment, as the variations in vehicle tolerances can
mean that Octane Number Requirement for a given vehicle model can range
over 6 Octane Numbers. Caution should be used, and remember to compensate
if the conditions change, such as carrying more people or driving in
different ambient conditions. You can often reduce the octane of the fuel
you use in winter because the temperature decrease and possible humidity
changes may significantly reduce the octane requirement of the engine.<p>

Use the octane that provides cost-effective driveability and performance,
using anything more is waste of money, and anything less could result in
an unscheduled, expensive visit to your mechanic.<p>
<h3>
6.17 Can I tune the engine to use another octane fuel?
</h3>
In general, modern engine management systems will compensate for fuel octane,
and once you have satisfied the optimum octane requirement, you are at the
optimum overall performance area of the engine map. Tuning changes to obtain
more power will probably adversely affect both fuel economy and emissions.
Unless you have access to good diagnostic equipment that can ensure
regulatory limits are complied with, it is likely that adjustments may be
regarded as illegal tampering by your local regulation enforcers. If you are
skilled, you will be able to legally wring slightly more performance from
your engine by using a dynamometer in conjunction with engine and exhaust gas
analyzers and a well-designed, retrofitted, performance engine management
chip.<p>
<h3>
6.18 How can I increase the fuel octane?
</h3>
Not simply, you can purchase additives, however these are not cost-effective
and a survey in 1989 showed the cost of increasing the octane rating of one
US gallon by one unit ranged from 10 cents ( methanol ), 50 cents (MMT),
$1.00 ( TEL ), to $3.25 ( xylenes ) [69]. It is preferable to purchase a
higher octane fuel such as racing fuel, aviation gasolines, or methanol.
Sadly, the price of chemical grade methanol has almost doubled during 1994.
If you plan to use alcohol blends, ensure your fuel handling system is
compatible, and that you only use dry gasoline by filling up early in the
morning when the storage tanks are cool. Also ensure that the service station
storage tank has not been refilled recently. Retailers are supposed to wait
several hours before bringing a refilled tank online, to allow suspended
undissolved water to settle out, but they do not always wait the full period. <p>
<h3>
6.19 Are aviation gasoline octane numbers comparable?
</h3>
Aviation gasolines were all highly leaded and graded using two numbers, with
common grades being 80/87, 100/130, and 115/145 [70]. The first number is the
Aviation rating ( aka Lean Mixture rating ), and the second number is the
Supercharge rating ( aka Rich Mixture rating ). In the 1970s a new grade,
100LL ( low lead = 0.53mlTEL/L instead of 1.06mlTEL/L) was introduced to
replace the 80/87 and 100/130. Soon after the introduction, there was a
spate of plug fouling, and high cylinder head temperatures resulting in
cracked cylinder heads [71]. The old 80/87 grade was reintroduced on a
limited scale.  The Aviation rating is determined using the automotive Motor
Octane test procedure, and then corrected to an Aviation number using a
table in the method - it's usually only 1 - 2 Octane units different to the
Motor value up to 100, but varies significant above that eg 110MON = 128AN.<p>

The second Avgas number is the Rich Mixture method Performance Number ( PN
- they are not commonly called octane numbers when they are above 100 ), and
is determined on a supercharged version of the CFR engine which has a fixed
compression ratio. The method determines the dependence of the highest
permissible power ( in terms of indicated mean effective pressure ) on
mixture strength and boost for a specific light knocking setting. The
Performance Number indicates the maximum knock-free power obtainable from a
fuel compared to iso-octane = 100. Thus, a PN = 150 indicates that an engine
designed to utilise the fuel can obtain 150% of the knock-limited power of
iso-octane at the same mixture ratio. This is an arbitrary scale based on
iso-octane + varying amounts of TEL, derived from a survey of engines
performed decades ago. Aviation gasoline PNs are rated using variations of
mixture strength to obtain the maximum knock-limited power in a supercharged
engine. This can be extended to provide mixture response curves which define
the maximum boost ( rich - about 11:1 stoichiometry ) and minimum boost
( weak about 16:1 stoichiometry ) before knock [71].<p>

The 115/145 grade is being phased out, but even the 100LL has more octane
than any automotive gasoline. <p>

<h3><b>
Subject: 7. What parameters determine octane requirement?
</b>
7.1  What is the effect of Compression ratio?
</h3>
Most people know that an increase in Compression Ratio will require an
increase in fuel octane for the same engine design. Increasing the
compression ratio increases the theoretical thermodynamic efficiency of an
engine according to the standard equation<p>
<pre>
Efficiency = 1 - (1/compression ratio)^gamma-1
</pre>
where gamma = ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and constant
volume of the working fluid ( for most purposes air is the working fluid,
and is treated as an ideal gas ). There are indications that thermal
efficiency reaches a maximum at a compression ratio of about 17:1 [15].<p>

The efficiency gains are best when the engine is at incipient knock, that's
why knock sensors ( actually vibration sensors ) are used. Low compression
ratio engines are less efficient because they can not deliver as much of the
ideal combustion power to the flywheel. For a typical carburetted engine,
without engine management [17,24]:-<p>
<pre>

     12:1                108                     35 %
</pre>
Modern engines have improved significantly on this, and the changing fuel
specifications and engine design should see more improvements, but
significant gains may have to await improved engine materials and fuels.<p>
<h3>
7.2  What is the effect of changing the air/fuel ratio?
</h3>
Traditionally, the greatest tendency to knock was near 13.5:1 air/fuel
ratio, but was very engine specific. Modern engines, with engine management
systems, now have their maximum octane requirement near to 14.5:1. For a
given engine using gasoline, the relationship between thermal efficiency,
air/fuel ratio, and power is complex. Stoichiometric combustion ( Air/Fuel
Ratio = 14.7:1 for a typical non-oxygenated gasoline ) is neither maximum
power - which occurs around A/F 12-13:1 (Rich), nor maximum thermal
efficiency - which occurs around A/F 16-18:1 (Lean). The air-fuel ratio is
controlled at part throttle by a closed loop system using the oxygen sensor
in the exhaust. Conventionally, enrichment for maximum power air/fuel ratio
is used during full throttle operation to reduce knocking while providing
better driveability [24]. If the mixture is weakened, the flame speed is
reduced, consequently less heat is converted to mechanical energy, leaving
heat in the cylinder walls and head, potentially inducing knock. It is
possible to weaken the mixture sufficiently that the flame is still present
when the inlet valve opens again, resulting in backfiring.<p>
<h3>
7.3  What is the effect of changing the ignition timing
</h3>
The tendency to knock increases as spark advance is increased, eg 2 degrees
BTDC requires 91 octane, whereas 14 degrees BTDC requires 96 octane.
If you advance the spark, the flame front starts earlier, and the end gases
start forming earlier in the cycle, providing more time for the autoigniting
species to form before the piston reaches the optimum position for power
delivery, as determined by the normal flame front propagation. It becomes a
race between the flame front and decomposition of the increasingly-squashed
end gases. High octane fuels produce end gases that take longer to
autoignite, so the good flame front reaches and consumes them properly. <p>

The ignition advance map is partly determined by the fuel the engine is
intended to use. The timing of the spark is advanced sufficiently to ensure
that the fuel/air mixture burns in such a way that maximum pressure of the
burning charge is about 15-20 degree after TDC. Knock will occur before
this point, usually in the late compression/early power stroke period.
The engine management system uses ignition timing as one of the major
variables that is adjusted if knock is detected. If very low octane fuels
are used ( several octane numbers below the vehicle's requirement at optimal
settings ), both performance and fuel economy will decrease.<p>

The actual Octane Number Requirement depends on the engine design, but for
some 1978 vehicles using standard fuels, the following (R+M)/2 Octane
Requirements were measured. "Standard" is the recommended ignition timing
for the engine, probably a few degrees before Top Dead Centre [24].<p>
<pre>
     <b>                     Basic Ignition Timing</b>
Vehicle   Retarded 5 degrees    Standard     Advanced 5 degrees
  A              88                91               93
  B              86                90.5             94.5
  C              85.5              88               90
  D              84                87.5             91
  E              82.5              87               90
</pre>
The actual ignition timing to achieve the maximum pressure from normal
combustion of gasoline will depend mainly on the speed of the engine and the
flame propagation rates in the engine. Knock increases the rate of the
pressure rise, thus superimposing additional pressure on the normal
combustion pressure rise. The knock actually rapidly resonates around the
chamber, creating a series of abnormal sharp spikes on the pressure diagram.
The normal flame speed is fairly consistent for most gasoline HCs, regardless
of octane rating, but the flame speed is affected by stoichiometry. Note that
the flame speeds in this FAQ are not the actual engine flame speeds. A 12:1
CR gasoline engine at 1500 rpm would have a flame speed of about 16.5 m/s,
and a similar hydrogen engine yields 48.3 m/s, but such engine flame speeds
are also very dependent on stoichiometry.  <p>
<h3>
7.4  What is the effect of engine management systems?
</h3>
Engine management systems are now an important part of the strategy to
reduce automotive pollution. The good news for the consumer is their ability
to maintain the efficiency of gasoline combustion, thus improving fuel
economy. The bad news is their tendency to hinder tuning for power. A very
basic modern engine system could monitor and control:- mass air flow, fuel
flow, ignition timing, exhaust oxygen ( lambda oxygen sensor ), knock
( vibration sensor ), EGR, exhaust gas temperature, coolant temperature, and
intake air temperature. The knock sensor can be either a nonresonant type
installed in the engine block and capable of measuring a wide range of knock
vibrations ( 5-15 kHz ) with minimal change in frequency, or a resonant type
that has excellent signal-to-noise ratio between 1000 and 5000 rpm [72].<p>

A modern engine management system can compensate for altitude, ambient air
temperature, and fuel octane. The management system will also control cold
start settings, and other operational parameters. There is a new requirement
that the engine management system also contain an on-board diagnostic
function that warns of malfunctions such as engine misfire, exhaust catalyst
failure, and evaporative emissions failure. The use of fuels with alcohols
such as methanol can confuse the engine management system as they generate
more hydrogen which can fool the oxygen sensor [47] .<p>

The use of fuel of too low octane can actually result in both a loss of fuel
economy and power, as the management system may have to move the engine
settings to a less efficient part of the performance map. The system retards
the ignition timing until only trace knock is detected, as engine damage
from knock is of more consequence than power and fuel economy. <p>
<h3>
7.5  What is the effect of temperature and load?
</h3>
Increasing the engine temperature, particularly the air/fuel charge
temperature, increases the tendency to knock. The Sensitivity of a fuel can
indicate how it is affected by charge temperature variations. Increasing
load increases both the engine temperature, and the end-gas pressure, thus
the likelihood of knock increases as load increases.<p>
<h3>
7.6  What is the effect of engine speed?.
</h3>
Faster engine speed means there is less time for the pre-flame reactions
in the end gases to occur, thus reducing the tendency to knock. On engines
with management systems, the ignition timing may be advanced with engine
speed and load, to obtain optimum efficiency at incipient knock. In such
cases, both high and low engines speeds may be critical.<p>
<h3>
7.7  What is the effect of engine deposits?
</h3>
A new engine may only require a fuel of 6-9 octane numbers lower than the
same engine after 25,000 km. This Octane Requirement Increase (ORI) is due to
the formation of a mixture of organic and inorganic deposits resulting from
both the fuel and the lubricant. They reach an equilibrium amount because
of flaking, however dramatic changes in driving styles can also result in
dramatic changes of the equilibrium position. When the engine starts to burn
more oil, the octane requirement can increase again. ORIs up to 12 are not
uncommon, depending on driving style [17,19]. The deposits produce the ORI
by several mechanisms:- <p>
 - they reduce the combustion chamber volume, effectively increasing the
   compression ratio.
 - they also reduce thermal conductivity, thus increasing the combustion
   chamber temperatures.
 - they catalyse undesirable pre-flame reactions that produce end gases with
   low autoignition temperatures.
<h3>
7.8  What is the Road Octane requirement of an vehicle?
</h3>
The actual octane requirements of a vehicle is called the Octane Number
Requirement ( ONR ), and is determined by using standard octane fuels that
can be blends of iso-octane and normal heptane, or commercial gasolines.
The vehicle is tested under a wide range of conditions and loads, using
different octane fuels until trace knock is detected. The conditions that
require maximum octane are not consistent, but often are full-throttle
acceleration from low starting speeds using the highest gear available. They
can even be at constant speed conditions [17]. Engine management systems
that adjust the octane requirement may also reduce the power output on low
octane fuel, resulting in increased fuel consumption. The maximum ONR is of
most interest, as that usually defines the recommended fuel.<p>

The octane rating engines do not reflect actual conditions in a vehicle,
consequently there are standard procedures for evaluating the performance
of the gasoline in an engine. The most common are:-
1. The Modified Uniontown Procedure. Full throttle accelerations are made
   from low speed using primary reference fuels. The ignition timing is
   adjusted until trace knock is detected at some stage. Several reference
   fuels are used, and a Road Octane Number v Basic Ignition timing graph is
   obtained. The fuel sample is tested, and the ignition timing setting is
   read from the graph to provide the Road Octane Number. This is a rapid
   procedure but provides minimal information.
2. The Modified Borderline Knock Procedure. The automatic spark advance is
   disabled, and a manual adjustment facility added. Accelerations are
   performed as in the Modified Uniontown Procedure, however trace knock is
   maintained throughout the run. A map of ignition advance v engine speed
   is made for several reference fuels and the sample fuels. This procedure
   can show the variation of road octane with engine speed. <p>
<h3>
7.9  What is the effect of air temperature?
</h3>
An increase in ambient air temperature of 5.6C increases the octane
requirement of an engine by 0.44 - 0.54 MON [17,24]. When the combined effects
of air temperature and humidity are considered, it is often possible to use
one octane grade in summer, and use a lower octane rating in winter. The
Motor octane rating has a higher charge temperature, and increasing charge
temperature increases the tendency to knock, so fuels with low Sensitivity
( the difference between RON and MON numbers ) are less affected by air
temperature.<p>
<h3>
7.10  What is the effect of altitude?
</h3>
The effect of increasing altitude may be nonlinear, with one study reporting
a decrease of the octane requirement of 1.4 RON/300m from sea level to 1800m
and 2.5 RON/300m from 1800m to 3600m [17]. Other studies report the octane
number requirement decreased by 1.0 - 1.9 RON/300m without specifying
altitude [24]. Modern engine management systems can accommodate this
adjustment, and in some recent studies, the octane number requirement was
0.2 - 0.5 Antiknock Index/300m. The reduction on older engines was due to:-<p>
 - reduced air density provides lower combustion temperature and pressure.
 - fuel is metered according to air volume, consequently as density decreases
   the stoichiometry moves to rich, with a lower octane number requirement.
 - manifold vacuum controlled spark advance, and reduced manifold vacuum
   results in less spark advance.
<h3>
7.11  What is the effect of humidity?.
</h3>
An increase of absolute humidity of 1.0 g water/ kg of dry air lowers the
octane requirement of an engine by 0.25 - 0.32 MON [17,24].<p>
<h3>
7.12  What does water injection achieve?.
</h3>
Water injection was used in WWII aviation engine to provide a large increase
in available power for very short periods. The injection of water does
decrease the dew point of the exhaust gases. This has potential corrosion
problems. The very high specific heat and heat of vaporisation of water
means that the combustion temperature will decrease. It has been shown that
a 10% water addition to methanol reduces the power and efficiency by about
3%, and doubles the unburnt fuel emissions, but does reduce NOx by 25% [73].
A decrease in combustion temperature will reduce the theoretical maximum
possible efficiency of an otto cycle engine that is operating correctly,
but may improve efficiency in engines that are experiencing abnormal
combustion on existing fuels.<p>

Some aviation SI engines still use boost fluids. The water/methanol mixtures
are used to provide increased power for short periods, up to 40% more -
assuming adequate mechanical strength of the engine. The 40/60 or 45/55
water/methanol mixtures are used as boost fluids for aviation engines because
water would freeze. Methanol is just "preburnt" methane, consequently it only
has about half the energy content of gasoline, but it does have a higher heat
of vaporisation, which has a significant cooling effect on the charge.
Water/methanol blends are more cost-effective than gasoline for combustion
cooling. The high Sensitivity of alcohol fuels has to be considered in the
engine design and settings.<p>

Boost fluids are used because they are far more economical than using the
fuel. When a supercharged engine has to be operated at high boost, the
mixture has to be enriched to keep the engine operating without knock. The
extra fuel cools the cylinder walls and the charge, thus delaying the onset
of knock which would otherwise occur at the associated higher temperatures.<p>

The overall effect of boost fluid injection is to permit a considerable
increase in knock-free engine power for the same combustion chamber
temperature. The power increase is obtained from the higher allowable boost.
In practice, the fuel mixture is usually weakened when using boost fluid
injection, and the ratio of the two fuel fluids is approximately 100 parts
of avgas to 25 parts of boost fluid. With that ratio, the resulting
performance corresponds to an effective uprating of the fuel of about 25%,
irrespective of its original value. Trying to increase power boosting above
40% is difficult, as the engine can drown because of excessive liquid [71].<p>

Note that for water injection to provide useful power gains, the engine
management and fuel systems must be able to monitor the knock and adjust
both stoichiometry and ignition to obtain significant benefits. Aviation
engines are designed to accommodate water injection, most automobile engines
are not. Returns on investment are usually harder to achieve on engines that
do not normal extend their performance envelope into those regions. Water
injection has been used by some engine manufacturers - usually as an
expedient way to maintain acceptable power after regulatory emissions
baggage was added to the engine, but usually the manufacturer quickly
produces a modified engine that does not require water injection.<p>

Subject: 8. How can I identify and cure other fuel-related problems?
</b>
8.1  What causes an empty fuel tank?
</h3>
<UL>
<LI>You forgot to refill it.
<LI>Your friendly neighbourhood thief "borrowed" the gasoline - the unfriendly
  one took the vehicle.
<LI>The fuel tank leaked.
<LI>Your darling child/wife/husband/partner/mother/father used the car.
<LI>The most likely reason is that your local garage switched to an oxygenated
  gasoline, and the engine management system compensated for the oxygen
  content, causing the fuel consumption to increase significantly.
</UL>
<h3>
8.2  Is knock the only abnormal combustion problem?
</h3>
No. Many of the abnormal combustion problems are induced by the same
conditions, and so one can lead to another.<p>

Preignition occurs when the air/fuel mixture is ignited prematurely by
glowing deposits or hot surfaces - such as exhaust valves and spark plugs.
If it continues, it can increase in severity and become Run-away Surface
Ignition (RSI) which prevents the combustion heat being converted into
mechanical energy, thus rapidly melting pistons. The Ricardo method uses an
electrically-heated wire in the engine to measure preignition tendency. The
scale uses iso-octane as 100 and cyclohexane as 0. <p>
Some common fuel components:-<p>
<pre>
             paraffins       50-100
             benzene           26
             toluene           93
             xylene          >100
             cyclopentane      70
             di-isobutylene    64
             hexene-2         -26
</pre>
There is no direct correlation between anti-knock ability and preignition
tendency, however high combustion chamber temperatures favour both, and so
one may lead to the other. An engine knocking during high-speed operation
will increase in temperature and that can induce preignition, and conversely
any preignition will result in higher temperatures than may induce knock.<p>

Misfire is commonly caused by either a failure in the ignition system, or
fouling of the spark plug by deposits. The most common cause of deposits
was the alkyl lead additives in gasoline, and the yellow glaze of various
lead salts was used by mechanics to assess engine tune. From the upper
recess to the tip, the composition changed, but typical compounds ( going
from cold to hot ) were PbClBr; 2PbO.PbClBr; PbO.PbSO4; 3Pb3(PO4)2.PbClBr.<p>

Run-on is the tendency of an engine to continue running after the ignition
has been switched off. It is usually caused by the spontaneous ignition of
the fuel/air mixture, rather than by surface ignition from hotspots or
deposits, as commonly believed. The narrow range of conditions for
spontaneous ignition of the fuel/air mixture ( engine speed, charge
temperature, cylinder pressure ) may be created when the engine is switched
off. The engine may refire, thus taking the conditions out of the critical
range for a couple of cycles, and then refire again, until overall cooling
of the engine drops it out of the critical region. The octane rating of the
fuel is the appropriate parameter, and it is not rare for an engine to
require a higher Octane fuel to prevent run-on than to avoid knock [17]. <p>
<h3>
8.3  Can I prevent carburetter icing?
</h3>
Yes, carburettor icing is caused by the combination of highly volatile fuel,
high humidity and low ambient temperature. The extent of cooling, caused by
the latent heat of the vaporised gasoline in the carburettor, can be as much
as 20C, perhaps dropping below the dew point of the charge. If this happens,
water will condense on the cooler carburettor surfaces, and will freeze if
the temperature is low enough. The fuel volatility can not always be reduced
to eliminate icing, so anti-icing additives are used.<p>

Two types of additive are added to gasoline to inhibit icing:- <p>
- surfactants that form a monomolecular layer over the metal parts that
  inhibits ice crystal formation. These are usually added at concentrations
  of 30-150 ppm.
- cryoscopic additives that depress the freezing point of the condensed water
  so that it does not turn to ice. Alcohols ( methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol,
  etc. ) and glycols ( hexylene glycol, dipropylene glycol ) are used at
  concentrations of 0.03% - 1%.

If you have icing problems, the addition of 100-200mls of methanol to a full
tank of dry gasoline will prevent icing under most conditions. If you believe
there is a small amount of water in the fuel tank, add 500mls of isopropanol
as the first treatment. Oxygenated gasolines using alcohols can also be used.<p>
<h3>
8.4  Should I store fuel to avoid the oxygenate season?
</h3>
No. The fuel will be from a different season, and will have significantly
different volatility properties that may induce driveability problems. You
can tune your engine to perform on oxygenated gasoline as well as it did on
traditional gasoline, however you will have increased fuel consumption due
to the useless oxygen in the oxygenates. Some engines may not initially
perform well on some oxygenated fuels, usually because of the slightly
different volatility and combustion characteristics. A good mechanic should
be able to recover any lost performance or driveability, providing the engine
is in reasonable condition. <p>
<h3>
8.5  Can I improve fuel economy by using quality gasolines?
</h3>
Yes, several manufacturers have demonstrated that their new gasoline additive
packages are more effective than traditional gasoline formulations. Texaco
claim their new vapour phase fuel additive can reduce existing deposits by
up to 30%, improve fuel economy, and reduce NOx tailpipe emissions by 15%,
when compared to other advanced liquid phase additives. These claims appear
to have been verified in independent tests [30]. Other reputable gasoline
brands will have similar additive packages in their quality products.
Quality gasolines, of whatever octane ratings, will include a full range of
gasoline additives designed to provide consistent fuel quality.<p>

Note that oxygenated gasolines must decrease fuel economy for the same power.
If your engine is initially well-tuned on hydrocarbon gasolines, the
stoichiometry will move to lean, and maximum power is slightly rich, so
either the management system ( if you have one ) or your mechanic has to
increase the fuel flow. The minor improvements in combustion efficiency that
oxygenates may provide, can not compensate for 2+% of oxygen in the fuel
that will not provide energy.         <p>
<h3>
8.6  What is "stale" fuel, and should I use it?
</h3>
"Stale" fuel is caused by improper storage, and usually smells sour. The
gasoline has been allowed to get warm, thus catalysing olefin decomposition
reactions, and perhaps also losing volatile material in unsealed containers.
Such fuel will tend to rapidly form gums, and will usually have a significant
reduction in octane rating. The fuel can be used by blending with twice the
volume of new gasoline. Some stale fuels can drop several octane numbers, so
be generous with the dilution.<p>
<h3>
8.7  How can I remove water in the fuel tank?
</h3>
If you only have a small quantity of water, then the addition of 500mls of
dry isopropanol (IPA) to a near-full 30-40 litre tank will absorb the water,
and will not significantly affect combustion. Once you have mopped up the
water with IPA. Small, regular doses of any anhydrous alcohol will help
keep the tank dry. This technique will not work if you have very large
amounts of water, and the addition of greater amounts of IPA may result in
poor driveability. <p>

Water in fuel tanks can be minimised by keeping the fuel tank near full, and
filling in the morning from a service station that allows storage tanks to
stand for several hours after refilling before using the fuel. Note that
oxygenated gasolines have greater water solubility, and should cope with
small quantities of water.<p>
<h3>
8.8  Can I used unleaded on older vehicles?
</h3>
Yes, providing the octane is appropriate. There are some older engines that
cut the valve seats directly into the cylinder head ( eg BMC minis ). The
absence of lead, which lubricated the valve seat, causes the very hard
oxidation products of the valve to wear down the seat. This valve seat
recession is usually corrected by installing seat inserts. Most other
problems arise because the fuels have different volatility, or the reduction
of combustion chamber deposits. These can usually be cured by reference to
the vehicle manufacturer, who will probably have a publication with the
changes. Some vehicles will perform as well on unleaded with a slightly
lower octane than recommended leaded fuel, due to the significant reduction
in deposits from modern unleaded gasolines.<p>

<hr>
<h3>
<b>
Section: 9. Alternative Fuels and Additives
</b>
9.1  Do fuel additives work?
</h3>
Most aftermarket fuel additives are not cost-effective. These include the
octane-enhancer solutions discussed in section 6.18. There are various other
pills, tablets, magnets, filters, etc. that all claim to improve either fuel
economy or performance. Some of these have perfectly sound scientific
mechanisms, unfortunately they are not cost-effective. Some do not even have
sound scientific mechanisms. Because the same model production vehicles can
vary significantly, it's expensive to unambiguously demonstrate these
additives are not cost-effective. If you wish to try them, remember the
biggest gain is likely to be caused by the lower mass of your wallet/purse.<p>

There is one aftermarket additive that may be cost-effective, the lubricity
additive used with unleaded gasolines to combat valve seat recession on
engines that do not have seat inserts. The long-term solution is to install
inserts at the next top overhaul.<p>

Some other fuel additives work, especially those that are carefully
formulated into the gasoline by the manufacturer at the refinery.<p>
A typical gasoline may contain [17,19,24]:-<p>
* Oil-soluble Dye, initially added to leaded gasoline at about 10 ppm to
        prevent its misuse as an industrial solvent
* Antioxidants, typically phenylene diamines or hindered phenols, are
        added to prevent oxidation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
* Metal Deactivators, typically about 10ppm of chelating agent such as
        N,N'-disalicylidene-1,2-propanediamine is added to inhibit copper,
        which can rapidly catalyze oxidation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
* Corrosion Inhibitors, about 5ppm of oil-soluble surfactants are added
        to prevent corrosion caused either by water condensing from cooling,
        water-saturated gasoline, or from condensation from air onto the
        walls of almost-empty gasoline tanks that drop below the dew point.
        If your gasoline travels along a pipeline, it's possible the pipeline
        owner will add additional corrosion inhibitor to the fuel.
* Anti-icing Additives, used mainly with carburetted cars, and usually either
        a surfactant, alcohol or glycol.
* Anti-wear Additives, these are used to control wear in the upper cylinder
        and piston ring area that the gasoline contacts, and are usually
        very light hydrocarbon oils. Phosphorus additives can also be used
        on engines without exhaust catalyst systems.
* Deposit-modifying Additives, usually surfactants.
  1. Carburettor Deposits, additives to prevent these were required when
        crankcase blow-by (PCV) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) controls
        were introduced. Some fuel components reacted with these gas streams
        to form deposits on the throat and throttle plate of carburettors.
  2. Fuel Injector tips operate about 100C, and deposits form in the
        annulus during hot soak, mainly from the oxidation and polymerisation
        of the larger unsaturated hydrocarbons. The additives that prevent
        and unclog these tips are usually polybutene succinimides or
        polyether amines.
  3. Intake Valve Deposits caused major problems in the mid-1980s when
        some engines had reduced driveability when fully warmed, even though
        the amount of deposit was below previously acceptable limits. It is
        believed that the new fuels and engine designs were producing a more
        absorbent deposit that grabbed some passing fuel vapour, causing lean
        hesitation. Intake valves operate about 300C, and if the valve is
        is kept wet deposits tend not to form, thus intermittent injectors
        tend to promote deposits. Oil leaking through the valve guides can be
        either harmful or beneficial, depending on the type and quantity.
        Gasoline factors implicated in these deposits include unsaturates and
        alcohols. Additives to prevent these deposits contain a detergent
        and/or dispersant in a higher molecular weight solvent or light oil
        whose low volatility keeps the valve surface wetted.
  4. Combustion Chamber Deposits have been targeted in the 1990s, as they
        are responsible for significant increases in emissions. Recent
        detergent-dispersant additives have the ability to function in both
        the liquid and vapour phases to remove existing carbon and prevent
        deposit formation.
* Octane Enhancers, these are usually formulated blends of alkyl lead
        or MMT compounds in a solvent such as toluene, and added at the
        100-1000  ppm levels. They have been replaced by hydrocarbons with
        higher octanes such as aromatics and olefins. These hydrocarbons
        are now being replaced by a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons and
        and oxygenates.

If you wish to play with different fuels and additives, be aware that
some parts of your engine management systems, such as the oxygen sensor,
can be confused by different exhaust gas compositions. An example is
increased quantities of hydrogen from methanol combustion.<p>
<h3>
9.2  Can a quality fuel help a sick engine?
</h3>
It depends on the ailment. Nothing can compensate for poor tuning and wear.
If the problem is caused by deposits or combustion quality, then modern
premium quality gasolines have been shown to improve engine performance
significantly. The new generation of additive packages for gasolines include
components that will dissolve existing carbon deposits, and have been shown
to improve fuel economy, NOx emissions, and driveability.<p>
<h3>
9.3  What are the advantages of alcohols and ethers?
</h3>
This section discusses only the use of high ( >80% ) alcohol or ether fuels.
Alcohol fuels can be made from sources other than imported crude oil, and the
nations that have researched/used alcohol fuels have mainly based their
choice on import substitution. Alcohol fuels can burn more efficiently, and
can reduce photochemically-active emissions. Most vehicle manufacturers
favoured the use of liquid fuels over compressed or liquified gases. The
alcohol fuels have high research octane ratings, but also high sensitivity
and high latent heats [6,17,51,74].<p>

The major advantages are gained when pure fuels ( M100, and E100 ) are used,
as the addition of hydrocarbons to overcome the cold start problems also
significantly reduces, if not totally eliminates, any emission benefits.
Methanol will produce significant amounts of formaldehyde, a suspected
human carcinogen, until the exhaust catalyst reaches operating temperature.
Ethanol produces acetaldehyde. The cold-start problems have been addressed,
and alcohol fuels are technically viable, however with crude oil at
<$30/bbl they are not economically viable, especially as the demand for then
as precursors for gasoline oxygenates has elevated the world prices.
Methanol almost doubled in price during 1994. There have also been trials
of pure MTBE as a fuel, however there are no unique or significant advantages
that would outweigh the poor economic viability [11].<p>
<h3>
9.4  Why are CNG and LPG considered "cleaner" fuels.
</h3>
CNG ( Compressed Natural Gas ) is usually around 70-90% methane with 10-20%
ethane, 2-8% propanes, and decreasing quantities of the higher HCs up to
butane. The fuel has a high octane and usually only trace quantities of
unsaturates. The emissions from CNG have lower concentrations of the
hydrocarbons responsible for photochemical smog, reduced CO, SOx, and NOx,
and the lean misfire limit is extended [75]. There are no technical
disadvantages, providing the installation is performed correctly. The major
disadvantage of compressed gas is the reduced range. Vehicles may have
between one to three cylinders ( 25 MPa, 90-120 litre capacity), and they
usually represent about 50% of the gasoline range. As natural gas pipelines
do not go everywhere, most conversions are dual-fuel with gasoline. The
ignition timing and stoichiometry are significantly different, but good
conversions will provide about 85% of the gasoline power over the full
operating range, with easy switching between the two fuels [76].<p>

CNG has been extensively used in Italy and New Zealand ( NZ had 130,000
dual-fuelled vehicles with 380 refuelling stations in 1987 ). The conversion
costs are usually around US$1000, so the economics are very dependent on the
natural gas price. The typical 15% power loss means that driveability of
retrofitted CNG-fuelled vehicles is easily impaired, consequently it is not
recommended for vehicles of less than 1.5l engine capacity, or retrofitted
onto engine/vehicle combinations that have marginal driveability on gasoline.
The low price of crude oil, along with installation and ongoing CNG
tank-testing costs, have reduced the number of CNG vehicles in NZ. The US
CNG fleet continues to increase in size ( 60,000 in 1994 ).<p>

LPG ( Liquified Petroleum Gas ) is predominantly propane with iso-butane
and n-butane. It has one major advantage over CNG, the tanks do not have
to be high pressure, and the fuel is stored as a liquid. The fuel offers
most of the environmental benefits of CNG, including high octane.
Approximately 20-25% more fuel is required, unless the engine is optimised
( CR 12:1 ) for LPG, in which case there is no decrease in power or increase
in fuel consumption [17,76].<p>

9.5  Why are hydrogen-powered cars not available?
</h3>
<b>
The Hindenburg.
</b>
The technology to operate IC engines on hydrogen has been investigated in
depth since before the turn of the century. One attraction was to
use the hydrogen in airships to fuel the engines instead of venting it.
Hydrogen has a very high flame speed ( 3.24 - 4.40 m/s ), wide flammability
limits ( 4.0 - 75 vol% ), low ignition energy ( 0.017 mJ ), high autoignition
temperature ( 520C ), and flame temperature of 2050 C. Hydrogen has a very
high specific energy ( 120.0 MJ/kg ), making it very desirable as a
transportation fuel.  The problem has been to develop a storage system that
will pass all safety concerns, and yet still be light enough for automotive
use. Although hydrogen can be mixed with oxygen and combusted more
efficiently, most proposals use air [73,77].<p>

Unfortunately the flame temperature is sufficiently high to dissociate
atmospheric nitrogen and form undesirable NOx emissions. The high flame
speeds mean that ignition timing is at TDC, except when running lean, when
the ignition timing is advanced 10 degrees. The high flame speed, coupled
with a very small quenching distance mean that the flame can sneak past
inlet narrow inlet valve openings and cause backfiring. The advantage of a
wide range of mixture strengths and high thermal efficiencies are matched
by the disadvantages of pre-ignition and knock unless weak mixtures, clean
engines, and cool operation are used.<p>

Interested readers are referred to the group sci.energy.hydrogen for details
about this fuel.<p>
<h3>
9.6  What are "fuel cells" ?
</h3>
Fuel cells are electrochemical cells that directly oxidise the fuel at
electrodes producing electrical and thermal energy. The oxidant is usually
oxygen from the air and the fuel is usually gaseous, with hydrogen
preferred. There has, so far, been little success using low temperature fuel
cells ( < 200C ) to perform the direct oxidation of hydrocarbon-based liquids
or gases. Methanol can be used as a source for the hydrogen by adding an
on-board reformer. The main advantage of fuel cells is their high fuel-to-
electricity efficiency of about 40-60% of the nett calorific value of the
fuel. As fuel cells also produce heat that can be used for vehicle climate
control. Fuel Cells are the most likely candidate to replace the IC engine
as a primary energy source. Fuel cells are quiet and produce virtually no
toxic emissions, but they do require a clean fuel ( no halogens, CO, S, or
ammonia ) to avoid poisoning. They currently are expensive to produce, and
have a short operational lifetime, when compared to an IC engine [78,79].<p>
<h3>
9.7  What is a "hybrid" vehicle?
</h3>
A hybrid vehicle has three major systems [80].<p>
<OL>
<LI>A primary power source, either an IC engine driven generator where the
   IC engine only operates in the most efficient part of it's performance
   map, or alternatives such as fuel cells and turbines.
<LI>A power storage unit, which can be a flywheel, battery, or ultracapacitor.
<LI>A drive unit, almost always now an electric motor that can used as a
   generator during braking. Regenerative braking may increase the
   operational range about 8-13%.
</OL>
Battery technology has not yet advanced sufficiently to economically
substitute for an IC engine, while retaining the carrying capacity, range,
performance, and driveability of the vehicle. Hybrid vehicles may enable
this problem to be at least partially overcome, but they remain expensive,
and the current ZEV proposals exclude fuel cells and hybrids systems, but
this is being re-evaluated.
<p>
<h3>
9.8  What about other alternative fuels?
</h3>
<h4>
9.8.1 Ammonia
</h4>
Anhydrous ammonia has been researched because it does not contain any carbon,
and so would not release any CO2. The high heat of vaporisation requires
a pre-vaporisation step, preferably also with high jacket temperatures
( 180C ) to assist decomposition. Power outputs of about 70% of that of
gasoline under the same conditions have been achieved [73].<p>
<h4>
9.8.2 Water
</h4>
Mr Gunnerman has been promoting his patents that claim mixing one part of
gasoline with 2 parts water can provide as much power from an IC engine as
the same flow rate of gasoline. He claims the increased efficiency is from
catalysed dissociation of water to H2 and 02, as the combustion chamber of
the test engine contained a catalyst. It takes the same amount of energy to
dissociate water, as you reclaim when you burn the H2 with 02. So he has to
use heat energy that is normally lost. He appears to have modified his
claims a little with his new A55 fuel.  A recent article claims a 29%
increase in fuel economy for a test bus in Reno, but also claims that his
fuel combusts so efficiently that it can pass an emissions test without
requiring a catalytic converter [81]. Caterpillar are working with
Gunnerman to evaluate his claims and develop the product.<p>
<h3>
9.9  What about alternative oxidants?
</h3>
<h4>
9.9.1 Nitrous Oxide
</h4>
Nitrous oxide ( N2O ) contains 33 vol% of oxygen, consequently the combustion
chamber is filled with less useless nitrogen. It is also metered in as a
liquid, with can cool the incoming charge further, thus effectively
increasing the charge density. With all that oxygen, a lot more fuel can
be squashed into the combustion chamber. The advantage of nitrous oxide is
that it has a flame speed, when burned with hydrocarbon and alcohol fuels,
that can be handled by current IC engines, consequently the power is
delivered in an orderly fashion, but rapidly. The same is not true for
pure oxygen combustion with hydrocarbons, so leave that oxygen cylinder on
the gas axe alone :-). The following are for common premixed flames [82].<p>

</pre>
Nitrous oxide is not yet routinely used on standard vehicles, but the
technology is well understood.<p>
<h4>
9.9.2 Membrane Enrichment of Air
</h4>
Over the last two decades, extensive research has been performed on the
use of membranes to enrich the oxygen content of air. Increasing the oxygen
content can make combustion more efficient due to the higher flame
temperature and less nitrogen. The optimum oxygen concentration for existing
automotive engine materials is around 30 - 40%. There are several commercial
membranes that can provide that level of enrichment. The problem is that the
surface area required to produce the necessary amount of enriched air for an
SI engine is very large. The membranes have to be laid close together, or
wound in a spiral, and significant amounts of power are required to force
the air along the membrane surface for sufficient enriched air to run a
slightly modified engine. Most research to date has centred on CI engines,
with their higher efficiencies. Several systems have been tried on research
engines and vehicles, however the higher NOx emissions remain a problem
[83,84].<p>

Subject: 10. Historical Legends
</b>
10.1  The myth of Triptane
</h4>
<blockquote><i>
  This post is an edited version of some posted after JdA posted some claims
  from a hot-rod enthusiast reporting that triptane + 4cc TEL had a rich
  power octane rating of 270. This was followed by another that claimed the
  unleaded octane was 150.</i>
</blockquote>
In WWII there was a major effort to increase the power of the aviation
engines continuously, rather than just for short periods using boost fluids.
Increasing the octane of the fuel had dramatic effects on engines that could
be adjusted to utilise the fuel ( by changing boost pressure ). There was a
12% increase in cruising speed, 40% increase in rate of climb, 20% increase
in ceiling, and 40% increase in payload for a DC-3, if the fuel went from 87
to 100 Octane, and further increases if the engine could handle 100+ PN fuel
[85]. A 12 cylinder allison aircraft engine was operated on a 60% blend of
triptane ( 2,2,3-trimethylbutane ) in 100 octane leaded gasoline to produce
2500hp when the rated take-off horsepower with 100 octane leaded was 1500hp
[10].<p>

Triptane was first shown to have high octane in 1926 as part of the General
Motors Research Laboratories investigations [86]. As further interest
developed, gallon quantities were made in 1938, and a full size production
plant was completed in late 1943. The fuel was tested, and the high lead
sensitivity resulted in power outputs up to 4 times that of iso-octane, and
as much as 25% improvement in fuel economy over iso-octane [10].<p>

All of this sounds incredibly good, but then, as now, the cost of octane
enhancement has to be considered, and the plant producing triptane was not
really viable. the fuel was fully evaluated in the aviation test engines,
and it was under the aviation test conditions - where mixture strength is
varied, that the high power levels were observed over a narrow range of
engine adjustment. If turbine engines had not appeared, then maybe triptane
would have been used as an octane agent in leaded aviation gasolines.
Significant design changes would have been required for engines to utilise
the high anti-knock rating.<p>

As an unleaded additive, it was not that much different to other isoalkanes,
consequently the modern manufacturing processes for aviation gasolines are
alkylation of unsaturated C4 HCs with isobutane, to produce a highly
iso-paraffinic product, and/or aromatization of naphthenic fractions to
produce aromatic hydrocarbons possessing excellent rich-mixture antiknock
properties.<p>

So, the myth that triptane was the wonder anti-knock agent that would provide
heaps of power arose. In reality, it was one of the best of the iso-alkanes
( remember we are comparing it to iso-octane which just happened to be worse
than most other iso-alkanes), but it was not _that_ different from other
members. It was targeted, and produced, for supercharged aviation engines
that could adjust their mixture strength, used highly leaded fuel, and wanted
short period of high power for takeoff, regardless of economy.<p>

The blending octane number, which is what we are discussing, of triptane
is designated by the American Petroleum Institute Research Project 45 survey
as 112 Motor and 112 Research [31]. Triptane does not have a significantly
different blending number for MON or RON, when compared to iso-octane.
When TEL is added, the lead response of a large number of paraffins is well
above that of iso-octane ( about +45 for 3ml TEL/US Gal ), and this can lead
to Performance Numbers that can not be used in conventional automotive
engines [10].<p>
<h3>
10.2  From Honda Civic to Formula 1 winner.
</h3>
<blockquote><i>
The following is edited from a post in a debate over the advantages of
water injection. I tried to demonstrate what modifications would be required
to convert my own 1500cc Honda Civic into something worthwhile :-).</i>
</blockquote>

There are many variables that will determine the power output of an engine.
High on the list will be the ability of the fuel to burn evenly without
knock. No matter how clever the engine, the engine power output limit is
determined by the fuel it is designed to use, not the amount of oxygen
stuffed into the cylinder and compressed. Modern engines designs and
gasolines are intended to reduce the emission of undesirable exhaust
pollutants, consequently engine performance is mainly constrained by the
fuel available.<p>

My Honda Civic uses 91 RON fuel, but the Honda Formula 1 turbocharged 1.5
litre engine was only permitted to operate on 102 Research Octane fuel, and
had limits placed on the amount of fuel it could use during a race, the
maximum boost of the turbochargers was specified, as was an additional
40kg penalty weight. Standard 102 RON gasoline would be about 96 R+M/2 if
sold as a pump gasoline. The normally-aspirated 3.0 litre engines could use
unlimited amounts of 102RON fuel. The F1 race duration is 305 km or 2 hours,
and it's perhaps worth remembering that Indy cars run at 7.3 psi boost.<p>

<LI>Add sophisticated electronic timing and engine manangement controls

</OL>
You now have a six-cylinder, 1.5 litre, 1000hp Honda Civic.<p>

For subsequent years the restrictions were even more severe, 150 litres
and 36.3 maximum boost, in a still vain attempt to give the 3 litre,
normally-aspirated engines a chance. Obviously Honda took advantage
of the reduced boost by increasing CR to 9.4:1, and only going to 15%
rich air/fuel ratio. They then developed an economy mode that involved
heating the liquid fuel to 180F to improve vaporisation, and increased
the air temp to 158F, and leaned out the air-fuel ratio to just 2% rich.
The engine output dropped to 610hp @ 12,500 ( from  685hp @ 12,500 and
about 312 lbs-ft of torque @ 10,000 rpm ), but 32% of the energy in
the fuel was converted to mechanical work. The engine still had crisp
throttle response, and still beat the normally aspirated engines that
did not have the fuel limitation. So turbos were banned. No other
F1 racing engine has ever come close to converting 32% of the fuel
energy into work [87].<p>

         <H1>Acid Rain</H1>
</HEADER>
<BODY>         
<CITE>The following information came from Environment Canada's A 
      Primer on Environmental Citizenship </A>.</H5>
        <I>Despite progress in recent years, acid rain remains a significant 
        environmental and economic concern for many regions of Canada.  
        This section explains what acid rain is, where it comes from, and 
        what it's effects are.
</I>
<P>
 <HR>        
        <I> Q3.49</I>
         <STRONG>What causes acid
         deposition?</STRONG>
         <P>
         Acid deposition - commonly called
         acid rain - is caused by emissions
         of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen
         oxides. Although natural sources
         of sulphur oxides and nitrogen
         oxides do exist, more than 90%
         of the sulphur and 95% of the
         nitrogen emissions occurring in
         eastern North America are of
         human origin. These primary
         air pollutants arise from the use
         of coal in the production of
         electricity, from base-metal
         smelting, and from fuel combustion in vehicles. Once released
         into the atmosphere, they can be
         converted chemically into such
         secondary pollutants as nitric
         
         acid and sulfuric acid, both of
         which dissolve easily in water.
         The resulting acidic water
         droplets can be carried long
         distances by prevailing winds,
         returning to Earth as acid rain,
         snow, or fog.
    <P><HR>     
        <I> Q 3.50</I>
         <STRONG>Is acid deposition always
         wet?</STRONG>
         <P>
         No. The acids can be transformed
         chemically into sulphur dioxide
         gas or into sulphur and nitrogen
         salts. In this form they are deposited 'dry', causing the same
         damage as when they land dissolved in rain or snow. In this
         form they can also do internal
         damage to plants as they are
         taken up from the soil.
        <P>
	<HR><I>
<IMG ALIGN = "BOTTOM" SRC = "dyk1.gif" ALT = "Did You Know?">
       About 40% of nitrogen oxides come from transportation
         (cars, trucks, buses, trains), about 25% from thermoelectric
         generating stations, and the balance from other industrial,
         commercial, and residential combustion processes.
	 </I>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.51</I>
<STRONG> Is natural precipitation acidic?</STRONG>
<P>
Yes. Water solutions vary in their degree of acidity. If pure water is defined as neutral,  baking soda solutions are basic (alkaline) and household ammonia is very basic (very alkaline).  On the other side of this scale there are ascending degrees of acidity; milk is slightly acidic, tomato juice is slightly more acidic, vinegar is mediumly acidic, lemon juice is still more acidic, and battery acid is extremely acidic.
If there were no pollution at all, normal rainwater would fall on the acid side of this scale, not the alkaline side. Normal rainwater is less acidic than tomato juice, but more acidic than milk. What pollution does is cause the acidity of rain to increase. In some areas of Canada, rain can be as acidic as vinegar or lemon juice.
<P>
<HR>
<I>Q 3.52</I>
<STRONG>If rain is naturally acidic, why does it matter if pollution makes it more acidic?</STRONG>
<P>
The problem is one of balance; nature depends upon balance. Normal precipitation reacts with alkaline chemicals - derived from the region's bedrock and found in the air, soils, lakes, and streams - and is thereby neutralized.
However, if precipitation is more highly acidic, then acid-buffering chemicals can eventually become depleted.  In this case, the buffering effect will no longer occur, and nature's ability to maintain balance will have been destroyed. 
<P>
<HR>
<I>Q 3.53</I>
<STRONG>Do all regions have the same acid-neutralizing capacity?</STRONG>
<P>
No. Different types of bedrock contain variable amounts of contain variable amounts of alkaline chemicals. Regions with bedrock containing less alkali have a lower capacity for reducing acidity, and thus are more sensitive to acid deposition.
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.54</I>
<STRONG>What happens when this buffering effect is disrupted </STRONG>
<P>
When the environment cannot neutralize acid rain, damage occurs to forests, crops, lakes,
and fish. Toxic metals such as copper and lead can also be leached from water pipes into drinking water.
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.55</I>
<P>
<STRONG>How does acid deposition affect aquatic ecosystems?</STRONG>
<P>
The interactions between living organisms and the chemistry of their aquatic habitats are extremely complex. If the number of one species or group of species changes in response to acidification, then the ecosystem of the entire water body is likely to be affected through the predator-prey relationships of the food web. At first, the effects of acid deposition may be almost imperceptible, but as acidity increases, more and more species of plants and animals decline or disappear.
<P><UL>
<LI> As the water pH approaches 6.0, crustaceans, insects, and some plankton species begin to disappear.
<BR><LI> As pH approaches 5.0, major changes in the makeup of the plankton community occur, less desirable species of mosses and plankton may begin to invade, and the progressive loss of some fish populations is likely, with the more highly valued species being generally the least tolerant of acidity.
<BR><LI> Below pH of 5.0, the water is largely devoid of fish, the bottom is covered with undecayed material, and the nearshore areas may be dominated by mosses.
<BR><LI> Terrestrial animals dependent on aquatic ecosystems are also affected. Waterfowl, for example, depend on aquatic organisms for nourishment and nutrients. As these food sources are reduced or eliminated, the quality of habitat declines and the reproductive
success of the birds is affected.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.56</I>
<STRONG>How does acid deposition affect terrestrial plant life?</STRONG>
<P>
Both natural vegetation and crops can be affected.
<P><UL>
<LI> It can alter the protective waxy surface of leaves, lowering disease resistance.
<BR><LI> It may inhibit plant germination and reproduction.
<BR><LI> It accelerates soil weathering and removal of nutrients.
<BR><LI> It makes some toxic elements, such as aluminum, more soluble. High aluminum concentrations in soil can prevent the uptake and use of nutrients by plants.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.57</I>
<STRONG>How does acid deposition affect animal life?</STRONG>
<P>
The effects on terrestrial wildlife are hard to assess. As a result of pollution-induced alteration of habitat or food resources, acid deposition may cause population decline through stress (because of decreases in available resources) and lower reproductive
success.
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.58</I>
<STRONG>What are the socioeconomic consequences of acidification?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Lower productivity  in fisheries, forestry, and agriculture translates to lower profits and fewer jobs for some of Canada's important industries.
<BR><LI> Acid deposition causes accelerated corrosion, fracturing, and discoloration of buildings,
structures, and monuments.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.59</I>
<STRONG>How does acid deposition affect human health?</STRONG>
<P><UL>
<LI> We eat food, drink water, and breathe air that has come in contact with acid deposition.
<LI> Canadian and U.S. studies indicate that there is a link between this pollution and
respirator problems in sensitive populations such as children and asthmatics.
<LI> Acid deposition can increase the levels of toxic metals such as aluminum, copper, and mercury in untreated drinking water supplies.
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<IMG SRC = "focus.gif" ALT = "FOCUS!"><BR>
<I>It has been estimated that acid rain causes $1 billion worth of damage in Canada every year. Thousands of lakes have been damaged; a large part of the salmon habitat in the Maritimes has been lost; a significant proportion of eastern Canada's forests has been
affected; and considerable damage to buildings and monuments has been documented.
<P>
The Canadian Council of Resource and Environment Ministers in established 20 kg/hectare per year as the target for Canadian sulphur dioxide loading. In eastern Canada, 96% of the land with high capability for forestry is subject to acidic deposition
in excess of 20 kg/ha per year. In recent years, important instances of dieback and
declines in growth rate have been noted in sugar maple groves in parts of Canada that receive high levels of these and other air pollutants, such as ozone. Significant growth declines in northern Ontario forests, most notable over the past 30 years, coincide with a period of rapidly increasing industrialization and urbanization across much of  the province.

<IMG ALIGN = "BOTTOM" SRC = "dyk1.gif" ALT = "Did You Know?">
<I>More than 80% of all Canadians live in areas with high acid rain-related pollution levels.
</I>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.60</I>
<STRONG>Is acid deposition occurring to the same extent across Canada?</STRONG>
<P>
No. Sulphur emissions tend to be concentrated in relatively few locations, while the sources of nitrogen emissions are widely distributed; however, where they are deposited depends on more than just where they are produced. Airborne acidic pollutants are often transported by large scale weather systems thousands of kilometres from their point of
origin before being deposited. In eastern North America, weather systems generally travel

<h1> Revisiting Solar Power's Past<br><em>By Charles Smith</em></h1>
Inventors unlocked the secrets of turning the sun's rays into mechnical power 
more than a century ago, only to see their dream machines collapse from lack 
of public support.  Modern solar engineers must not be doomed to relive their fate.

Studies at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. His primary area of research is the history of energy.

<p>
<img src="Smith2.GIF"></p>
<p>Many of us assume that the nation's first serious push to develop renewable fuels 
was spawned while angry Americans waited in gas lines during the "energy crisis" of 
the 1970s. Held hostage by the OPEC oil embargo, the country suddenly seemed 
receptive to warnings from scientists, environmentalists, and even a few 
politicians to end its overreliance on finite coal and oil reserves or 
face severe economic distress and political upheaval.  </p>

<p> But efforts to design and construct devices for supplying renewable 
energy actually began some 100 years before that turbulent time--ironically, 
at the very height of the Industrial Revolution, which was largely founded 
on the promise of seemingly inexhaustible supplies of fossil fuels. Contrary 
to the prevailing opinion of the day, a number of engineers questioned the 
practice of an industrial economy based on nonrenewable energy and worried 
about what the world's nations would do after exhausting the fuel supply.  </p>

<p> More important, many of these visionaries did not just provide futuristic 
rhetoric but actively explored almost all the renewable energy options 
familiar today. In the end, most decided to focus on solar power, reasoning 
that the potential rewards outweighed the technical barriers. In less than 
50 years, these pioneers developed an impres-sive array of innovative 
techniques for capturing solar radiation and using it to produce the steam 
that powered the machines of that era. In fact, just before World War I, they 
had outlined all of the solar thermal conversion methods now being considered. 
Unfortunately, despite their technical successes and innovative designs, 
their work was largely forgotten for the next 50 years in the rush to 
develop fossil fuels for an energy-hungry world.</p>

<p>Now, a century later, history is repeating itself. After following the 
same path as the early inventors--in some cases reinventing the same 
techniques--contemporary solar engineers have arrived at the same conclusion: 
solar power is not only possible but eminently practical, not to mention more 
environmentally friendly. Alas, once again, just as the technology has proven 
itself from a practical standpoint, public support for further development 
and implementation is eroding, and solar power could yet again be eclipsed 
by conventional energy technologies.</p>
<h3>The First Solar Motor</h3>
<p>The earliest known record of the direct conversion of solar radiation 
into mechanical power belongs to Auguste Mouchout, a mathematics instructor
at the Lyce de Tours. Mouchout began his solar work in 1860 after expressin
grave concerns about his country's dependence on coal. "It would be prudent 
and wise not to fall asleep regarding this quasi-security," he wrote. 
"Eventually industry will no longer find in Europe the resources to satisfy
its prodigious expansion. Coal will undoubtedly be used up. What will 
industry do then?" By the following year he was granted the first patent
for a motor running on solar power and continued to improve his design 
until about 1880. During this period the inventor laid the foundation for
our modern understanding of converting solar radiation into mechanical 
steam power. </p>
<p>Mouchout's initial experiments involved a glass-enclosed iron cauldron: 
incoming solar radiation passed through the glass cover, and the trapped 
rays transmitted heat to the water. While this simple arrangement boiled 
water, it was of little practical value because the quantities and 
pressures of steam it produced were minimal. However, Mouchout soon 
discovered that by adding a reflector to concentrate additional radiation
onto the cauldron, he could generate more steam. In late 1865, he 
succeeded in using his apparatus to operate a small, conventional 
steam engine. </p>

<p>By the following summer, Mouchout displayed his solar motor to Emperor 
Napoleon III in Paris. The monarch, favorably impressed, offered financial
assistance for developing an industrial solar motor for France. With the 
newly acquired funds, Mouchout enlarged his invention's capacity, refined
the reflector, redesigning it as a truncated cone, like a dish with slanted 
sides, to more accurately focus the sun's rays on the boiler. Mouchout 
also constructed a tracking mechanism that enabled the entire machine to 
follow the sun's altitude and azimuth, providing uninterrupted solar reception. 
</p>
<p>
After six years of work, Mouchout exhibited his new machine in the library 
courtyard of his Tours home in 1872, amazing spectators. One reporter 
described the reflector as an inverted "mammoth lamp shade...coated on the 
inside with very thin silver leaf" and the boiler sitting in the middle as 
an "enormous thimble" made of blackened copper and "covered with a glass bell".
</p>
<p>Anxious to put his invention to work, he connected the apparatus to a 
steam engine that powered a water pump. On what was deemed "an 
exceptionally hot day," the solar motor produced one-half horsepower. 
Mouchout reported the results and findings to the French Academy of 
Science. The government, eager to exploit the new invention to its 
fullest potential, decided that the most suitable venue for the new 
machine would be the tropical climes of the French protectorate of Algeria,
a region blessed with almost constant sunshine and entirely dependent on 
coal, a prohibitively expensive commodity in the African region. </p>

<p>Mouchout was quickly deployed to Algeria with ample funding to 
construct a large solar steam engine. He first decided to enlarge his 
invention's capacity yetagain to 100 liters (70 for water and 30 for steam) 
and employ a multi-tubed boiler instead of the single cauldron. The boiler 
tubes had a better surface-area-to-water ratio, yielding more pressure and 
improved engine performance. </p>

<p>In 1878, Mouchout exhibited the redesigned invention at the Paris 
Exposition. Perhaps to impress the audience or, more likely, his government 
backers, he coupled the steam engine to a refrigeration device. The steam 
from the solar motor, after being routed through a condenser, rapidly 
cooled the inside of a separate insulated compartment. He explained the 
result: "In spite of the seeming paradox of the statement, [it was] 
possible to utilize the rays of the sun to make ice." Mouchout was 
awarded a medal for his accomplishments.</p>

<p>By 1881 the French Ministry of Public Works, intrigued by Mouchout's 
machine, appointed two commissioners to assess its cost efficiency. But 
after some 900 observations at Montpelier, a city in southern France, 
and Constantine, Algeria, the government deemed the device a technical 
success but a practical failure. One reason was that France had recently 
improved its system for transporting coal and developed a better 
relationship with England, on which it was dependent for that commodity.
The price of coal had thus dropped, rendering the need for alternatives 
less attractive. Unable to procure further financial assistance, Mouchout 
returned to his academic pursuits. </p>

<h3>The Tower of Power</h3>
<p>During the height of Mouchout's experimentation, William Adams, the 
deputy registrar for the English Crown in Bombay, India, wrote an 
award-winning book entitled Solar Heat: A Substitute for Fuel in 
Tropical Countries. Adams noted that he was intrigued with Mouchout's 
solar steam engine after reading an account of the Tours demonstration, 
but that the invention was impractical, since "it would be impossible 
to construct [a dish-shaped reflector] of much greater dimensions" to 
generate more than Mouchout's one-half horsepower. The problem, 
he felt, was that the polished metal reflector would tarnish too easily, 
and would be too costly to build and too unwieldy to efficiently track 
the sun. </p>

<p>Fortunately for the infant solar discipline, the English registrar 
did not spend all his time finding faults in the French inventor's 
efforts, but offered somecreative solutions. For example, Adams was 
convinced that a reflector of flat silvered mirrors arranged in a 
semicircle would be cheaper to construct and easier to maintain. 
His plan was to build a large rack of many small mirrors and adjust 
each one to reflect sunlight in a specific direction. To track the 
sun's movement, the entire rack could be rolled around a semicircular 
track, projecting the concentrated radiation onto a stationary boiler. 
The rack could be attended by a laborer and would have to be moved only 
"three or four times during the day," Adams noted, or more frequently 
to improve performance. </p>

<p>Confident of his innovative arrangement, Adams began construction in late
1878. By gradually adding 17-by-10-inch flat mirrors and measuring the 
rising temperatures, he calculated that to generate the 1,200û F necessary 
to produce steam pressures high enough to operate conventional engines, 
the reflector would require 72 mirrors. To demonstrate the power of the 
concentrated radiation, Adams placed a piece of wood in the focus of the 
mirrored panes where, he noted, "it ignited immediately." He then arranged
the collectors around a boiler, retaining Mouchout's enclosed cauldron 
configuration, and connected it to a 2.5-horsepower steam engine that 
operated during daylight hours "for a fortnight in the compound of [his] 
bungalow."</p>

<p>Eager to display his invention, Adams notified newspapers and 
invited his important friends--including the Army's commander in chief, 
a colonel from the Royal Engineers, the secretary of public works, various 
justices, and principal mill owners--to a demonstration. Adams wrote that 
all were impressed, even the local engineers who, while doubtful that 
solar power could compete directly with coal and wood, thought it could
be a practical supplemental energy source. </p>

<p>Adams's experimentation ended soon after the demonstration, though, 
perhaps because he hadachieved his goal of proving the feasibility of 
his basic design, but more likely because, as some say, he lacked 
sufficient entrepreneurial drive. Even so, his legacy of producing a
powerful and versatile way to harness and convert solar heat survives. 
Engineers today know this design as the Power Tower concept, which 
is one of the best configurations for large scale, centralized solar 
plants. In fact, most of the modern tower-type solar plants follow 
Adams's basic configuration: flat or slightly curved mirrors that 
remain stationary or travel on a semicircular track and either reflect 
light upward to a boiler in a receiver tower or downward to a boiler at
ground level, thereby generating steam to drive an accompanying heat 
engine.</p>
<h3>Collection without Reflection</h3>

<p>Even with Mouchout's abandonment and the apparent disenchantment of 
England's sole participant, Europe continued to advance the practical 
application of solar heat, as the torch returned to France and engineer 
Charles Tellier. Considered by many the father of refrigeration, Tellier 
actually began his work in refrigeration as a result of his solar 
experimentation, which led to the design of the first nonconcentrating, 
or non-reflecting, solar motor. </p>

<p><img src ="Smith3.GIF"></p>
<p>In 1885, Tellier installed a solar collector on his roof similar to 
the flat-plate collectors placed atop many homes today for heating 
domestic water. The collector was composed of ten plates, each 
consisting of two iron sheets riveted together to form a water

tight seal, and connected by tubes to form a single unit. Instead of 
filling the plates with water to produce steam, Tellier chose ammonia 
as a working fluid because of its significantly lower boiling point. 
After solar exposure, the containers emitted enough pressurized ammonia 
gas to power a water pump he had placed in his well at the rate of some 
300 gallons per hour during daylight. Tellier considered his solar water 
pump practical for anyone with a south-facing roof. He also thought that 
simply adding plates, thereby increasing the size of the system, would make
industrial applications possible.</p><p>By 1889 Tellier had increased 
the efficiency of the collectors by enclosing the top with glass and 
insulating the bottom. He published the results in The Elevation of 
Water with the Solar Atmosphere, which included details on his intentions 
to use the sun to manufacture ice. Like his countryman Mouchout, Tellier 
envisioned that the large expanses of the African plains could become 
industrially and agriculturally productive through the implementation of 
solar power. </p>

<p>In The Peaceful Conquest of West Africa, Tellier argued that a 
consistent and readily available supply of energy would be required to 
power the machinery of industry before the French holdings in Africa could 
be properly developed. He also pointed out that even though the price of 
coal had fallen since Mouchout's experiments, fuel continued to be a 
significant expense in French operations in Africa. He therefore concluded 
that the construction costs of his low-temperature, nonconcentrating solar 
motor were low enough to justify its implementation. He also noted that his 
machine was far less costly than Mouchout's device, with its dish-shaped 
reflector and complicated tracking mechanism.</p>

<p>Yet despite this potential, Tellier evidently decided to pursue his 
refrigeration interests instead, and do so without the aid of solar heat. 
Most likely the profits from conventionally operated refrigerators proved 
irresistible. Also, much of the demand for the new cooling technology now 
stemmed from the desire to transport beef to Europe from North and South 
America. The rolling motion of the ships combined with space limitations 
precluded the use of solar power altogether. And as Tellier redirected his 
focus, France saw the last major development of solar mechanical power on 
her soil until well into the twentieth century. Most experimentation in the 
fledgling discipline crossed the Atlantic to that new bastion of mechanical 
ingenuity, the United States. </p>

<h3>The Parabolic Trough</h3>

<p>Though Swedish by birth, John Ericsson was one of the most influential 
and controversial U.S. engineers of the nineteenth century. While he spent 
his most productive years designing machines of war--his most celebrated 
accomplishment was the Civil War battleship the Monitor--he dedicated the 
last 20 years of his life largely to more peaceful pursuits such as solar 
power. This work was inspired by a fear shared by virtually all of his 
fellow solar inventors that coal supplies would someday end. In 1868 he 
wrote, "A couple of thousand years dropped in the ocean of time will 
completely exhaust the coal fields of Europe, unless, in the meantime, the 
heat of the sun be employed."</p>

<p>Thus by 1870 Ericsson had developed what he claimed to be the first 
solar-powered steam engine, dismissing Mouchout's machine as "a mere toy." 
In truth, Ericsson's first designs greatly resembled Mouchout's devices, 
employing a conical, dish-shaped reflector that concentrated solar 
radiation onto a boiler and a tracking mechanism that kept the reflector 
directed toward the sun. </p>

<p>Though unjustified in claiming his design original, Ericsson soon did 
invent a novel method for collecting solar rays--the parabolic trough. Unlike 
a true parabola, which focuses solar radiation onto a single, relatively small 
area, or focal point, like a satellite television dish, a parabolic trough is 
more akin to an oil drum cut in half lengthwise that focuses solar rays in a 
line across the open side of the reflector. This type of reflector offered 
many advantages over its circular (dish-shaped) counterparts: it was 
comparatively simple, less expensive to construct, and, unlike a circular 
reflector, had only to track the sun in a single direction (up and down, if 
lying horizontal, or east to west if standing on end), thus eliminating the 
need for complex tracking machinery. The downside was that the device's 
temperatures and efficiencies were not as high as with a dish-shaped 
reflector, since the configuration spread radiation over a wider area--a 
line rather than a point. Still, when Ericsson constructed a single linear 
boiler (essentially a pipe), placed it in the focus of the trough, 
positioned the new arrangement toward the sun, and connected it to a 
conventional steam engine, he claimed the machine ran successfully, though 
he declined to provide power ratings. <p>The new collection system became 
popular with later experimenters and eventually became a standard for 
modern plants.

In fact, the largest solar systems in the last decade have opted for 
Ericsson's parabolic trough reflector because it strikes a good engineering 
compromise between efficiency and ease of operation.</p><p>For the next 
decade, Ericsson continued to refine his invention, trying lighter materials
for the reflector and simplifying its construction. By 1888, he was so confident
of his design's practical performance that he planned to mass-produce and supply
the apparatus to the "owners of the sunburnt lands on the Pacific coast" for 
agricultural irrigation. </p><p>Unfortunately for the struggling discipline, 
Ericsson died the following year. And because he was a suspicious and, some 
said, paranoid man who kept his designs to himself until he filed patent 
applications, the detailed plans for his improved sun motor died with him. 
Nevertheless, the search for a practical solar motor was not abandoned. In 
fact, the experimentation and development of large-scale solar technology 
was just beginning. </p>

<h3>The First Commercial Venture</h3>

<p>Boston resident Aubrey Eneas began his solar motor experimentation in 1892, 
formed the first solar power company (The Solar Motor Co.) in 1900, and 
continued his work until 1905. One of his first efforts resulted in a 
reflector much like Ericsson's early parabolic trough. But Eneas found that 
it could not attain sufficiently high temperatures, and, unable to unlock 
his predecessor's secrets, decided to scrap the concept altogether and 
return to Mouchout's truncated-cone reflector. Unfortunately, while 
Mouchout's approach resulted in higher temperatures, Eneas was still 
dissatisfied with the machine's performance. His solution was to make 
the bottom of the reflector's truncated cone-shaped dish larger by 
designing its sides to be more upright to focus radiation onto a boiler that 
was 50 percent larger. </p><p>Finally satisfied with the results, he 
decided to advertise his design by exhibiting it in sunny Pasadena, 
Calif., at Edwin Cawston's ostrich farm, a popular tourist attraction. 
The monstrous machine did not fail to attract attention. Its reflector, 
which spanned 33 feet in diameter, contained 1,788 individual mirrors. 
And its boiler, which was about 13 feet in length and a foot wide, held 
100 gallons of water. After exposure to the sun, Eneas's device boiled the 
water and transferred steam through a flexible pipe to an engine that pumped 
1,400 gallons of water per minute from a well onto the arid California 
landscape. </p>

<p>Not everyone grasped the concept. In fact, one man thought the solar machine 
had something to do with the 
incubation of ostrich eggs. But Eneas's marketing savvy eventually paid 
off. Despite the occasional misconceptions, thousands who visited the 
farm left convinced that the sun machine would soon be a fixture in the sunny 
Southwest. Moreover, many regional newspapers and popular-science journals sent 
reporters to the farm to cover the spectacle. To Frank Millard, a reporter for 
the brand new magazine World's Work, the potential of solar motors placed in 
quantity across the land inspired futuristic visions of a region "where oranges 
may be growing, lemons yellowing, and grapes purpling, under the glare of the 
sun which, while it ripens the fruits it will also water and nourish them." He 
also predicted that the potential for this novel machine was not limited to 
irrigation: "If the sun motor will pump water, it will also grind grain and 
saw lumber and run electric cars." </p>

<p>The future, like the machine itself, looked bright and shiny. In 1903 Eneas, 
ready to market his solar motor, moved his Boston-based company to Los Angeles, 
closer to potential customers. By early the following year he had sold his 
first complete system for $2,160 to Dr. A. J. Chandler of Mesa, Ariz. 
Unfortunately,after less than a week, the rigging supporting the heavy boiler 
weakened during a windstorm and collapsed, sending it tumbling into the 
reflector and damaging the machine beyond repair. <p>But Eneas, accustomed 
to setbacks, decided to push onward and constructed another solar pump near 
Tempe, Ariz. Seven long months later, in the fall of 1904, John May, a rancher 
in Wilcox, Ariz., bought another machine for $2,500. Unfortunately, shortly 
afterward, it was destroyed by a hailstorm. This second weather-related 
incident all but proved that the massive parabolic reflector was too 
susceptible to the turbulent climactic conditions of the desert southwest. 
And unable to survive on such measly sales, the company soon folded. </p>

<p>Though the machine did not become a fixture as Eneas had hoped, the 
inventor contributed a great deal of scientific and technical data about 
solar heat conversion and initiated more than his share of public exposure. 
Despite his business failure, the lure of limitless fuel was strong, and 
while Eneas and the Solar Motor Company were suspending their operations, 
another solar pioneer was just beginning his. </p>

<h3>Moonlight Operation</h3>

<p>Henry E. Willsie began his solar motor construction a year before 
Eneas's company folded. In his opinion, the lessons of Mouchout, Adams, 
Ericsson, and Eneas proved the cost inefficiency of high-temperature, 
concentrating machines. He was convinced that a nonreflective, 
lower-temperature collection system similar to Tellier's invention was 
the best method for directly utilizing solar heat. The inventor also felt 
that a solar motor would never be practical unless it could operate 
around the clock. Thus thermal storage, a practice that lent itself to 
low-temperature operation, was the focus of his experimentation. </p>

<p>To store the sun's energy, Willsie built large flat-plate collectors 
that heated hundreds of gallons of water, which he kept warm all night 
in a huge insulated basin. He then submerged a series of tubes, or 
vaporizing pipes, inside the basin to serve as boilers. When the acting 
medium--Willsie preferred sulfur dioxide to Tellier's ammonia--passed 
through the pipes, it transformed into a high-pressure vapor, which passed 
to the engine, operated it, and exhausted into a condensing tube, where it 
cooled, returned to a liquid state, and was reused. </p>

<p>In 1904, confident that his design would produce continuous power, 
he built two plants, a 6-horsepower facility in St. Louis, Mo., and a 
15-horsepower operation in Needles, Calif. And after several power trials, 
Willsie decided to test the storage capacity of the larger system. After 
darkness had fallen, he opened a valve that "allowed the solar-heated water 
to flow over the exchanger pipes and thus start up the engine." Willsie had 
created the first solar device that could operate at night using the heat 
gathered during the day. He also announced that the 15-horsepower machine 
was the most powerful arrangement constructed up to that time. Beside 
offering a way to provide continuous solar power production, Willsie also 
furnished detailed cost comparisons to justify his efforts: the solar plant 
exacted a two-year payback period, he claimed, an exceptional value even 
when compared with today's standards for alternative energy technology. </p>

<p>Originally, like Ericsson and Eneas before him, Willsie planned to 
market his device for desert irrigation. But in his later patents Willsie 
wrote that the invention was "designed for furnishing power for electric 
light and power, refrigerating and ice making, for milling and pumping at 
mines, and for other purposes where large amounts of power are required."</p>

<p>Willsie determined all that was left to do was to offer his futurist 
invention for sale. Unfortunately, no buyers emerged. Despite the favorable 
long-term cost analysis, potential customers were suspicious of the 
machine's durability, deterred by the high ratio of machine size to power 
output, and fearful of the initial investment cost of Willsie's ingenious 
solar power plant. His company, like others before it, disintegrated.</p>

<h3>A Certain Technical Maturity</h3>

<p>Despite solar power's dismal commercial failures, some proponents 
continued to believe that if they could only find the right combination of 
solar technologies, the vision of a free and unlimited power source would 
come true. Frank Shuman was one who shared that dream. But unlike most 
dreamers, Shuman did not have his head in the clouds. In fact, his hardheaded 
approach to business and his persistent search for practical solar power led him 
and his colleagues to construct the largest and most cost-effective machine 
prior to the space age.</p><p>Shuman's first effort in 1906 was similar to 
Willsie's flat-plate collector design except that it employed ether as a working 
fluid instead of sulfur dioxide. The machine performed poorly, however, because 
even at respectable pressures, the steam--or more accurately, the vapor--exerted 
comparatively little force to drive a motor because of its low specific gravity. </p>

<p>Shuman knew he needed more heat to produce steam, but felt that using 
complicated reflectors and tracking devices would be too costly and prone to 
mechanical failure. He decided that rather than trying to generate more heat, 
the answer was to better conserve the heat already being absorbed. </p>

<p>In 1910, to improve the collector's insulation properties, Shuman enclosed 
the absorption plates not with a single sheet of glass but with dual panes 
separated by a one-inch air space. He also replaced the boiler pipes with 
a thin, flat metal container similar to Tellier's original greenhouse design. 
The apparatus could now consistently boil water rather than ether. 
Unfortunately, however, the pressure was still insufficient to drive 
industrial-size steam engines, which were designed to operate under 
pressures produced by hotter-burning coal or wood. </p>

<p>After determining that the cost of building a larger absorber would be 
prohibitive, Shuman reluctantly conceded that the additional heat would 
have to be provided through some form of concentration. He thus devised a 
low-cost reflector stringing together two rows of ordinary mirrors to 
double the amount of radiation intercepted. And in 1911, after forming 
the Sun Power Co., he constructed the largest solar conversion system 
ever built. In fact, the new plant, located near his home in Talcony, 
Penn., intercepted more than 10,000 square feet of solar radiation. 
The new arrangement increased the amount of steam produced, but still 
did not provide the pressure he expected. </p>

<p>Not easily defeated, Shuman figured that if he couldn't raise the 
pressure of the steam to run a conventional steam engine, he would 
have to redesign the engine to operate at lower pressures. So he 
teamed up with E.P. Haines, an engineer who suggested that more precise 
milling, closer tolerances in the moving components, and lighter-weight 
materials would do the trick. Haines was right. When the reworked 
engine was connected to the solar collectors, it developed 33 horsepower 
and drove a water pump that gushed 3,000 gallons per minute onto the 
Talcony soil. </p>

<p><img src = "Smith1.GIF"></p>

<p>Shuman calculated that the Talcony plant cost $200 per horsepower 
compared with the $80 of a conventionally operated coal system--a 
respectable figure, he pointed out, considering that the additional 
investment would be recouped in a few years because the fuel was free. 
Moreover, the fact that this figure was not initially competitive with 
coal or oil-fired engines in the industrial Northeast did not concern 
him because, like the French entrepreneurs before him, he was planning 
to ship the machine to the vast sunburnt regions in North Africa.</p>

<p>To buy property and move the machine there, new investors were 
solicited from England and the Sun Power Co. Ltd. was created. But 
with the additional financial support came stipulations. Shuman was 
required to let British physicist C. V. Boys review the workings of 
the machine and suggest possible improvements. In fact, the physicist 
recommended a radical change. Instead of flat mirrors reflecting the 
sun onto a flat-plate configuration, Boys thought that a parabolic 
trough focusing on a glass-encased tube would perform much better. 
Shuman's technical consultant A.S.E. Ackermann agreed, but added that 
to be effective, the trough would need to track the sun continuously. 
Shuman felt that his conception of a simple system was rapidly 
disintegrating. </p>

<p>Fortunately, when the machine was completed just outside of Cairo, 
Egypt, in 1912, Shuman's fears that the increased complexity would 
render the device impractical proved unfounded. The Cairo plant 
outperformed the Talcony model by a large margin--the machine produced 
33 percent more steam and generated more than 55 horsepower--which more 
than offset the higher costs. Sun Power Co.'s solar pumping station 
offered an excellent value of $150 per horsepower, significantly reducing 
the payback period for solar-driven irrigation in the region. It looked 
as if solar mechanical power had finally developed the technical 
sophistication it needed to compete with coal and oil.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the beginning was also the end. Two months after the 
final Cairo trials, Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in the Balkans, 
igniting the Great War. The fighting quickly spread to Europe's colonial 
holdings, and the upper regions of Africa were soon engulfed. Shuman's 
solar irrigation plant was destroyed, the engineers associated with the 
project returned to their respective countries to perform war-related 
tasks, and Frank Shuman died before the armistice was signed. </p>

<p>Whether or not Shuman's device would have initiated the commercial 
success that solar power desperately needed, we will never know. However, 
the Sun Power Co. can boast a certain technical maturity by effectively 
synthesizing the ideas of its predecessors from the previous 50 years. 
The company used an absorber (though in linear form) of Tellier and 
Willsie, a reflector similar to Ericsson's, simple tracking mechanisms 
first used by Mouchout and later employed by Eneas, and combined them 
to operate an engine specially designed to run with solar-generated 
steam. In effect, Shuman and his colleagues set the standard for many 
of the most popular modern solar systems 50 to 60 years before the fact.</p>

<h3>The Most Rational Source</h3>

<p>The aforementioned solar pioneers were only the most notable 
inventors involved in the development of solar thermal power from 1860 
to 1914. Many others contributed to the more than 50 patents and the 
scores of books and articles on the subject. With all this sophistication, 
why couldn't solar mechanical technology blossom into a viable industry? 
Why did the discipline take a 50-year dive before again gaining a measure 
of popular interest and technical attention? </p>

<p>First, despite the rapid advances in solar mechanical technology, the 
industry's future was rendered problematic by a revolution in the use and 
transport of fossil fuels. Oil and coal companies had established a massive 
infrastructure, stable markets, and ample supplies. Also, besides trying 
to perfect the technology, solar pioneers had the difficult task of convincing 
skeptics to see solar energy as something more than a curiosity. Visionary 
rhetoric without readily tangible results was not well received by a 
population accustomed to immediate gratification. Improving and adapting 
existing power technology, deemed less risky and more controlled, seemed to 
make far more sense. </p>

<p>Finally, the ability to implement radically new hardware requires 
either massive commitment or the failure of existing technology to get the 
job done. Solar mechanical power production in the late nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries did not meet either criterion. Despite warnings from 
noted scientists and engineers, alternatives to what seemed like an 
inexhaustible fuel supply did not fit into the U.S. agenda. Unfortunately, 
in many ways, these antiquated sentiments remain with us today. During 
the 1970s, while the OPEC nations exercised their economic power and as 
the environmental and "no-nuke" movements gained momentum, Americans plotted 
an industrial coup whose slogans were energy efficiency and renewable 
resources. Consequently, mechanical solar power--along with its 
space-age, electricity-producing sibling photovoltaics, as well as other 
renewable sources such as wind power--underwent a revival. And during 
the next two decades, solar engineers tried myriad techniques to satisfy 
society's need for power. </p>

<p>They discovered that dish-shaped reflectors akin to Mouchout's and 
Eneas's designs were the most efficient but also the most expensive and 
difficult to maintain. Low-temperature, nonconcentrating systems like 
Willsie's and Tellier's, though simple and less sensitive to climatic 
conditions, were among the least powerful and therefore suited only to 
small, specific tasks. Stationary reflectors like those used in Adams's 
device, now called Power Tower systems, offered a better solution but 
were still pricey and damage prone. </p>

<p>By the mid-1980s, contemporary solar engineers, like their 
industrial-revolution counterparts Ericsson and Shuman, determined that 
for sunny areas, tracking parabolic troughs were the best compromise 
because they exhibited superior cost-to-power ratios in most locations. 
Such efforts led engineers at the Los Angeles-based Luz Co. to construct 
an 80-megawatt electric power plant using parabolic trough collectors to 
drive steam-powered turbines. The company had already used similar 
designs to build nine other solar electric generation facilities, providing 
a total of 275 megawatts of power. In the process, Luz engineers steadily 
lowered the initial costs by optimizing construction techniques and taking 
advantage of economiesof buying material in bulk to build ever-larger 
plants until the price dropped from 24 to 12 cents per kilowatt hour. 
The next, even larger plant--a 300-megawatt facility--scheduled for 
completion last year, promised to provide 6 to 7 cents per kilowatt 
hour, near the price of electricity produced by coal, oil, or nuclear 
technology. </p>

<p>Once again, as with Shuman and his team, the gap was closing. But once 
again these facilities would not be built. Luz, producer of more than 95 
percent of the world's solar-based electricity, filed for bankruptcy in 
1991. According to Newton Becker, Luz's chairman of the board, and other 
investors, the demise of the already meager tax credits, declining fossil 
fuel prices, and the bleak prospects for future assistance from both federal 
and state governments drove investors to withdraw from the project. As 
Becker concluded, "The failure of the world's largest solar electric 
company was not due to technological or business judgment failures but 
rather to failures of government regulatory bodies to recognize the economic 
and environmental benefits of solar thermal generating plants." </p>

<p>Other solar projects met with similar financial failure. For example, 
two plants that employed the tower power concept, Edison's 10-megawatt 
plant in Daggett, Calif., and a 30-megawatt facility built in Jordan 
performed well despite operating on a much smaller scale and without 
Luz's advantages of heavy initial capital investment and a lengthy 
trial-and-error process to improve efficiency. Still they were assessed 
as too costly to compete in the intense conventional fuel market. </p>

<p>Although some of our brightest engineers have produced some exemplary 
solar power designs during the past 25 years, their work reflects a 
disjointed solar energy policy. Had the findings of the early solar 
pioneers and the evolution of their machinery been more closely 
scrutinized, perhaps by Department of Energy officials or some other 
oversight committee, contemporary efforts might have focused on building 
a new infrastructure when social and political attitudes were more 
receptive to solar technology. Rather than rediscovering the technical 
merits of the various systems, we might have been better served by 
reviewing history, selecting a relatively small number of promising 
systems, and combining them with contemporary materials and construction 
techniques. Reinventing the wheel when only the direction of the cart 
seems suspect is certainly not the best way to reach one's destination. </p>

<p>While the best period to make our energy transition may have passed 
and though our energy future appears stable, the problems that initiated 
the energy crisis of the 1970s have not disappeared. Indeed, the 
instability of OPEC and the recent success in the Gulf War merely 
created an artificial sense of security about petroleum supplies. 
While we should continue to develop clean, efficient petroleum and 
coal technology while our present supplies are plentiful, this approach 
should not dominate our efforts. 

Alternative, renewable energy technologies must eventually be implemented 
in tandem with their fossil-fuel counterparts. Not doing so would simply 
provide an excuse for maintaining the status quo and beg for economic 
disruption when reserves run low or political instability again erupts 
in oil-rich regions. </p>

<p>Toward that end, we must change the prevailing attitude that solar 
power is an infant field born out of the oil shocks and the environmental 
movement of the past 25 years. Such misconceptions lead many to assert 
that before solar power can become a viable alternative, the industry 
must first pay its dues with a fair share of technological evolution.</p>

<p>Solar technology already boasts a century of R&D, requires no toxic 
fuel and relativelylittle maintenance, is inexhaustible, and, with 
adequate financial support, is capable of becoming directly competitive 
with conventional technologies in many locations. These attributes make 
solar energy one of the most promising sources for many current and 
future energy needs. As Frank Shuman declared more than 80 years ago, 
it is "the most rational source of power." </p>

Dear Prospective Reviewer:
<p>
The U. S. Government has received a draft for review of the IPCC Second Assessment 
Synthesis Report. Drawing from the three IPCC reports, this synthesis report is intended to 
provide an integrated and comprehensive perspective of the knowledge relevant to the 
interpretation of Article 2 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Although 
the individual working group reports have not yet been completed, to meet the IPCC 
schedule, it is necessary that the initial review of the synthesis report occur at this time. 
This office is collating comments to be considered for the U.S. Government review and is 
not the mechanism to be used for individual reviews.  
</p>

THIS  IS A DRAFT DOCUMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR DISTRIBUTED.  
<p>
The report includes 14 figures and several tables which could not be downloaded onto the 
Web.  While it may be somewhat difficult to review the synthesis report without approved 
versions of the Summaries for Policymakers from the three working groups, they are 
currently being revised and are not available.  However, the Synthesis report will be 
updated as these documents change.  Despite these difficulties, we believe it is important to 
participate at this stage in this review process and to comment on both the broad structure 
of the report and the detailed presentation of information.
</p>
Comments must be received by the USGCRP office by noon on September 6. Because this 
date provides for less than  a week for us to assemble and integrate the comments and send 
forth a set of U. S. Government comments, this deadline is very firm. It would be most 
helpful if comments could be sent via email to office@usgcrp.gov, or please deliver an 
electronic disc to the address above. 
<p>
Comments should be divided into general comments which should come first, and then 
specific comments. List page and line numbers for each suggestion or explanation for a 
specific working change.  If you do not have a paper copy available for referral to line 
numbers, list page and paragraph numbers so we can understand where they should be 
inserted. Please provide your name, affiliation, address, telephone and fax numbers, and 
email address with your submission. If you need a paper copy contact Ms. Sandra Vaughn-
Cooke at 202-651-8250 (fax: 202-554-6715; email office@usgcrp.gov).

THE IPCC ASSESSMENT OF KNOWLEDGE
RELEVANT TO THE INTERPRETATION OF
ARTICLE 2 OF THE UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE 
CHANGE: 
A SYNTHESIS REPORT
1995


Draft Summary for Policymakers

1. Introduction

1.1 The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change recognizes that 
human activities could alter the Earth's climate. Its ultimate objective as 
expressed in its Article 2 is:

"... stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level 
that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate 
system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow 
ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change and to ensure that food 
production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in 
a sustainable manner". 

1.2 A determination of what concentrations of greenhouse gases are 
"dangerous" is a policy judgement. This summary provides an assessment of 
scientific and technical information for policymakers in their consideration of 
Article 2. It is based on the IPCC reports of 1994 and 1995.

2. Is There Evidence that Human Activities are Changing the Climate? 

2.1 Human activities are causing increases in atmospheric concentrations of 
greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, and of aerosols 
(tiny airborne particles) . Greenhouse gases warm the atmosphere while 
aerosols tend to cool it. The cooling effect of aerosols is regional because of 
the regional nature of their distributions.

2.2 Comparing the observed change in the global mean temperature with model 
simulations suggests that the observed increase over the last century (0.3 C - 
0.6 C) is unlikely to be entirely due to natural causes and that a pattern of 
climatic response to human activities is identifiable in the climatological record. 
It is more difficult to determine whether global precipitation has changed; 
increases are evident in some places but not in others. On a global scale, there 
is little evidence of sustained trends in variability or extremes of weather events 
such as hurricanes and floods. On regional scales, there is clear evidence of 
changes in them.

3. How is Climate Projected to Change in the Absence of Mitigation Policies? 

3.1 Based on inputs such as population, economic growth, land-use, 
technological change and energy availability, and assuming no climate change 
policies, the IPCC developed a range of emissions scenarios - the so-called 
IPCC IS 92 scenarios. For these scenarios, carbon dioxide emissions in the 
year 2100 are projected to be in the range of about 6 GtC per year (for low 
population projections), similar to current emissions, to as much as 36 GtC per 
year. Cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide for the same scenarios for the 
period 1990-2100 would range from 700 to 2080 GtC (compared to 240 GtC 
for 1860-1994). The wide range in the projections reflects different prevailing 
views on population and economic growths and other factors. 

3.2 Climate models, using the IS 92 scenarios, project an increase in the global 
mean temperature of 0.8 C to 3.5 C by 2100, the range in the projections 
arising from uncertainties in climate processes and future greenhouse gas 
emissions. (The range would be 0.8 C-4.6 C if aerosols were excluded in the 
models.) However, only 50-70% of the eventual equilibrium temperature 
change would have been realized by that time. These temperature changes are 
expected to be accompanied by changes in the regional and temporal patterns 
and intensity of rainfall (increased tendency for both floods and droughts) and, 
by the year 2100, an increase in the global mean sea-level of 0.1 to 0.8 m (0.1 
to 1.2 m if aerosols were excluded in the models). These projections indicate 
changes more rapid than any experienced in the last 10,000 years, the current 
interglacial when modern society has evolved. Even if atmospheric 
concentrations of the greenhouse gases were immediately stabilized, society 
would be committed to a further increase in temperature of 0.5 C-2 C.

3.3 Ability to project climate changes at the regional level remains low. 

4. How Vulnerable are Ecological and Socio-Economic Systems and Human 
Health to Climate Change?

4.1 Quantitative projections of the impacts of the magnitude and rate of climate 
change on any particular ecological or socio-economic system are difficult 
because (i) regional scale climate change predictions are more uncertain than 
global climate change, (ii) our understanding of many critical processes is 
limited and (iii) the systems areinfluenced by multiple environmental and non-
environmental stresses. Various aspects of climate affect ecosystems and 
socio-economic systems differently: some systems are sensitive to a change in 
mean climate, some to changes in the frequency and severity of extreme 
weather events, some to the rate of change and some to changes in climate 
variability.

4.2 Most impact studies have only dealt with how systems would respond to a 
climate change resulting from a (arbitrary) doubling of atmospheric carbon 
dioxide concentration over its pre-industrial level. Few have considered the 
evolving responses of systems to steadily increasing greenhouse gas 
concentrations over the corresponding period, and fewer still have examined 
the consequences of greenhouse gas increases beyond this arbitrary doubling.

4.3 While there would be some beneficial effects of climate change, there 
would be many adverse effects, with some being potentially irreversible, e.g., 
loss of biological diversity and land. While population increases and human 
decisions about land use and harvesting intensities potentially represent the 
greatest pressures on most terrestrial and marine ecosystems in the foreseeable 
future, climate change represents an important additional stress factor which 
could result in the following impacts. 

a. Natural ecosystems: The boundaries of most ecosystems would shift with 
possible loss of biological diversity and affecting the goods and services 
ecosystem types (e.g., forests, grasslands, savannah) provide society. For 
example: even a rate of temperature change as low as 0.1 C per decade (the 
lower end of the range of IPCC projections), if sustained for a century, would 
result in significant loss of forest tree species as they cannot migrate quickly 
enough to keep pace; changes of a few degrees in temperature can result in the 
loss of species in the upper elevations of montane systems because no 
migration would be feasible for them as climate warms. 

b. Food security: There may be significant adverse consequences for food 
security in some regions of the world even though the current assessment has 
confirmed the 1990 IPCC conclusion that the aggregate effects of climate 
change on global agricultural production may be small to moderate. Studies 
tend to show more negative impacts for areas in the tropics where many of the 
world's poorest people live and where individuals are at greatest risk of 
hunger.

c. Sustainable economic development: Sustainable economic development in 
some countries will be threatened by loss of habitat, increases in human 
diseases and loss of life. Some human habitats are likely to be destroyed by sea 
level rise and possible change in extreme weather events, causing migration of 
populations and placing additional stresses on already stressed social and 
political systems. For human health, a critical issue is the projected increase in 
the incidence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, especially in tropical 
and subtropical countries, and increased periods of severe heat stress in 
temperate zones.

4.4 Because both the rate and magnitude of climate change are important, the 
rates of change of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may be as 
important as stabilization levels. Non-disruptive adaptation in the structure and 
functioning of natural ecosystems and agriculture and other socio- economic 
systems is more likely, but not assured, with a slow rate of climate change. 
Rapid changes, on the other hand, may preclude non-disruptive adaptation.

4.5 Adaptation strategies for managed systems such as agriculture and water 
supply are generally improving because of technological advances. These 
advances, however, are not available in many parts of the world. In contrast, 
measures to assist adaptation in unmanaged ecosystems, such as provision of 
migration corridors, are not well developed.

4.6 The vulnerability of human health and socio-economic systems, and to a 
lesser extent of ecological systems, depends upon economic circumstances and 
institutional infrastructure. This implies that systems are typically more 
vulnerable in developing countries where technologies are fewer and less 
advanced and financial resources more scarce.

4.7 Incorporation of environmental concerns into resource-use and 
development decisions will enhance society's resilience to climate change. 

5. How do Emissions Relate to Levels of Stabilization of Greenhouse Gases? 

5.1 The Convention in Article 3 provides that the type of strategy used in 
reaching its objective should be comprehensive, covering all relevant sources, 
sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The individual radiative forcing 
(radiative forcing drives climate change) due to increases in the concentrations 
of different greenhouse gases - CO2, CH4, N2O and halocarbons and thereby 
implicitly stratospheric ozone - can be combined and the total expressed in 
terms of an "equivalent" CO2 concentration. This concept is helpful in 
analysing the comprehensive approach. 

5.2 Carbon cycle models can be used to estimate emission profiles and 
cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide for various stabilization levels. Such 
estimates have been made for an illustrative set of CO2 stabilization levels 
ranging from 450 ppmv to 750 ppmv. Table 1 shows the cumulative 
emissions. The cumulative emissions could be distributed in different ways 
over the time until stabilization: higher emissions earlier with lower emissions 
later or vice versa, for example. 

5.3 The cumulative emissions in table 1 are illustrated for two cases: with and 
without projected increases in methane and nitrous oxide until 2050 in 
accordance with IS 92a scenario. Accepting, for example, continued growth in 
the emissions of these gases would significantly reduce the room for 
cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide for a given stabilization level of 
"equivalent" carbon dioxide. 

5.4 Table 2 shows the cumulative emissions for all IS 92 scenarios. These 
figures together with table 1 suggest that to stabilize "equivalent" carbon 
dioxide at 750 ppmv would require emissions to be much lower than the 
central IS 92a (and IS92b) scenarios. Stabilization of "equivalent" carbon 
dioxide at 550 ppmv (about twice the pre-industrial level) or lower would 
require emissions to be lower than any of the IS 92 scenarios except IS 92c 
(where a low increase of world population to 6.3 billion in 2100 is assumed). 

5.5 Stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations at any of the arbitrary levels 
explored above would be possible only if anthropogenic emissions were 
eventually reduced well below 1990 levels. It is possible to choose other 
stabilization levels and time scales and pathways for achieving them.

5.6 The global average annual per capita emissions of carbon dioxide due to 
the combustion of fossil fuels is at present about 1.1 tonnes (as carbon). In 
addition, about 0.2 (net) tonnes are emitted per capita from deforestation and 
land-use changes. The average annual fossil fuel per capita emissions in 
developed countries is about 2.8 tonnes and

varies from 1.5 to 5.5 tonnes. This compares to the figure of 0.5 tonnes for the 
same parameter in developing countries, ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 (in some 
cases more) tonnes. 

5.7 Given cumulative emissions and population figures, global annual average 
per capita carbon emissions can be derived. As an illustration, for the median 
UN population projections, the future average annual per capita use of fossil 
fuel cannot much exceed the current global average if the atmospheric 
concentration of carbon dioxide is to remain below 550 ppmv. Annual average 
per capita emissions would be higher for stabilization levels above 750 ppmv, 
but still less than 2 tonnes.

6. Technology and Policy Options Available to Approach the Objective of the 
Convention

6.1 An extensive array of technologies and policy measures capable of 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions is available. However, there are social, 
institutional, financial, market, and legislative barriers to their application and 
implementation. Hence their technical potential may not be fully realized. 

a. Energy Supply: Emissions from the supply sector can be substantially 
reduced by:

- more efficient conversion of fossil fuels; - increased use of low carbon fossil 
fuels, by switching from coal to oil to 
natural gas;
- decarbonizing flue gases and fuels coupled with carbon dioxide storage; - 
increased use of renewable sources of energy, in particular biomass, solar, 
wind, hydropower, and geothermal;
- switching to nuclear energy.

b. Energy Demand: The technical potential for energy efficiency improvements 
in the industry, transport and human settlements sectors is large. It is estimated 
to be 10-30% globally at little or no cost, and, if relevant technologies and 
financing become available, 50-60% in developing countries. Options include: 

- Industry: improved electric motor drives and heating systems, efficient use 
of materials and integrating local heat and power systems; - Transport: 
changing vehicle design to use more efficient drivetrains, body 
shapes and materials, switching energy sources for propulsion, altering land-
use and traffic patterns, transport systems and life styles to reduce the level of 
passenger and freight transport activity and shifting to less energy intensive 
transportation modes;
- Human Settlements: more efficient space-conditioning systems, reduced 
heat losses through walls, ceilings and windows and more efficient lighting 
and appliances including refrigerators, water heaters, cook stoves, etc. 

c. Enhancement of Sinks: Management of agricultural lands, rangelands and 
forests can play an important role in reducing emissions and/or enhancing the 
sinks of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Agricultural lands and 
forests can also be used to provide biomass fuels to replace fossil fuels. 
Estimates of the total amount of carbon that could be sequestered in the forestry 
and agriculture sectors over the next 50 years range from 90 to 155 GtC, 
which is equivalent to 8 to 40% of projected emissions in IS 92a scenario over 
the same period. Emissions can be reduced and atmospheric carbon can be 
sequestered at an estimated cost of $2-$8 per tonne (excluding land costs) 
through measures such as:

- altered management of agricultural soils and rangelands; - restoration of 
degraded agricultural lands and rangelands; - slowing deforestation;
- natural forest generation;
- establishment of tree plantations for biomass fuels and fibre; - promoting 
agroforestry.

6.6 Population and economic growth will drive future food and energy 
demands. The potential of the agricultural and forestry mitigation options needs 
to be further assessed in the context of competition for land in the face of such 
demands. 

6.9 Several policy instruments are available to facilitate penetration of low 
carbon intensive technologies and the modification of consumption patterns. 
The optimum mix of instruments will vary from country to country and could 
include: 

- labelling;
- market pull and demonstration programmes that stimulate the development 
and application of advanced technologies; - incentives such as provision for 
accelerated depreciation and reduced cost 
to consumer;
- utility demand-side management;
- negotiated agreements with industry;
- energy pricing (e.g., carbon or energy taxes) and reduced fossil fuel 
subsidies;
- tradeable emissions permits;
- regulatory programmes including minimum energy efficiency standards and 
fuel economy standards;
- reduction of agricultural subsidies.

7. Factors in Decision-Making

7.1 Article 2 provides the framework for cooperative decision-making in the 
international arena.

7.2 The uncertainties in the knowledge base make it difficult to assess the risks 
posed by anthropogenic climate change quantitatively. The inherent time lags 
between greenhouse gas emissions and climatic response and between climate 
change and ecosystems' adaptability (with potential irreversible impacts), and 
the lead times for infrastructure and capital turnover and for national and 
international political processes to come to fruition, need to be taken into 
account in making decisions. 

7.3 Action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could have other benefits such 
as reduced traffic congestion, air pollution and soil erosion. The market and 
no-market value of such secondary benefits depends upon local circumstances, 
but can be considerable. Action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are likely 
to be more acceptable if designed to address simultaneously other concerns that 
impede sustainable development, and be more effective if tailored to local 
situations and developed through consultations with stakeholders.

7.3 Impacts and the costs of mitigation and adaptation will vary within and 
among countries raising issues of intranational, international and 
intergenerational equity. Perceived equity is an important element for 
legitimizing decisions and promoting national and international cooperation.

7.4 A sequential decision-making approach offers a prudent strategy that can 
be adjusted in the light of new information and could take into account factors 
such as future flexibility and current and future costs. Near term decisions 
along an optimal path (i.e., modest cost mitigation measures) will be the same 
for a wide range of ultimate stabilization concentrations.7.5 A broad portfolio 
of actions aimed at mitigation, adaptation and reducing uncertainties through 
further research provides a balanced approach to managing the risks of 
anthropogenic climate change. The appropriate portfolio will differ from 
country to country. A well-chosen portfolio of climate change investments will 
yield greater benefit for a given cost than any one option undertaken by itself. 

7.6 Delaying action might reduce the overall costs of mitigation, but would 
increase both the adaptation and damage costs because of the rate and the 
eventual magnitude of climate change.

7.7 Stabilizing CO2 concentrations, for example, near or below even 750 
ppmv would require immediate initiation of near term actions that include: 

(i) research and development on energy efficiency improvements, alternative 
sources of energy and strategies to accelerate diffusion of new technologies 
into the market place;
(ii) policies to encourage replacement of long-lived energy, transportation, and 
industrial infrastructure in normal investment cycles with plant and equipment 
that provides the highest amount of service and the lowest greenhouse gas 
emissions per unit of input energy and materials;
(iii) research and monitoring to promote a better understanding of the climate 
system and the impacts of climate variability; (iv) action on other measures 
with multiple benefits and no or low cost. 

7.11 "No regrets" measures are those whose benefits, such as reduced energy 
costs and lower emissions of local and regional pollutants, equal or exceed 
their cost to society, excluding the benefits of mitigation of climate change. 
Such "no regrets" mitigation and adaptation measures would appear justified 
on technical grounds unrelated to the risks of rapid climate change due to 
greenhouse gases. The expectation of net damages from climate change and the 
precautionary principle provide a rationale for going beyond "no regrets".

THE IPCC ASSESSMENT OF KNOWLEDGE
RELEVANT TO THE INTERPRETATION OF
ARTICLE 2 OF THE UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE 
CHANGE: 
A SYNTHESIS REPORT
1995




1.1 Since the last Ice Age, generations of human beings have adapted their 
settlements, agriculture, water use, responses to health hazards and commercial 
activities to current climate (temperature and rainfall) and soils. Nonetheless 
there are losses incurred yearly due to variability in climate and large losses 
incurred frequently as a result of extreme weather events such as floods, 
storms and droughts. Human-induced climate change would be a stress, in 
some cases a major stress, that would add to existing stresses such as 
population and the non-sustainable exploitation of natural resources. A large 
and/or rapid change in climate is likely to affect the distribution and availability 
of these resources.

1.2 Assessments of climate change in the last decade have consistently 
concluded that human activities are significantly changing the composition of 
the atmosphere so that a climate change will occur if greenhouse gases (GHGs) 
continue to be emitted at current or greater rates of emission. However, 
scientists are as yet not confident about how climate will change regionally nor 
about its impacts. 

1.3 In recognition of these concerns, governments have negotiated, signed and 
ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereinafter called 
the Convention). The Convention has entered into force. Its objective is 
expressed in Article 2 (see box 1).



Box 1

The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that 
the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas 
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous 
anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be 
achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally 
to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to 
enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.



1.4 A determination of what concentrations of GHGs are "dangerous" 
inherently requires policy judgements. It is not the role of the IPCC to make 
such a determination. But the IPCC assessments can provide useful 
information on questions such as: the projected response of the climate system 
to different scenarios of future GHG emissions; the vulnerability of natural and 
socio-economic systems to changes in climate; potential outcomes under 
different timings and levels of stabilization of GHG concentrations; and 
technological and economic policy options available to reduce future GHG 
emissions and their effectiveness and associated costs and their distributions. 
The report is based on the contributions of the three IPCC Working Groups to 
the IPCC Second Assessment Report.

1.5 The elements and their interactions within and between the global climate 
system and the global socio-economic system are shown in figure 1. The upper 
part details the interactions in the climate system and the lower part focuses on 
the human system. 


FIGURE 1














Increasing Greenhouse Gas Concentrations, Radiative Forcing and Changes in 
Climate and Sea Level

2.1 There is agreement that the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs have 
increased globally due to human activities (see table 1). As a result, the 
radiative balance between the Earth and the atmosphere has changed. This 
change can be expressed in terms of a radiative forcing of global climate (see 
figure 2). 

2.2 Small particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) arising from sulphur emissions 
from industrial sources and from biomass burning also have an important 
effect on radiative forcing. In contrast to most GHGs whose atmospheric 
lifetimes can vary from years to centuries, the aerosols have very short 
lifetimes (a few days). The concentrations of aerosols are therefore determined 
by current emissions. 

2.3 Substantial uncertainty surrounds not only the future concentrations of 
aerosols (because the severe environmental problems of high sulphur 
emissions are causes of concern) but also the physical mechanisms governing 
their radiative forcing. Further, aerosols are very inhomogeneous in their 
geographical distribution. It is important therefore to distinguish between the 
effects of long-living greenhouse gases and those of aerosols.

2.3 Changes in global mean surface temperature and sea level are simple 
indicators of changes in mean climate. Global mean surface temperature (land 
and ocean) has increased by between 0.3 C and 0.6 C since the late 19th 
century and by 0.2 C to 0.3 c over the last 40 years, the period with the most 
reliable data (figure 3). Urbanization and land degradation account for only 
about 0.05 C of this increase. The warming has not been globally uniform: 
summer temperatures In the Northern Hemisphere in recent decades have been 
the warmest since about 1200 A.D; in some small regions (e.g., Northwestern 
North Atlantic), cooling has been observed. Over much of the land mass, the 
warming is associated with warmer nights rather than warmer days, although 
warmer days are also occurring. Figure 3 shows observed variability of 
surface temperature on interannual and decadal time scales which is similar to 
model estimates even when radiative forcing is absent. This variability arises 
from interactions between different components of the climate system and 
serves to mask trends due to systematic changes in radiative forcing.

(FIGURE 3)

2.4 It is more difficult to determine whether global mean precipitation has 
changed. Increases are evident in some places but not in others. 

2.5 Increasing surface temperature melts ice on land and warms the oceans. 
Thermal expansion of ocean waters and the water flowing from melting ice on 
land raises the level of the sea. (Melting sea ice does not raise the sea level.) 
Global mean sea level has risen by between 10 to 25 cm over the past 100 
years. About half of this rise could be due to melting glaciers and sea water 
expansion. The remainder could come from melting of large ice sheets but this 
is not conclusive. 

2.6 There have been both increases and decreases in extremes and variability of 
weather events during the last several decades. These changes have often been 
associated with the El NiÛo - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. 
However, data are inadequate at present to determine whether there have been 
world-wide changes in variability and extremes.

2.7 An important question is whether the rise in the global mean temperature 
over the past century can be explained as natural variability or whether there is 
an identifiable contribution from human activities. Compared to the warming 
projected by models (see paragraph 3.1 also) which take account of the 
increase of greenhouse gases alone, the observed warming is smaller. But if 
the effects of aerosols are included in the models, projections agree better with 
observations. Comparisons of the patterns of the observed warming with 
model projections have also been performed. These comparisons find much 
unexplained variation, but agreement is generally better with model patterns 
that include both aerosols and greenhouse gases than those which include 
greenhouse gases alone.

2.8 Overall, the best evidence to-date suggests that global mean temperature 
changes over the last century are unlikely to be entirely due to natural causes, 
and that a pattern of climatic response to human activities is identifiable in the 
climatological record.



3.1 Scenarios of future anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (and 
their precursors) and the precursors of aerosols are used as inputs for models 
that project future climates. Starting from emissions, it is possible to calculate 
future atmospheric concentrations on the basis of atmospheric chemistry and 
global carbon cycle models. Radiative forcing, which is the fundamental 
variable used by climate models, is linked to greenhouse gas concentrations 
through well-established physical relationships. Radiative forcing due to 
aerosols can also be calculated, but with greater uncertainty than for 
greenhouse gases.

Projected Future Emissions of Greenhouse Gases and Aerosols (Emission 
scenarios)

3.2 In the absence of policies specifically designed to reduce anthropogenic 
GHG emissions, their atmospheric concentrations will increase. The key 
factors that determine future GHG emissions include population increase, 
energy demand, difficulties in moving away from fossil fuels giving rise to 
continuing heavy dependence on them, pressure on forests , increased use of 
private vehicles, etc. These various factors are assumed inputs in deriving 
plausible scenarios of future GHG emissions and contain uncertainties due to 
differing views on their future values and changes. Emission scenarios, which 
are not predictions, are divided into those which set out their projections in the 
absence of mitigation measures and those which take into account mitigation 
and adaptation measures.

3.3 The results of emission scenarios can vary considerably from actual 
outcomes even over short time horizons because the confidence in the 
applicability of their underlying assumptions diminishes as the time horizon 
increases. Therefore, an informed assessment of the possible consequences of 
uncertain future emissions paths necessitates the use of a range of scenarios. 

3.4 A set of six emissions scenarios, the so-called IS92 scenarios a through f, 
are presented in the IPCC 1992 Supplement to illustrate a range of plausible 
future emissions. The scenarios assume no new policies to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions (and are thus non-intervention scenarios as far as climate change 
is concerned). They extend to the year 2100 and include emissions of CO2, 
CH4, N2O, the halocarbons (CFCs and their substitutes HCFCs and HFCs) 
and sulphur emissions from industry and biomass burning.

3.5 The scenario of highest emissions (IS 92e) assumes high economic 
growth, moderate population growth, high fossil fuel availability and a phase-
out of nuclear power. The IS 92a scenario provides a central case (not 
necessarily the most likely case) projection of global emissions. Use of coal is 
assumed to increase with time and renewable energy sources are assumed to 
replace fossil fuels only to a modest degree. Its world population projection is 
close to the medium projections of three international organizations and global 
economic growth assumptions are close to the average of other published 
scenarios. The IS 92c and IS 92d scenarios assume constraints on economic 
growth and fossil fuel use and low population projection of 6.4 billion in 2100 
(for reference, current world population is 5.8 billion) and hence have low 
emissions. A summary of the assumptions in the scenarios is given in table 2. 

TABLE 2

3.6 Most published emission scenarios (including the IS 92 scenarios) show 
an increase in global annual greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2, over 
the next century. Virtually the only exceptions are scenarios which either 
incorporate very low population projections or policy measures. 

3.7 To understand the potential impact of climate change policies on emissions 
and resulting concentrations of greenhouse gases, it is illustrative to consider 
emission scenarios that explicitly include different policy options. These 
options may contain measures specifically directed at climate change mitigation 
or measures which have much the same effect although differently motivated 
(e.g. intended to mitigate local and regional air pollution). The World Energy 
Council (WEC) developed emissions cases based on a medium population 
projection (11.3 billion by 2100), economic growth assumptions with faster 
(5.6% p.a) and slower (4.6% p.a.) possibilities for developing countries, 
adjustments of the official GDP for purchasing power parity rather than market 
exchange rates, alternative assumptions about the pace of future energy 
efficiency improvements and alternative fuel mix possibilities in the light of 
known reserves. 

3.8 Two of the WEC scenarios imply atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 
600 ppmv by 2100 (one around 450 ppmv), and even their high growth case 
implies concentration below 700 ppmv. These and other studies illustrate the 
scope for policy measures - not necessarily solely based on climate change 
mitigation - directed at raising energy efficiency, accelerating the diffusion of 
non-fossil forms of energy, and reducing local and regional expected damages, 
so far as feasible, arising from conversion and use of fossil fuels.

3.9 In figures 5 (a) and 5 (b) are shown the concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in 
the IS 92 emission scenarios. It is evident that these non-intervention scenarios 
lead to rising concentrations of the greenhouse gases. 

FIGURE 5 (a)


FIGURE 5 (b)

3.7 Atmospheric concentrations of key long-lived greenhouse gases (such as 
CO2) at a given time are determined, to a first approximation, by the 
cumulative emissions up to that time. Cumulative emissions have a smaller 
range than annual emissions. Cumulative CO2 emissions for the years 1990 to 
2100 in the IS92 scenarios range between 700 and 2080 GtC and between 230 
and 330 GtC for 1990 - 2025. For comparison, emissions due to fossil fuel 
use between 1860 and 1994 amounted to 240 GtC (215 GtC for 1860 - 1990) 
and due to deforestation and changing land use to 80 - 120 GtC. On 
comparable (medium) population projections, the WEC cases indicate a range 
of 2.5 to 6 times past CO2 emissions (see figure 6). 

FIGURE 6

3.11 The emissions of sulphur dioxide, which are transformed into sulphate 
aerosols, depend primarily upon the sulphur content of oil and coal burned. 
The IS92 emissions scenarios assume that the anthropogenic sulphur 
emissions in 1990 amounted to about 80 TgS or million tonnes (for 
comparison, about 25 TgS were emitted from natural sources). This was 
projected to increase to 85, 115 and 130 TgS/yr respectively for the IS 92c, IS 
92a and IS 92e scenarios in 2050 and to 60, 140 and 200 TgS/yr in 2100. 
These estimates are quite uncertain, but are the only ones available for use in 
projecting the future radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols. 

Projected Changes in Global Mean Temperature and Mean Sea Level 

3.12 Future changes of climate due to human activities are estimated by first 
deriving patterns of radiative forcing from scenarios of atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols. The detailed response to 
these patterns of radiative forcing is obtained from models of the climate which 
take into account the physical and dynamical processes in all components of the 
climate system (atmosphere, ocean, land, ice and biosphere) and the 
interactions (most of which are non-linear) between them. Key to these model 
descriptions are feedbacks which act either to amplify or to reduce the basic 
radiative forcing signal. Because of our limited knowledge of these feedbacks, 
especially those involving clouds, considerable uncertainty remains in 
estimates of future climate change. Further uncertainty is associated with the 
role of the ocean which, because of its large heat capacity, acts to slow down 
the climate response to radiative forcing; the ocean also, through its ability to 
redistribute heat within the climate system, has an important role in determining 
the spatial patterns of climate change. 

3.13 Many model estimates of climate change have been made for the particular 
case of an equilibrium atmospheric state in which the radiative forcing is 
increased to that which would occur if the CO2 concentration were doubled 
over its pre-industrial value (such an estimate is known as the climate 
sensitivity). The IPCC assessments in 1990, 1992 and 1995 reported that the 
global average temperature rise for doubled CO2 at equilibrium is most likely 
to be in the range of 1.5 C - 4.5 C with a best estimate of 2.5 C.

3.14 Estimates of global mean temperature change for all of the IS92 scenarios 
are shown in figure 7. The extreme and middle estimates reflecting the range 
(and hence the uncertainty) in the climate sensitivity are shown in figure 8. 

FIGURE 7


FIGURE 8

3.15 For the central scenario (IS92a), global mean surface temperature 
increasesat a rate between 0.l6 C and 0.36 C per decade with greenhouse gases 
alone. If the effects of aerosols (less certain) are taken into account, the 
projected rates of warming over the next century are expected to be in the range 
0.14 C - 0.28 C per decade. 

FIGURE 9

3.16 For the same scenario, global mean sea level would rise by between 0.3 
and 1.0 m by the year 2100, if the greenhouse gases alone are considered. 
Inclusion of aerosols leads to a calculated rise over the same period of 0.2 to 
0.8 m. (These values are for the IS92a scenario.) Sea level is expected to 
continue to rise for several centuries after stabilization of GHG levels.

Projected Regional Changes of Climate and Sea Level 

3.17 Models with and without aerosols indicate that a change of climate will 
not be distributed uniformly around the globe (figure 10). The confidence in 
their projections of regional climate change, however, remains low. This is 
partly due to approximations in current models, and to the fact that the inherent 
predictability of climate diminishes as geographical scale is reduced.

FIGURE 10

3.18 Changes in future sea level will not occur uniformly around the globe. 
Recent model experiments suggest that the regional responses could differ by a 
factor of 2 to 3 from the mean due to regional differences in heating and 
changes in ocean circulation. In addition, geological and geophysical processes 
cause vertical land movements and these affect relative sea level changes on 
local and regional scales. 

3.19 The following general conclusions, nevertheless, can be drawn relating to 
climate change due to increasing GHGs only:


 Warming is projected to be in general greater over land than over the oceans; 
 Over land, maximum warming is expected in high northern latitudes in winter; 
 Several model experiments indicate that south Asian monsoon will strengthen. 


3.20 Since impacts are particularly related to climate variability and the 
occurrence of extreme weather events, possible changes in these deserve 
special attention. Model results lead to the following findings:


 A general warming tends to lead to an increase in high temperature events 
(heat 
waves) and a decrease in winter days below freezing; 
 Models indicate that global average precipitation would increase in a warmer 
climate. 
The probability of heavy precipitation events leading to floods is expected to 
increase; 
 All model experiments show that warming leads to increased evaporation. In 
regions 
that are currently prone to drought, droughts may become longer lasting and 
more severe;

 Models indicate changes in the precipitation patterns. In some places, 
increases in the 
probability of dry days and the length of dry spells (consecutive days without 
precipitation) are indicated. In those regions where mean precipitation 
decreases, droughts may increase markedly;

 Model experiments do not agree on systematic changes in overall storminess 
globally 
in a warmer world, but the possibility of systematic changes on the regional 
scale cannot be excluded;

 Changes of tropical cyclone frequency may be small in comparison with 
observed 
natural variability. There may, however, be some potential for changes of 
cyclone intensity in regions where sea surface temperature lies between 26 C 
and 29 C. 

3.22 Questions are often asked regarding the long-term stability of climate and 
whether large, almost discontinuous, changes could occur as a result of 
increasing greenhouse gases. One such change is concerned with the 
circulation of the ocean on the largest spatial scale. For instance, it is this 
circulation which maintains the region of the North Atlantic ocean several 
degrees warmer than it would otherwise be. Several experiments with complex 
climate models indicate that this large scale circulation might weaken with 
global warming. Observations also show that some change in this direction 
might have occurred in the last few decades. Further, both the study of palaeo-
climatic records and climate model experiments show that transitions to quite 
different circulation patterns might occur relatively rapidly. How likely is the 
occurrence of such events in response to global warming, how strong the 
radiative forcing will have to be for the change to be significant and the details 
of the accompanying changes are currently subjects of much scientific debate.

3.23 There is a very remote possibility that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet might 
gradually disintegrate because of a warmer climate, causing a significant rise in 
sea level. The specific circumstances under which such an event may occur are 
not known. 



4.1 Human-induced climate change would represent an important stress in a 
world where many systems are already threatened by increasing resource 
demands and non-sustainable management practices. Both the magnitude and 
the rate of climate change are important in determining the inherent sensitivity 
and adaptability of ecological and socio-economic system (Box 2). This section 
assesses the sensitivity, and the potential for adaptation, of human health and 
selected ecological and socio-economic sectors to changes in climate.

4.2	Quantitative projections of the impacts of the magnitudes and the rates 
of climate
change on any particular ecological or socio-economic system are difficult 
because (i) regional scale climate change predictions are uncertain, (ii) our 
understanding of many critical processes is limited, and (iii) the systems are 
influenced by multiple environmental and non-environmental factors. 
Moreover, most impact studies have only assessed how systems would 
respond to a climate change resulting from a (arbitrary) doubling of 
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over its pre-industrial level. Very 
few have considered the evolving responses of systems to steadily increasing 
greenhouse gas concentrations over the corresponding period, and fewer still 
have examined the consequences of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations 
beyond doubling.

Human Health

4.3 Projected changes in climate are likely to result in a wide range of human 
health impacts, most of them adverse, and many of which would reduce life 
expectancy. In many cases there is likely a threshold of minimum temperature 
associated with the occurrence of an adverse health impact. However, 
quantifying the impacts is difficult and depends on co-existent and interacting 
factors other than climate change, which include environmental circumstances 
and socio-economic conditions such as nutritional and immune status, water 
purity, population density, social infrastructure, working conditions and access 
to health care.






Box 2

Sensitivity is the response of a system to a change in climatic conditions. 

Adaptation refers to adjustments in practices, processes, and structures of 
systems to projected or actual changes in attributes of climate. Adaptations can 
be autonomous or planned (planning could be reactive or anticipatory). 
The ability to adapt determines whether a system can turn new climate 
conditions into an opportunity to become more successful, or whether it incurs 
losses that weaken its efficiency or even its ability to survive. Most societies 
and resource-use sectors already contend with contemporary climatic variability 
and the wide range of associated natural hazards and unexpected opportunities. 
The ability of some systems to adapt to changes may be reduced by 
simultaneous exposure to other stresses (habitat fragmentation, acid 
deposition, influx of toxic pollutants, etc.).
Some societies have more human, technological, and financial resources at 
their disposal with which to modify their environmental or social/economic 
systems. 

Vulnerability is the extent to which a system may be damaged or harmed by 
climate change and depends not only on the sensitivity of systems to variations 
in attributes of climate, but also on the ability of these systems to adapt by 
adjusting to new climatic conditions.
Natural ecosystems are more vulnerable to climate change than managed 
ecosystems because adaptation options for the former are more limited and 
human intervention can control to some extent needed inputs of water and 
nutrients for the latter.
Developing countries are more vulnerable to climate change than developed 
countries which have greater resources for adaptation. 



4.4 Climate change can directly affect human health by increased exposure to 
very hot weather events and more frequent weather hazards (e.g., droughts, 
floods, and severe storms) increasing injuries, death, and destruction of public 
health infrastructure. An increase in the frequency and/or severity of heat 
waves would affect even populations that are acclimatized to high background 
temperatures resulting in several thousand additional deaths per year world-
wide. Temperature increases in colder regions should result in fewer cold-
related deaths. The ability to withstand severe heat waves depends upon the 
susceptibility of a given population, which is a function of socio-economic 
differences, physiological acclimatization, and cultural-technical adaptation. 
Temperature and humidity thresholds and physiological tolerances vary and 
generally increase towards the equator.

4.5 Climate change can indirectly affect human health through altered disease 
transmission and nutritional status and exacerbation of existing health 
disorders. Increases in transmission of vector-borne infectious diseases may 
result from increases in the geographical distribution of the vector organisms of 
those diseases (e.g., mosquitoes that spread malaria, dengue and yellow fever; 
water snails that spread schistosomiasis; and black flies that spread river 
blindness), and from climate-change driven variations in the life-cycle 
dynamics of both the vector and the infectious parasite. With malaria for 
example, the parasite cannot develop inside its mosquito host at temperatures 
below 16 C. There is already evidence that malaria, yellow fever and dengue 
fever are persisting at higher altitudes and latitudes. It is estimated that the 
potential transmission of malaria and river blindness could increase by 
approximately 20% (i.e., an extra 50-80 million prevalent cases of malaria and 
3.5 million cases of river blindness). Any such increase would primarily affect 
tropical, subtropical, and some less well-protected temperate-zone populations 
currently at the margins of endemically infected areas. Increasing transmission 
of certain contagious diseases (cholera, for example, through an increase in 
algal blooms in warm coastal waters and wetlands) may also be caused by 
changes in climate. Climate-change related decreases in food production may 
impair nutritional status, especially in some developing countries whose 
populations currently have insecure access to food supplies. Conversely, 
climate change may also help improve food production, and therefore 
nutritional status, in some regions. Finally, climate change may exacerbate 
respiratory disorders and allergies by intensifying the effects of air pollution 
(ozone and particulates), particularly in densely-populated urban areas.

4.6 Options for adapting to the potential health effects of climate change are 
available. However, much of the world's population already suffers from poor 
environmental health conditions and has little access to health care, and these 
populations would be the least likely to have access to adaptive measures. At 
the population level, public health surveillance-and-control measures 
(especially for infectious diseases), the introduction of protective technologies 
(e.g. insulated buildings, air-conditioning), improved primary health care 
(such as use of malarial prophylactics and vaccines such as that for yellow 
fever), and improved large-scale health monitoring could play a significant role 
in reducing the range of health impacts. At the individual level, people can be 
encouraged to limit dangerous exposures (e.g. by use of protective clothing, 
mosquito nets, repellents, sun screens, etc.). 

Water Systems

4.7 Fresh water, an essential component of national welfare and productivity, 
is an increasingly scarce commodity. The world's agriculture, hydroelectric 
and thermal power generation, municipal and industrial water needs, water 
pollution control, and inland navigation depend on the natural endowment of 
surface and groundwater resources. Reductions in natural freshwater resources 
could result in chronic shortages in regions that are already under stress and for 
which there is considerable competition among users.

4.8 Climate change could represent an additional stress on the hydrological 
cycle that is already under a variety of stresses, such as depletion of aquifers, 
urbanization, changes in vegetative cover, and chemical contamination. The 
complexity of the hydrological system and the many influences on it, combined 
with the uncertainty of the regional distribution of changes in temperature and 
precipitation in climate model results, make it difficult to project precisely 
where stresses on water resources would be greatest.

4.9 Current evidence suggests that a warmer climate would result in changes in 
the timing, regional patterns, and intensity of precipitation events. This would 
lead to changes in the seasonal availability of water for agriculture and supplies 
of drinking water (timing of precipitation); river flow (regional patterns of 
precipitation); and flooding (intensity of precipitation). While climate models 
project increases in global mean precipitation, higher temperatures would 
increase evapotranspiration. Higher evaporation rates may lead to reduced run-
off and streamflow in some areas despite increased precipitation.

4.10 Global climate change would have the largest effects on countries which 
extract a high percentage of their available water resources. In particular, the 
current arid and semi-arid regions of the world are likely to be significantly 
affected and could experience the largest decreases in run-off, the latter posing 
the greatest challenges for water resources management.

4.11 Management of water resources should be a continuously adaptive 
enterprise, responding to changing demands, hydrological conditions, 
technologies, and economic shifts. Water management practices seek to control 
demand for water, and to increase supplies, for example, by increasing 
reservoir capacity. However, experts disagree over whether water supply 
systems will evolve substantially enough in the future to compensate for the 
anticipated negative impacts of climate change on water resources and for 
potential increases in demand. To the extent that existing water supply and 
quality problems are not addressed, especially in developing countries, 
optimistic projections about adequate water supplies of sufficient quality will 
not hold. 

Natural Ecological Systems

4.12 Ecosystems are regulated by numerous aspects of the physical 
environment such as atmospheric composition, soil properties, topography, 
and climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and cloudiness. 
Changes in climate, and associated changes in the frequency of fires and 
prevalence of pests could alter the structure (biological diversity) and function 
(productivity, carbon storage and nutrient recycling) of terrestrial ecosystems, 
thus affecting the critical goods and services they provide to society. These 
goods and services include: (i) provision of food, fibre, medicines, and 
energy; (ii) regulation of water run-off to control floods and soil erosion; (iii) 
assimilation of wastes and purification of water; and (iv) maintenance of an 
attractive environment for recreation and tourism. While population increases 
and human decisions about land use and harvesting intensities will probably 
represent the greatest pressures on most terrestrial and marine ecosystems for 
the foreseeable future, climate change would represent a significant additional 
stress factor. 

Forests

4.13 The consequences of climate change for forest ecosystems depend on the 
magnitude and the rate of change and their potential to adapt. The rate at which 
climate zones shift is important because different species migrate at different 
rates, depending on their growth and reproductive cycles. A global mean 
warming of 1 C-4 C over the next 100 years would be equivalent to a poleward 
shift of temperature bands of approximately 160-640 km. The historical 
migration rates for tree species, based on the palaeo-environmental record, are 
generally believed to be on the order of 4 - 200 km per century. Thus some 
forest species may be unable to migrate sufficiently rapidly to keep pace with 
shifts in the climate zones. 

4.14 An increase in mean annual air temperature of 1 C is sufficient to cause 
changes in the growth and regeneration capacity of many forest species, and 
hence in the composition of forest ecosystems. Under a doubled-CO2 
equilibrium climate scenario, global models project major changes in vegetation 
types, (i.e., transformation from one equilibrium vegetation class to another) 
over a substantial fraction (14- 65% with a global mean of 34%) of the existing 
forested area of the world. Boreal forests will be most affected, with tropical 
forests being least affected. Such a transition will have implications for animal 
and microbial biodiversity because of habitat loss, as well as for commodity 
extraction and management practices within forests. 

4.15 While it can be inferred that higher rates and larger magnitudes of change 
will have stronger impact, a key uncertainty is the fate of forested systems 
during the transition from one equilibrium climate to another (assuming a new 
equilibrium will be established). Changes in species range, disturbance 
regimes (fires, pests, and diseases), and increased temperatures (which 
increases respiration) may decrease standing biomass during the transition, 
even though the net primary productivity of forests may increase due to the so-
called CO2 fertilization effect (see paragraph 4.24 also).

4.16 Measures to assist adaptation in unmanaged ecosystems are not well 
developed, especially for complex forested ecosystems. Human activities 
fragment most landscapes limiting the ability of populations to follow changing 
habitat distribution. One adaptation strategy would be to establish a distributed 
system of reserves based on model projections of future habitats. Migration to 
such reserves (or other appropriate habitats) could be assisted by 
transplantation or by means of migration corridors of relatively undisturbed 
habitat and by reducing the competition for resources or other stresses at 
critical stages in life-cycles (e.g. seedling stage for plants, juvenile period for 
animals). 

4.17 Article 2 provides that GHG concentrations be stabilized in a time-frame 
sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change. Ecosystems 
do not adapt to climate change but individual species do. Hence, the rate of 
climate change affects the way in which ecosystems disassemble-assemble and 
reassemble into new ecological systems. At the present rate of GHG 
emissions, global mean temperatures are projected to increase by about 0.2 C 
per decade, a rate which is at least twice the historically observed maximum 
rate. Therefore, forested ecosystems will be unable to completely adjust to 
such rates and some species may become extinct. 

Coastal Ecosystems

4.18 Coastal ecosystems such as salt-water marshes, mangrove ecosystems, 
coastal wetlands, coral reefs, coral atolls and reef islands provide a wide range 
of goods and services to society such as providing important habitats and 
nurseries for wildlife and fish and centres for tourism and fishing, and 
protecting islands and coastal areas from wave actions and severe storms. 
These ecosystems are under various stresses including overexploitation of 
resources, pollution, sediment starvation and urbanization. They are also 
exceptionally vulnerable to increases in temperature and sea level. 

4.19 Coral reefs, coral atolls and reef islands and deltas are particularly 
vulnerable to even modest increases in temperature, resulting in a significant 
increase in the frequency of coral bleaching, submergence, and coastal erosion. 
If seawater temperature increases of 3 C-4 C are sustained for a period of 
months, considerable coral mortality can ensue. Severe bleached corals can 
take decades to centuries to recover.

4.20 Sea level is projected to increase at a rate of 2-8 cm per decade (20-80 
cms by 2100) for the IS92 emission scenarios, a rate several times faster than 
experienced during the last 100 years. Reef accretion rates are typically 1- 10 
cm per decade and hence corals should not be particularly vulnerable to 
increases in sea level unless accretion rates significantly decrease due to 
warmer sea temperatures. 

Vulnerability of Socio-Economic Sectors

Agriculture

4.21 Based on several model projections of future global food production, one 
view holds that global food availability would increase relative to population. 
An alternative view is that the historical trend of generally improving food 
supply will not be continued because of resource degradation and the inability 
of technological advances to keep up with population growth. Climate change 
would represent yet another stress on some of the world's agroecosystems.

4.22 Agricultural productivity is sensitive to two broad classes of climate-
induced effects on the quality and quantity of harvestable yield: direct effects 
from changes intemperature, water balance, atmospheric composition and 
extreme weather events; and indirect effects through changes in soils and the 
distribution and frequency of infestation by insects, diseases, weeds, and other 
predators. The vulnerability of agricultural production to climate change 
depends not only on the physiological response of the affected plants, but also 
on the ability of the affected socio-economic systems of production to cope 
with fluctuations in yield. 

4.23 Recent studies have confirmed the conclusion of the IPCC 1990 
Assessment that the aggregate effects of climate change on global agricultural 
production are likely to be small to moderate. However, global food supply is 
only one aspect of the issue and large differences are projected at local and 
regional scales. Studies tend to show more negative impacts for areas in the 
tropics where many of the world's poorest people live and where individuals 
are currently at greatest risk of hunger. Large yield losses in one locality and 
for one type of crop are balanced by large gains in other localities, both within 
and among countries (e.g. frequently more than +/- 20 %). Low- latitude, low-
income populations depending on isolated, dryland agricultural systems in 
semi-arid and arid regions are particularly vulnerable. Many of these 
populations at risk are in Sub-Saharan Africa, South, East and South East 
Asia, as well as some islands in the Pacific. The risks may be underestimated 
because the studies do not include indirect effects of climate change on 
agriculture via insects, weeds and diseases. 

4.24	Several major food crops (e.g., wheat, rice, and soybeans), should 
benefit from
improved water use efficiency and increased productivity because of the 
interaction of increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and their 
particular photosynthetic process (the so-called CO2 fertilization effect). On 
average, such crops will see a 30 percent increase in yield (for a doubled 
carbon dioxide environment), although the variation in response is wide (-10 to 
+80 percent). Temperature increases at high latitudes are likely to increase crop 
growth, through lengthening and intensifying of the growing season, 
assuming adequate availability of water and suitable soils. At low and low-to-
mid latitudes, where temperatures are already high, temperature increases may 
cause increases in the frequency of heat stress on crops and decreases in 
available water through higher rates of evaporation and transpiration. In 
contrast, some other major crops (e.g., sugar cane, maize, millet, and 
sorghum) and some common weeds, which have different photosynthetic 
processes, will benefit less from increased carbon dioxide concentrations.

4.25 Adaptation will be important to limit losses or take advantage of changing 
climatic conditions. Major classes of agricultural adaptation options considered 
in the literature include: (i) breeding new crops and cultivars for changed 
climate conditions; (ii) improved management strategies such as altered 
irrigation practices or planting times; (iii) adding nutrients to take full advantage 
of the projected CO2 fertilization effect; (iv) employing soil conservation and 
protection strategies; and (v) research on pest control. The incremental costs of 
adaptation could be a serious burden for developing countries. 

Coastal Zones and Small Islands Infrastructure 

4.26 Sea-level rise can have a number of negative impacts on tourism, ports 
and harbours, human settlements, natural freshwater systems in coastal areas, 
agriculture, insurance industry, and cultural systems and values. Climate 
change projected for the IS 92 emission scenarios would increase the 
vulnerability of coastal populations to flooding. Currently an annual average of 
about 50 million people experience flooding due to storm surges. A 50 cm sea-
level rise would increase this number to about 92 million and a 1 meter sea-
level to about 118 million. The estimates will be substantially higher if one 
incorporates population growth projections. Developing country populations, 
such as those of Bangladesh or China, will be more vulnerable because their 
existing sea and coastal protection systems are less well established and also 
because their population growth rates are higher, putting more people at risk. 
For such countries, sea-level rise could force internal or international migration 
of populations. 

4.27 A number of studies have evaluated the sensitivity to a 1 meter sea level 
rise (the upper end of the range projected for the IS 92 scenarios). These 
studies show that small islands and deltaic areas are particularly vulnerable 
with land losses, for example, of 0.05% in Uruguay, 1.0% in Egypt, 6% in 
the Netherlands, 17.5% in Bangladash and about 80% in the Marshall Islands. 
In some cases, such land losses can be reduced through coastal protection 
measures. However, there are major technical, environmental and economic 
constraints in implementing them. While annual adaptation/protection costs for 
these nations are relatively modest (about 0.1% GDP), average annual costs to 
many small island states and deltaic coasts are much higher amounting to 
several percent of GDP assuming that adaptation is at all possible. Many 
nations face loss of capital value in excess of 10% of GDP. Large numbers of 
people would be affected, e.g., about 70 million in both China and 
Bangladesh. 

4.28 For coastal states with access to financial and technical resources, a wide 
array of management options are available to prevent, ameliorate or compensate 
for coastal-zone damages encountered under current climate variability and 
which could be encountered under future climate change. The emphasis in the 
past has been on engineering responses to coastal erosion and protection 
against flooding, with action often being triggered in response to an extreme 
event. Heavily populated industrial and urban areas are primary candidates for 
structural protection measures such as dikes, seawalls and breakwaters. These 
are high-cost options. Economic evaluation principles, especially risk 
assessments and cost-benefit analyses, should be of use in deciding whether to 
protect or retreat. In addition, the range of options includes non- structural 
adaptation such as zoning, land-use regulation and flood-damage insurance, 
with emphasis on a precautionary approach in locating investments. 

Conclusions on Vulnerability to Climate Change 

4.29 There are a number of important conclusions that are not specific to any 
one ecological or socio-economic system:


 The sensitivity of ecological and socio-economic systems is not distributed 
evenly 
across the globe. Various aspects of climate affect systems differently. Some 
systems are sensitive to changes in mean climate; some to changes in the 
frequency and magnitude of extreme events; some to the rate of climate change; 
and some to changes in climate variability;

 While there would be some beneficial effects of climate change, there would 
be many 
adverse effects, with some being potentially irreversible, e.g., loss of 
biological diversity and loss of land;

 The ability to adapt to a changing climate is improving because of 
technological 
advances. However, the majority of human beings do not have access to such 
technological advances;

 The vulnerability of human health and socio-economic systems, and to a lesser 
extent 
ecological systems, depends upon economic circumstances and institutional 
infrastructure. This implies that systems are typically more vulnerable in 
developing countries where economic and institutional circumstances are less 
favourable; 
 Both the rate and magnitude of climate change are important. Hence, the rate 
of 
change of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may be as important 
as the stabilization level. A slow rate of climate change permits, but does not 
assure, non-disruptive adaptations in the structure and function of natural 
ecosystems, agriculture, and other socio- economic systems. Rapid change, on 
the other hand, may preclude non-disruptive adaptations;

 Uncertainties associated with projections of changes in local and regional 
climate 
present a challenge in designing adaptation strategies; 
 Incorporation of environmental and sustainability concerns into resource-use 
and 
development decisions and plans for infrastructure investments will enhance 
society's resilience to climate change.

4.30 Table 3 summarizes the major threats and adaptation potential for natural, 
agricultural, and socio-economic systems. For the present rate of greenhouse 
gas emissions, global mean temperatures are projected to increase by between 
0.1 C and 0.4oC per decade, with associated changes in other climatic factors, 
including precipitation.


 For natural ecosystems ,this would result in: (i) loss of species from forests as 
they fail 
to migrate rapidly enough to keep pace with such rates; (ii) loss of montane 
because migration would not be feasible for them as climate warms; and (iii) 
the destruction of coral reefs as the surrounding waters become too warm for 
the coral reef organism to reproduce and grow. Adaptation options for natural 
ecosystems are limited at best and would be very costly for broad scale 
implementation. 
 For food production, the consequences are most important at the local and 
regional 
levels. Agricultural systems in the developing countries of the tropics may be 
subject to increasing drought stress as the result of increased temperatures and 
reductions in precipitation. While technologies exist that could permit these 
systems to adapt to climate change, these technologies are often costly and 
therefore, may not be available to the countries that need them most.

 Human health and habitats are also at risk. For human health, a critical issue is 
possible increase in the incidence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, 
especially in developing countries, and heat spells. Some parts of human 
habitats are likely to be destroyed by sea level rise and possible change in 
extreme weather events, causing migration of populations and placing 
additional stresses on already stressed social and political systems.

4.31 The economics literature contains a few aggregate estimates of the 
damages associated with a doubled CO2 concentration scenario. The estimates 
suggest that the associated warming would impose net damages equivalent to 
between 1.5% and 2.0% of world GDP on the present world economy. The 
regional variation in climate change damage would be substantial. However, 
there is little agreement across the studies about the magnitude of each category 
of damages or the relative ranking of the damage categories. Climate changes 
of this magnitude are not expected to occur for some decades and damages in 
the interim would be smaller. Some impacts, such as potential loss of low-
lying areas, may be so significant physically and culturally that no monetary 
compensation would be sufficient. [NOTE: This paragraph will be made 
consistent with the 1995 Summary for policymakers of Working Group III.] 




Box 3

The Framework Convention on Climate Change defines its objective (in Article 
2) as stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. 
Stabilization of emissions is often confused with stabilization of 
concentrations. 

Stabilization of emissions refers to a situation in which the GHG emissions in 
one year are the same as in the previous year.

A stable concentration of a greenhouse gas refers to a state of dynamic 
equilibrium between the atmosphere, the ocean, and the terrestrial ecosystems. 
In this state of equilibrium, aggregate annual emissions of the gas from the 
surface of the planet are just balanced by removals of the same gas from the 
atmosphere. As a consequence, the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere 
remains unchanged. 



5.1 As noted in the previous sections, some damage and adaptation costs of a 
human-induced climate change may be unavoidable. Even though there are 
major uncertainties about the magnitude and pace of a climate change due GHG 
emissions and about how serious it will be, the uncertainties do not diminish 
the risk itself but merely make its quantification difficult. Risks would vary 
markedly from country to country.

5.2 An analytical approach to the issue of stabilization of concentrations is 
presented in the following pages. It is purely illustrative and designed to 
expose the dimensions of the problem only. It has no implication of policy 
recommendation whatsoever. 

5.3 The Convention in Article 3 (see box 4) provides that the type of strategy 
to be used in reaching its objective should be comprehensive, covering all 
relevant sources, sinks, and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. It is important to 
keep this provision in mind when synthesizing scientific-technical information 
relevant to Article 2. Because of the multiplicity of sources and the variety of 
gases involved, there is no single strategy for stabilization.


Box 4

In their actions to achieve the objective of the Convention and to implement its 
provisions, the Parties shall be guided, inter alia, by the following: 

1. The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and 
future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with 
their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. 
Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating 
climate change and the adverse effects thereof. 

2. The specific needs and special circumstances of developing country Parties, 
especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate 
change, and of those Parties, especially developing country Parties, that would 
have to bear a disproportionate or abnormal burden under the Convention, 
should be given full consideration. 

3. The Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or 
minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where 
there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific 
certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such measures, taking 
into account that policies and measures to deal with climate change should be 
cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the lowest possible cost. To 
achieve this, such policies and measures should take into account different 
socio- economic contexts, be comprehensive, cover all relevant sources, sinks 
and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and adaptation, and comprise all economic 
sectors. Efforts to address climate change may be carried out cooperatively by 
interested Parties. 

4. The Parties have a right to, and should, promote sustainable development. 
Policies and measures to protect the climate system against human-induced 
change should be appropriate for the specific conditions of each Party and 
should be integrated with national development programmes, taking into 
account that economic development is essential for adopting measures to 
address climate change. 

5. The Parties should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international 
economic system that would lead to sustainable economic growth and 
development in all Parties, particularly developing country Parties, thus 
enabling them better to address the problems of climate change. Measures 
taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute 
a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on 
international trade.


5.4 The direct radiative forcing due to enhanced concentrations of all 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was about 2.4 W/m2 in 1994 of which 
1.55 W/m2 was due to increased carbon dioxide (see figure 2). The forcing 
due to all greenhouse gases in 1994 was equivalent to that due to a 
concentration of CO2 alone of (about) 420 ppmv. Thus the figure of 420 ppmv 
CO2 is the equivalent CO2 concentration for the radiative forcing of 1994. (For 
comparison, the actual CO2 concentration in 1994 was 356 ppmv.) The 
concept of equivalent CO2 concentration is helpful in approaching the 
simultaneous stabilization of all the GHG concentrations in the atmosphere - 
the so-called comprehensive approach.

5.5 The individual reductions in emissions for stabilizing the concentrations of 
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and halocarbons, and thereby implicitly 
stratospheric ozone, can be combined in different ways for stabilizing the total 
global radiative forcing in the comprehensive approach. To these, the forcing 
due to changes in tropospheric ozone and aerosols should be added; this cannot 
be easily done - and has not been done in the illustrations that follow - because 
of limited information on their future concentrations and geographical 
distributions. 

5.6 Different greenhouse gases have different residence times in the 
atmosphere. 


 Tropospheric ozone and tropospheric aerosols have residence times of the 
order of 
a day and of a week respectively. Their concentrations are governed directly by 
the emissions of their precursors.

 Methane has a residence time of 12-17 years and will stabilize in about 50 
years if 
its emissions were stabilized.

 Other greenhouse gases have longer residence times spanning many decades 
to 
centuries. The concentration of each of them is governed by some 
(determinable) fraction of its emissions accumulating in the atmosphere over 
decades to centuries. The concept of cumulative emissions of the long-lived 
greenhouse gases helps in understanding the complexities associated with 
stabilization. 

Carbon Emissions and Stabilization of CO2 Concentrations 

5.7 Because carbon dioxide presently contributes more than half of the direct 
annual increase in the radiative forcing (with probably a greater fraction in the 
future), stabilizing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere would appear to be 
necessary for stabilizing future total global radiative forcing.

5.8 Profiles of atmospheric CO2 concentrations can be constructed assuming 
smooth variations in the rates of increase in its concentrations from the current 
value to different stabilization levels. Such profiles for concentrations of 350, 
450, 550, 650 and 750 ppmv, published previously by the IPCC, are shown 
in figure 11. It is possible to choose other stabilization levels and time scales 
and pathways for achieving them. 

FIGURE 11

5.9 Carbon cycle models can be used to derive profiles of total anthropogenic 
carbon emissions corresponding to the concentration profiles shown in figure 
11. Such emission profiles are shown in figure 12. More rapid increases in the 
concentrations in the beginning would lead to higher initial emissions than 
those given in figure 12, but greater reductions would be necessary later if 
stabilization were to be achieved at any given concentration. Emissions to 
achieve the stabilization levels illustrated here are, after some decades, lower 
than those of the IS 92 scenarios. Also, all emissions eventually have to be 
below the 1990 emissions and be maintained there. Emissions would be 
greater for stabilization levels higher than those shown in figure 11. 

FIGURE 12

5.10 Figure 13 provides, as an illustration, estimates of cumulative global 
carbon emissions until the year 2100 for various stabilization levels of CO2. 
The figure also illustrates cumulative emissions for the IS92a emissions 
scenario. (These values may be compared to the estimated emissions of 240 
GtC from fossil fuel use between 1860 and 1994, about 60% of which came 
from burning solid fuels.) 

FIGURE 13

5.11 Because of the inertia of the carbon cycle and of the socio-economic 
system, it would take a decade or two for significant deviations from non-
intervention emissions profiles to become noticeable. The selection of the 
illustrative concentration profiles (figure 11) assumes this inertia and 
consequently the emissions in figure 12 do not deviate much from each other in 
the first decade or two. A delay beyond a few years hence to initiate 
appropriate measures to reduce emissions would result in steeper rates of 
reduction later, if, for example, stabilization of CO2 is aimed for at 550 ppmv 
or below.

5.12 Given cumulative emissions and population figures, global annual 
average per capita carbon emissions can be derived. Figure 14 shows values of 
annual average per capita emissions derived for stabilization of CO2 
concentrations at 450, 550, 650 and 750 ppmv, taking the corresponding 
cumulative emissions from figure 13 and assumingthe UN median estimates of 
population growth to about 9.5 billion in 2050 and about 11 billion persons in 
2100. If other population estimates were used, the values would change 
accordingly.

FIGURE 14

5.13 The average annual per capita carbon emission for the globe as a whole 
due to fossil fuel burning is at present about 1.1 tonnes. (In addition, a net of 
0.2 tonne is emitted from deforestation and land-use change.) It is on average 
about 2.8 tonnes from fossil fuels in developed countries (including countries 
with economies in transition). National annual per capita emissions vary 
between 1.5 and 5.5 tonnes. In the developing world, the average annual per 
capita emission is about 0.5 tonne (with a range of 0.1 to about 2.0 tonnes). 
The future global average annual per capita emissions from fossil fuel use 
cannot exceed the current global average by very much if the atmospheric 
concentration of carbon dioxide is to remain at 550 ppmv (about double the 
pre-industrial level) or below. Larger annual per capita emissions would be 
possible if stabilization at higher concentrations were to be aimed for. 

Stabilization of Other Greenhouse Gases

5.14 Methane: The atmospheric residence time for methane, at 12 to 17 years, 
is comparatively short. If current emissions and removal rates were held 
constant, atmospheric concentration would stabilize at about 1.9 ppmv 
(compared to the 1994 concentration of 1.73 ppmv and the estimated pre-
industrial concentration of about 0.65 ppmv). On the other hand, stabilization 
at present concentration would require a reduction in the emissions by about 
10%. 

5.15 Nitrous oxide: The lifetime of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere is about 
120 years. A reduction of anthropogenic emissions by about 50% is required 
in order to stabilize the concentration at present level. If emissions were 
stabilized at the present level, the concentration would increase to about 400 
ppbv during the next century (compared to 310 ppbv today and an estimated 
pre-industrial concentration of approximately 280 ppbv).

5.16 Halogen-containing compounds and stratospheric ozone: The 
concentrations of the CFC-gases in the atmosphere are expected to stabilize 
gradually in the next few years. A very slow decrease in their concentrations is 
then expected and a return towards natural stratospheric ozone concentrations 
during the 22nd century. 

5.17 Other than CFCs, most other halocarbons have lifetimes in the 
atmosphere of years to a few decades. Their contributions to human-induced 
radiative forcing is slight at present. The lifetimes of HCFC-22 and HFC-134 
are 13 and 18 years respectively. The projected increase in their emissions in 
the IS92a scenario implies that a decade or two into the next century, these 
gases would be contributing more than 0.1 W/m2 to the radiative forcing.

5.18 Some very long-lived greenhouse gases are also being emitted into the 
atmosphere, although still in very small amounts (e.g., sulphur hexafluoride or 
SF6 and perfluoromethane or CF4 with lifetimes of 3,200 and 50,000 years 
respectively). The long lifetimes of these gases make them very difficult to 
stabilize implying rising concentrations for centuries after steps to eliminate 
their emissions are put in place. 

5.19 Concentrations of tropospheric ozone and of tropospheric aerosols 
respond quickly to changes in the emissions of the precursors, as has been 
mentioned earlier. 

The Concept of Equivalent CO2 Concentrations and the Comprehensive 
Approach

5.20 As an illustration, let us consider the stabilization of radiative forcing due 
to all greenhouse gases, i.e., the radiative forcing due to the equivalent carbon 
dioxide concentrations of, say, 450, 550, 650 and 750 ppmv. Other choices of 
concentrations can equally well be made. For each case, we ask what level of 
concentration is required for carbon dioxide alone for stabilization, if 
simultaneously demanding that methane and nitrous oxide are either (i) 
stabilized at present levels (hereinafter referred to as "N2O and CH4 
stabilization now") or (ii) permitted to increase according to IS 92a scenario 
until 2050 and stabilize thereafter (hereinafter referred to as "N2O and CH4 
stabilization in 2050"). It is possible, then, to deduce the approximate levels of 
stabilization for carbon dioxide required for stabilizing equivalent CO2 
concentrations. These are illustrated in table 4.

5.22 It may be seen from the table that, for example, stabilization of equivalent 
carbon dioxide concentration at 450 ppmv would require a stabilization in CO2 
concentration alone at about 385 and 365 ppmv, respectively, for N2O and 
CH4 stabilization now and in 2050. Stabilization of equivalent CO2 
concentration at 550 ppmv (equal to almost a doubling of the pre-industrial 
CO2 concentration) would require a stabilization of CO2 alone at about 480 
and 455 ppmv, respectively, for N2O and CH4 stabilization now and in 2050.

6.1 An extensive array of technologies and policy measures exist to mitigate 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the energy, industrial, and 
agriculture sectors, and to enhance natural sinks through forestry and land 
management. The rate and degree of diffusion of the technologies will be 
influenced by fiscal and regulatory measures, additional research, and 
dissemination of information. The policy measures will be more effective if 
they are developed through consultations with various stakeholders and are 
carefully tailored to local situations. 

Energy Sector

6.2 The options for reducing energy-related emissions fall into two general 
categories: (i) those that utilize alternative energy supply technologies and (ii) 
those that reduce the demand for energy in sectors such as industry, residential/ 
commercial buildings and transportation.

Energy Supply Options

6.3 Technologies exist with potential to reduce GHG emissions substantially 
over 50-100 years. They can be developed to provide energy services at 
projected costs comparable to the projected costs of conventional sources of 
energy. Much of the world's commercial energy system will be replaced at 
least twice by the year 2100. Such replacement times provide opportunities to 
change the energy systems in the course of normal investment cycles.

6.4 In the energy supply sector, GHG emissions reductions are possible 
through the following technology options, listed in no particular order of 
priority: 

* More efficient conversion of fossil fuels New technology offers considerably 
increased conversion efficiencies. For example, the technical efficiency for 
coal-fired power generation can be increased from the present world average of 
30% to the 43% available with today's most efficient technology and to over 
60% in the longer term. Using combined-cycle gas turbines for electricity 
generation, conversion efficiency can be improved to 54% using currently 
available technology. Higher efficiencies are possible with combined heat and 
power schemes and using such schemes in district heating arrangements. 

* Increasing the use of low carbon fossil fuels and suppressing emissions 
Emissions can be reduced by switching from coal to oil to natural gas because 
natural gas contains 1.8 times as much energy as coal per unit carbon in the 
fuel. Large resources of natural gas exist in many areas. Low-capital cost, 
high-efficiency advanced combined cycle technology can reduce electricity 
costs in areas where natural gas is becoming the preferred fuel. Use of natural 
gas as a substitute for oil as a fuel in the transportation sector can be increased. 
Methane emissions from natural gas pipelines and from oil and gas wells and 
coal mines can be substantially reduced. 

* Increasing the use of renewable sources of energy Renewable energy sources 
are sufficiently abundant that eventually they could technically provide all of 
the world energy needs over the next century. In 1990, renewable sources 
contributed about 17% of the world's primary energy; of this, 2% was derived 
from solar, modern biomass, wind, geothermal and micro-hydro sources. 
Technological advances offer declining costs . In addition, renewable sources 
are often beneficial for local and regional environmental problems such as 
urban air pollution and acid rain. In the case of large-scale biomass plantations, 
established on currently non-forested lands, there is not only an increase in the 
amount of carbon sequestered, but the biomass used as fuel can replace fossil 
fuel, increasing the effective rate of carbon sequestration. Moreover, there are 
the prospects of rural income and employment generation, but these need to be 
balanced against such concerns as land use constraints, loss of biodiversity and 
natural habitats and other environmental issues. In the case of hydropower, 
most large-scale plants require dams and reservoirs, which can give rise to 
significant social and environmental concerns such as dislocation of 
populations, water diversion, slope alteration, disruptions of ecosystems, etc. 

* Decarbonization of flue gases and fuels, and CO2 Storage The removal and 
storage of CO2 from power-station stack gases, which is feasible, will 
significantly increase the production cost of electricity. Fossil fuels can be used 
to make hydrogen-rich fuels, applying conversion technologies such as fuel 
cells, but the by-product stream of CO2 will also require storage. Depleted oil 
and natural gas fields could be used for storing such CO2 at relatively low 
cost. 

* Increasing the use of nuclear energy
Nuclear energy could replace baseload fossil fuel electricity generation, if 
public concerns about reactor safety, radioactive waste disposal, and 
proliferation can be resolved. The long construction lead times and high capital 
costs make nuclear power a relatively inflexible option.

Energy Demand Options

6.5 Development of alternative sources of energy can be coupled to efforts to 
reduce existing inefficiencies in energy end-use. The technical potential for 
efficiency improvements on the demand side is large. Numerous studies have 
indicated that 10-30 % efficiency gains are feasible with current plant and 
equipment in many parts of the world at little or no cost. Using plant and 
equipment which presently yields the highest output of energy service for a 
given input of energy, efficiency gains of 50-60 % would be feasible in 
developing countries if requisite technology and financing became available.


6.6 More than a third of global CO2 emissions come from the industrial sector 
through energy use and production processes. Other greenhouse gases are also 
emitted through production processes. Basic processes including production of 
iron and steel, chemicals, building materials and food account for more than 
half of all the energy used in this sector. Industry has made substantial 
reductions in energy intensity in the past two decades. Improvements in energy 
efficiency have, in some countries, permitted major increases in production 
with little or no increase in energy use. The potential in the relative short-term 
for efficiency improvements in the manufacturing sector in the leading 
industrial nations is around 25 percent. 

6.7 Emissions reductions are feasible through other efficiency improvements 
(e.g., materials savings, co-generation and steam recovery, use of more 
efficient motors and electrical devices), recycling materials and switching to 
those with lower CO2 content, developing fundamentally new processes 
("industrial metabolism" that uses less energy), lowering of materials intensity 
in manufacturing ("dematerialization"), and feasible reductions in the emissions 
of gases such as halocarbons, CH4 and N20 in industrial proceses such as 
production of iron, steel, aluminum, ammonia, etc. The emissions reductions 
and costs associated with specific technologies or approaches in each of these 
categories will vary, according to current patterns of industrial energy and 
materials use. Some countries, for example, use twice as much energy to 
produce a unit of steel as do other countries, thus affording opportunities to 
achieve significant emissions reductions.

6.8 About 25% of global primary energy use in 1990 and 22% of CO2 
emissions from fossil fuel use came from the transportation sector. This is the 
most rapidly growing source of GHG emissions. Whereas transportation 
world-wide consumed 68 EJ (1 EJ = 1018 J) in 1990, mostly in oil products, 
this sector could account for 65-170 EJ by 2025 and 30-520 EJ by 2100 
according to the IS 92 and WEC scenarios. About 75 percent of energy use 
and greenhouse gas emissions in this sector are now in industrialized countries; 
greater growth is expected in developing countries in the future. Vehicle 
ownership and use ranges from 1.7 people per car or light truck in the USA to 
about 600 people per car in China. The nature of production and demand for 
vehicles in OECD countries influences the pattern of demand for transportation 
services throughout the world.

6.9 Two key areas in this sector provide opportunities to reduce emissions 
significantly:


 Changing the design of all vehicle types to use more efficient drive trains, 
body 
shapes and materials, as well as switching fuels for propulsion. The potential 
for reduction in energy intensity through these measures in 2025, without 
losses in vehicle performance and size, is 35-60% in cars, 20-40% in heavy 
trucks, and 30-50% in aircraft. If performance and size were changed, greater 
energy intensity reductions could be achieved. More than 95% reductions in 
GHG emissions relative to 1990 levels are feasible per unit of transport 
service, if a switch to alternative fuel and electric powered vehicles using 
renewable energy sources is coupled with the foregoing reductions in energy 
intensity. 
 Altering land-use patterns, transport systems, mobility patterns and life styles 
to 
reduce the level of passenger miles travelled and freight transport activity, and 
shifting to less energy intensive transportation modes. 

6.10 Actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport can 
simultaneously address other problems, including traffic congestion, high 
accident rates, noise and local air pollution including emissions of particulates, 
NOx and VOC that are precursors to tropospheric ozone. Much experience has 
already been gained in the effective use of policies such as fuel and vehicle 
taxes and fuel economy standards to encourage energy efficiency 
improvements. Research will continue to be needed to develop new propulsion 
systems and affordable, lightweight materials. 

6.11 Human settlements currently account for about one-third of GHG 
emissions. The largest portion is in the form of CO2 emissions from energy 
use in buildings; most of the remainder is in the form of methane from solid 
waste and industrial/domestic waste water. While the range in current and 
projected energy use and emissions in this sector is large, the "best guess" 
estimate is 2% growth in energy use per year (assuming continuing economic 
growth and improvements in energy efficiency), leading to a doubling of 
energy use by 2030.

6.12 Some examples of technologies that could cut projected growth in 
emissions by one-half over the next 35 years (and more in the longer run) 
without diminishing energy services include more efficient space-conditioning 
systems, reduced heat losses through walls, ceilings and windows, more 
efficient lighting and more efficient appliances (refrigerators, water heaters, 
cook stoves, etc). Other technologies that can capture, reduce, or prevent 
methane emissions (e.g., in landfills) are also increasingly available. 

6.13 Activities that provide the best opportunities for reductions in emissions 
growth in buildings are: (i) support for energy efficiency policies (energy 
pricing strategies, regulatory programs including minimum energy efficiency 
standards for buildings and appliances, utility demand-side management 
programs, and market pull and demonstration programs that stimulate the 
development and application of advanced technologies); (ii) enhanced research 
and development in energy efficiency; (iii) enhanced training and added 
support for financing of efficiency programs in developing and transitional 
economy countries.


Land Management

6.14 There are options for increasing carbon storage and/or for reducing 
emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in managed sectors 
such as agriculture and forestry. In general, mitigation options in these sectors 
focus on more sustainable uses of existing resources and have other positive 
effects such as reducing air and water pollution, slowing the rate of land 
degradation and conserving biodiversity. The mitigation potential in these 
options, however, appears insufficient to bring about reductions in emissions 
to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations. 

6.15 Estimates of the total amount of carbon that could be sequestered in the 
forestry and agriculture sectors over the next 50 years range from 90 to 150 
GtC, which is equivalent to 8 to 40% of the projected cumulative fossil fuel 
emissions over the same period in the IS92 emission scenarios. Significant 
uncertainties are associated with estimating the amount of carbon that can thus 
be conserved and/or sequestered. They include the magnitude of the CO2 
fertilisation effect, interactions between carbon-storage potential and changes in 
temperature, precipitation and the availability of other nutrients, changes in the 
frequency of disturbances such as fires and pest outbreaks, land availability for 
forestation and regeneration programmes, lack of information about current 
land-use practices and rates at which deforestation can be reduced. 

Carbon sequestration through improved management of forests and agricultural 
lands

6.16 The categories of promising forestry activities include: (i) management 
and conservation of existing carbon in forests as for example by slowing 
deforestation; (ii) expanding carbon storage by increasing the area and/or 
carbon density of native forests; and (iii) increasing the use of forest biomass 
in products such as bio-fuels and long-lived wood products which can 
substitute for fossil-fuel intensive products. Under baseline conditions (i.e., 
today's climate and no change in the estimated availability of land over the 
period), 60 to 87 GtC could be conserved and sequestered over the period 
1995 to 2050 by slowing deforestation and promoting natural forest 
regeneration. The tropics have the potential to conserve and sequester the 
largest quantity of carbon (80 percent of the global total in the forestry sector), 
more than half of which would be due to promoting forest regeneration and 
slowing deforestation. The temperate and boreal zones could sequester about 
20 percent of the global total, mainly in North America, temperate-zone Asia, 
the former Soviet Union, China, and New Zealand. Projections of increased 
demand for agricultural land in the tropics could reduce these estimates 
significantly.

6.17 The cumulative cost, excluding land costs, to conserve and sequester the 
above amounts of carbon range from US$250 billion to $300 billion (thousand 
million) , at a unit cost ranging from $2 to $8/tonne of carbon. Realised costs 
will depend on national circumstances, including costs of land, establishment 
of infrastructure, tree nurseries, training programs and protection. Costs per 
unit of carbon sequestered or conserved generally increase from slowing 
deforestation to establishing plantations. 

6.18 In agriculture, a variety of practices could increase storage of carbon. 
Recent studies indicate that 20-30 GtC could be sequestered through improved 
management of agricultural soils, including return of crop residues and reduced 
tillage. An additional9-37 Gt C could be sequestered due to restoration of 
degraded agricultural lands and improved management of rangelands.

Reductions in methane and nitrous oxide emissions through improved 
management of agricultural practices

6.19 Emissions from the agriculture sector contribute now about one-fifth to 
overall anthropogenic emissions. This sector accounts for about 50% of 
anthropogenic methane, and about 70% of anthropogenic nitrous oxide, 
emissions. 

6.20 Significant decreases in methane emissions from agriculture can be 
achieved through improved nutrition of ruminant animals and better 
management of paddy rice fields (e.g., irrigation, nutrients, use of new 
cultivars). Further methane reductions are possible with altered treatment and 
management of animal wastes and by reducing agricultural biomass burning. 
These practices could be combined to reduce methane emissions from 
agriculture by 25 to 100 Tg/yr (estimated annual anthropogenic methane 
emissions in the 1980s were 300-450 Tg/yr). The projected increase in world 
population during the next century would imply larger, however, methane 
emissions. 

6.21 Sources of nitrous oxide in agriculture are mineral fertilisers, legume 
cropping, animal waste and biomass burning. The N2O emissions could be 
reduced by 0.3 to 0.9 Tg N/yr by improving fertiliser and manure-use 
efficiency with presently available techniques (estimated emissions in the 
1980s were 3-8 Tg/yr). 

Other benefits of mitigation options

6.22 Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions often yield additional 
economic benefits (such as reduced traffic congestion) and/or environmental 
benefits (such as reduced emissions of urban smog precursors). What matters 
from a policy perspective is the net cost (total cost adjusted for other benefits 
and costs) of a mitigation or an adaptation option apart from its climate change 
benefits. The magnitude of these secondary benefits depends on local 
circumstances. Studies for European countries and the United States indicate 
that secondary benefits could offset 30% to 100% of abatement costs. For 
many countries and peoples there are problems which are perceived as being 
more pressing than potential climate change. These include provision of basic 
needs, and regional and local pollution. By raising efficiency and energy use, 
local and regional pollution can be curbed, and costs reduced, releasing 
financial and other resources for other needs. These are sometimes described 
as secondary benefits, although given the different local and regional priorities, 
they may in some countries well be considered primary benefits and climate 
change mitigation a valuable secondary benefit.

Barriers to Implementing Mitigation Options 

6.23 Historically, gaps have existed between the most cost-effective 
technologies available or rapidly becoming available and those actually in use. 
There are also gaps between what existing industrial plants and equipment 
should be able to achieve in terms of efficiency and what is actually being 
achieved. 

6.24 There are time lags in exploiting new technologies, because of the risk of 
financial losses, if the new technology is introduced before earlier investments 
are fully amortized. Several other factors may be even greater discouragements 
:

 uncertainty about the costs of the new technology (operating and maintenance 
costs, reliability and training in of new skills) and the level of service provided; 
 uncertainty about the long-term prices, lack of information, poor decision 
processes, imperfect market structures, institutional deficiencies including 
restrictive government regulations and property tenure; 
 the status of economic and cultural development; 
 the motivation for innovation, which is ultimately determined by prevailing 
incentive systems that are often based on societal values other than the risk of 
climate change.

Addressing Barriers

6.25 Many policy instruments are available to facilitate the penetration of lower 
carbon intensity technologies and modified consumption patterns. They include 
energy pricing strategies, e.g., carbon or energy taxes and reduced energy 
subsidies, incentives such as provisions for accelerated depreciation and 
reduced cost for the consumers, tradable emission permits, reduction of market 
imperfections, negotiated agreements with industry, new standards and 
product labelling and increased support for research and development. (See 
chapter 11 of the contribution of Working Group III to the IPCC Second 
Assessment Report for more detailed analyses of the advantages and 
disadvantages of such instruments.)

6.26 The optimal mix of policy instruments will vary from country to country 
depending upon political structure and societal receptiveness. It will also vary 
between economic sectors and on whether or not there is a tradition of 
negotiated agreements between government and industry.

6.27 The best combination of policies will also vary over time. Studies indicate 
that high priority should initially be given to the removal of existing barriers, to 
the implementation of best available technologies, elimination of barriers due to 
existing investments in raw materials, processes and products, vested interests, 
institutional inertia and lack of information and awareness. The longer-run 
costs of abatement can be reduced by improved price signals, research and 
development and emphasis on effective information programmes.

6.28 No significant shift in technical consumption patterns towards low-
emitting products and services is likely if relative prices do not encourage it. 
The impact of price signals, whether achieved through taxes or incentives or 
tradable permits, will ultimately depend on:


 continuity of the policy, including confidence in its long-run stability, 
prevention of 
"free riders", and progressiveness in implementation; 
 the way in which revenues arising from the price signals are recycled in the 
economy.

6.29 The use of taxes to alter market prices requires careful consideration in 
order to avoid market distortions and decreasing economic efficiency, which 
could negate the overall impact of climate change policies. On the other hand, if 
the proceeds of a carbon tax are used to reduce other taxes which have a 
distortionary impact on labour and capital, an effective use of the tax might be 
achieved.. Such a move might simultaneously help to reduce long-term 
concerns about climate change with concern about unemployment and public 
expenditure levels and their allocation. 

Combining Mitigation Options

6.30 Each of the technologies and measures discussed above has the potential 
to contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions and the enhancement of GHG 
sinks. Evaluating the effectiveness of these individual options is relatively 
straightforward. However, understanding the overall effectiveness of 
combinations of these options to reduce energy demand and increase use of 
energy resources with lower emissions requires development and evaluation of 
an integrated mitigation strategy. There is no unique path to realization of deep 
emissions reductions. 

6.31 Several modelling experiments suggest that achieving deep reductions in 
emissions is possible at low cost over the long term. However, it is not 
possible to identify a least-cost future energy system for the longer term, as the 
relative costs of options depend on resource constraints, technological 
opportunities that are imperfectly known and on actions to be taken by 
governments and the private sector. Published estimates of the cost of 
mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon sequestration vary 
substantially. Despite significant progress in reconciling methodological and 
technical differences concerning model structures and data, major differences 
concerning underlying assumptions remain. These differences reflect 
alternative perspectives about such factors as the efficiency of energy markets, 
distortions in fiscal systems, availability of new technologies and the costs o 
implementation.







7.1 Article 2 provides the framework for international cooperation in decision-
making to address climate change. Article 3 sets out a number of principles for 
the implementation of the provisions of the Convention including Article 2. 

7.2 Climate change presents the decision-maker with a formidable set of 
challenges: 
 very long planning horizon;

 large uncertainties;

 wide regional variations in causes, potential impacts - positive and negative - 
and costs;

 many greenhouse gases involving many sectors of societies. Yet another 
challenge is that the atmosphere is an international public good in that all 
countries are affected by each country's greenhouse gas emissions. Decisions 
in the short term should be taken with the long-term perspective in mind and 
vice versa. 

7.3 These challenges have several characteristics that affect the decision 
making process:


 Long time scales of relevance suggest the need for early decision-making: (a) 
from emissions of greenhouse gases to the response of the climate system, (b) 
for adaptation of the ecosystems and natural resource systems to climate 
change, (c) for the climate system to come to equilibrium once greenhouse gas 
concentrations are stabilized, (d) for turnover of infrastructure and capital in the 
energy, industrial, transport and commercial/residential buildings sectors; and 
(e) the nature of international and national political processes. 
 While knowledge about climate change, its potential effects, and the 
advantages 
and disadvantages of various responses is increasing, there are still critical 
uncertainties regarding basic scientific and socio-economic issues. These 
uncertainties make it difficult to assess the risks posed by anthropogenic 
climate change, and increase the costs of insurance and new infrastructure. 
 Some potential impacts of climate change, such as loss of biological diversity 
and 
land, are irreversible. Some other impacts may be disproportionate to the 
changes in climate because of likely thresholds. 
 Impacts and the costs of mitigation and adaptation will vary both within and 
among countries raising issues of intranational and international equity. 
Perceived equity is an important element for legitimizing decisions and 
promoting cooperation.

 Sustainable development is often defined as "meeting the needs of the present 
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs". Because future generations are not able to influence directly the actions 
taken that will affect their well-being, climate change raises issues of inter-
generational equity. These issues are generally addressed through the choice of 
a discount rate. Making the choice is a question of values, a profound ethical 
question, since the choice inherently compares the costs of present measures 
against possible damages suffered by future generations if no action is taken. 
 Economic efficiency requires that emission reductions occur where their cost 
is 
lowest, irrespective of who bears the financial burden. For purposes of 
analysis, it is useful to separate efficiency (what to do and how it is done) from 
equity (who bears the burden) considerations. This analytical separation can be 
implemented in practice only if effective institutions exist or can be created for 
appropriate redistribution of climate change costs.

 Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase sinks can yield 
multiple additional benefits (e.g., rural employment generation, reduced traffic 
congestion, reduced emissions of urban smog precursors). The magnitude of 
these other benefits depends on local circumstances. When other priorities such 
as provision of basic needs or reducing regional or local pollution are perceived 
to be more important, actions taken to address them are generally likely to 
advance the goal of greenhouse gas mitigation simultaneously. 
 Radiative forcing of climate warming is caused by anthropogenic emissions of 
other greenhouse gases in addition to CO2. Cooling due to anthropogenic 
aerosols should also be taken into account. To achieve stabilization of all 
greenhouse gas concentrations, the concept of equivalent CO2 can be used. It 
is possible to increase the efficiency of strategies to stabilize concentrations by 
reducing initially the emissions of those gases which have the lowest marginal 
costs of control.

7.4 A stabilization objective could be based upon a benefit-cost analysis, a 
cost-effectiveness approach or an absolute standard. Benefit-cost analysis or 
trade-off analysis attempts to identify the most efficient climate change strategy 
by balancing the costs of mitigation and adaptation measures against the 
damages avoided by these measures, including non-market costs such as 
damage to ecosystems or loss of species.

7.5 A cost-effectiveness approach would begin with a maximum atmospheric 
concentration of greenhouse gases, based on an assessment of the risks 
associated with different concentrations and the costs of achieving those 
concentrations. The objective would be reach the specified target at the lowest 
total cost, including non-market costs. 


7.6 An absolute standard approach would define a maximum atmospheric 
concentration of greenhouse gases that is considered to constitute "dangerous 
anthropogenic interference with the climate system" on the basis of predicted 
biophysical impacts of climate change, independent of the economic and social 
impacts of achieving this concentration. Economists generally reject the 
absolute standard approach, believing that trade-offs are always relevant. At 
the same time, it is recognized that many governments set policies on the basis 
of underlying legislation that is itself based on an absolute standard. Even 
under the absolute standard approach, mitigation and adaptation measures 
should be chosen to achieve the standard at least cost. 

7.7 Given the interrelated nature of the global economic system, attempts to 
mitigate climate change through actions in one region or sector may have 
offsetting effects which increase emissions from other regions or sectors. 
These emission reduction leakages can be reduced through coordinated actions 
of groups of countries. 

Considerations for moving towards the ultimate objective 

7.8 Article 2 of the Convention introduces several specific considerations to be 
taken into account in moving towards stabilization of GHG concentrations. 
The ability of ecosystems to adapt naturally depends critically on the rate of 
climate change. Analyses suggest that in some regions significant reductions in 
food security may occur but that global food production may not be seriously 
threatened. Thus, with free, fair and unrestricted trade, food security is 
unlikely to be threatened by the risks of climate change due to a greenhouse 
warming. Economic development may not be able to proceed in a sustainable 
manner in those areas where climate change could worsen existing water and 
food shortages, public health concerns and exposure to natural disasters.

7.9 A number of levels for stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations have 
been explored in the scientific literature. While some effects of different levels 
can be identified or inferred from this literature (for example, a rate of global 
mean temperature increase of 0.1 C per decade may result in significant loss of 
species from forest and montane ecosystems), there is not enough information 
to specify completely the consequences of various concentrations or emissions 
pathways for ecosystems, food production, or sustainable development.

7.10 Nonetheless, a number of observations of relevance to policymaking can 
be made about stabilization and potential options to achieve it: 
 The impacts of stabilizing at a level of 750 ppmv (of equivalent CO2, implying 
a 
value for CO2 alone close to thrice its pre-industrial concentration) or higher 
are outside documented past fluctuations in greenhouse gas concentrations and 
climate and associated impacts;

 In order to achieve stabilization near or below 750 ppmv, emissions will have 
to 
fall substantially below those of the IPCC IS92a emissions scenario within the 
next few decades. Higher initial emissions would require more drastic 
reductions later to achieve stabilization;

 Stabilizing concentrations at any of the levels illustrated in this discussion 
requires initiation of near term measures including: (i) research and 
development on energy efficiency improvements, alternative sources of 
energy, and strategies to accelerate diffusion of new technologies into the 
market place; (ii) policies to encourage replacement of long-lived energy, 
transportation and industrial infrastructure in normal investment cycles with 
plant and equipment that provides the highest amount of service and the lowest 
level of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of input energy and materials; (iii) 
research and monitoring to promote a better understanding of the climate 
system and the impacts of climate variability; and (iv) action of other measures 
with multiple benefits and negative or low cost. Such measures would begin 
the process of moving towards eventual stabilization while further information 
is developed; 
 Delaying action might conceivably reduce the overall costs of mitigation, but 
would increase both the rate and the eventual magnitude of climate change, and 
hence the adaptation and damage costs.

7.11 "No regrets" measures are those whose benefits, such as reduced energy 
costs and lower emissions of local and regional pollutants, equal or exceed 
their cost to society, excluding the benefits of mitigation of climate change. 
Such "no regrets" mitigation and adaptation measures would appear justified 
on technical grounds unrelated to the risks of rapid climate change due to 
greenhouse gases. The expectation of net damages from climate change and the 
precautionary principle provide a rationale for going beyond "no regrets".

7.12 A sequential decision-making approach offers a prudent strategy that can 
be adjusted in the light of new information and could take into account factors 
such as future flexibility and current and future costs. Near term decisions 
along an optimal path (i.e., modest cost mitigation measures) will be the same 
for a wide range of ultimate stabilization concentrations (see chapter 5 also). 

7.13 A broad portfolio of actions aimed at mitigation, adaptation and reducing 
uncertainties through further research provides a balanced approach to 
managing the risks of anthropogenic climate change. The appropriate portfolio 
will differ from country to country. A well-chosen portfolio of climate change 
investments will yield greater benefit for a given cost than any one option 
undertaken by itself.

<b>ABSTRACT</b><p>



An overview of activities in the United States and 

Europe including a look at installed capacity, generation, 

specific yield, price, and environmental impact. <p>

  

The 1992-1993 period saw the wind industry reach several 

significant milestones. Worldwide wind generation exceeded 4 

TWh during 1992 for the first time and will surpass 5 TWh in 

1993. See Table 1. By 1995, total generation will approach 7 TWh. 

During 1993, Europe's total installed wind generating 

capacity will exeeded 1,000 MW for the first time: the 

Netherlands and the United Kingdom will each top 100 MW and 

Germany will exceed 300 MW. <p>

Europe's rapid growth will push wind energy beyond another 

milestonein 1993 when sales of wind turbines and wind-

generated electricity exceed $1 billion (thousand million), 

an increase of nearly $200 million over 1992 sales. 1993 

turnover includes $600 million in project development, and 

sales of wind-generated electricity worth an estimated $450 

million. The industry has not seen turnover in excess of $1 

billion (thousand million) since 1985 during the height of 

California's <I>wind rush</I>. At that time, revenues were due almost entirely to sales of new wind turbines.<p>

 

Europe's feverish development of wind energy shows little 

sign of abating. Altogether, Europe will install 350 MW of 

capacity in 1993, up from nearly 250 MW last year. European 

development is far outpacing the 15 MW installed in North 

America during 1992, and the 25 MW expected this year. By 

the end of 1993, Europeans will be operating 1,200 MW of 

wind generation, and if the present pace continues, will 

outstrip the United States in total installed capacity by 

the end of 1995.<p>

 

Denmark currently accounts for half the capacity installed 

in Europe and continues to add 40-50 MW per year in one of 

Europe's most stable domestic markets. Germany accounts for 

another fifth, with new capacity additions in Germany now 

rivaling that of any other country in the world, including 

Denmark. See Figure 1.<p>

<b>EUROPE TO SURPASS NORTH AMERICA IN 1995</b><p>

 

North America's share of world wind generation  fell to 66 

percent in 1992, the lowest level in a decade. As recently 

as 1990, California alone accounted for 78 percent of world-

wide wind generation. The slide in America's leading role in 

the world's wind industry began with a boom in European wind 

development while growth stagnated in the United States. A 

lack of new installations and a poor wind year in 1992 

contributed to the first fall in California production since 

wind development began in the early 1980s. If present trends 

continue, European generation will exceed that of North 

America by the end of 1995. See Figure 2.<p>

<b>TEHACHAPI LEADS IN GENERATION</b> <p>

 

California electric utilities report that the Tehachapi Pass 

led the world in wind-electric production during 1992. See 

Figure 3.<p> 

<center>

<iMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="overview3.gif"><p>

</center>

<center>Figure 3. Ranking of Major Production Centers.</center><p>



For the first time, production in the Tehachapi  

Pass exceeded that of the Altamont Pass east of San Francis-

co. Southern California Edison Co. estimates that wind 

turbines near Tehachapi, Calif. generated 1.158 TWh during 1992, while Pacific Gas & Electric Co. estimates that total Altamont production fell from a high in 1991 of 1.079 TWh to 

approximately 1.010 TWh in 1992. Despite poor winds during 

1992, Tehachapi's generation increased over that of the 

1.064 billion kWh produced during 1991. Altamont contains 

about one-sixth more wind turbines than Tehachapi, but 

Tehachapi's more powerful wind resource, and greater number 

of state-of-the-art turbines has led to continuing improve-

ments in production. The gap between the two sites will 

widen further this year. Production by mid-1993 is down 20-

30% in the Altamont Pass, while above average winds in Te-

hachapi have led SCE to project record-breaking production 

approaching 1.4 TWh. By the end of 1993, Denmark should 

surpass 1 TWh placing it alongside the Altamont Pass in 

annual generation.<p>

 

<b>CURRENT ACTIVITY IN NORTH AMERICA</b><p>

 

During 1993 and early 1994, wind developers will erect 100 

MW of capacity in North America: 25 MW in California, 18 MW 

in Alberta, 26 MW in Iowa, and 25 MW in Minnesota. Between 

1995 and 1997, wind companies will install 300-350 MW in 

North America outside of California: 10 MW in Saskatchewan, 

5 MW in Quebec, 100 MW in Washington, 60 MW in Wyoming, 50 

MW or more in Texas, 75 MW in Minnesota, 10 MW in Wisconsin, 

and 65 MW in Maine. Another 200 MW or more may be added in 

California during this period. However, this may be insuffi-

cient to offset retirements of existing capacity in the 

state. Several firms are also active in Mexico, where the 

first small project should be completed in 1993.<p>

 

<b>PROJECT PRICE DECLINES</b><p>

 

The market price paid for wind power plants has decreased 

dramatically since the first projects were built in Califor-

nia. However, the price of installed wind plants bears 

little resemblance to the much-touted cost of $1,000/kW of 

installed capacity with the exception of projects installed 

by Danish utilities.(1) See Figure 4. California projects 

reached a low of $1,250/kW in 1987. Subsequent projects were 

more costly because of the construction of a 45 mile high 

voltage transmission line.(2) These projects also included 

the developer's up front profit. Similarly, non-utility 

projects in England and Wales are costing more than 

$2,000/kW, among the most costly in Europe. Only Danish 

utility projects are showing a steady decline in installed 

costs, resulting from competitive procurement and low-

interest financing. Danish utilities also take their profit 

out over the life of the project.<p>

<b>SPECIFIC YIELD STILL INCREASING</b><p>

 

According to data from the CEC's Performance Reporting 

System, BTM Consult and Denmark's Risoe National Laboratory, 

the specific yield of individual wind turbines and wind 

power plants in California and Denmark have increased stead-

ily since the early 1980s. See Figure 5. The exception is 

average yield in California wind plants and the yield of 

post-1985 wind plants in California. The specific yield in 

California reached a peak in 1990 and has declined since. 

There are several possible explanations. Wind speeds have 

suffered during the late 1980s and early 1990s due to "El 

Nino" and from a volcanic eruption in the Philippines. The 

turbine stock may also be showing signs of age.<p>



<center> 

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="overview5.gif"><p>



Figure 5. Average Annual Specific Yield.</center><p>  



Of note is the steady improvement in specific yield with 

succeeding design iterations, both in California and Den-

mark. Medium-sized wind turbines have steadily increased in 

size since introduction of the 55 kW Danish wind turbine 

(15-16 meters in diameter) in the early 1980s. Machine 

designs have increased in modest increments from 55 kW to 

100 kW, to 200 kW, to 400 kW, and to today's state-of-the-

art machines in the 500 kW range. See Figure 6.<p>



<center> 

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="overview6.gif"><p>

Figure 6. Increasing Rotor Diameter in Successive Design Iterations.

</center><p> 

 

Though the specific yield (the kWh generated per year per 

square meter of rotor area) increases for each Danish wind 

turbine model in succeeding years, the most dramatic im-

provement is from one wind turbine model to the next.(3) The 

average specific yield of the 450 kW model of 850-900 

kWh/m2/yr is twice that of the early 55 kW model. Even the 

later 55 kW model shows a marked performance improvement 

over the previous version. The same results can be seen in 

California, when the specific yield of all wind turbines is 

contrasted with those installed since 1985. The improved 

performance is attributable to greater reliability, improved 

airfoils, and taller towers. Next to greater reliability, 

the most important contributor to higher specific yields is 

taller towers. Tower heights have nearly doubled from 18 

meters to 35 meters since the early 1980s. Doubling the 

tower height alone will increase the power available more 

than 30%. For sites yielding 600 kWh/m2/yr the taller towers 

will add nearly 200 kWh/m2/yr, bringing total yield to 800 

kWh/m2/yr at a good site.<p>

 

At exceptional sites, such as on the west coast of the 

Jutland peninsula (7 m/s), or atop Whitewater Hill near Palm 

Springs, contemporary turbines should yield 1,000-1,250 

kWh/m2/yr. See Figure 7. San Gorgonio Farms, which operates 

the world's most productive wind plant, consistently produc-

es within this range. There are numerous sites in Northern 

Europe where specific yields exceed 1,000 kWh/m2/yr, includ-

ing coastal Germany, and the Netherlands.<p>

<b>REPOWERING CALIFORNIA</b><p>

 

As mentioned, California's turbine stock is comprised large-

ly of early, less cost-effective designs. Some of the tur-

bines are ten years old. The aging stock may have partially 

contributed to the decline of average specific yield during 

1991 and 1992. Nearly 3,100 turbines comprising 230 MW of 

capacity are of first generation design. See Table 2. These 

turbines are costly to maintain, often sited poorly, in-

stalled on short towers, and unreliable. Many of them are 

unsalvageable. The bulk of the capacity in the state is 

provided by second generation designs, including 100-150 kW 

Danish machines and U.S. Windpower's 56-100. There are 1,300 

state-of-the-art turbines representing 300 MW of capacity. <p>

</pre><p> 

The American Wind Energy Association's west coast office, in 

a study for the California Energy Commission, estimated that 

repowering California's wind plants by replacing first and 

second generation designs with contemporary machines could 

lower operations and maintenance costs, reduce the density 

of turbines on the landscape by more than 50%, and increase 

annual generation by 30% to 3.6 TWh. The AWEA study concluded 
that repowering with modern turbines would make the California 
industry more competitive with other resources, 

preserve jobs, and reduce the industry's aesthetic impact, 

thus improving its public acceptance.<p>

 

The AWEA study took the first-ever truly comprehensive 

employment survey of California wind plant operators and 

their service providers. See Table 3. AWEA found that there 

are 1,250 people working directly with wind energy in California 
for 460 jobs/TWh/yr. This compares well with estimates by BTM 
Consult of the number of people employed in 

Denmark. BTM Consult estimates there are nearly 600 manufac-

turing jobs in Denmark for 100 jobs/MW of manufacturing and 

another 400 people are employed in the service sector for 

440 jobs/TWh.(4) <p>

<b>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT</b><p>

 

During 1992 and 1993, the wind industry has made consider-

able strides towards quieting wind turbine noise. Bonus, 

Vestas, and WEG have demonstrated that noise emissions can 

be reduced significantly by focusing attention on tip 

design, trailing edge thickness, drive-train compliance, 

noise insulation, and nacelle isolation. Keeping tip speeds 

to 60 m/s or less is an important means for reducing aerody-

namic noise. These wind turbines are 5-7 dB(A) quieter in 

their noise emissions than competitive machines designed 

during the mid-1980s operating at higher tip speeds. <p>

 

Despite the industry's best efforts, wind turbines will 

introduce noise into many rural environments previously 

noted for their solitude. This intrusion creates concern, 

fear, and objections until the public has had ample time to 

become familiar with the technology. See Figure 8. It has 

taken the community of Tehachapi a decade to become comfortable 

with its wind industry. It was Tehachapi's experience 

that prior to development there was broad support of wind 

energy in the abstract. Yet when wind projects were first 

developed, there was a loud outcry and consternation that 

the wind turbines would devour the small town of 5,000. 

Several years after installation qualitative acceptance has 

resumed to near pre-project levels. Energy Connection, a 

Dutch wind developer, has observed the same effect in the 

Netherlands.(5)<p>

Wind energy's most significant impact remains its use of the 

visual amenity. Wind energy will only reach its potential 

when the industry addresses aesthetic impact. However, 

public opinion surveys and architectural studies in the 

United States and Europe can provide guidelines for minimiz-

ing wind's aesthetic impact.<p>

 

The single most important measure is aesthetic uniformity. 

All wind turbines and towers within a wind plant must look 

similar. They need not be identical, but they must appear 

similar. This is less of a problem in Europe than in the 

United States. In California, for example, it is common for 

a developer to install a wind plant containing hundreds of 

different wind turbines in a seemingly incoherent mix. <p>

 

To maintain visual uniformity within a wind plant that 

comprises one visual unit, all wind turbines must spin in 

the same direction, have the same number of blades, use the 

same tower,  and use the same color scheme. If another wind 

turbine and tower combination will be installed nearby, 

there must be sufficient visual separation to make the 

projects distinct from one another.<p>

 

Turbines should all be of the same height unless they are 

part of a coherent "wind wall", with alternating groups of 

turbines on towers of different heights. If turbines are of 

different heights, all towers should appear similar if not 

identical. This provision alone would eliminate much of the 

jumble and visual clutter typical of many California wind 

plants.<p>

 

Further, developers must minimize roads or eliminate them 

altogether. This prevents unsightly cut and fill slopes in 

steep terrain, and minimizes the amount of land used by the 

wind plant. <p>

 

If two-bladed turbines are used, all turbines must park 

their rotors in the same position. This "synchronized stop" 

provides visual balance for what many consider an ungainly 

design choice. Three-bladed rotors, which appear more visu-

ally symmetrical to observers than two-bladed rotors, can be 

parked in any position.<p>

 

No wind turbine should ever go out undressed: none should 

operate without a nacelle cover. Nose cones and nacelle 

covers serve a valuable purpose. They smooth the angular 

lines of the drive train and aid in making the nacelle a 

part of a visual whole with the tower. Nacelle covers should 

be replaced immediately if they blow off.<p>

 

Designers should strive toward visual unity between rotor, 

nacelle, and tower. A wind turbine need not be a "box on a 

stick." Lattice towers need not appear cluttered with cross 

braces and angular lines. Lattice towers can be designed 

with graceful curves and a sparing use of cross braces. <p>

 

The industry must address the question of aesthetics or the 

publics' general support will be lost. Consider the reversal 

of public attitudes towards nuclear power during the 1960s. 

Wind is currently a preferred technology even when account-

ing for wind's aesthetic impact.(6) See Figure 9. This 

support is tenuous and can be squandered by inappropriate 

development.<p>

<b>COMMUNITY ASSIMILATION</b><p>

 

Community acceptance of wind energy can be aided by address-

ing community concerns, by providing information about the 

operation of nearby wind turbines and the companies in-

volved, and by low-key, long-term participation of the wind 

industry in community events. In Tehachapi the Kern Wind 

Energy Association is the focal point for inquiries about 

wind energy and the local wind industry. KWEA and member 

companies offer speakers for local service clubs, partici-

pate in local festivals, and provide simple, inexpensive 

brochures and postcards to local merchants for distribution 

to tourists and residents alike. KWEA also operates a low-

power radio transmitter for broadcasting information about 

the wind industry to motorists on Highway 58, a major artery 

crossing the Tehachapi Mountains. More recently KWEA has 

sponsored a new local event: the Tehachapi Wind Fair. The 

success of this weekend event, which drew 14,000 the first 

year and 12,000 the next, confirms that the Tehachapi wind 

industry has become an accepted part of the community.<p>

 

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>

 

Wind generation now meets 1% of California's electrical 

supply and 3% of Denmark's electrical consumption. Worldwide 

wind generation will exceed 6 TWh in 1995, when Europe will 

surpass North America in total generation and installed 

capacity. At good sites, medium-sized wind turbines today 

should produce specific yields in excess of 800 kWh/m2/yr. 

Wind energy can become an accepted part of the community if 

designers and developers keep community interests in mind, 

especially those of wind's aesthetic impact on the land-

scape.<p>

<title>Wind Farms of the World</title>

<head><b>
<h1>Wind Farms of the World</h1></b></head><p>

<body>
Take a tour of selected wind farms around the world. The wind power plants 
in the tour are <a href="location.html">located </a> in <a href="#California">California</a>,  <a href="#Asia">India</a>, the <a href="#United Kingdom
">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="#Continental Europe">Continental Europe.</a><p>
 
Wind Farms, or more correctly wind power plants, are arrays of multiple 
wind turbines. The number of wind turbines in the array varies from no 
more than two or three in a small cluster to the thousands of machines 
in California's windy passes.<p>
 
Though it may seem a feature of the modern landscape, the use of 
multiple wind turbines to perform a task is nothing new. Only by 
tapping the power of multiple windmills could Jan Leeghwater 
(literally the "empty water" Jan), and the engineers that followed 
him, drain the polders and make the Netherlands what it is today. The 
Dutch called these early wind farms <i>gangs</i> of windmills and a 
group can still be seen southeast of Rotterdam at Kinderdijk. This 
water pumping wind plant was in use until the 1950s.<p>
 
Windmills may also have been the driving force of the industrial 
revolution. During the eighteenth century the Zaan region northwest of 
Amsterdam became Holland's powerhouse. There Dutch millers constructed 
what must have been an amazing assembly of more than 700 
<i>industrial</i> windmills along the Zaan River. These windmills 
drove Dutch industry at a time when Britain and Germany were still 
trying to figure out what to do with a black rock they found 
underground. Monuments to the region's halcyon days can still be seen 
at Zaanse Schans.<p>
 
Modern wind plants generate electricity--lots of it. This electricity 
can be used to pump water in the Netherlands, power a hair dryer for a 
Hollywood starlet, or cool Bob Hope's mansion near Palm Springs. <p>
 
The 28,000 wind turbines operating worldwide generate more than 7.8 
Terawatt-hours (7,800,000,000 kWh) of electricity annually. Wind 
plants now scan the globe from a fjord in Denmark to the deserts 
of Southern California, from the polders of the Netherlands to the 
shores of the Arabian Sea, from the rugged Tehachapi Mountains to the 
moors of Britain's Pennines.<p>

The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program is to achieve significant 
environmental and public health benefits through
reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
the primary causes of acid
rain. To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society, the program 
employs both traditional and
innovative, market-based approaches for controlling air pollution. In addition, the program
encourages energy efficiency and pollution prevention.<p>
 Title IV of the Clean Air Act sets as its primary goal the reduction 
 of annual SO2 emissions by 10
million tons below 1980 levels. To achieve these reductions, the law 
requires a two-phase tightening
of the restrictions placed on fossil fuel-fired power plants.<p>
 Phase I began in 1995 and affects 110 mostly coal-burning electric 
 utility plants located in 21 eastern
and midwestern states. Phase II, which begins in the year 2000, 
tightens the annual emissions limits
imposed on these large, higher emitting plants and also sets restrictions 
on smaller, cleaner plants fired
by coal, oil, and gas. The program affects existing utility units 
serving generators with an output capacity of greater than
25 megawatts and all new utility units.<p>
 The Act also calls for a 2 million ton reduction in NOx emissions by the year 2000. A significant
portion of this reduction will be achieved by coal-fired utility boilers that will be required to install
low NOx burner technologies and to meet new emissions standards.<p>

<h3>Operating Principles:  Feasible, Flexible, Accountable</h3>
<hr>

The Acid Rain Program is implemented through an integrated set of rules and guidance designed to
accomplish three primary objectives:<br>
<ol>
<li>Achieve environmental benefits through reductions in S02 and NOx emissions.
<li>Facilitate active trading of allowances and use of other compliance options to minimize compliance
costs, maximize economic efficiency, and permit strong economic growth.
<li>Promote pollution prevention and energy efficient strategies and technologies.
</ol>
Each individual component fulfills a vital function in the larger program:
<ul>
<li>the allowance trading system creates low-cost rules of exchange that minimize government intrusion and make allowance trading a viable compliance strategy for reducing SO2
<li>the opt-in program allows nonaffected industrial and small utility units to participate in allowance trading
<li>the NOx emissions reduction rule sets new NOx emissions standards for existing coal-fired utility boilers and allows emissions averaging to reduce costs
<li>the permitting process affords sources maximum flexibility in selecting
the most cost-effective approach to reducing emissions
<li>the continuous emission monitoring (CEM) requirements provide credible accounting of emissions to ensure the integrity of the market-based
allowance system and the achievement of the reduction goals
<li>the excess emissions provision provides incentives to ensure self-enforcement, greatly reducing the need for government intervention
<li>the appeals procedures allow the  regulated community to appeal decisions with which it may disagree
</ul>
Together these measures ensure the achievement of environmental benefits at the least cost to society.<p>

<h3>Environmental Benefits</h3>
<hr>

     Acid rain causes acidification of lakes and streams and contributes to damage of trees at high elevations (for
example, red spruce trees above 2,000 feet in elevation).  In addition, acid rain accelerates the decay of building materials and paints, including
irreplaceable buildings, statues,and sculptures that are part of our nation's cultural heritage.
Prior to falling to the earth, SO2 and NOx gases and their particulate matter derivatives, 
sulfates and nitrates, contribute to visibility degradation and impact public health.<p>
     Implementation of the Acid Rain Program under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments will confer significant benefits on the nation. 
By reducing SO2 and NOx, many acidified lakes and streams will significantly improve so that they can once
again support fish life.  Visibility will improve, allowing for increased enjoyment of scenic vistas across our country, particularly in National Parks.  
Stress to our forests that populate the ridges of mountains from Maine to Georgia
will be reduced.  Deterioration of our historic buildings and monuments will be slowed.  Finally,
reductions in SO2 and NOx will reduce sulfates, nitrates, and ground level ozone (smog), leading
to improvements in public health.<p>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Allowance Trading</h3>
<hr>

 The Acid Rain Program represents a dramatic departure from traditional command and control
regulatory methods that establish specific inflexible emissions limitations with which all affected
sources must comply. Instead, the program introduces an allowance trading system that harnesses
the incentives of the free market to reduce pollution.<p> 
 Under this system, affected utility units were allocated allowances based on their historic fuel consumption and a specific emissions
rate. Each allowance permits a unit to emit 1 ton of SO2 during or after a specified year. For each
ton of SO2 discharged in a given year, one allowance is retired, that is, it can no longer be used.<p>
 Allowances may be bought, sold, or banked. Any person may acquire allowances and participate
in the trading system. However, regardless of the number of allowances a source holds, it may not
emit at levels that would violate federal or state limits set under Title I of the Clean Air Act to protect public
health.<p>
 At the end of the year, utilities are granted a 30-day true-up or grace period, during which SO2
allowances may be purchased, if necessary, to cover each unit's emissions for the year. At the end
of the grace period, the allowances a unit holds in its compliance account must equal or exceed
the annual SO2 emissions recorded by the unit's monitoring system. Any remaining allowances may be sold or
banked for use in future years.<p>
 During Phase II of the program, the Act sets a permanent ceiling (or cap) of 8.95 million
allowances for total annual allowance allocations to utilities. This cap firmly restricts emissions and ensures that environmental benefits will be achieved and maintained.<p>
For more information, see 
<a href="allsys.html">Allowance System</a>

<br><a name="ats"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>The Allowance Tracking System</h3>
<hr>

 EPA has instituted an electronic recordkeeping and notification system called the Allowance
Tracking System (ATS) to track allowance transactions and the status of allowance
accounts. ATS is the official tally of allowances by which EPA determines compliance
with the emissions limitations. Any party interested in participating in the trading system may
open an ATS account by submitting an application to EPA. Accounts contain information on
unit account balances, account representatives (which must be appointed by each
trading party), and serial numbers for each allowance. ATS is computerized to expedite the
flow of data and to assist in the development of a viable market for allowances.<p>
For more information, see 
<a href="ats/atsintro.html">Allowance Tracking System</a>

<br><a name="auctions"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Auctions and Direct Sales</h3>
<hr>

EPA holds allowance auctions and a direct sale annually. The auctions 
help to send the market an
allowance price signal, as well as furnish utilities with an additional 
avenue for purchasing needed
allowances.  The direct sale offers allowances at a fixed price of 
$1,500 (adjusted for inflation). Anyone can buy allowances in
the direct sale, but independent power producers (IPPs) can obtain 
written guarantees from EPA
stating that they have first priority. These guarantees, which are 
awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, secure the option for 
qualified IPPs to purchase a yearly amount of allowances over
a 30 year span. This provision enables IPPs to assure lenders that 
they will have access to the
allowances they need to build and operate new units.<p>
For more information, see 
<a href="auctions/aucmain.html">Allowance Auctions and Direct Sales</a>

<br><a name="optin"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Voluntary Entry:  The Opt-in Program</h3>
<hr>

The Opt-in Program expands EPA's Acid Rain
Program to include additional sulfur dioxide (SO2)
emitting sources.  Recognizing that there are
additional emission reduction opportunities in the
industrial sector, Congress established the Opt-in
Program under section 410 of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990.  The Opt-in Program allows
sources not required to participate in the Acid Rain
Program the opportunity to enter the program on a
voluntary basis, reduce their SO2 emissions, and
receive their own acid rain allowances.<p>
     The participation of these additional sources
will reduce the cost of achieving the 10 million ton
reduction in SO2 emissions mandated under the
Clean Air Act.  As participating sources reduce
their SO2 emissions at a relatively low cost, their
reductions -- in the form of allowances -- can be
transferred to electric utilities where emission
reductions are more expensive.<p>
     The Opt-in Program offers a combustion source
a financial incentive to voluntarily reduce its SO2
emissions.  By reducing emissions below its
allowance allocation, an opt-in source will create
unused allowances, which it can sell in the SO2
allowance market.  Opting in will be profitable if
the revenue from allowances exceeds the combined
cost of the emissions reduction and the cost of
participating in the Opt-in Program.<p>
For more information, see 
<a href="optin/optin.html">The Opt-in Program</a>

<br><a name="impetus"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Pollution Prevention</h3>
<hr>

 The allowance trading system contains an inherent incentive for utilities to prevent pollution, since
for each ton of SO2 that a utility avoids emitting, one fewer allowance must be retired. Utilities that reduce emissions through energy efficiency and renewable energy are able to sell, use, or bank their surplus allowances.  As also provided in the
Act, EPA has set aside a reserve of 300,000 allowances to stimulate energy efficiency and renewable energy generation. Those
utilities that either implement demand-side energy conservation programs to curtail emissions or
install renewable energy generation facilities may be eligible to receive extra allowances from this
reserve.<p>
For more information, see 
<a href="crerqa.html">Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve</a>

<br><a name="nox"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>The NOx Program</h3>
<hr>

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set a goal of reducing NOx by 2 million tons from 1980 levels.  The Acid Rain program focuses on one set of sources that emit
NOx, coal-fired electric utility boilers.  As with the SO2 emission reduction requirements, the
NOx program is implemented in two phases, beginnning in 1996 and 2000.<p>
The NOx program embodies many of the same principles of the SO2 trading program in
its design: a results-orientation, flexibility in the method to achieve emission reductions, and program
integrity through measurement of the emissions.  However, it does not "cap" NOx emissions as the SO2 program does, nor does it utilize an allowance trading system. <p>
Emission limitations for the NOx boilers provide flexibility for utilities by focusing
on the emission rate to be achieved (expressed in pounds of NOx per million Btu of heat input).  Two options for compliance with the emission limitations are provided:
<ul>
     <li>compliance with an individual emission rate for a boiler
     <br>
     <li>averaging of emission rates over two or more units to meet an overall emission rate limitation<BR>                                                                                                                                                                                  
            (Note:  these units must have the same owner or operator)
</ul>
These options give utilities flexibility to meet the emission limitations in the most
cost-effective way and allow for the further development of technologies to reduce the cost of
compliance.<p>
If a utility properly installs and maintains the appropriate control equipment designed to
meet the emission limitation established in the regulations, but is still unable to meet the limitation, the NOx program allows the utility to apply for an alternative emission limitation (AEL) that corresponds to the level
that the utility demonstrates is achievable.<p>
Phase I of the program, which was delayed a year due to litigation, is now scheduled to begin on
January 1, 1996, and will affect two types of boilers (which are among those already targeted for Phase I SO2 reductions): dry-bottom wall-fired boilers and tangentially fired boilers.  Dry-bottom wall-fired boilers must meet a limitation of 0.50 lbs of NOx per mmBtu averaged over the year, and tangentially fired boilers must achieve a limitation of 0.45 lbs of NOx per mmBtu per year.  Approximately 170 boilers must comply with these NOx performance standards during Phase I. <p>

The regulations governing the Phase II portion of the program are under development.  By January 1, 1997, EPA may issue regulations revising the limitations for dry-bottom wall-fired and tangentially fired boilers first subject to NOx limitations in Phase II and regulations covering the remaining types of coal-fired boilers.<p>

<br><a name="cem"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Emissions Monitoring and Reporting</h3>
<hr>

Under the Acid Rain Program, each unit must continuously measure and record its emissions of
S02, NOx, and CO2, as well as volumetric flow and opacity.  In most cases, a continuous emission monitoring (CEM) system must be used.  There are provisions for initial equipment certification procedures, periodic
quality assurance and quality control procedures, recordkeeping and reporting, and procedures for
filling in missing data periods.  Units report hourly emissions data to EPA on a quarterly basis.  This data is then recorded in the Emissions Tracking System, which serves as a repository of emissions data for the utility industry.  The emissions monitoring and reporting systems are
critical to the program. They instill confidence in allowance transactions by certifying the existence
and quantity of the commodity being traded and assure that NOx averaging plans are working.  Monitoring also ensures, through accurate
accounting, that the SO2 and NOx emissions reduction goals are met.<p>
For more information, see 
<a href="cems/cemlng.html">Continuous Emissions Monitoring</a>

<br><a name="emission"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Excess Emissions</h3>
<hr>

 If annual emissions exceed the number of allowances held, the owners or operators of delinquent units must pay a penalty of
$2,000 (adjusted for inflation) per excess ton of SO2 or NOx emissions. In addition, violating utilities must offset the excess SO2
emissions with allowances in an amount equivalent to the excess. A utility may
either have allowances deducted immediately or submit an excess emissions offset plan to EPA
that outlines how these cutbacks will be achieved.<p>

<br><a name="desigrep"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Designated Representatives</h3>
<hr>

 Each source appoints one individual, the Designated Representative, to represent the owners and
operators of the source in all matters relating to the holding and disposal of allowances for its
units that are affected by the Clean Air Act. The Designated Representative is also responsible for
all submissions pertaining to permits, compliance plans, emission monitoring reports, offset plans,
compliance certification, and other necessary information.  A source may appoint an Alternate Designated Representative to act on behalf of the Designated Representative.<p>

<br><a name="permits"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Permitting</h3>
<hr>

 The Designated Representative for each source is required to file a permit application for the
source and a compliance plan for each affected unit at the source. The Acid Rain permits and compliance
plans are simple, allow sources to fashion a compliance strategy
tailored to their individual needs, and foster trading. For example, they
allow sources to make real-time allowance trading decisions through the use of automatic permit
amendments.<p>   
 The permits stipulate the initial allowance allocation for each affected unit at a source. Permit applications must certify that each unit account will hold a sufficient number of allowances to cover
the unit's S02 emissions for the year, will comply with the applicable NOx limit, and will monitor and report emissions.  Permits are subject to public comment before approval.<p>
For more information, see 
<a href="permit.html">Permits</a>

<br><a name="options"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Compliance Options:  Freedom to Choose</h3>
<hr>

 The Acid Rain Program allows sources to select their own compliance strategy. For example, to
reduce SO2 an affected source may repower its units, use cleaner burning fuel, or reassign some
of its energy production capacity from dirtier units to cleaner ones.  Sources also may decide to reduce electricity generation by adopting conservation or efficiency measures.
Some of the options afford the unit special treatment, such as a compliance extension or extra
allowances. Most options, like fuel switching, require no special prior approval, allowing the source to respond quickly to market conditions without needing government approval.  For NOx, the source may meet the performance standard on a utility-unit basis, enter into an emissions averaging plan, or apply for an alternative emissions limitation.<p>
In either case, the program allows affected utilities to combine these and other options in ways
they see fit in order to tailor their compliance plans to the unique needs of each unit or system.<p>

<br><a name="model"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>A Model Program</h3>
<hr>

 EPA gained broad input into the
development of the Acid Rain Program by consulting with representatives from various stakeholder groups, including utilities, coal and gas
companies, emissions control equipment vendors, labor, academia, Public Utility Commissions,
state pollution control agencies, and environmental groups.<p>
 EPA is maintaining this open door policy as it implements the program, and it continues to solicit
ideas from the numerous and diverse individuals and groups interested in acid rain control. In
addition, EPA is collaborating with groups who wish to evaluate the benefits and effects of the program through economic and
environmental studies.<p>
 The Acid Rain Program is already being viewed around the world as a prototype for tackling
emerging environmental issues. The allowance trading system capitalizes on the power of the
marketplace to reduce SO2 emissions in the most cost-effective manner possible.  The permitting
program allows sources the flexibility to tailor and update their compliance strategy based on their
individual circumstances. The continuous emissions monitoring and reporting systems provide the accurate accounting of emissions
necessary to make the program work, and the excess emissions penalties provide strong incentives
for self-enforcement. Each of these separate components contributes to the effective working of
an integrated program that lets market incentives do the work to achieve cost-effective emissions
reductions.  The General Accounting Office recently confirmed the beneftis of this approach, projecting that the allowance trading system could save as much as $3 billion per year -- over 50% -- compared with a command and control approach typical of previous environmental protection programs.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How safe are the French tests?</B></FONT><P>
<B>Since 1945, the nuclear powers have exploded<BR>
 more than 2,000 nuclear devices.<BR> 
The French have exploded 175 in the Pacific</B></CENTER>.
<P>
50 years into the nuclear age, it seems we're finally coming to our senses. Next 
year the major nuclear powers look set  to sign a treaty banning just about all 
nuclear testing. But before it signs, France insists on slipping in 8 more 
underground tests.<P>
<P>
The outrage at the French government's decision is universal: it's been decried 
as arrogant colonialism, jeopardising progress to a nuclear weapons-free 
world.<P>
But there's also the strong belief that French nuclear tests have contaminated 
the Pacific and its people.<P>
<P>
<B>Given the litany of lies we've been told about nuclear tests - from the 
Marshall Islands to Maralinga -  people are understandably sceptical of 
France's assurance that all is safe. Claims that France's testing has 
poisoned the environment and caused cancers and birth defects are of 
great concern, but must be viewed in the light of the available facts. 
Tonight, we weigh up the scientific evidence. Is radioactivity the real 
danger?</B><P>

Radioactivity is something we  all have to live with, all the time. Cosmic rays 
from space, traces of radioactive elements in soil and our food; they make up 
what's called natural or background radioactivity. For Australia and South Pacific 
nations that's measured as 2 <I>MilliSieverts</I> a year. <P>
<P>
To put that in perspective: every time you have a medical procedure like a CAT 
scan or barium meal, you're exposed to about 4 times that radioactivity, up to 
8mS.  <P>
<P>
Most experts agree the 2 mS background radiation does us little or no harm. But 
when it comes to additional radioactivity: the less you're exposed to, the 
better.<p>
<p>
<H2><B>FALLOUT FROM ATMOSPHERIC TESTS</B></H2><P>

<B>Fallout is the radioactive byproduct of nuclear explosions. The greatest 
danger to humans are the radionuclides caesium 137, iodine 131, strontium 
90 and plutonium 239.</B><P>

In March 1954 the United States exploded a 15 megaton 
bomb on Bikini Atoll. People on some nearby Marshall Islands received a 
tragically high dose of radioactivity, with tragically clear results: thyroid disease 
and cancers, for which the United States belatedly paid compensation. <P>
We know from the survivors of the first nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki that doses of radioactivity above  around 500 mS do cause extra 
cancers and birth defects in a population. The Marshall Islanders were exposed 
to four times that level, nearly 2,000mS. The case is not so clear cut in French 
Polynesia.<P>
<B>Between 1966 and 1974, France exploded 41 atmospheric tests in 
French Polynesia. The total yield was 15 megatons equal to one US test on 
Bikini atoll.</B><P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Murray Matthews</b><BR>
<Font size=-1>National Radiation Lab New Zealand</font>.<BR>
<I>"Our estimate is that on average in the Pacific Islands from the entire history 
of atmospheric weapons tests individuals in the islands would have received 
around about one miliSievert over their entire life times from that testing."</I></CENTER>
<P>
One mS spread over 50 years. How can we be sure the exposure was so 
low? The figures come from the Australian Radiation Lab and the National 
Radiation Lab in NZ. Both exist to monitor radiation hazards and protect the 
populations. The labs have no vested interest in the nuclear industry - NZ 
doesn't even have a nuclear reactor.<P>

During the whole period of French atmospheric testing New Zealand monitored 
the levels of fallout at their network of South Pacific stations. <P>
The fallout was low, but uneven. There were rainouts, times when winds blew a 
cloud of radioactivity over island populations. If it rained, fallout rained down 
too.<P>

<CENTER><b>Dr Murray Matthews</b> <BR>
<Font size=-1>National Radiation Lab New Zealand</font>.<BR>
<I>"The most significant event occurred in 1966 when there was what we call 
a blow back from Mururoa towards Samoa in particular where the from the test 
went westward instead of eastward and it was caught in a heavy rain event at 
Samoa and this resulted in quite a lot of local contamination even then though 
the dose in that year from that event would have only been around naught point 
two miliSieverts.</I><P>
<I><B>Q.</B> So that's still a tenth of the background radiation?<P>
<B>A.</B>	1/10 of the annual background."</I></CENTER><P>
<B>There was another rainout in Tahiti in 1974, but again fallout was well 
below background. We know of one other rainout, in the Gambier Islands, 
just to the southeast of Mururoa. Fallout was higher, 4 mS, twice 
background radiation, but many hundreds of times lower than Marshall 
islands. Now, some of these figures do come from France's monitoring 
stations, but they closely correspond to the levels and patterns of fallout 
monitored by New Zealand.</B><P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Andrew McEwan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>National Radiation Lab, New Zealand</font><BR>
<I>"The radiation doses were so low that no effects from radiation would be 
expected. If there is no radiation there can be no radiation effects."</I>
</CENTER><P>
So what are we to make of the worrying claims that birth defects and cancer 
rates have increased in French Polynesia since the tests? As harsh as it may 
seem, reports of an increase of birth defects are all anecdotal - there simply isn't 
a register of birth defects in French Polynesia. And while evidence is building 
that cancers are increasing, there are other explanations.<P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Andrew McEwan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>National Radiation Lab, New Zealand</font><BR>
<I>"Increasing cancers will rise if the people live longer, if the life expectancy 
goes up then the cancer rates go up because cancer rates increase with age.  
Another cause of increased cancer is changes and life style factors such as 
increases in smoking and if the population is smoking heavily then there will be a 
very considerable rise in lung cancers and other cancers."</I></CENTER><P>
<p>
<H2><B>LEAKAGE FROM UNDERGROUND TESTS</B></H2><P>
<B>The French still contend their atmospheric tests were safe, but they did 
respond to international pressure on health concerns. In 1975, more than a 
decade after Britain, the US and Russia moved their nuclear tests 
underground, the French finally followed suit. But while other nuclear 
powers moved out of the Pacific, the French stayed put. And on this 
question the scientific consensus is the French were mistaken. An atoll is 
no place to store nuclear waste.</B><P>
Mururoa is a seamount- formed more than 7 million years ago when a volcano 
erupted beneath  the sea. When lava hits cold water it forms intertwining tubes 
of rock, which build up a mountain.<P>
The mountain erodes leaving a basalt base and a middle layer of soil. The top 
layer of limestones and corals leaks like a sieve.<P>

<CENTER><b>Prof Michael Michael O'Sullivan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>University of Auckland</font><BR>
<I>"There's a very permeable zone from the level where the arrow at about 400 
hundred meters below sea level up to the surface and that consists of limestones 
which are naturally very permeable and very leaky and the heavy ocean water 
here drives the water through the atoll up into the lagoon."</I></CENTER><P>
Any nuclear waste would get through these middle and top layers very 
quickly. But the shafts for the underground tests are up to 1,000 metres deep in the 
basalt base, supposedly well clear of the leaky layers.<P>
<CENTER><b>Megan James</b><BR>
<I>"What happens when you add a nuclear explosion or two according to the 
French?"</I><P>
<b>Prof Michael Michael O'Sullivan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>University of Auckland</font><BR>
<I>"Well we detonate a bomb//down in these deep basalts and then what the 
French claim is this kind of scenario where we have a chamber here which 
consists of glassified rock which is broken up in little lumps and surrounding that 
they say the rock is not very badly effected. So the natural flow of water is 
virtually unaffected by the bomb going off and radioactivity is safe down in the 
volcanic rock."</I></CENTER><P>
But there's a problem. The French claim the chamber is sealed, yet cools 
quickly. The only way it could cool quickly is if the chamber is really so cracked it 
allows cooling water to get in and out.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Prof Michael Michael O'Sullivan</b>,<BR>
<font size=-1>University of Auckland</font><BR>
<I>"Now we have a large fractured chamber// Then the water can get down into 
the bomb site and up again."</I></CENTER>
<P>
Professor O'Sullivan concludes radioactivity must, in time, leak out. Is it leaking 
now?<P>
<P>
The latest evidence we can now reveal strongly supports France's claim 
underground testing has not poisoned the marine environment.<P>
<P>
These are samples of foodstuffs collected on Mururoa by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. Fish from the lagoon, spiny lobster, molluscs and 
coconut milk.<P>
<P>
The Australian Radiation Laboratory was one of 8 around the world given samples 
of the same organisms collected at the same time. The analysis shows there is 
radioactivity in the samples, but the levels are <B>very low</B>.<P>
<P>
The results are credible because all 8 labs concur. Among them was New 
Zealand's National Radiation Laboratory.<P>

<CENTER><b>Dr Andrew McEwan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>National Radiation Lab, New Zealand</font><BR>
<i>"The levels in those fish did show traces of Caesium 137 and strontium 90 
which one would expect and the levels were fairly consistent with what one 
would expect from global fallout but there is certainly no evidence of significant 
leakage of any type."</I></CENTER><P>
Mururoa may not be leaking now, yet even the French admit the radioactive 
waste stored under their feet will eventually escape. But they say it won't be for 
thousands, perhaps 10,000 years. <P>
<P>
The French claim the basalt that forms the base of Mururoa is not very porous; 
so any water in the blast chambers will take thousands of years to move through 
the rock. But there's good evidence it will happen much more quickly than 
that.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Megan James</b><BR>
"<I>So these are actually samples from Mururoa itself?"</I><P><b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR><Font size=-1> University of Sydney</font><br>
<I>"That's correct."</I></CENTER>
<P><I>
</I>Professor Peter Davies visited Mururoa in the early 80s. He studied just how 
porous the atoll's base is. Some parts are far leakier than others.<P><CENTER><b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR><I>"If you look at this sample for example there are nicks and cracks through the sample indicating that there are fisures which run through the sample and 
that is very important in terms of the conactivity of the pores in other words how 
water will transport through the rock."</I><P>
<b>Megan James</b><br><I>
</I><I>"And from the variety of porosities that you're looking at here how did you 
redo the sums on the how long it would take for leakage to occur from these 
basalt chambers?"</I><P>
<b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR>
<I>"From that I calculated best case scenarios of greater than 500 years for 
leakage fluids from the middle of the atoll."</I><P>
<B>Megan James</B><BR><I> "And a worst case scenario?"</I><P>
<b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR><I>"Well the worst case scenario is related to something happening 
associated with the test and that's almost instantaneous."</I></CENTER><P>
And accidents have happened. In July 1979, a 120 kiloton bomb got stuck 
halfway down the shaft, at 400 metres. They exploded it anyway, and because 
tests were then on the rim of the atoll, part of the southern side collapsed in an 
underwater landslide.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>University of Sydney</FONT><BR>
<I>"The French have admitted to some million cubic meters of rock having come 
away from the side of the atoll. Well a million cubic meters is substantial however 
think of what it means: it's a hundred meters by a hundred meters by a hundred 
meters// that is actually a small portion of the atoll but nevertheless// they've also 
moved their tests back into the lagoon. And I don't think that they have reported 
or anybody has reported land slides since."</I></CENTER><P>
Because the tests are now in the centre of the atoll, and the bombs are now 
smaller, the risk of a major collapes is very low. Long term leakage remains by 
far the most realistic scenario.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>University of Sydney</FONT><BR>
<I>"In 500 years or whatever it is and I don't know what the exact time is but at 
whatever time, there will be the potential for Mururoa to leak radionuclides into 
the biosphere."</I></CENTER><P>
But such leakage may not be as dangerous as we've been lead to believe.<P>
<p>
<H2><B> THE DANGER FROM LEAKAGE</B></H2>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Murray Matthews</b><BR>
<Font size=-1>National Radiation Lab New Zealand</font>.<BR>
<I>"Well a key factor which seems to be overlooked in most people's arguments 
is just what the source term is, how much radioactivity is locked up in Mururoa 
after all of these tests, it seems that in many circles some people think a very 
large amount of radioactivity is there and it should be called into perspective how 
much is there.</I> "</CENTER><P>
<P>
The total fallout from all  atmospheric tests ever conducted is 300 megatons. 
The total of France's underground tests to date is just under 3 megatons. We 
know that from New Zealand's seismic monitoring stations. <P>
<P>
Most of that 3 megatons is locked in the glassy lining of the cavity created by the 
explosion. Only around 5% is loose in the blast chamber.Let's imagine for a 
moment that somehow it all leaked out tomorrow. Incredible as it may seem, the 
sums done by NZ's radiation scientists suggest there'd be no great danger to 
environment or health.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Murray Matthews</b><BR>
<Font size=-1>National Radiation Lab New Zealand</font><BR>
<I>"Well most of our reasoning in this area is based on recommendations of the 
International Commission on radiological protection and that body produces 
recommendations for limits of intake - they call annual limits of intake and if all of 
the material presently in Mururoa were to dissolve in a lagoon that size if it were 
fresh water, one could drink around about 300 litres of that before one would 
reach the annual limit of intake".</I><P>
<b>Megan James</b><br>
<I>"What about in a couple of hundred years, which is the best estimate, what 
would be the danger then?"</I><P>
<b>Dr Andrew McEwan</b><BR>
<font size=-1>National Radiation Lab, New Zealand</font><I> </I><BR>
<I>"Well if one goes to hundreds of years to the future, then the fission 
products of more particular concern like caesium 137, strontium, they have 
halflives of 30yrs, so going 90 years is going through three half lives that the total 
amount is down to 1/8th - go another 90 yrs it is down to a 64th so it is actually 
decaying away and if you go hundreds of years into the future then you probably 
haven't got a lot of radioactivity to worry about."</I></CENTER><P>
None of these scientists is saying that Mururoa is contamination-free. It's 
known that in 1981 a typhoon washed between 10-20 kgms of plutonium, the 
legacy of earlier weapons safety tests, into the lagoon. Plutonium, when it's in 
the air and can be inhaled, is one of the deadlies substances we know. But in a 
marine environment like the lagoon, plutonium gets very strongly bound up in 
sediments, very little gets into the food chain. (as confirmed by the latest IAEA 
study.)<P>
<P>
<CENTER><b>Megan James</b>:<BR><I>
</I><I>A lot of people might interpret this information as scientists saying that the 
testing is ok. That it can go ahead?</I><P>
<b>Dr Murray Matthews</b><BR>
 <Font size=-1>National Radiation Lab New Zealand</font><BR>
<I>"Well there are two distinct sets of issues related to Mururoa as the public see 
it. There are the what I would call political philosophical issues of whether we 
want weapons to be developed, whether we want nuclear proliferation, whether 
we want more people with nuclear weapons on the planet, there are those 
political and philosophical issues and then there are the environmental ones 
which I have been talking about. All I'm saying is that the environmental issues 
are not as great as people will appear to think they are".</I><P>
<b>Prof Peter Davies</b><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>University of Sydney</FONT><BR>
<I>"The French are their own worst enemy. I think they have a huge data 
base which if shared properly with the scientific community would help to dispell 
many many of the problems that people currently relate to what is happening at 
Mururoa because on the basis of easily verifiable experiments it would be 
possible to show that much of the French data is correct. But they label 
everything confidential and therefore it never sees the light of day-  it does them 
no good at all I said this to them in 1984."</I></CENTER><P>
<P>
<H1><B>THE REAL DANGER OF TESTS</B></H1>
<P>
The weight of scientific evidence is that the test pose no great danger to human 
health or the environment of the region. The real danger is that France's and 
China's resumption of testing may derail progress to a world free of nuclear 
weapons.<P>
<P>
<center><b>Dr Karin von Strokirch</b><br>
<font size=-1>Australian National University</font><br>
<I>"Well President Chirac gave the most detailed statement about the purpose 
of the nuclear tests one month after his announcement of test resumption. He 
explained to the French senate in Paris that of the eight tests four would be used 
to perfect computer simulation of nuclear tests two would be used to test the 
reliability and effectiveness of ageing detonators and fuses and the remainder, 
that is to say two, would be used to test what he called a new war 
head."</I><P></center>
<B>That new warhead may be TN75, the TN100 or a new generation 
variable yield warhead: potential first strike weapons.</B><P>
Many of the new generation nuclear warheads are small enough for their 
testing to  be hidden.<P>
<CENTER><B>Dr Peter Wills</B><br>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Greenpeace Spokesperson</FONT><br>
<I>"The thing that really makes me suspicious is that the military the French 
military wanted to to conduct 20 tests they said before France signed the 
comprehensive test ban now that makes me wonder if the eight tests which have 
announced involve something of the order of 20 devices rather than just eight as 
you would have thought."</I><P><b>Dr Karin von Strokirch</b><br>
<font size=-1>Australian National University</font><br>
<I>"Well I believe that in the past the United States has conducted two nuclear 
weapons test explosion simultaneously, there's no reason to believe that France 
can't do that."</I></CENTER><P>
If the French do test 2 devices simultaneously, we won't know. The 
Seimological Centre in Canberra will be the first place in Australia to detect any 
explosion. But from this distance, they can't identify an explosion under 1 kt, if 
masked by a larger one. <P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Dr Peter Wills</B><br>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Greenpeace Spokesperson</FONT><br>
<I>"In the broader picture in the long run the reason to have a comprehensive 
test ban and to stop testing is to inhibit the development of nuclear weapons and 
the great offence which France is causing at the moment is that they say they will 
sign the comprehensive test ban when they have developed the means for 
circumventing it."</I></CENTER><P>
Those means are computers. France needs the field data from the Mururoa 
tests to perfect its computer simulation programs. But even if we stopped the 
French tests, other nuclear nations could continue the electronic version of the 
arms race. Because even under the proposed treaty banning all field tests, 
nuclear weapons are allwed to be developed and refined, via computers.<P>
<P>
We've directed all our protest efforts at trying to stop this series of French tests, 
as though stopping them would somehow stop the arms race. Perhaps our 
protests would be better directed at ensuring next year's treaty is comprehensive 
in its truest sense.<P>
<CENTER><b>Dr Karin von Strokirch</b><br>
<font size=-1>Australian National University</font><br>
<I>"No nuclear tests full stop no simulation full stop don't allow it nothing nothing 
is going to be allowed that will help a nation to develop nuclear weapons. 
"<P>
"The opportunity we have now for achieving a comprehensive test ban is 
greater than it's been at any time since nuclear weapons have been 
invented//</I><P><I>And the danger is if we don't achieve a ban within the coming year the 
political situation could change in any one of the main players' countries. For 
example the United States is having presidential elections Russia is looking 
towards presidential elections the Chinese paramount leader may die in the not 
too distant future and if the political context changes in one of the nuclear 
weapons states it may change the whole of the nature of the negotiations for a 
comprehensive test ban".</I><P>
<b>Megan James</b><br><I>"We would have lost that opportunity?"</I><P>
<B>Dr Karin von Strokirch</B><BR>
<font size=-1>Australian National University</font><br>
<I>"Mmm this is a window of opportunity now and we need to take it 
while its there."<P>

<B>THE RELEASE, DISPERSION AND DEPOSITION OF RADIONUCLIDES</B>
</center>
<P>
<B>The source term</B>
<P>
The &quot;source term&quot; is a technical expression used to
describe the accidental release of radioactive material from a
nuclear facility to the environment. Not only are the levels of
radioactivity released important, but also their distribution
in time as well as their chemical and physical forms. The initial
estimation of the Source Term was based on air sampling and the
integration of the assessed ground deposition within the then
Soviet Union. This was clear at the IAEA Post-Accident Review
Meeting in August 1986 (<I>IA86</I>), when the Soviet scientists
made their presentation, but during the discussions it was suggested
that the total release estimate would be significantly higher
if the deposition outside the Soviet Union territory were included.
Subsequent assessments support this view, certainly for the caesium
radionuclides (<I>Wa87, Ca87, Gu89</I>). The initial estimates
were presented as a fraction of the core inventory for the important
radionuclides and also as total activity released. 
<P>
<I><B>Atmospheric releases </B></I>
<P>
In the initial assessment of releases made by the Soviet scientists
and presented at the IAEA Post-Accident Assessment Meeting in
Vienna (<I>IA86</I>), it was estimated that 100 per cent of the
core inventory of the noble gases (xenon and krypton) was released,
and between 10 and 20 per cent of the more volatile elements of
iodine, tellurium and caesium. The early estimate for fuel material
released to the environment was 3 &#177; 1.5 per cent (<I>IA86</I>).
This estimate was later revised to 3.5 &#177; 0.5 per cent <I>(Be91).
</I>This corresponds to the emission of 6 t of fragmented fuel.
<P>
The IAEA International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG) issued
in 1986 its summary report (<I>IA86a</I>) based on the information
presented by the Soviet scientists to the Post-Accident Review
Meeting. At that time, it was estimated that 1 to 2 exabecquerels
(EBq) were released. This did not include the noble gases, and
had an estimated error of &#177;50 per cent. These estimates of
the source term were based solely on the estimated deposition
of radionuclides on the territory of the Soviet Union, and could
not take into account deposition in Europe and elsewhere, as the
data were not then available.
<P>
However, more deposition data (<I>Be90</I>) were available when,
in their 1988 Report (<I>UN88</I>), the United Nations Scientific
Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) gave release
figures based not only on the Soviet data, but also on worldwide
deposition. The total caesium-137 release was estimated to be
70 petabecquerels (PBq) of which 31 PBq were deposited in the
Soviet Union. 
<P>
Later analyses carried out on the core debris and the deposited
material within the reactor building have provided an independent
assessment of the environmental release. These studies estimate
that the release fraction of caesium-137 was 20 to 40 per cent
(85 &#177; 26 PBq) based on an average release fraction from fuel
of 47 per cent with subsequent retention of the remainder within
the reactor building <I>(Be91)</I>. After an extensive review
of the many reports <I>(IA86</I>, <I>Bu93)</I>, this was confirmed.
For iodine-131, the most accurate estimate was felt to be 50 to
60 per cent of the core inventory of 3,200 PBq. The current estimate
of the source term (<I>De95</I>) is summarised in Table 1. 
<P>
The release pattern over time is well illustrated in Figure 3
(<I>Bu93</I>). The initial large release was principally due to
the mechanical fragmentation of the fuel during the explosion.
It contained mainly the more volatile radionuclides such as noble
gases, iodines and some caesium. The second large release between
day 7 and day 10 was associated with the high temperatures reached
in the core melt. The sharp drop in releases after ten days may
have been due to a rapid cooling of the fuel as the core debris
melted through the lower shield and interacted with other material
in the reactor. Although further releases probably occurred after
6 May, these are not thought to have been large.

<P>
The release of radioactive material to the atmosphere consisted
of gases, aerosols and finely fragmented fuel. Gaseous elements,
such as krypton and xenon escaped more or less completely from
the fuel material. In addition to its gaseous and particulate
form, organically bound iodine was also detected. The ratios between
the various iodine compounds varied with time. As mentioned<BR>

above, 50 to 60 per cent of the core inventory of iodine was thought
to have been released in one form or another. Other volatile elements
and compounds, such as those of caesium and tellurium, attached
to aerosols, were transported in the air separate from fuel particles.
Air sampling revealed particle sizes for these elements to be
0.5 to 1 mm.
<P>
Unexpected features of the source term, due largely to the graphite
fire, were the extensive releases of fuel material and the long
duration of the release. Elements of low volatility, such as cerium,
zirconium, the actinides and to a large extent barium, lanthanium
and strontium also, were embedded in fuel 
particles. Larger fuel particles were deposited close to the accident
site, whereas smaller particles were more widely dispersed. Other
condensates from the vaporised fuel, such as radioactive ruthenium,
formed metallic particles. These, as well as the small fuel particles,
were often referred to as &quot;hot particles&quot;, and were
found at large distances from the accident site (<I>De95</I>).
<P>
<B>Dispersion and deposition</B>
<P>
<I><B>Within the former Soviet Union</B></I>
<P>
During the first 10 days of the accident when important releases
of radioactivity occurred, meteorological conditions changed frequently,
causing significant variations in release direction and dispersion
parameters. Deposition patterns of radioactive particles depended
highly on the dispersion parameters, the particle sizes, and the
occurrence of rainfall. The largest particles, which were primarily
fuel particles, were deposited essentially by sedimentation within
100 km of the reactor. Small particles were carried by the wind
to large distances and were deposited primarily with rainfall.
<P>
The radionuclide composition of the release and of the subsequent
deposition on the ground also varied considerably during the accident
due to variations in temperature and other parameters during the
release. Caesium-137 was selected to characterise the magnitude
of the ground deposition because (1) it is easily measurable,
and (2) it was the main contributor to the radiation doses received
by the population once the short-lived iodine-131 had decayed.
<P>
The three main spots of contamination resulting from the Chernobyl
accident have been called the Central, Bryansk-Belarus, and Kaluga-Tula-Orel
spots (Figure 4). The Central spot was formed during the initial,
active stage of the release <BR>
predominantly to the West and North-west (Figure 5). Ground depositions
of caesium-137 of over 40 kilobecquerels per square metre [kBq/m2]
covered large areas of the Northern part of Ukraine and of the
Southern part of Belarus. The most highly contaminated area was
the 30-km zone surrounding the reactor, where caesium-137 ground
depositions generally exceeded 1,500 kBq/m2 (<I>Ba93</I>).
<P>
The Bryansk-Belarus spot, centered 200 km to the North-northeast
of the reactor, was formed on 28-29 April as a result of rainfall
on the interface of the Bryansk region of Russia and the Gomel
and Mogilev regions of Belarus. The ground depositions of caesium-137
in the most highly contaminated areas in this spot were comparable
to the levels in the Central spot and reached 5,000 kBq/m2 in
some villages (<I>Ba93</I>).

<center><B><a href="chern5.gif">Figure 5. Central spot of caesium-137 contamination</a></B><br>
</center><P><br><p><br>

The Kaluga-Tula-Orel spot in Russia, centered approximately 500
km North-east of the reactor, was formed from the same radioactive
cloud that produced the Bryansk-Belarus spot, as a result of rainfall
on 28-29 April. However, the levels of deposition of caesium-137
were lower, usually less than 600 kBq/m2 (<I>Ba93</I>).
<P>
In addition, outside the three main hot spots in the greater part
of the European territory of the former Soviet Union, there were
many areas of radioactive contamination with caesium-137 levels
in the range 40 to 200 kBq/m2. Overall, the territory of the former
Soviet Union initially contained approximately 3,100 km2 contaminated
by caesium-137 with deposition levels exceeding 1,500 kBq/m2;
7,200 km2 with levels of 600 to 1,500 kBq/m2; and 103,000 km2
with levels of 40 to 200 kBq/m2 (<I>US91</I>).
<P>
<I><B>Outside the former Soviet Union</B></I>
<P>
Radioactivity was first detected outside the Soviet Union at a
Nuclear Power station in Sweden, where monitored workers were
noted to be contaminated. It was at first believed that the contamination
was from a Swedish reactor. When it became apparent that the Chernobyl
reactor was the source, monitoring stations all over the world
began intensive sampling programmes.
<P>
The radioactive plume was tracked as it moved over the European
part of the Soviet Union and Europe (Figure 6). Initially the
wind was blowing in a Northwesterly direction and was responsible
for much of the deposition in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and
Belgium and Great Britain. Later the plume shifted <BR>
to the South and much of Central Europe, as well as the Northern
Mediterranean and the Balkans, received some deposition, the actual
severity of which depended on the height of the plume, wind speed
and direction, terrain features and the amount of rainfall that
occurred during the passage of the plume.
<P>
The radioactive cloud initially contained a large number of different
fission products and actinides, but only trace quantities of actinides
were detected in most European countries, and a very small number
were found in quantities that were considered radiologically significant.
This was largely due to the fact that these radionuclides were
contained in the larger and heavier particulates, which tended
to be deposited closer to the accident site rather than further
away. The most radiologically important radionuclides detected
outside the Soviet Union were iodine-131, tellurium/iodine-132,
caesium-137 and caesium-134.

cloud on various days during the release</B><p><br></a>

<p><br><p><br>

Most countries in Europe experienced some deposition of radionuclides,
mainly caesium-137 and caesium-134, as the plume passed over the
country. In 
Austria, Eastern and Southern Switzerland, parts of Southern Germany
and Scandinavia, where the passage of the plume coincided with
rainfall, the total deposition from the Chernobyl release was
greater than that experienced by most other countries, whereas
Spain, France and Portugal experienced the least deposition. For
example, the estimated average depositions of caesium-137 in the
provinces of Upper Austria, Salzburg and Carinthia in Austria
were 59, 46 and 33 kBq/m2 respectively, whereas the average caesium-137
deposition in Portugal was 0.02 kBq/m2 (<I>Un88</I>). It was reported
that considerable secondary contamination occurred due to resuspension
of material from contaminated forest. This was not confirmed by
later studies. 
<P>
While the plume was detectable in the Northern hemisphere as far
away as Japan and North America, countries outside Europe received
very little deposition of radionuclides from the accident. No
deposition was detected in the Southern hemisphere (<I>Un88</I>).
<P>
<B>In summary it can be stated that there is now a fairly accurate
estimate of the total release. The duration of the release was
unexpectedly long, lasting more than a week with two periods of
intense release. Another peculiar feature was the significant
emission (about 4 per cent) of fuel material which also contained
embedded radionuclides of low volatility such as cerium, zirconium
and the actinides. The composition and characteristics of the
radioactive material in the plume changed during its passage due
to wet and dry deposition, decay, chemical transformations and
alterations in particle size. The area affected was particularly
large due to the high altitude and long duration of the release
as well as the change of wind direction. However, the pattern
of deposition was very irregular, and significant deposition of
radionuclides occurred where the passage of the plume coincided
with rainfall. Although all the Northern hemisphere was affected,
only territories of the former Soviet Union and part of Europe
experienced contamination to a significant degree. </B>

<B>DOSE ESTIMATES</B>
</center>
<P>
The exposure of the population as a result of the accident resulted
in two main pathways of exposure. The first is the radiation dose
to the thyroid as a result of the concentration of radioiodine
and similar radionuclides in the gland. The second is the whole-body
dose caused largely by external irradiation mainly from radiocesium.
<P>
The absorbed dose to the whole body is thought to be about 20
times more deleterious, in terms of late health effects incidence,
than the same dose to the thyroid (<I>IC90</I>).
<P>
The population exposed to radiation following the Chernobyl accident
can be divided into four categories: (1) the staff of the nuclear
power plant and workers who participated in clean-up operations
(referred to as &quot;liquidators&quot;); (2) the nearby residents
who were evacuated from the 30-km zone during the first two weeks
after the accident; (3) the population of the former Soviet Union,
including especially the residents of contaminated areas; and
(4) the population in countries outside the former Soviet Union.
<P>
A number of liquidators estimated to amount up to 800,000 took
part in mitigation activities at the reactor and within the 30-km
zone surrounding the reactor. The most exposed workers were the
firemen and the power plant personnel during the first days of
the accident. Most of the dose received by the workers resulted
from external irradiation from the fuel fragments and radioactive
particles deposited on various surfaces.
<P>
About 135,000 people were evacuated during the first days following
the accident, mainly from the 30-km zone surrounding the reactor.
Prior to evacuation, those individuals were exposed to external
irradiation from radioactive materials transported by the cloud
and deposited on the ground, as well as to internal irradiation
essentially due to the inhalation of radioactive materials in
the cloud.
<P>
The relative contributions to the external whole-body dose from
the main radionuclides of concern for that pathway of exposure
and during the first few months after the accident are shown in
Figure 7. It is clear that tellurium-132 played a major role in
the first week after the accident, and that, after one month,
the radiocaesiums (caesium-134 and caesium-137) became predominant.
Subsequently, however, caesium-134 decayed to levels much lower
than those of caesium-137, which became after a few years the
only radionuclide of importance for practical purposes. It is
usual to refer to caesium-137 only, even when the mix of caesium-134
and caesium-137 is meant, because the values for the constituents
can be easily derived from those for caesium-137.

</center>
<p><br><p><br>

With regard to internal doses from inhalation and ingestion of
radionuclides, the situation is similar: radioiodine was important
during the first few weeks after the accident and gave rise to
thyroid doses via inhalation of contaminated air, and, more importantly,
via consumption of contaminated foodstuffs, mainly cow's milk.
After about one month, the radiocaesiums (caesium-134 and caesium-137)
again became predominant, and, after a few years, caesium-137
became the only radionuclide of importance for practical purposes,
even though strontium-90 may in the future play a significant
role at short distances from the reactor.
<P>
Among the population of the former Soviet Union, it is usual to
single out the residents of the contaminated areas, defined as
those with caesium-137 deposition levels greater than 37 kBq/m2.
About 4 million people live in those areas. Of special interest
are the inhabitants of the spots with caesium-137 deposition levels
greater than 555 kBq/m2. In those areas, called &quot;strict control
zones&quot;, protection measures are applied, especially as far
as control of consumption of contaminated food is concerned. 
<P>
Early after the accident, the All-Union Dose Registry (AUDR) was
set up by the Soviet Government in 1986 to record medical and
dosimetric data on the <BR>
population groups expected to be the most exposed: (1) the liquidators,
(2) the evacuees from the 30-km zone, (3) the inhabitants of the
contaminated areas, and (4) the children of those people. In 1991,
the AUDR contained data on 659,292 persons. Starting from 1992,
national registries of Belarus, Russian Federation, and Ukraine
replaced the AUDR.
<P>
 Outside the former Soviet Union, the radionuclides of importance
are, again, the radioiodines and radiocaesiums, which, once deposited
on the ground,<BR>
give rise to doses from ingestion through the consumption of foodstuffs.
Deposited radiocaesium is also a source of long-term exposure
from external irradiation from the contaminated ground and other
surfaces. Most of the population of the Northern hemisphere was
exposed, in varying degrees, to radiation from the Chernobyl accident.
The caesium-137 deposition outside the former Soviet Union ranged
from negligible levels to about 50 kBq/m2.
<P>
<B>The liquidators</B>
<P>
Most of the liquidators can be divided into two groups: (1) the
people who were working at the Chernobyl power station at the
time of the accident viz. the staff of the station and the firemen
and people who went to the aid of the victims. They number a few
hundred persons; and (2) the workers, estimated to amount up to
800,000, who were active in 1986-1990 at the power station or
in the zone surrounding it for the decontamination, sarcophagus
construction and other recovery operations.
<P>
On the night of 26 April 1986, about 400 workers were on the site
of the Chernobyl power plant. As a consequence of the accident,
they were subjected to the combined effect of radiation from several
sources: (1) external gamma/beta radiation from the radioactive
cloud, the fragments of the damaged reactor core scattered over
the site and the radioactive particles deposited on the skin,
and (2) inhalation of radioactive particles (<I>UN88</I>).
<P>
All of the dosimeters worn by the workers were over-exposed and
did not allow an estimate of the doses received. However, information
is available on the doses received by the 237 persons who were
placed in hospitals and diagnosed as suffering from acute radiation
syndrome. Using biological dosimetry, it was estimated that 140
of these patients received whole-body doses from external irradiation
in the range 1-2 Gy, that 55 received doses between 2 and 4 Gy
, that 21 received between 4 and 6 Gy, and that the remaining
21 received doses between 6 and 16 Gy. In addition, it was estimated
from thyroid measurements that the thyroid dose from inhalation
would range up to about 20 Sv, with 173 individuals in the 0-1.2
Sv range and five workers with thyroid doses greater than 11 Sv
(<I>UN88</I>).
<P>
The second category of liquidators consists of the large number
of adults who were recruited to assist in the clean-up operations.
They worked at the site, in towns, forests and agricultural areas
to make them fit to work and live in. Several hundreds of thousands
of individuals participated in this work. Initially, 50 per cent
of those workers came from the Soviet armed forces, the other
half including personnel of civil organisations, the security
service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and other organisations.
The total number of liquidators has yet to be determined accurately,
since only some of the data from some of those organisations have
been collected so far in the national registries of Belarus, Russia,
Ukraine and other republics of the former Soviet Union (<I>So95</I>).
Also, it has been suggested that, because of the social and economic
advantages associated with being designated a liquidator, many
persons have contrived latterly to have their names added to the
list.
<P>
There are only fragmented data on the doses received by the liquidators.
Attempts to establish a dosimetric service were inadequate until
the middle of June of 1986; until then, doses were estimated from
area radiation measurements. The liquidators were initially subjected
to a radiation dose limit for one year of 250 mSv. In 1987 this
limit was reduced to 100 mSv and in 1988 to 50 mSv <I>(Ba93)</I>.
The registry data show that the average recorded doses decreased
from year to year, being about 170 mSv in 1986, 130 mSv in 1987,
30 mSv in 1988 and 15 mSv in 1989 (<I>Se95a</I>). It is, however,
difficult to assess the validity of the results as they have been
reported. 
<P>
It is interesting to note that a small special group of 15 scientists
who have worked periodically inside the sarcophagus for a number
of years have estimated accumulated whole-body doses in the range
0.5 to 13 Gy (<I>Se95a</I>). While no deterministic effects have
been noted to date, this group may well show radiation health
effects in the future.
<P>
<B>The evacuees from the 30-km zone</B>
<P>
Immediately after the accident monitoring of the environment was
started by gamma dose rate measurements. About 20 hours after
the accident the wind turned in the direction of Pripyat, gamma
dose rates increased significantly in the town, and it was decided
to evacuate the inhabitants. About 20 hours later the 49,000 inhabitants
of Pripyat had left the town in nearly 1,200 buses. About a further
80,000 people were evacuated in the following days and weeks from
the contaminated areas.
<P>
Information relevant for the assessment of the doses received
by these people have been obtained by responses of the evacuees
to questionnaires about the location where they stayed, the types
of houses in which they lived, the consumption of stable iodine,
and other activities (<I>Li94</I>).
<P>
<I><B>Doses to the thyroid gland</B></I>
<P>
The iodine activity in thyroid glands of evacuees was measured.
More than 2,000 measurements of former inhabitants of Pripyat
had sufficient quality to be useful for dose reconstruction (<I>Go95a</I>).
A comparative analysis with the questionnaire responses showed
that thyroid doses were mainly due to inhalation of iodine-131.
Average individual doses and collective doses to the thyroid are
shown in Table 3 for three age groups. Individual doses in the
age classes were distributed over two orders of magnitude. The
main factor influencing the individual doses was found to be the
distance of the residence from the reactor.

Assessments of the doses to the thyroid gland of the evacuees
from the <BR>
30-km zone (<I>Li93a</I>) showed similar doses for young children
as those for the Pripyat evacuees. Exposures to adults were higher.
These high doses were due to a greater consumption of food contaminated
with iodine-131 among those evacuated later from the 30-km zone.
<P>
<I><B>Whole-body doses</B></I>
<P>
The whole-body doses to the evacuees were mainly due to external
exposure from deposited tellurium-132/iodine-132, caesium-134
and caesium137 and short lived radionuclides in the air. Measurements
of the gamma dose rate in air were performed every hour at about
thirty sites in Pripyat and daily at about eighty sites in the
30-km zone. Based on these measurements and using the responses
to the questionnaires, whole-body doses were reconstructed for
the 90,000 persons evacuated from the Ukrainian part of the 30-km
zone (<I>Li94</I>). There was a wide range of estimated doses
with an average value of 15 mSv. The collective dose was assessed
to be 1,300 person-Sv. The 24,000 persons evacuated in Belarus
might have received slightly higher doses, since the prevailing
wind was initially towards the north.
<P>
<B>People living in the contaminated areas</B>
<P>
<I><B>Doses to the thyroid gland</B></I>
<P>
The main information source for the dose reconstruction is the
vast amount of iodine activity measurements in thyroid glands.
In Ukraine 150,000 measurements, in Belarus several hundreds of
thousands of measurements and in the Russian Federation more than
60,000 measurements were performed in May/June 1986. Some of the
measurements were performed with inadequate instrumentation and
measurement conditions and are not useful for dose assessment
purposes. 
<P>
The large variability of individual doses makes estimates of dose
distributions difficult and current dose estimates are still subject
to considerable uncertainties, especially in areas where only
a few activity measurements in the thyroid were performed. Children
in the Gomel oblast (region) in Belarus received the highest doses.
An estimate (<I>Ba94</I>) of the dose distribution among these
children is shown in Table 4. For the whole Belarus the collective
thyroid dose to children (0 to 14 years) at the time of the accident
was assessed to be about 170,000 person-Sv <I>(Ri94)</I>. In the
eight most contaminated districts of Ukraine where thyroid measurements
were performed, the collective dose to this age group was about
60,000 person-Sv and for the whole population about 200,000 person-Sv
(<I>Li93</I>). In the Russian Federation the collective dose to
the whole population was about 100,000 person-Sv (<I>Zv93</I>).

Evaluations of questionnaires on food consumption rates in the
period May/June 1986 and measurements of food contamination showed
iodine-131 in milk as the major source for the thyroid exposure
of the population living in the contaminated areas. However, in
individual cases the consumption of fresh vegetables contributed
significantly to the exposure.
<P>
<I><B>Whole-body doses</B></I>
<P>
Two major pathways contributed to the whole-body doses of the
population in contaminated areas, the exposure to external irradiation
from deposited radionuclides (<I>Iv95</I>) and the incorporation
into the body of radio-caesium in food.
<P>
The external exposure is directly related to the radionuclide
activity per unit area and it is influenced by the gamma dose
rates in air at the locations of occupancy. Forestry workers and
other workers living in woodframe houses received the highest
doses.
<P>
Most of the higher contaminated areas are rural and a large part
of the diet is locally produced. Therefore, the uptake of caesium
by the plants from the soil is a deciding factor in the internal
exposure. These are regions with extraordinarily high transfer
factors, as the Rovno region in Ukraine, where even moderate soil
contaminations led to high doses. In order of decreasing magnitude
of transfer factors these regions are followed by regions with
peaty soil, sandy podzol (acidic infertile forest soil), loamy
podzol, and chernozem which is rich black soil.
<P>
In the first years after the accident the caesium uptake was dominated
practically everywhere by the consumption of locally produced
milk (<I>Ho94</I>). However, later mushrooms began to contribute
significantly in many settlements to the caesium incorporation
for two reasons. First, the milk contamination decreased with
time, whereas the mushroom contamination remained relatively constant.
Second, due to changes in the economic conditions in the three
republics, people are again collecting more mushrooms than they
were in the first years after the accident .
<P>
Table 5 summarises a recent estimate of whole-body doses to people
living in the higher contaminated areas. On average, external
irradiation was by far the highest contributor to the total population
exposure (<I>Er94</I>). However, the highest doses to individuals
were produced by the consumption of food from areas with high
transfers of radionuclides.

<B>Populations outside the former Soviet Union</B>
<P>
Even though the releases of radioactive materials during the Chernobyl
accident mainly affected the populations of Belarus, Russia and
Ukraine, the released materials became further dispersed throughout
the atmosphere and the volatile radionuclides of primary importance
(iodine-131 and caesium-137) were
detected in most countries of the Northern hemisphere. However,
the doses to the population were in most places much lower than
in the contaminated areas of the former Soviet Union; they reflected
the deposition levels of caesium-137 and were higher in areas
where the passage of the radioactive cloud coincided with rainfall.
Generally speaking, however, and with a few notable exceptions,
the doses decreased as a function of distance from the reactor
(<I>Ne87</I>).
<P>
During the first few weeks, iodine-131 was the main contributor
to the dose, via ingestion of milk <I>(Ma91)</I>. Infant thyroid
doses generally ranged from 1 to 20 mSv in Europe, from 0.1 to
5 mSv in Asia, and were about 0.1 mSv in North America. Adult
thyroid doses were lower by a factor of about 5 (<I>UN88</I>).

<P>
Later on, caesium-134 and caesium-137 were responsible for most
of the dose, through external and internal irradiation (<I>Ma89</I>).
The whole-body doses received during the first year following
the accident generally ranged from 0.05 to 0.5 mSv in Europe,
from 0.005 to 0.1 mSv in Asia, and of the order of 0.001 mSv in
North America. The total whole-body doses expected to be accumulated
during the lifetimes of the individuals are estimated to be a
factor of 3 greater than the doses received during the first year
(<I>UN88</I>).
<P>
<B>In summary, a large number of people received substantial doses
as a result of the Chernobyl accident:</B>
<UL>
<p><LI><I><B>Liquidators</B></I><B> - Hundreds of thousands of workers,
estimated to amount up to 800,000, were involved in clean-up operations.
The most exposed, with doses of several grays, were the workers
involved immediately after the beginning of the accident and the
scientists who have performed special tasks in the sarcophagus.
The average doses to liquidators are reported to have ranged between
170 mSv in 1986 and 15 mSv in 1989.</B>
<p><LI><I><B>Evacuees</B></I><B> - More than 100,000 persons were
evacuated during the first few weeks following the accident. The
evacuees were exposed to internal irradiation arising from inhalation
of radioiodines, especially iodine-131, and to external irradiation
from radioactivity present in the cloud and deposited on the ground.
Thyroid doses are estimated to have been, on average, about 1
Sv for small children under 3 years of age and about 70 mSv for
adults. Whole-body doses received from external irradiation prior
to evacuation from the Ukrainian part of the 30-km zone showed
a large range of variation with an average value of 15 mSv.</B>
<p><LI><I><B>People living in contaminated areas of the former Soviet
Union </B></I><B>- About 270,000 people live in contaminated areas
with caesium-137 deposition levels in excess of 555 kBq/m2. Thyroid
doses, due mainly to the consumption of cow's milk contaminated
with iodine-131, were delivered during the first few weeks after
the accident; children in the Gomel region of Belarus appear to
have received the highest thyroid doses with a range from negligible
levels up to 40 Sv and an average close to 1 Sv for children aged
0 to 7. Because of the control of foodstuffs in those areas, most
of the radiation exposure since the summer of 1986 is due to external
irradiation from the caesium-137 activity deposited on the ground;
the whole-body doses for the    1986-1989 time period are estimated
to range from 5 to 250 mSv with an average of 40 mSv. In areas
without food control, there are places, such as the Rovno region
of Ukraine, where the transfer of caesium137 from soil to plant
is very high, resulting in doses from internal exposure being
greater than those from external exposure.</B>
<p><LI><I><B>Populations outside the former Soviet Union -</B></I><B>
The radioactive materials of a volatile nature (such as iodine
and caesium) that were released during the accident spread throughout
the entire northern hemisphere. The doses received by populations
outside the former Soviet Union were relatively low, and showed
large differences from one country to another depending mainly
upon whether rainfall occurred during the passage of the radioactive
cloud.</B>

<B>HEALTH IMPACT</B>
</center>
<P>
As ionising radiation passes through the body, it interacts with
the tissues transfering energy to cellular and other constituents
by ionisation of their atoms. This phenomenon has been extensively
studied in the critical genetic material, DNA, which controls
the functions of the cells. If the damage to DNA is slight and
the rate of damage production is not rapid, i.e. at low dose rate,
the cell may be able to repair most of the damage. If the damage
is irreparable and severe enough to interfere with cellular function,
the cell may die either immediately or after several divisions.
<P>
At low doses, cell death can be accommodated by the normal mechanisms
that regulate cellular regeneration. However, at high doses and
dose rates, repair and regeneration may be inadequate, so that
a large number of cells may be destroyed leading to impaired organ
function. This rapid, uncompensatable cell death at high doses
leads to early deleterious radiation effects which become evident
within days or weeks of exposure, and are known as &quot;deterministic
effects&quot;. These deterministic effects can be life-threatening
in the short term if the dose is high enough, and were responsible
for most of the early deaths in the Chernobyl accident.
<P>
Lower doses and dose rates do not produce these acute early effects,
because the available cellular repair mechanisms are able to compensate
for the damage. However, this repair may be incomplete or defective,
in which case the cell may be altered so that it may develop into
a cancerous cell, perhaps many years into the future, or its transformation
may lead to hereditable defects in the long term. These late effects,
cancer induction and hereditary defects, are known as &quot;stochastic
effects&quot; and are those effects whose frequency, not severity,
is dose dependent. Moreover, they are not radiation-specific and,
therefore, cannot be directly attributed to a given radiation
exposure.
<P>
For this reason, low dose health effects in humans cannot be measured
and, therefore, risk projections of the future health impact of
low-dose ionising radiation exposure have to be extrapolated from
measured high-dose effects. The assumption was made that no dose
of ionising radiation was without potential harm and that the
frequency of stochastic effects at low doses would be proportional
to that occurring at high doses. This prudent assumption was adopted
to assist in the planning of radiation protection provisions when
considering the introduction of practices involving ionising radiations.
The ICRP has estimated the risk of fatal cancer to the general
population from whole-body exposure to be 5 per cent per sievert
(<I>IC90</I>). 
<P>
The health impact of the Chernobyl accident can be classified
in terms of acute health effects (&quot;deterministic effects&quot;)
and of late health effects (&quot;stochastic effects&quot;); moreover
there are also psychological effects which can influence health.

<P>
<B>Acute health effects </B>
<P>
All the acute deterministic health effects occurred among the
personnel of the plant, or in those persons brought in for fire
fighting and immediate clean-up operations.
<P>
Two deaths were immediately associated with the accident: one
person killed by the explosion and another who suffered a coronary
thrombosis. A third person died early the morning of the accident
from thermal burns. Twenty-eight other persons died later in the
treatment centres, bringing the total to 31 deaths in the first
weeks after the accident (<I>UN88</I>).
<P>
All symptomatic exposed persons from the site were placed in hospitals.
Of the total of 499 persons admitted for observation, 237 of these
were initially diagnosed as suffering from acute radiation syndrome
and most of these were hospitalised in the first 24 hours. The
severity and rapidity of onset of their symptoms depended on their
dose. The initial early signs and symptoms of radiation sickness
from high doses included diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and erythema.
Over 200 patients were placed in regional hospitals and specialised
centres in the first 24 hours. Patients were allocated to four
categories of radiation sickness severity according to their symptoms,
signs and dose estimates. The differential white blood cell count
showed reduced circulating lymphocytes (lymphocytopenia) which
was the initial indicator of the severity of the exposure and
became evident in the first 24-36 hours for those most severely
irradiated. 
<P>
No members of the general public received such high whole-body
doses as to induce Acute Radiation Syndrome (<I>IA86</I>). This
was confirmed in Belarus, where, between May and June 1986, 11,600
people were investigated without the discovery of any cases of
acute radiation sickness.
<P>
In the highest exposure group (6-16 Gy), the first reaction was
usually vomiting, occurring within 15-30 minutes of exposure.
These patients were desperately ill; fever and intoxication as
well as diarrhoea and vomiting, were prominent features. Mucous
membranes were severely affected, becoming swollen, dry and ulcerated,
making breathing and swallowing extremely painful and difficult.
Extensive burns both thermal and due to beta radiation often complicated
the illness. Within the first two weeks white blood cells and
platelets fell dramatically, indicating a very high dose which
had compromised the production of blood cells in the bone marrow,
making it virtually impossible for the patients to fight infection
or to retain the natural clotting activity of the blood. Almost
all the patients with such high doses died (20 of 21), in spite
of the intensive specialised medical treatment provided.
<P>
At lower exposures, the symptoms, signs and laboratory findings
improved. Vomiting began later, platelet and white cell counts
did not drop so precipitously and the fever and toxaemia were
less pronounced. Beta radiation burns to the skin were a major
complicating factor and mucous membrane damage was difficult to
treat, but survival improved markedly at lower doses, so that
no early deaths were noted in the less than 1-2 Gy exposure group
(Table 6).

There is a large range of medical treatments that can be attempted
to mitigate the acute radiation syndrome. All these procedures
were applied to the persons hospitalised with varying degrees
of success. The hospital treatment following the accident included
replacement therapy with blood constituents, fluids and electrolytes;
antibiotics; antifungal agents; barrier nursing and bone marrow
transplantation.
<P>
The treatment of the depression of bone-marrow function encountered
after the accident was largely supportive. Special hygienic measures
were taken; patients' clothes were changed at least twice a day
and aseptic techniques used. Those patients who received doses
above 2 Gy were given anti-fungal agents after the second week.
Antibiotics and gamma globulin were also administered.  
<P>
Bone-marrow transplantation was undertaken in 13 patients who
were judged to have irreversible bone marrow damage after doses
greater than 4 Gy. All but two of these patients died, some before
the transfused marrow had had a chance to &quot;take&quot;, but
others had short-term takes. It was concluded that, even after
very high radiation doses, the bone marrow may well not be completely
destroyed and may recover at least some function at a later stage.
It is this recovery which may lead to later rejection of the transplanted
marrow through a &quot;Host versus Graft&quot; reaction. The physicians
responsible for treating the victims of the accident concluded
that bone marrow transplantation should play a very limited role
in treatment.
<P>
Burns, both thermal and from beta radiation, were treated with
surgical excision of tissue that was not viable, and any fluid
and electrolyte loss was compensated for by the parenteral feeding
set up to treat the gastro-intestinal syndrome which is a prominent
feature of acute radiation sickness. The oro-pharyngeal syndrome
of mucosal destruction, oedema and the absence of lubrication
caused by radiation damage to the mucosa of the mouth and pharynx
was extremely difficult to treat, and severely impaired swallowing
and breathing.
<P>
The organisational aspects of treating large numbers of very ill
patients also presented significant problems. Intensive nursing
care and monitoring had to be provided 24 hours a day in small
units. Personnel had to be taught new techniques of care and patient
handling, and a large number of diagnostic samples had to be examined.
The logistic requirements of medical handling needed to be well-established
before any therapeutic programme could be run efficiently.
<P>
<B>Late health effects</B>
<P>
There have been many reports of an increase in the incidence of
some diseases as a result of the Chernobyl accident. In fact,
the accident has, according to present knowledge, given rise to
an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancers. Also, it has
had negative psychological consequences. As far as other diseases
are concerned, the scientific community has not been able to relate
those to the effects of ionising radiation. However, large research
projects have been conducted and are under way to further study
the matter. For example, the WHO (<I>WH95</I>) established the
International Programme on the Health Effects of the Chernobyl
Accident (IPHECA). This programme initially concentrated on pilot
projects involving leukaemia, thyroid diseases, oral health in
Belarus, mental health in children irradiated before birth and
the development of epidemiological registries. The pilot phase
came to an end in 1994 and, as a result of the findings, efforts
are underway to develop long-term permanent programmes involving
thyroid diseases, the accident recovery workers, dose reconstruction
and guidance to the public in the event of an accident. It is
expected that these new projects will provide further insight
into any future health effects. 
<P>
An estimate (<I>An88</I>) of the total lifetime cancers which
could be expected in Europe as a result of the accident suggested
an increase of about 0.01 per cent above their natural incidence.
Another assessment placed the increase in cancer incidence at
0.004 per cent in the Northern hemisphere, a lower percentage
increase due probably to including the large population of the
whole hemisphere (<I>Pa89</I>). These predictions are remarkably
similar and support the view that the average doses to the general
population of the Northern hemisphere were so low that only fractions
of a percent increases in cancer incidence could be expected in
this population (<I>Pe88</I>, <I>Re87</I>). Large parts of the
Northern hemisphere, such as North America (<I>Hu88</I>, <I>Br88</I>),
Asia and Siberia, were not significantly contaminated and doses
were inconsequential. Therefore, the following sections focus
on the late health effects in the population of the contaminated
regions of the former Soviet Union. 
<P>
 In the International Chernobyl Project organised by the IAEA
(<I>IA91</I>), field studies were undertaken in the latter half
of 1990 on the permanent residents of the rural settlements with
a surface caesium contamination of greater than 555 kBq/m2, and
on control settlements of 2,000 to 50,000 persons, using an age
matched study design. Seven contaminated and six control settlements
were chosen by the medical team of the Chernobyl Project. Since
all persons could not be examined, representative samples were
taken from various age groups. In all, 1,356 people were examined,
and the aim was to examine about 250 from each of the larger settlements.
Three medical teams each spent two weeks conducting medical examinations
to provide the data for these assessments.
<P>
The medical examinations were quite comprehensive, and the general
conclusions reached were that there were no health abnormalities
which could be attributed to radiation exposure, but that there
were significant non-radiation related health disorders which
were similar in both contaminated and control settlements. The
accident had had substantial negative psychological consequences
which were compounded by the socio-economic and political changes
occurring in the former Soviet Union. The official data provided
to the medical teams was incomplete and difficult to evaluate,
and were not detailed enough to exclude or confirm the possibility
of an increase in the incidence of some tumour types. On this
subject, it was suggested in 1991 that the incidence of cancer
in Ukraine showed no large increase even in the most contaminated
areas (<I>Pr91</I>).  
<P>
The International Chernobyl Project Report (<I>IA91</I>) suggested
that the reported high thyroid doses in some children were such
that there could be a statistically detectable increase in the
incidence of future thyroid tumours. The Chernobyl Project team
finally concluded that, on the basis of the doses estimated by
the team and the currently accepted radiation risk estimates,
future increases over the natural incidence of cancer or hereditary
defects would be difficult if not impossible to discern, even
with very large and well-designed long-term epidemiological studies.
However, it should be remembered that this health survey took
place four years after the accident, before any increase in cancer
incidence might be expected and reflects the status of the people
examined in a few months of 1990. The sample size was also criticised
as being too small.  
<P>
Nevertheless, the dose estimates generally accepted indicate that,
with the exception of thyroid disease, it is unlikely that the
exposure would lead to discernible radiation effects in the general
population. Many predictions of the future impact of the accident
on the health of populations have been made, all of which, apart
from thyroid disease, indicate that the overall effect will be
small when compared with the natural incidence and therefore not
expected to be discernible (<I>An88</I>, <I>Be87, Hu87, Mo87,
De87, Be87</I>).
<P>
<I><B>Thyroid cancer</B></I>
<P>
 Early in the development of the Chernobyl accident, it became
obvious that the radioiodines were contributing significant thyroid
doses (<I>Il90</I>), especially to children, and the then Soviet
authorities made every effort not only to minimise doses, but
also to record the thyroid doses as accurately as possible. The
results of these measurements and dose reconstruction assessments
indicated that some groups in the population received high doses
to their thyroids, and that an increase in thyroid abnormalities,
including cancer, was a very real possibility in the future. This
was particularly true for children in the contaminated regions
in Belarus, northern Ukraine and the Bryansk and Kaluga regions
of the Russian Federation. These were not inconsequential thyroid
doses and, as early as 1986, it was predicted by experts from
the Soviet Union that the thyroid would be the target organ most
likely to show evidence of radiation effects, especially an increased
incidence of benign and malignant tumours. 
<P>
It was known from previous studies of largely external irradiation
of the thyroid that an increase in thyroid tumours tended to appear
six to eight years following irradiation, and continue for more
than twenty years after exposure, particularly in children. What
was not expected was that thyroid abnormalities would already
become detectable about four years after the accident. At the
same time, the current conventional wisdom was that internal radioiodine
exposure was less carcinogenic than external irradiation of the
thyroid. It was estimated that the incidence of thyroid cancers
in children, defined as those diagnosed between the ages of 0
and 14, might increase by about 5 per cent, and in adults by about
0.9 per cent over the next 30 years. As will be seen, a substantial
increase has already been detected in the more contaminated regions.
A determined effort was made to estimate doses, record the data,
initiate medical examinations and follow the cohorts already identified
as being most at risk.
<P>
In Ukraine, more than 150,000 examinations were conducted by special
dosimetric teams, and a realistic estimate of the collective thyroid
dose of 64,000 person-Sv has been made, leading to a projection
of 300 additional thyroid cancers (<I>Li93a</I>). In the contaminated
regions of Russia, namely Bryansk, Tula and Orel, it was predicted
that an excess thyroid cancer total of 349 would appear in a population
of 4.3 million (<I>Zv93</I>). This represents an increase of 3
to 6 per cent above the spontaneous rate. 
<P>
A programme to monitor the thyroid status of exposed children
in Belarus was set up in Minsk in May/June 1986. The highest doses
were received by the evacuated inhabitants of the Hoiniki rayon
(district) in the Gomel oblast. In the course of this study, it
was noted that the numbers of thyroid cancers in children were
increasing in some areas. For Belarus as a whole (<I>WH90, Ka92,
Wi94</I>), there has been a significantly increasing trend in
childhood thyroid cancer incidence since 1990 (<I>Pa94</I>). It
was also noted that this increase is confined to regions in the
Gomel and Brest oblasts, and no significant increase has been
noted in the Mogilev, Minsk or Vitebsk areas where the radioactive
iodine contamination is assessed to have been lower. Over 50 per
cent of all the cases are from the Gomel oblast.
<P>
For the eight years prior to 1986, only five cases of childhood
thyroid cancer were seen in Minsk, which is the main Belarussian
centre for thyroid cancer diagnosis and treatment on children
(<I>De94</I>). From 1986 to 1989, 2 to 6 cases of thyroid cancer
in children were seen annually in Minsk. In 1990, the number jumped
to 29, to 55 in 1991, then to 67 in 1992. By the end of 1994 the
total had reached over 300 in Belarus. Nearly 50 per cent of the
early (1992) thyroid cancers appeared in children who were aged
between one and four years at the time of the accident.
<P>
The histology of the cancers has shown that nearly all were papillary
carcinomata (<I>Ni94</I>) and that they were particularly aggressive,
often with prominent local invasion and distant metastases, usually
to the lungs. This has made the treatment of these children less
successful than expected, whether undertaken in Minsk or in specialised
centres in Europe. In all, about 150,000 children in Belarus had
thyroid uptake measurements following the accident. Other data
from Ukraine and Russia show a similar, but not as pronounced,
increase in the incidence of childhood thyroid cancer since 1987.

<P>
The increase in Belarus was confirmed by the final report of an
EC Expert Panel (<I>EC93</I>) convened in 1992 to investigate
the reported increase. In 1992 the incidence of childhood thyroid
cancer in Belarus as a whole was estimated to be 2.77 per 100,000,
whereas in the Gomel and Brest oblasts it was 8.8 and 4.76 respectively.
This increased incidence was not confined to children, as a larger
number of adult cases was registered in Belarus and in Ukraine
(<I>WH94</I>).
<P>
There is some difficulty in comparing the numbers quoted by the
health authorities of the former Soviet Union with previous incidence
statistics, as previous data collection was not sufficiently rigorous.
However, in Belarus all cases of childhood thyroid cancer have
been confirmed since 1986 by international review of the histology,
and, because of more rigid criteria for data collection, reliance
can be placed on accuracy and completeness. An attempt to review
incidence estimates was made in the above-mentioned EC Report
(<I>EC93</I>). These experts confirmed that the incidence of childhood
thyroid cancer (0-14 y) prior to the accident in Belarus (between
0 and 0.14/100,000/y) was similar to that reported by other cancer
registries. This indicates that the data collection in Belarus
was adequate. They noted that it jumped to 2.25/100,000/y in 1991,
about a twenty-fold increase.  
<P>
When this increase was first reported, it was very quickly pointed
out <I>(Be92)</I> that any medical surveillance programme introduced
would apparently increase the incidence by revealing occult disease
and rectifying misdiagnoses. While this may account for some of
the increase (<I>Ro92</I>), it cannot possibly be the sole cause,
as the increase is so large and many of the children presented
not with occult disease, but with clinical evidence of thyroid
and/or metastatic disease. In fact, only 12 per cent of the childhood
thyroid cancers were discovered by ultrasound screening alone
in Belarus (<I>WH95</I>). In addition, subsequent examination
by serial section of the thyroids of persons coming to autopsy
in Belarus have confirmed that the number of occult thyroid cancers
is similar to that found in other studies (<I>Fu93</I>) and showed
none of the aggressive characteristics found in the childhood
cancers presenting in life (<I>Fu92</I>).
<P>
The most recent published rates of childhood thyroid cancer (<I>St95</I>)
show unequivocal increases as seen in Table 7. At the time of
writing three children have died of their disease.

It can be concluded that there is a real, and large, increase
in the incidence of childhood thyroid cancer in Belarus and Ukraine
which is likely to be related to the Chernobyl accident. This
is suggested by features of the disease, which differ somewhat
from the so-called natural occurrence, as well as by its temporal
and geographic distribution.<I> </I>
<P>
As far as other thyroid disorders are concerned, no difference
in Russia was detected by ultrasound examination, in the percentage
incidence of cysts, nodules or autoimmune thyroiditis in the contaminated
versus the uncontaminated areas (<I>Ts94</I>). Following the accident,
children in the Ukrainian contaminated regions exhibited a transient
dose-dependent increase in serum thyroxine level, without overt
clinical thyrotoxicosis, which returned to normal within 12 to
18 months (<I>Ni94</I>). This was most marked in the youngest
children. This finding cannot be regarded as an adverse health
effect, as no abnormality was permanent. However, it may be a
pointer to future thyroid disease, especially when it may be associated
with mild regional dietary iodine deficiency, and indicates the
need for continued monitoring.
<P>
The majority of the estimates indicate that the overall health
impact from these thyroid disorders will be extremely small and
not detectable when averaged over the population potentially at
risk. This viewpoint is widely held by the competent risk assessors
who have examined the potential effects of the accident.
<P>
<I><B>Other late health effects</B></I>
<P>
From data in the Russian National Medical Dosimetric Registry
(RNMDR), the reported incidence of all types of disease has risen
between 1989 and 1992 (<I>Iv94</I>). There has also been a reported
increase in malignant disease which might be due to better surveillance
and/or radiation exposure. The crude mortality rate of the liquidators
from all causes in the Russian Federation has increased from 5
per 1,000 in 1991 to 7 per 1,000 in 1992. The crude death rate
from respiratory cancer is reported to have increased significantly
between 1990 and 1991, and for all malignant neoplasms between
1991 and 1992. It is not clear what influence smoking has had
on these data, and the overall significance of these findings
will need to be established by further surveillance, especially
when there are distinct regional variations in the crude death
rate and the mortality rates from lung, breast and intestinal
cancer are rising in the general population of the Russian Federation.
<P>
From the dosimetric data in the RNMDR (<I>Iv94</I>), a predicted
excess 670 cancer deaths may occur in the exposed groups covered
by the Registry, peaking in about 25 years. This is about 3.4
per cent of the expected cancer deaths from other causes. Data
from the other national dose registries is not readily available
in the published literature.
<P>
In view of the difficulties associated with these Registry data,
such as the dose estimates, the influence of such confounding
factors as smoking, the difficulty in follow-up, the possible
increase in some diseases in the general population and also the
short time since the accident, it is not possible to draw any
firm conclusions from these data at this time. The only inference
that can be made is that these groups are the most exposed and
that, if any radiation effects are to be seen, they will occur
in selected cohorts within these registries, which will require
long-term future surveillance.
<P>
A predicted increase of genetic effects in the next two generations
was 0.015 per cent of the spontaneous rate, and the estimated
lifetime excess percentage of all cancers as a result of living
in the strict control zones was 0.5 per cent, provided that a
lifetime dose limit of 350 mSv was not exceeded (<I>Il90</I>).

<P>
Childhood leukemia incidence has not changed in the decade since
the accident. There is no significant change in the level of leukemia
and related diseases in the contaminated (more than 555 kBq/m2)
and noncontaminated territories of the three states<I> (WH95)</I>.
Other attempts through epidemiological studies have failed to
establish a link between radiation exposure from the Chernobyl
accident and the incidence of leukemia and other abnormalities.
No epidemiological evidence of an increase in childhood leukemia
around Chernobyl <I>(Iv93)</I>, in Sweden <I>(Hj94)</I> or the
rest of Europe <I>(Pa92, Wi94)</I> has been established. However,
it may be prudent to withold final judgement on this issue for
a few more years.
<P>
<B>Other studies</B>
<P>
Various reports (<I>Pa93, Sc93, Se95, St93, Ve93</I>) have been
published on the incidence of chromosome aberrations among people
exposed both in the contaminated regions and in Europe. Some of
these have shown little or no increase, while others have. This
may reflect the wide variation in dose. However, there is a trend
for the incidence of chromosome aberrations to return to normal
with the passage of time. Other studies have not shown evidence
of lymphocytic chromosome damage (<I>Br92</I>). 
<P>
In East Germany one study found no rise in foetal chromosome aberrations
between May and December 1986. Chromosome aberrations are to be
expected in any exposed population, and should be regarded as
biological evidence of that exposure, rather than an adverse health
effect.
<P>
Another study in Germany suggesting a link between Down's syndrome
(Trisomy 21) and the Chernobyl accident has been severely criticised
and cannot be accepted at face value because of the absence of
control for confounding factors (<I>Sp91</I>), and it was not
confirmed by more extensive studies (<I>Li93</I>). Another study
in Finland (<I>Ha92</I>) showed no association of the incidence
of Trisomy 21 with radiation exposure from Chernobyl.
<P>
There are no clear trends in data for birth anomalies in Belarus
or Ukraine (<I>Li93, Bo94</I>). Two epidemiological studies in
Norway concluded that no serious gross changes as to pregnancy
outcome were observed (<I>Ir91</I>), and that no birth defects
known to be associated with radiation exposure were detected (<I>Li92</I>).
In Austria, no significant changes in the incidence of birth defects
or spontaneous abortion rates which could be attributed to the
Chernobyl accident were detected (<I>Ha92a</I>).
<P>
A review by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
showed no consistent evidence of a detrimental physical effect
of the Chernobyl accident on congenital abnormalities or pregnancy
outcomes (<I>Li93, EG88</I>). No reliable data have shown any
significant association between adverse pregnancy outcome or birth
anomalies even in the most contaminated regions and the doses
indicate that none would be expected.
<P>
There have been reports that have suggested that radiation exposure
as a result of the accident resulted in altered immune reactions.
While immune suppression at high whole-body doses is known to
be inevitable and severe, at the low doses experienced by the
general population it is expected that any detected alterations
will be minor and corrected naturally without any medical consequences.
These minor changes may be indicative of radiation exposure, but
their mild transitory nature is unlikely to lead to permanent
damage to the immune system. All immunological tests of radiation
exposure are in their infancy, but tests such as stimulated immunoglobulin
production by lymphocytes hold promise for the future as a means
of assessing doses below one Gy (<I>De90</I>). 
<P>
<B>Psychological effects </B>
<P>
The severity of the psychological effects of the Chernobyl accident
appears to be related to the public's growing mistrust of officialdom,
politicians and government, especially in the field of nuclear
power. Public scepticism towards authority is reinforced by its
difficulty in understanding radiation and its effects, as well
as the inability of the experts to present the issues in a way
that is comprehensible. The impression that an unseen, unknowable,
polluting hazard has been imposed upon them by the authorities
against their will, fosters a feeling of outrage. 
<P>
Public outrage is magnified by the concept that their existing
or future descendants are also at risk from this radiation pollution.
This widespread public attitude was not confined to one country,
and largely determined the initial public response outside the
Soviet Union. The public distrust was increased by the fact that
the accident that they had been told could not happen, did happen,
and it induced anxiety and stress in people not only in the contaminated
areas but, to a lesser extent, all over the world. 
<P>
While stress and anxiety cannot be regarded as direct physical
adverse health effects of irradiation, their influence on the
well-being of people who were exposed or thought that they might
have been, may well have a significant impact on the exposed population.
Several surveys have shown that the intensity of the anxiety and
stress are directly related to the presence of contamination.
It should also be remembered that the stress induced by the accident
was in addition to that produced in the general population by
the severe economic and social hardship caused by the break-up
of the Soviet Union.
<P>
<I><B>Within the former Soviet Union</B></I>
<P>
Within the Soviet Union additional factors came into play to influence
the public reaction. It should be remembered that this accident
occurred during the initial period of &quot;glasnost&quot; and
&quot;perestroika&quot;. After nearly seventy years of repression,
the ordinary people in the Soviet Union were beginning openly
to express all the dissatisfaction and frustration that they had
been harbouring. Distrust and hatred of the central government
and the Communist system could be expressed for the first time
without too much fear of reprisal. In addition, nationalism was
not repressed. The Chernobyl accident appeared to epitomise everything
that was wrong with the old system, such as secrecy, witholding
information and a heavy-handed authoritarian approach. Opposition
to Chernobyl came to symbolise not only anti-nuclear and anti-communist
sentiment but also was associated with an upsurge in nationalism.
<P>
The distrust of officialdom was so great that even scientists
from the central government were not believed, and more reliance
was placed on local &quot;experts&quot; who often had very little
expertise in radiation and its effects. The then Soviet Government
recognised this problem quickly, and tried to counteract the trend
by inviting foreign experts to visit the contaminated areas, assess
the problems, meet with local specialists and publicise their
views in open meetings and on television. These visits appeared
to have a positive effect, at least initially, in allaying the
fears of the public. In the contaminated Republics, anxiety and
stress were much more prevalent and were not just confined to
the more heavily contaminated regions (<I>WH90a</I>). Several
surveys conducted by Soviet (<I>Al89</I>) and other researchers
(<I>Du94</I>) have shown that the anxiety induced by the accident
has spread far beyond the more heavily contaminated regions. 
<P>
During this period there was severe economic hardship which added
to the social unrest and reinforced opposition to the official
system of government. Anti-nuclear demonstrations were commonplace
in the larger cities in Belarus (Gomel and Minsk), and Ukraine
(Kiev and Lvov) in the years following the accident (<I>Co92</I>).
The dismissive attitude of some Soviet scientists and government
officials in describing the public reaction as &quot;radiophobic&quot;
tended to alienate the public even further by implying some sort
of mental illness or reaction which was irrational and abnormal.
It also served as a convenient catch-all diagnosis which suggested
that the public was somehow at fault, and the authorities were
unable to do anything about its manifestations.
<P>
The concern of people for their own health is only overshadowed
by their concern for the health of their children and grandchildren.
Major and minor health problems are attributed to radiation exposure
no matter what their origin, and the impact that the accident
has had on their daily lives has added to the stress. Whole communities
are facing or have faced evacuation or relocation. There are still
widespread restrictions on daily life affecting schooling, work,
diet and recreation. 
<P>
The accident has caused disruption of social networks and traditional
ways of life. As most inhabitants of the contaminated settlements
are native to the area and often have lived there all their lives,
relocation has in many cases, destroyed the existing family and
community social networks, transferring groups to new areas where
they may well be resented or even ostracised. In spite of these
drawbacks, about 70 per cent of the people living in contaminated
areas wished to be relocated (<I>IA91</I>). This may well be influenced
by the economic incentives and improved living standards that
result from relocation by the government.
<P>
There are two additional circumstances and events which have tended
to increase the psychological impact of the accident, the first
of which was an initiative specifically designed to alleviate
these effects in Ukraine. This was the introduction of the compensation
law in Ukraine in 1991. Some three million Ukrainians were affected
in some way by the post-accident management introduced, upon which
approximately one sixth of the total national budget was spent
(<I>Du94</I>). Different surveys have shown a general feeling
of anxiety in all sectors of the population, but it was particularly
acute among those who had been relocated. People were fearful
of what the future might bring for themselves and their offspring,
and were concerned about their lack of control over their own
destiny. 
<P>
The problem is that the system of compensation may well have exaggerated
these fears by placing the recipients into the category of victims.
This tended to segregate them socially and increased the resentment
of the native population into whose social system these &quot;victims&quot;
had been injected without consultation. This had the effect on
the evacuees of increasing stress, often leading to withdrawal,
apathy and despair. Locally, this compensation was often referred
as a &quot;coffin subsidy&quot;! It is interesting to note that
the 800 or so mostly elderly people who have returned to their
contaminated homes in the evacuated zones, and hence receive no
compensation, appear to be less stressed and anxious, in spite
of worse living conditions, than those who were relocated. It
should be pointed out that compensation and assistance are not
harmful in themselves, provided that care is taken not to induce
an attitude of dependence and resignation in the recipients. 
<P>
The second factor which served to augment the psychological impact
of the accident was the acceptance by physicians and the public
of the disease entity known as &quot;vegetative dystonia&quot;.
This diagnosis is characterised by vague symptoms and no definitive
diagnostic tests. At any one time, up to 1,000 children were hospitalised
in Kiev, often for weeks, for treatment of this &quot;disease&quot;
(<I>St92</I>). The diagnosis of vegetative dystonia appears to
be tailor-made for the post-accident situation, assigned by parents
and doctors to account for childhood complaints and accepted by
adults as an explanation for vague symptoms. 
<P>
There is great pressure on the physicians to respond to their
patients' needs in terms of arriving at an acceptable diagnosis,
and &quot;Vegetative Dystonia&quot; is very convenient as it will
fit any array of symptoms. Such a diagnosis not only justifies
the patients' complaints by placing the blame for this &quot;disease&quot;
on radiation exposure, it also exonerates the patient from any
responsibility, which is placed squarely on the shoulders of those
responsible for the exposure - the Government. When the need for
extended hospitalisation is added, the justification to accept
this as a real disease is enhanced. It can be understood why there
is an epidemic of this diagnosis in the contaminated areas.  

<P>
<I><B>Outside the former Soviet Union</B></I>
<P>
Psychological effects in other countries were minimal compared
with those within the former Soviet Union, and were generally
exhibited more as concerned social reactions rather than psychosomatic
symptoms. In the contaminated regions of the former Soviet Union,
many people were convinced that they were suffering from radiation
induced disease, whereas in the rest of the world, where contamination
was much less, news of the accident appeared to reinforce anti-nuclear
perceptions in the general population. This was evidenced, for
example, by the demonstrations on 7 June 1986 demanding the decommissioning
of all nuclear power plants in the Federal Republic of Germany
(<I>Ze86</I>). While in France public support for nuclear power
expansion dropped since the accident, 63 per cent of the population
felt that French nuclear power reactors operated efficiently (<I>Ch90</I>).
The minimal impact of the Chernobyl accident on French public
opinion was probably due to the fact that about 75 per cent of
their electrical power is derived from nuclear stations, and in
addition, France was one of the least contaminated European countries.

<P>
The Swedish public response has been well-documented (<I>Dr93</I>,
<I>Sj87</I>). In the survey, the question was asked: &quot;With
the experience that we now have, do you think it was good or bad
for the country to invest in Nuclear Energy?&quot; Those that
responded &quot;bad&quot; jumped from 25 per cent before, to 47
per cent after Chernobyl. The accident probably doubled the number
of people who admitted negative attitudes towards nuclear power
(<I>Sj87</I>). This change was most marked among women, who, it
was felt, regarded nuclear power as an environmental problem,
whereas men regarded it as a technical problem which could be
solved. Media criticism of the radiation protection authorities
in that country became more common, with the charge that the official
pronouncements on the one hand said that the risk in Sweden was
negligible, and yet on the other, gave instructions on how it
could be reduced. The concept that a dose, however small, should
be avoided if it could be done easily and cheaply, was not understood.

<P>
This sort of reaction was common outside the former Soviet Union,
and while it did not give rise to significant psychosomatic effects,
it tended to enhance public apprehension about the dangers of
nuclear power and foster the public's growing mistrust of official
bodies. 
<P>
In addition, public opinion in Europe was very sceptical of the
information released by the Soviet Union. This mistrust was reinforced
further by the fact that the traditional sources of information
to which the public tended to turn in a crisis, the physicians
and teachers, were no better informed and often only repeated
and reinforced the fears that had been expressed to them. Added
to this were the media, who tended to respond to the need to print
&quot;newsworthy&quot; items by publishing some of the more outlandish
claims of so-called radiation effects. 
<P>
The general public was confused and cynical and responded in predictable
but extreme ways such as seeking induced abortions, postponing
travel and not buying food that might conceivably be contaminated.
Another global concern that was manifested, was the apprehension
over travel to the Soviet Union. Potential travellers sought advice
from national authorities on whether to travel, what precautions
to take and how they could check on their exposure. Many people,
in spite of being reassured that it was safe to travel, cancelled
their trip, just to be on the safe side, exhibiting their lack
of confidence in the advice they received. 
<P>
As has been seen, governments themselves were not immune from
the influence of these fears and some responded by introducing
measures such as unnecessarily stringent intervention levels for
the control of radionuclides in imported food. Thus, in the world
as a whole, while the individual psychological effects due to
anxiety and stress were probably minimal, the collective perception
and response had a significant economic and social impact. It
became clear that there was a need to inform the public on radiation
effects, to provide clear instructions on the precautions to be
taken so that the public regains some level of personal control,
and for the authorities to recognise the public's need to be involved
in the decisions that affect them.
<P>

<p><LI><B>Thirty-one people died in the course of the accident or

syndrome.</B>

<center><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B></center>
<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
On 26 April, 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear power station, in Ukraine,
suffered a major accident which was followed by a prolonged release
to the atmosphere of large quantities of radioactive substances.
The specific features of the release favoured a widespread distribution
of radioactivity throughout the northern hemisphere, mainly across
Europe. A contributing factor was the variation of meteorological
conditions and wind regimes during the period of release. Activity
transported by the multiple plumes from Chernobyl was measured
not only in Northern and in Southern Europe, but also in Canada,
Japan and the United States. Only the Southern hemisphere remained
free of contamination.
<P>
This had serious radiological, health and socio-economic consequences
for the populations of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, and to some
extent they are still suffering from these consequences. Although
the radiological impact of the accident in other countries was
generally very low, and even insignificant outside Europe, this
event had, however, the effect of enhancing public apprehension
all over the world on the risks associated with the use of nuclear
energy.
<P>
This is one of the reasons explaining the renewed attention and
effort devoted during the last decade to the reactor safety studies
and to emergency preparedness by public authorities and the nuclear
industry. This also underlies the continuing attention of the
public opinion to the situation at Chernobyl.
<P>
The forthcoming tenth anniversary of the accident appears, therefore,
the right moment to review the status of our knowledge of the
serious aspects of the accident impact, to take stock of the information
accumulated and the scientific studies underway, as well as to
assess the degree to which national authorities and experts have
implemented the numerous lessons that the Chernobyl accident taught
us.
<P>
This brief report, prepared under the aegis of the Committee on
Radiation Protection and Public Health (CRPPH) of the OECD Nuclear
Energy Agency, presents a collective view by OECD radiation protection
experts on this matter.
<P>
<B>The accident</B>
<P>
The Unit 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was to be shutdown
for routine maintenance on 25 April 1986. On that occasion, it
was decided to carry out a test of the capability of the plant
equipment to provide enough electrical power to operate the reactor
core cooling system and emergency equipment during the transition
period between a loss of main station electrical power supply
and the start up of the emergency power supply provided by diesel
engines.
<P>
Unfortunately, this test, which was considered essentially to
concern the non-nuclear part of the power plant, was carried out
without a proper exchange of information and co-ordination between
the team in charge of the test and the personnel in charge of
the operation and safety of the nuclear reactor. Therefore, inadequate
safety precautions were included in the test programme and the
operating personnel were not alerted to the nuclear safety implications
and potential danger of the electrical test.
<P>
This lack of co-ordination and awareness, resulting from an insufficient
level of &quot;safety culture&quot; within the plant staff, led
the operators to take a number of actions which deviated from
established safety procedures and led to a potentially dangerous
situation. This course of actions was compounded by the existence
of significant drawbacks in the reactor design which made the
plant potentially unstable and easily susceptible to loss of control
in case of operational errors.
<P>
The combination of these factors provoked a sudden and uncontrollable
power surge which resulted in violent explosions and almost total
destruction of the reactor. The consequences of this catastrophic
event were further worsened by the graphite moderator and other
material fires that broke out in the building and contributed
to a widespread and prolonged release of radioactive materials
to the environment.
<P>
<B>Dispersion and deposition of radionuclides</B>
<P>
The release of radioactive materials to the atmosphere consisted
of gases, aerosols and finely fragmented nuclear fuel particles.
This release was extremely high in quantity, involving a large
fraction of the radioactive product inventory existing in the
reactor, and its duration was unexpectedly long, lasting for more
than a week. This duration and the high altitude (about 1 km)
reached by the release were largely due to the graphite fire which
was very difficult to extinguish.
<P>
For these reasons and the concomitant frequent changes of wind
direction during the release period, the area affected by the
radioactive plume and the consequent deposition of radioactive
substances on the ground was extremely large, encompassing the
whole Northern hemisphere, although significant contamination
outside the former Soviet Union was only experienced in part of
Europe.
<P>
The pattern of contamination on the ground and in foodchains was,
however, very uneven in some areas due to the influence of rainfall
during the passage of the plume. This irregularity in the pattern
of deposition was particularly pronounced at larger distances
from the reactor site.
<P>
<B>Reactions of national authorities</B>
<P>
The scale and severity of the Chernobyl accident had not been
foreseen and took most national authorities responsible for public
health and emergency preparedness by surprise. The intervention
criteria and procedures existing in most countries were not adequate
for dealing with an accident of such scale and provided little
help in decision-making concerning the choice and adoption of
protective measures. In addition, early in the course of the accident
there was little information available and considerable political
pressure, partially based on the public perception of the radiation
danger, was being exerted on the decision-makers.
<P>
In these circumstances, cautious immediate actions were felt necessary
and in many cases measures were introduced that tended to err,
sometimes excessively so, on the side of prudence rather than
being driven by informed scientific and expert judgement. 
<P>
Within the territory of the former Soviet Union, short-term countermeasures
were massive and, in general, reasonably timely and effective.
However, difficulties emerged when the authorities tried to establish
criteria for the management of the contaminated areas on the long
term and the associated relocation of large groups of population.
Various approaches were proposed and criteria were applied over
the years. Eventually, criteria for population resettlement or
relocation from contaminated areas were adopted in which radiation
protection requirements and economic compensation considerations
were intermingled. This was and continues to be a source of confusion
and possible abuse.
<P>
The progressive spread of contamination at large distances from
the accident site caused considerable concern in many countries
outside the former Soviet Union and the reactions of the national
authorities to this situation were extremely varied, ranging from
a simple intensification of the normal environmental monitoring
programmes, without adoption of specific countermeasures, to compulsory
restrictions concerning the marketing and consumption of foodstuffs.
<P>
Apart from the objective differences of contamination levels and
regulatory and public health systems between countries, one of
the principal reasons for the variety of situations observed in
the different countries stems from the different criteria adopted
for the choice and application of intervention levels for the
implementation of protective actions. These discrepancies were
in some cases due to misinterpretation and misuse of international
radiation protection guidelines, especially in the case of food
contamination, and were further enhanced by the overwhelming role
played in many cases by non-radiological factors, such as socio-economic,
political and psychological, in determining the countermeasures.
<P>
This situation caused concern and confusion among the public,
perplexities among the experts and difficulties to national authorities,
including problems of public credibility, as well as a waste of
efforts and unnecessary economic losses. These problems were particularly
felt in areas close to international borders due to different
reactions of the authorities and media in bordering countries.
However, all these issues were soon identified as an area where
several lessons should be learned and international efforts were
undertaken to harmonise criteria and approaches to emergency management.
<P>
<B>Radiation dose estimates</B>
<P>
Most of the population of the Northern hemisphere was exposed,
to various degrees, to radiation from the Chernobyl accident.
After several years of accumulation of dosimetric data from all
available sources and dose reconstruction calculations based on
environmental contamination data and mathematical models, it is
now possible to arrive at a reasonable, although not highly accurate,
assessment of the ranges of doses received by the various groups
of population affected by the accident.
<P>
The main doses of concern are those to the thyroid due to external
irradiation and inhalation and ingestion of radioactive iodine
isotopes, and those to the whole body due to external irradiation
from and ingestion of radioactive caesium isotopes. According
to current estimates, the situation for the different exposed
groups is the following:

<UL>
<p>
<LI><I><B>Evacuees</B></I> - More than 100,000 persons were evacuated,
mostly from the 30-km radius area around the accident site, during
the first few weeks following the accident. These people received
significant doses both to the whole body and the thyroid, although
the distribution of those doses was very variable among them depending
on their positions around the accident site and the delays of
their evacuation. 
</UL>

<P>
Doses to the thyroid ranging from 70 millisieverts to adults up
to about 1,000 millisieverts (<I>i.e.,</I> 1 sievert) to young
children and an average individual dose of 15 millisieverts [mSv]
to the whole body were estimated to have been absorbed by this
population prior to their evacuation. Many of these people continued
to be exposed, although to a lesser extent depending on the sites
of their relocation, after their evacuation from the 30-km zone.
<p>
<UL>
<LI><I><B>&quot;Liquidators&quot;</B></I> - Hundreds of thousands
of workers, estimated to amount up to 800,000 and including a
large number of military personnel, were involved in the emergency
actions on the site during the accident and the subsequent clean-up
operations which lasted for a few years. These workers were called
&quot;liquidators&quot;.
</UL>

<P>
A restricted number, of the order of 400, including plant staff,
firemen and medical aid personnel, were on the site during the
accident and its immediate aftermath and received very high doses
from a variety of sources and exposure pathways. Among them were
all those who developed acute radiation syndrome and required
emergency medical treatment. The doses to these people ranged
from a few grays to well above 10 grays to the whole body from
external irradiation and comparable or even higher internal doses,
in particular to the thyroid, from incorporation of radionuclides.
A number of scientists, who periodically performed technical actions
inside the destroyed reactor area during several years, accumulated
over time doses of similar magnitude.
<P>
The largest group of liquidators participated in clean-up operations
for variable durations over a number of years after the accident.
Although they were not operating anymore in emergency conditions
and were submitted to controls and dose limitations, they received
significant doses ranging from tens to hundreds of millisieverts.
<p>
<UL>
<LI><I><B>People living in contaminated areas of the former Soviet
Union - </B></I>About 270,000 people continue to live in contaminated
areas with radiocaesium deposition levels in excess of 555 kilobecquerels
per square metre [kBq/m2], where protection measures still continue
to be required. Thyroid doses, due mainly to the consumption of
cow's milk contaminated with radioiodine, were delivered during
the first few weeks after the accident; children in the Gomel
region of Belarus appear to have received the highest thyroid
doses with a range from negligible levels up to 40 sieverts and
an average of about 1 sievert for children aged 0 to 7. Because
of the control of foodstuffs in those areas, most of the radiation
exposure since the summer of 1986 is due to external irradiation
from the radiocaesium activity deposited on the ground; the whole-body
doses for the 1986-89 time period are estimated to range from
5 to 250 mSv with an average of 40 mSv<I><B>.</B></I>
<p><LI><I><B>Populations outside the former Soviet Union - </B></I>The
radioactive materials of a volatile nature (such as iodine and
caesium) that were released during the accident spread throughout
the entire Northern hemisphere. The doses received by populations
outside the former Soviet Union are relatively low, and show large
differences from one country to another depending mainly upon
whether rainfall occurred during the passage of the radioactive
cloud. These doses range from a lower extreme of a few microsieverts
or tens of microsieverts outside Europe, to an upper extreme of
1 or 2 mSv in some European countries.  The latter value is of
the same order as the annual individual exposure from natural
background radiation.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Health impact</B>
<P>
The health impact of the Chernobyl accident can be described in
terms of acute health effects (death, severe health impairment),
late health effects (cancers) and psychological effects liable
to affect health.
<P>
The acute health effects occurred among the plant personnel and
the persons who intervened in the emergency phase to fight fires,
provide medical aid and immediate clean-up operations. A total
of 31 persons died as a consequence of the accident, and about
140 persons suffered various degrees of radiation sickness and
health impairment. No members of the general public suffered these
kinds of effects.
<P>
As far as the late health effects are concerned, namely the possible
increase of cancer incidence, in the decade following the accident
there has been a real and significant increase of carcinomas of
the thyroid among the children living in the contaminated regions
of the former Soviet Union, which should be attributed to the
accident until proved otherwise. There might also be some increase
of thyroid cancers among the adults living in those regions. From
the observed trend of this increase of thyroid cancers it is expected
that the peak has not yet been reached and that this kind of cancer
will still continue for some time to show an excess above its
natural rate in the area.
<P>
On the other hand, the scientific and medical observation of the
population has not revealed any increase in other cancers, as
well as in leukaemia, congenital abnormalities, adverse pregnancy
outcomes or any other radiation induced disease that could be
attributed to the Chernobyl accident. This observation applies
to the whole general population, both within and outside the former
Soviet Union. Large scientific and epidemiological research programmes,
some of them sponsored by international organisations such as
the WHO and the EC, are being conducted to provide further insight
into possible future health effects. However, the population dose
estimates generally accepted tend to indicate that, with the exception
of thyroid disease, it is unlikely that the exposure would lead
to discernible radiation effects in the general population above
the background of natural incidence of the same diseases. In the
case of the liquidators this forecast should be taken with some
caution.
<P>
An important effect of the accident, which has a bearing on health,
is the appearance of a widespread status of psychological stress
in the populations affected. The severity of this phenomenon,
which is mostly observed in the contaminated regions of the former
Soviet Union, appears to reflect the public fears about the unknowns
of radiation and its effects, as well as its mistrust towards
public authorities and official experts, and is certainly made
worse by the disruption of the social networks and traditional
ways of life provoked by the accident and its long-term consequences.
<P>
<B>Agricultural and environmental impacts</B>
<P>
The impact of the accident on agricultural practices, food production
and use and other aspects of the environment has been and continues
to be much more widespread than the direct health impact on humans.
<P>
Several techniques of soil treatment and decontamination to reduce
the accumulation of radioactivity in agricultural produce and
cow's milk and meat have been experimented with positive results
in some cases. Nevertheless, within the former Soviet Union large
areas of agricultural land are still excluded from use and are
expected to continue to be so for a long time. In a much larger
area, although agricultural and dairy production activities are
carried out, the food produced is subjected to strict controls
and restrictions of distribution and use.
<P>
Similar problems of control and limitation of use, although of
a much lower severity, were experienced in some countries of Europe
outside the former Soviet Union, where agricultural and farm animal
production were subjected to restrictions for variable durations
after the accident. Most of these restrictions have been lifted
several years ago. However, there are still today some areas in
Europe where restrictions on slaughter and distribution of animals
are in force. This concerns, for example, several hundreds of
thousands of sheep in the United Kingdom and large numbers of
sheep and reindeer in some Nordic countries.
<P>
A kind of environment where special problems were and continue
to be experienced is the forest environment. Because of the high
filtering characteristics of trees, deposition was often higher
in forests than in other areas. An extreme case was the so-called
&quot;red forest&quot; near to the Chernobyl site where the irradiation
was so high as to kill the trees which had to be destroyed as
radioactive waste.  In more general terms, forests, being a source
of timber, wild game, berries and mushrooms as well as a place
for work and recreation, continue to be of concern in some areas
and are expected to constitute a radiological problem for a long
time.
<P>
Water bodies, such as rivers, lakes and reservoirs can be, if
contaminated, an important source of human radiation exposure
because of their uses for recreation, drinking and fishing. In
the case of the Chernobyl accident this segment of the environment
did not contribute significantly to the total radiation exposure
of the population. It was estimated that the component of the
individual and collective doses that can be attributed to the
water bodies and their products did not exceed 1 or 2 percent
of the total exposure resulting from the accident. The contamination
of the water system has not posed a public health problem during
the last decade; nevertheless, in view of the large quantities
of radioactivity deposited in the catchment area of the system
of water bodies in the contaminated regions around Chernobyl,
there will continue to be for a long time a need for careful monitoring
to ensure that washout from the catchment area will not contaminate
drinking-water supplies.
<P>
Outside the former Soviet Union, no concerns were ever warranted
for the levels of radioactivity in drinking water. On the other
hand, there are lakes, particularly in Switzerland and the Nordic
countries, where restrictions were necessary for the consumption
of fish. These restrictions still exist in Sweden, for example,
where thousands of lakes contain fish with a radioactivity content
which is still higher than the limits established by the authorities
for sale on the market.
<P>
<B>Potential residual risks</B>
<P>
Within seven months of the accident, the destroyed reactor was
encased in a massive concrete structure, known as the &quot;sarcophagus&quot;,
to provide some form of confinement of the damaged nuclear fuel
and destroyed equipment and reduce the likelihood of further releases
of radioactivity to the environment. This structure was, however,
not conceived as a permanent containment but rather as a provisional
barrier pending the definition of a more radical solution for
the elimination of the destroyed reactor and the safe disposal
of the highly radioactive materials.
<P>
Nine years after its erection, the sarcophagus structure, although
still generally sound, raises concerns for its long-term resistance
and represents a standing potential risk. In particular, the roof
of the structure presented for a long time numerous cracks with
consequent impairment of leaktightness and penetration of large
quantities of rain water which is now highly radioactive. This
also creates conditions of high humidity producing corrosion of
metallic structures which contribute to the support of the sarcophagus.
Moreover, some massive concrete structures, damaged or dislodged
by the reactor explosion, are unstable and their failure, due
to further degradation or to external events, could provoke a
collapse of the roof and part of the building.
<P>
According to various analyses, a number of potential accidental
scenarios could be envisaged. They include a criticality excursion
due to change of configuration of the melted nuclear fuel masses
in the presence of water leaked from the roof, a resuspension
of radioactive dusts provoked by the collapse of the enclosure
and the long-term migration of radionuclides from the enclosure
into the groundwater. The first two accident scenarios would result
in the release of radionuclides into the atmosphere which would
produce a new contamination of the surrounding area within a radius
of several tens of kilometres. It is not expected, however, that
such accidents could have serious radiological consequences at
longer distances.
<P>
As far as the leaching of radionuclides from the fuel masses by
the water in the enclosure and their migration into the groundwater
are concerned, this phenomenon is expected to be very slow and
it has been estimated that, for example, it will take 45 to 90
years for certain radionuclides such as strontium90 to migrate
underground up to the Pripyat River catchment area. The expected
radiological significance of this phenomenon is not known with
certainty and a careful monitoring of the evolving situation of
the groundwater will need to be carried out for a long time.
<P>
The accident recovery and clean-up operations have resulted in
the production of very large quantities of radioactive wastes
and contaminated equipment which are currently stored in about
800 sites within and outside the 30-km exclusion zone around the
reactor. These wastes and equipment are partly buried in trenches
and partly conserved in containers isolated from groundwater by
clay or concrete screens. A large number of contaminated equipment,
engines and vehicles are also stored in the open air.
<P>
All these wastes are a potential source of contamination of the
groundwater which will require close monitoring until a safe disposal
into an appropriate repository is implemented.
<P>
In general, it can be concluded that the sarcophagus and the proliferation
of waste storage sites in the area constitute a series of potential
sources of release of radioactivity that threatens the surrounding
area. However, any such releases are expected to be very small
in comparison with those from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and
their consequences would be limited to a relatively small area
around the site. On the other hand, concerns have been expressed
by some experts that a much more important release might occur
if the collapse of the sarcophagus should induce damage in the
Unit 3 of the Chernobyl power plant, which currently is still
in operation.
<P>
In any event, initiatives have been taken internationally, and
are currently underway, to study a technical solution leading
to the elimination of these sources of residual risk on the site.
<P>
<B>Lessons learned </B>
<P>
The Chernobyl accident was very specific in nature and it should
not be seen as a reference accident for future emergency planning
purposes. However, it was very clear from the reactions of the
public authorities in the various countries that they were not
prepared to deal with an accident of this magnitude and that technical
and/or organisational deficiencies existed in emergency planning
and preparedness in almost all countries.
<P>
The lessons that could be learned from the Chernobyl accident
were, therefore, numerous and encompassed all areas, including
reactor safety and severe accident management, intervention criteria,
emergency procedures, communication, medical treatment of irradiated
persons, monitoring methods, radioecological processes, land and
agricultural management, public information, etc.
<P>
However, the most important lesson learned was probably the understanding
that a major nuclear accident has inevitable transboundary implications
and its consequences could affect, directly or indirectly, many
countries even at large distances from the accident site. This
led to an extraordinary effort to expand and reinforce international
co-operation in areas such as communication, harmonisation of
emergency management criteria and co-ordination of protective
actions. Major improvements were achieved in this decade and important
international mechanisms of co-operation and information were
established, such as the international conventions on early notification
and assistance in case of a radiological accident, by the IAEA
and the EC, the international nuclear emergency exercises (INEX)
programme, by the NEA, the international accident severity scale
(INES), by the IAEA and NEA and the international agreement on
food contamination, by the FAO and WHO.
<P>
At the national level, the Chernobyl accident also stimulated
authorities and experts to a radical review of their understanding
of and attitude to radiation protection and nuclear emergency
issues. This prompted many countries to establish nationwide emergency
plans in addition to the existing structure of local emergency
plans for individual nuclear facilities. In the scientific and
technical area, besides providing new impetus to nuclear safety
research, especially on the management of severe nuclear accidents,
this new climate led to renewed efforts to expand knowledge on
the harmful effects of radiation and their medical treatment and
to revitalise radioecological research and environmental monitoring
programmes. Substantial improvements were also achieved in the
definition of criteria and methods for the information of the
public, an aspect whose importance was particularly evident during
the accident and its aftermath.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
The history of the modern industrial world has been affected on
many occasions by catastrophes comparable or even more severe
than the Chernobyl accident. Nevertheless, this accident, due
not only to its severity but especially to the presence of ionising
radiation, had a significant impact on human society. 
<P>
Not only it produced severe health consequences and physical,
industrial and economic damage in the short term, but, also, its
long-term consequences in terms of socio-economic disruption,
psychological stress and damaged image of nuclear energy, are
expected to be long standing.
<P>
However, the international community has demonstrated a remarkable
ability to apprehend and treasure the lessons to be drawn from
this event, so that it will be better prepared to cope with a
challenge of this kind, if ever a severe nuclear accident should
happen again.

<B>LESSONS LEARNED</B>
</center>
<P>
The accident did not affect each country in the same way and a
different emphasis was placed on various aspects of the accident
with particular reference to the circumstances of that country.
Thus, countries remote from the accident, with no domestic nuclear
power programmes or neighbouring reactors, tended to emphasise
food control and information exchange as their major thrust for
improvement. Whereas those countries which were contaminated by
the accident, and had their own nuclear power programmes and/or
reactors in neighbouring countries, drew extensive lessons from
the way the accident developed and was treated. For these reasons,
not all the lessons learned were applied universally with the
same emphasis. 
<P>
<B>Operational aspects </B>
<P>
The Chernobyl accident was one of a kind, and, although it highlighted
deficiencies in emergency preparedness and radiation protection,
it should not be seen as the reference accident for future emergency
planning purposes (<I>Bu91</I>).
<P>
It was very clear from the initial reactions of the competent
national authorities that they were unprepared for an accident
of such magnitude and they had to make decisions, as the accident
evolved, on criteria that could have been established beforehand.
This also meant that too many organisations were involved in the
decision-making, as no clear-cut demarcations had been agreed
and established. Areas of overlapping responsibility and jurisdiction
needed to be clearly established prior to any accident. A permanent
infrastructure needed also to be in place and maintained for any
efficient implementation of protective measures. Such an infrastructure
had to include rapid communications systems, intervention teams
and monitoring networks. Mobile ground monitoring teams were required,
as was aerial monitoring and tracking of the plume. Many countries
responded to this need by establishing such monitoring networks
and reorganising their emergency response.
<P>
Logistic problems associated with intervention plans, such as
stable iodine distribution (<I>Sc94</I>, <I>NE95a</I>) and evacuation
obviously needed to be in place and rehearsed long before the
accident, as they are too complex and time-consuming to be implemented
during the short time available during the evolution of the accident.
Intervention actions and the levels at which they should be introduced
needed to be agreed, preferably internationally, and incorporated
into the emergency plans so that they could be immediately and
efficiently implemented. 
<P>
The accident also demonstrated the need to include the possibility
of transboundary implications in the emergency plans, as it had
been shown that the radionuclide release would be elevated and
the dispersion of contamination more widespread. The concern,
raised by the experience of Chernobyl, that any country could
be affected not only by nuclear accidents occurring on its territory
but also by the consequences of accidents happening abroad, stimulated
the establishment of national emergency plans in several countries.
<P>
The transboundary nature of the contamination prompted the international
organisations to promote international cooperation and communication,
to harmonise actions (<I>NE88, IA94, IC90, IC92, NE93, NE89, NE90,
NE89b, WH88, WH87, IA89b, IA92, IA91a, IA89c, IA87a, IA94a, EC89a,
EC89b) </I>and to develop international emergency exercises such
as those organised by the OECD/NEA in its INEX Programme (NE95).
A major accomplishment of the international community were the
agreements reached on early notification in the event of a radiological
accident and on assistance in radiological emergencies through
international Conventions in the frame of the IAEA and the EC
(<I>EC87, IA86b, IA86c</I>).
<P>
Furthermore, in order to facilitate communication with the public
on the severity of nuclear accidents, the International Nuclear
Event Scale INES was developed by the IAEA and the NEA and is
currently adopted by a large number of countries.
<P>
The accident provided the stimulus for international agreement
on food contamination moving in trade, promoted by the WHO/FAO,
as there is a need to import at least some food in most countries,
and governments recognised the need to assure their citizens that
the food that they eat is safe. Monitoring imported food was one
of the first control measures instituted and continues to be performed
(<I>FA91, EC89c, EC93a</I>).
<P>
This event also clearly showed that all national governments,
even those without nuclear power programmes, needed to develop
emergency plans to address the problem of transboundary dispersion
of radionuclides. Of necessity these plans had to be international
in nature, involving the free and rapid exchange of information
between countries.
<P>
It is essential that emergency plans are flexible. It would be
foolish to plan for another accident similar to Chernobyl without
any flexibility, as the only fact that one can be sure of is that
the next severe accident will be different. Emergency planners
need to distil the general principles applicable to various accidents
and incorporate these into a generic plan.   
<P>
The accident emphasised the need for public information and public
pressure at the time clearly demonstrated this need. A large number
of persons who are knowledgeable about the technique of providing
information, are needed to establish a credible source of information
to the public before an accident, so that clear and simple reports
can be disseminated continuously in a timely and accurate form
(<I>EC89</I>).
<P>
Emergency plans also need to include a process by which large
numbers of people could have their exposure assessed, and those
with high exposures differentiated.  The accident also highlighted
the need for the prior identification of central specialised medical
facilities with adequate transportation to treat the more highly
exposed individuals.            
<P>
Refinement and clarification of international advice was needed
(<I>Pa88</I>). The recommendations for intervention in an accident
contained in ICRP Publication 40 were not clearly understood when
they came to be applied, and the Commission reviewed this advice
in Publication 63 (<I>IC92</I>). This guide placed emphasis on
the averted dose as the parameter against which an intervention
measure should be assessed. It was also made clear that an intervention
had to be &quot;justified&quot; in as far as it produced more
good than harm, and that where a choice existed between different
protection options, &quot;optimisation&quot; was the mechanism
to determine the choice. Emphasis was also placed on the need
to integrate all protective actions in an emergency plan, and
not to assess each one in isolation, as one may well influence
the efficacy of another.
<P>
<B>Scientific and technical aspects  </B>
<P>
Prior to the accident, it was felt that the flora and fauna of
the environment were relatively radioresistant and this was supported
by the fact that no lethal radioecological injuries were noted
after the accident except in pine forests (600 ha) and small areas
of birch close to the reactor. A cumulative dose of less than
5 Gy has no gross effect even in the most sensitive flora of ecological
systems, but there are still ecological lessons to be learned
especially on the siting of nuclear power reactors (<I>Al93</I>).

<P>
Plant foliar and root uptake is being studied, as are resuspension
and weathering.  The transfer coefficients at all stages of the
pathways to human exposure are being refined. Following the accident,
an assessment of the models used at thirteen sites to predict
the movement of iodine-131 and caesium-137 from the atmosphere
to food chains (<I>Ho91</I>) indicated that models commonly used
tended to overpredict by anything up to a factor of ten. The extensive
whole-body monitoring of radioactivity in persons undertaken in
conjunction with the measurement of ground and food contamination
allowed refinement of the accuracy of the models for human dose
assessment from the exposure through different pathways. The methods
and techniques to handle contamination of food, equipment and
soil have been improved. 
<P>
Meteorological aspects, such as the relationship between deposition
and precipitation and greater deposition over high ground and
mountains, have been shown to be important especially in the development
of more realistic models (<I>NE96a</I>). The importance of synoptic
scale weather patterns used in predictions was established, and
different models have been developed to predict deposition patterns
under a wide variety of weather conditions. The chemico-physical
changes in the radioactive gases and aerosols transported through
the atmosphere are being studied to improve the accuracy of transport
models.
<P>
Other impacts of the accident on model refinement include the
improvement in understanding the movement of radionuclides in
soil and biota, pathways and transfer factors; the effect of rainstorms
and the influence of mountains and the alignment of valleys on
deposition patterns; particulate re-suspension; long range pollution
transport mechanisms; and the factors which influence deposition
velocities (<I>NE89a</I>, <I>NE96</I>).
<P>
Uniform methods and standards were developed for the measurement
of contaminating radionuclides in environmental samples.
<P>
In the case of high exposures the importance of symptomatic and
prophylactic medical and nursing procedures, such as antibiotics,
anti-fungal and anti-viral agents, parenteral feeding, air sterilisation
and barrier nursing was demonstrated, as were the disappointing
results of bone-marrow transplantation.   
<P>
In addition, the accident led to an expansion of research in nuclear
safety and the management of severe nuclear accidents.
<P>
On the other hand, there is a need to set up sound epidemiological
studies to investigate potential health effects, both acute and
chronic. In the Chernobyl case, the lack of routinely collected
data, such as cancer registry data that are reliable enough, led
to difficulty in organising appropriate epidemiological investigations
in timely manner. There appears to be a need for developing and
maintaining a routine health surveillance system within and around
nuclear facilities.
<P>
<B>In summary, besides providing new impetus to nuclear safety
research, especially on the management of severe nuclear accidents,
the Chernobyl accident stimulated national authorities and experts
to a radical review of their understanding of, and attitude to
radiation protection and nuclear emergency issues.</B>
<P>
<B>This led to expand knowledge on radiation effects and their
treatment and to revitalise radioecological research and monitoring
programmes. emergency procedures, and criteria and methods for
the information of the public.</B>
<P>
<B>Moreover, a substantial role in these improvements was played
by multiple international co-operation initiatives, including
revision and rationalisation of radiation protection criteria
for the management of accident consequences, as well as reinforcement
or creation of international communication and assistance mechanisms
to cope with the transboundary implications of potential nuclear

<B>THE SITE AND ACCIDENT SEQUENCE </B>
</center>
<P>
<B>The Site</B>
<P>
 At the time of the Chernobyl accident, on 26 April 1986, the
Soviet Nuclear Power Programme was based mainly upon two types
of reactors, the WWER, a pressurised light-water reactor, and
the RBMK, a graphite moderated light-water reactor. While the
WWER type of reactor was exported to other countries, the RBMK
design was restricted to republics within the Soviet Union. 
<P>
The Chernobyl Power Complex, lying about 130 km north of Kiev,
Ukraine (Figure 1), consisted of four nuclear reactors of the
RBMK-1000 design, Units 1 and 2 being constructed between 1970
and 1977, while Units 3 and 4 of the same design were completed
in 1983 (<I>IA86</I>). Two more RBMK reactors were under construction
at the site at the time of the accident.

</center>
<p><br><p><br>

To the South-east of the plant, an artificial lake of some 22
km2, situated beside the river Pripyat, a tributary of the Dniepr,
was constructed to provide cooling water for the reactors. 
<P>
This area of Ukraine is described as Belarussian-type woodland
with a low population density. About 3 km away from the reactor,
in Pripyat, there were 49,000 inhabitants. The town of Chernobyl,
which had a population of 12,500, is about 15 km to the South-east
of the complex. Within a 30-km radius of the power plant, the
total population was between 115,000 and 135,000. 
<P>
<B>The RBMK-1000 reactor</B>
<P>
The RBMK-1000 (Figure 2) is a Soviet designed and built graphite
moderated pressure tube type reactor, using slightly enriched
(2 per cent uranium-235) uranium dioxide fuel. It is a boiling
light water reactor, with<BR>

direct steam feed to the turbines, without an intervening heat-exchanger.
Water pumped to the bottom of the fuel channels boils as it progresses
up the pressure tubes, producing steam which feeds two 500-MW(e)
[megawatt electrical] turbines. The water acts as a coolant and
also provides the steam used to drive the turbines. The vertical
pressure tubes contain the zirconium-alloy clad uranium-dioxide
fuel around which the cooling water flows. A specially designed
refuelling machine allows fuel bundles to be changed without shutting
down the reactor. 
<P>
The moderator, whose function is to slow down neutrons to make
them more efficient in producing fission in the fuel, is constructed
of graphite. A mixture of nitrogen and helium is circulated between
the graphite blocks largely to prevent oxidation of the graphite
and to improve the transmission of the heat produced by neutron
interactions in the graphite, from the moderator to the fuel channel.
The core itself is about 7 m high and about 12 m in diameter.
There are four main coolant circulating pumps, one of which is
always on standby. The reactivity or power of the reactor is controlled
by raising or lowering 211 control rods, which, when lowered,
absorb neutrons and reduce the fission rate. The power output
of this reactor is 3,200 MW(t) [megawatt thermal] or 1,000 MW(e),
although there is a larger version producing 1,500 MW(e). Various
safety systems, such as an emergency core cooling system and the
requirement for an absolute minimal insertion of 30 control rods,
were incorporated into the reactor design and operation. 
<P>
The most important characteristic of the RBMK reactor is that
it possesses a &quot;positive void coefficient&quot;. This means
that if the power increases or the flow of water decreases, there
is increased steam production in the fuel channels, so that the
neutrons that would have been absorbed by the denser water will
now produce increased fission in the fuel. However, as the power
increases, so does the temperature of the fuel, and this has the
effect of reducing the neutron flux (negative fuel coefficient).
The net effect of these two opposing characteristics varies with
the power level. At the high power level of normal operation,
the temperature effect predominates, so that power excursions
leading to excessive overheating of the fuel do not occur. However,
at a lower power output of less than 20 per cent of the maximum,
the positive void coefficient effect is dominant and the reactor
becomes unstable and prone to sudden power surges. This was a
major factor in the development of the accident. 
<P>
<B>Events leading to the accident (<I>IA86, IA86a</I>)</B>
<P>
The Unit 4 reactor was to be shutdown for routine maintenance
on 25 April 1986. It was decided to take advantage of this shutdown
to determine whether, in the event of a loss of station power,
the slowing turbine could provide enough electrical power to operate
the emergency equipment and the core cooling water circulating
pumps, until the diesel emergency power supply became operative.
The aim of this test was to determine whether cooling of the core
could continue to be ensured in the event of a loss of power.
<P>
This type of test had been run during a previous shut-down period,
but the results had been inconclusive, so it was decided to repeat
it. Unfortunately, this test, which was considered essentially
to concern the non-nuclear part of the power plant, was carried
out without a proper exchange of information and co-ordination
between the team in charge of the test and the personnel in charge
of the operation and safety of the nuclear reactor. Therefore,
inadequate safety precautions were included in the test programme
and the operating personnel were not alerted to the nuclear safety
implications of the electrical test and its potential danger.

<P>
The planned programme called for shutting off the reactor's emergency
core cooling system (ECCS), which provides water for cooling the
core in an emergency. Although subsequent events were not greatly
affected by this, the exclusion of this system for the whole duration
of the test reflected a lax attitude towards the implementation
of safety procedures.
<P>
As the shutdown proceeded, the reactor was operating at about
half power when the electrical load dispatcher refused to allow
further shutdown, as the power was needed for the grid. In accordance
with the planned test programme, about an hour later the ECCS
was switched off while the reactor continued to operate at half
power. It was not until about 23:00 hr on 25 April that the grid
controller agreed to a further reduction in power. 
<P>
For this test, the reactor should have been stabilised at about
1,000 MW(t) prior to shut down, but due to operational error the
power fell to about 30 MW(t), where the positive void coefficient
became dominant. The operators then tried to raise the power to
700-1,000 MW(t) by switching off the automatic regulators and
freeing all the control rods manually. It was only at about 01:00
hr on 26 April that the reactor was stabilised at about 200 MW(t).
<P>
Although there was a standard operating order that a minimum of
<BR>
30 control rods was necessary to retain reactor control, in the
test only 6-8 control rods were actually used. Many of the control
rods were withdrawn to compensate for the build up of xenon which
acted as an absorber of neutrons and reduced power. This meant
that if there were a power surge, about <BR>
20 seconds would be required to lower the control rods and shut
the reactor down. In spite of this, it was decided to continue
the test programme. 
<P>
There was an increase in coolant flow and a resulting drop in
steam pressure. The automatic trip which would have shut down
the reactor when the steam pressure was low, had been circumvented.
In order to maintain power the operators had to withdraw nearly
all the remaining control rods. The reactor became very unstable
and the operators had to make adjustments every few seconds trying
to maintain constant power.
<P>
At about this time, the operators reduced the flow of feedwater,
presumably to maintain the steam pressure. Simultaneously, the
pumps that were powered by the slowing turbine were providing
less cooling water to the reactor. The loss of cooling water exaggerated
the unstable condition of the reactor by increasing steam production
in the cooling channels (positive void coefficient), and the operators
could not prevent an overwhelming power surge, estimated to be
<BR>
100 times the nominal power output.
<P>
The sudden increase in heat production ruptured part of the fuel
and small hot fuel particles, reacting with water, caused a steam
explosion, which destroyed the reactor core. A second explosion
added to the destruction two to three seconds later. While it
is not known for certain what caused the explosions, it is postulated
that the first was a steam/hot fuel explosion, and that hydrogen
may have played a role in the second.
<P>
<B>The accident</B>
<P>
The accident occurred at 01:23 hr on Saturday, 26 April 1986,
when the two explosions destroyed the core of Unit 4 and the roof
of the reactor building. 
<P>
In the IAEA Post-Accident Assessment Meeting in August 1986 <I>(IA86)</I>,
much was made of the operators' responsibility for the accident,
and not much emphasis was placed on the design faults of the reactor.
Later assessments <I>(IA86a)</I> suggest that the event was due
to a combination of the two, with a little more emphasis on the
design deficiencies and a little less on the operator actions.
<P>
The two explosions sent a shower of hot and highly radioactive
debris and graphite into the air and exposed the destroyed core
to the atmosphere. The plume of smoke, radioactive fission products
and debris from the core and the building rose up to about 1 km
into the air. The heavier debris in the plume was deposited close
to the site, but lighter components, including fission products
and virtually all of the noble gas inventory were blown by the
prevailing wind to the North-west of the plant. 
<P>
 Fires started in what remained of the Unit 4 building, giving
rise to clouds of steam and dust, and fires also broke out on
the adjacent turbine hall roof and in various stores of diesel
fuel and inflammable materials. Over 100 fire-fighters from the
site and called in from Pripyat were needed, and it was this group
that received the highest radiation exposures and suffered the
greatest losses in personnel. These fires were put out by 05:00
hr of the same day, but by then the graphite fire had started.
Many firemen added to their considerable doses by staying on call
on site. The intense graphite fire was responsible for the dispersion
of radionuclides and fission fragments high into the atmosphere.
The emissions continued for about twenty days , but were much
lower after the tenth day when the graphite fire was finally extinguished.

<P>
<B>The graphite fire</B>
<P>
While the conventional fires at the site posed no special firefighting
problems, very high radiation doses were incurred by the firemen.
However, the graphite moderator fire was a special problem. Very
little national or international expertise on fighting graphite
fires existed, and there was a very real fear that any attempt
to put it out might well result in further dispersion of radionuclides,
perhaps by steam production, or it might even provoke a criticality
excursion in the nuclear fuel.
<P>
A decision was made to layer the graphite fire with large amounts
of different materials, each one designed to combat a different
feature of the fire and the radioactive release. Boron carbide
was dumped in large quantities from helicopters to act as a neutron
absorber and prevent any renewed chain reaction. Dolomite was
also added to act as heat sink and a source of carbon dioxide
to smother the fire. Lead was included as a radiation absorber,
as well as sand and clay which it was hoped would prevent the
release of particulates. While it was later discovered that many
of these compounds were not actually dropped on the target, they
may have acted as thermal insulators and precipitated an increase
in the temperature of the damaged core leading to a further release
of radionuclides a week later.
<P>
By May 9, the graphite fire had been extinguished, and work began
on a massive reinforced concrete slab with a built-in cooling
system beneath the reactor. This involved digging a tunnel from
underneath Unit 3. About four hundred people worked on this tunnel
which was completed in 15 days, allowing the installation of the
concrete slab. This slab would not only be of use to cool the
core if necessary, it would also act as a barrier to prevent penetration
of melted radioactive material into the groundwater.
<P>
<B> In summary, the Chernobyl accident was the product of a lack
of &quot;safety culture&quot;. The reactor design was poor from
the point of view of safety and unforgiving for the operators,
both of which provoked a dangerous operating state. The operators
were not informed of this and were not aware that the test performed
could have brought the reactor into explosive conditions. In addition,
they did not comply with established operational procedures. The
combination of these factors provoked a nuclear accident of maximum
severity in which the reactor was totally destroyed within a few
seconds.</B>

<UL><H2>Acid rain:</H2></UL>

<H2>Direct effects of SO2 and NOx</h2>
<UL>SO2 and NOx  have adverse effects on human health. Investigations show that the  effects may reduce the function of the lungs in astmathics, increase the resistance of the respiratory passages ( healthy and astmathics) and increase the receptiveness for  infection of the respiratory passages.
Population groups in heavily affected areas have a larger number of acute- and chronic respiratory diseases.<P>

SO2 and NOx have adverse effects on vegetation. Heavy concentrations of NOx has proven to inhibit vegetation growth, especially when ozone is present. (Synergistic effects)<P>

SO inhibits photosynthesis in green plants, leading to reduced plant growth.                 <P>

</UL><UL>


</UL><H2>The chemistry of acid  in the soil. Indirect effects.</H2><UL>
The effects of acid rain are substantial. However, soil and water have a natural buffer capacity. This means that nature has a natural ability to cope with acid rain up to a certain level: the critical load.<P>                        
The problems are most severe where the soil contains only a small amount of Calcium, Potassium and Magnesium. These elements constitute the basic buffer capacity of the soil. When the critical load has been exceeded, the metal cations and other plant nutrients are washed out. This explains why there is often a significant amount of aluminium in water coming from areas damaged by acid precipitation.             <P>  The acid  in acid rain is due to Hydrogen ions (H+). The buffer capacity of soil implicates that the soil absorbs the H+ ions, while other positive ions are liberated. In other words; the H+ ions replace the other ions bound in the soil structure. (Colloids)
The problem become apparent  when there are more H+ ions absorbed  than can be neutralised.
The positive ions washed out by H+ ions are called cations. The most common cations are: Calsium (Ca++), Magnesium (Mg++), Potassium (K+), Aluminium (Al+++), Manganese (Mn++) and Ammonium (NH4+).<P>



How long it would take for an ecosystem to regain its normal chemical and biological status if emissions were to cease is uncertain. The chemistry of the soil and its capacity for recovery will be decisive. The soils store of base cations would gradually be built up through the inflow from weathering and from the atmosphere: a process that may be assumed to need several decades, in some cases centuries.<P>   </UL>

</UL><H2>Effects of the washing out of metal ions</H2><UL>
<LI><B>Aluminium</B><BR>
The washing out of metal ions has lead to damages of forests, lakes, watercourses and fish. Sources for potable water may become poisoned by high concentrations of copper, lead and aluminium. Aluminium causes the most severe problems to the water in Southern Norway.<P>

<LI><B>Death of fish</B><BR>
Death of fish is the best known effect of acidification, and is therefore a reliable and frequently used indicator. There are two reasons for the death of fish. When the acidification reaches a certain level, the fry die. Different species of fish have different tolerance levels to  acidic water. The most sensitive species are trout and salmon. The presence of aluminium in the water is another common cause of fish death. Aluminium is toxic to fish, because it prevents a fish from absorbing salts and destroys the gills. Aluminium is the major cause of fish death in the southern part of Norway.<P>

From 1960 to 1990, areas with damages to fish stock were quintupled. Of the 13 000 investigated stocks of fish in the Southern part of Norway during this period, 19 per cent were lost, while a reduction in the number of fish was registered in 21 per cent of the stocks.<P>

<LI><B>Damage to vegetation</B><BR>
Damage to vegetation and the dying of forests have long been associated with acid rain. The washing out of metal ions results in limited plant nutrients. (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Magnesium etc)
In many cases, a plants ability  to absorb these nutrients depends on the level of acidification in the soil. Vegetation exposed to acid rain will therefore absorb less of these essential nutrients. The result is poorer quality of a plants proteins, stunted growth and exposure to diseases. <P>

Green plants are the foundation of the food chain, and a reduction in plant production will have consequences higher up in the food chain. Animals and human beings may experience less valuable nutrition.  <P>

Compared to other countries, the situation in Norway is better than  in Central Europe. In e.g.  the Czech Republic, 71 per cent of the forest has been damaged due to acid rain. The situation is also severe where the supply of potable water is concerned.

<B>POTENTIAL RESIDUAL RISKS   </B>
</center>
<P>
<B>The Sarcophagus</B>
<P>
In the aftermath of the accident several designs to encase the
damaged reactor were examined (<I>Ku95</I>). The option which
was chosen provided for the construction of a massive structure
in concrete and steel that used as a support what remained of
the walls of the reactor building (<I>Ku95</I>).
<P>
By August 1986 special sensors monitoring gamma radiation and
other parameters were installed in various points by using cranes
and helicopters. These sensors had primarily the function of assessing
the radiation exposure in the areas where the work for the construction
was to be carried out.
<P>
An outer protective wall was then erected around the perimeter
and other walls in the turbine building, connected to the reactor
Unit 3 building through an intermediate building, the so-called
&quot;V&quot; building, and a steel roof completed the structure.
The destroyed reactor was thus entombed in a 300,000-tonne concrete
and steel structure known as the &quot;Envelope&quot; or &quot;Sarcophagus&quot;.
This mammoth task was completed in only seven months, in November
1986.
<P>
Multiple sensors were placed to monitor such parameters as gamma
radiation and neutron flux, temperature, heat flux, as well as
the concentrations of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and water vapour
in air. Other sensors monitor the mechanical stability of the
structure and the fuel mass so that any vibration or shifts of
major components can be detected. All these sensors are under
computer control. Systems designed to mitigate any changing adverse
conditions have also been put into place. These include the injection
of chemicals to prevent nuclear criticality excursions in the
fuel and pumping to remove excess water leaking into the Sarcophagus
(<I>To95</I>).
<P>
An enormous effort was required to mount the clean-up operation;
decontaminating ground and buildings, enclosing the damaged reactor
and building the Sarcophagus was a formidable task, and it is
impressive that so much was achieved so quickly. At that time
the emphasis was placed on confinement as rapidly as possible.
Consequently, a structure which would effectively be permanent
was not built and the Sarcophagus should rather be seen as a provisional
barrier pending the definition of a more radical solution for
the elimination of the destroyed reactor and the safe disposal
of highly radioactive materials. In these conditions, to maintain
the existing structure for the next several decades poses very
significant engineering problems. Consultations and studies by
an international consortium are currently taking place to provide
a permanent solution to this problem.
<P>
The fuel in the damaged reactor exists in three forms, (a) as
pellets of 2 per cent enriched uranium dioxide plus some fission
products essentially unchanged from the original forms in the
fuel rods, (b) as hot particles of uranium dioxide a few tens
of microns in diameter or smaller particles of a few microns,
made of fuel fused with the metal cladding of the fuel rods, and
(c) as three extensive lava-like flows of fuel mixed with sand
or concrete. The amount of dispersed fuel in the form of dust
is estimated to amount to several tons (<I>Gl95</I>).
<P>
The molten fuel mixture has solidified into a glass-like material
containing former fuel. The estimates of the quantity of this
fuel are very uncertain. It is this vitrified material that is
largely responsible for the very high dose rates in some areas
(<I>Se95a</I>). Inside the reactor envelope, external exposure
is largely from caesium-137, but the inhalation of fuel dust is
also a hazard. As was noted earlier, a small special group of
scientists who have worked periodically inside the Sarcophagus
for a number of years have accumulated doses in the estimated
range of 0.5 to 13 Gy (<I>Se95a</I>). Due to the fact that these
doses were fractionated over a long time period, no deterministic
effects have been noted in these scientists. Since the beginning
of 1987 the intensity of the gamma radiation inside the structure
fell by a factor 10. The temperature also fell significantly.
Outside the Sarcophagus, the radiation levels are not high, except
for the roof where dose rates up to 0.5 Gy/h have been measured
after the construction of the Sarcophagus. These radiation levels
on the roof have now decreased to less than 0.05 Gy/h.
<P>
Nine years after its erection, the Sarcophagus structure, although
still generally sound, raises concerns for its stability and long-term
resistance and represents a standing potential risk. Some supports
for the enclosure are the original Unit 4 building structures
which may be in poor condition following the explosions and fire,
and their failure could cause the roof to collapse. This situation
is aggravated by the corrosion of internal metallic structures
due to the high humidity of the Sarcophagus atmosphere provoked
by the penetration of large quantities of rain water through the
numerous cracks which were present on the roof and were only recently
repaired <I>(La95)</I>. The existing structure is not designed
to withstand earthquakes or tornados. The upper concrete biological
shield of the reactor is lodged between walls, and may fall. There
is considerable uncertainty on the condition of the lower floor
slab, which was damaged by the penetration of molten material
during the accident. It this slab failed, it could result in the
destruction of most of the building.
<P>
A number of potential situations have been considered which could
lead to breaches in the Sarcophagus and the release of radionuclides
into the environment. These include the collapse of the roof and
internal structures, a possible criticality event, and the long-term
migration of radionuclides into groundwater.
<P>
Currently, the envelope is not leaktight even if its degree of
confinement has been recently improved. Although the current emissions
into the environment are small, not exceeding 10 Gbq/y for caesium-137
and 0.1 GBq/y for plutonium and other transuranic elements, disturbance
of the current conditions within the Sarcophagus, such as the
dislodgement of the biological shield could result in more significant
dispersion of radionuclides (<I>To95</I>). The dispersion in this
case would not be severe and would be confined to the site provided
that the roof did not collapse. However, collapse of the roof,
perhaps precipitated by an earthquake, a tornado or a plane crash,
combined with collapse of internal unstable structures could lead
to the release of the order of 0.1 PBq of fuel dust, contaminating
part of the 30-km exclusion zone (<I>Be95</I>).
<P>
More improbable worst case scenarios would result in higher contamination
of the exclusion zone, but no significant contamination is expected
beyond that area. Perhaps the situation causing most concern is
the effect that the collapse of the Sarcophagus might have on
the reactor Unit 3, which is still producing power and whose building
is connected to the Sarcophagus through the &quot;V&quot; Building,
which is not very stable.
<P>
Currently, criticality excursions are not thought to be likely
(<I>IP95</I>). Nevertheless, it is possible to theorise (<I>Go95</I>,
<I>Bv95</I>) on hypothetical accident scenarios, however remote,
which could lead to a criticality event. One such scenario would
involve a plane crash or earthquake with collapse of the Sarcophagus,
combined with flooding. An accident of this type could release
about 0.4 PBq of old fuel dust and new fission products to the
atmosphere to contaminate the ground mainly in the 30-km zone.
<P>
Leakage from the Sarcophagus can also be a mechanism by which
radionuclides are released into the environment. There are currently
over 3,000 m3 of water in various rooms in the Sarcophagus (<I>To95</I>).
Most of this has entered through defects in the roof. Its activity,
mainly caesium-137, ranges from 0.4 to 40 MBq/L. Studies on the
fuel containing masses indicate that they are not inert and are
changing in various ways. These changes include the pulverisation
of fuel particles, the surface breakdown of the lava-like material,
the formation of new uranium compounds, some of which are soluble
on the surface, and the leaching of radionuclides from the fuel
containing masses. Studies to date indicate that this migration
may become more significant as time passes.
<P>
Another possible mechanism of dispersion of radioactivity into
the environment may be the transport of contamination by animals,
particularly birds and insects, which penetrate and dwell in the
Sarcophagus (<I>Pu92</I>). Finally, the possibility of leaching
of radionuclides from the fuel masses by the water in the enclosure
and their migration into the groundwater has been considered.
This phenomenon, however, is expected to be very slow and it has
been estimated that, for example, it will take 45 to 90 years
for certain radionuclides, such as strontium-90, to migrate undergound
up to the Pripyat river catchment area. The expected radiological
significance of this phenomenon is not known with certainty and
a careful monitoring of the evolving situation of the groundwater
will need to be carried out for a long time.
<P>
<B>Radioactive waste storage sites</B>
<P>
 The accident recovery and clean-up operations have resulted in
the production of very large quantities of radioactive wastes
and contaminated equipment. Some of these radioactive wastes are
buried in trenches or in containers isolated from the groundwater
by clay or concrete screens within the 30-km zone (<I>Vo95</I>).
A review of these engineered sites concluded that, provided the
clay layer remained intact, their contribution to groundwater
contamination would be negligible. On the other hand, 600 to 800
waste trenches were hastily dug in the immediate vicinity of the
Unit 4 in the aftermath of the accident. These unlined trenches
contain the radioactive fallout that had accumulated on trees,
grass, and in the ground to a depth of 10-15 cm and which was
bulldozed from over an area of roughly 8 km2. The estimated activity
amount is now of the order of 1 PBq, which is comparable to the
total inventory stored in specially constructed facilities next
to Unit 4. Moreover, a large number of contaminated equipment,
engines and vehicles are also stored in the open air.
<P>
The original clean-up activities are poorly documented, and much
of the information on the present status of the unlined trenches
near Unit 4 and the spread of radioelements has been obtained
in a one-time survey. Some of the findings of the study (<I>Dz95</I>)
are that:
<UL>
<p><LI>the water table in the vicinity of Unit 4 has risen by 1 to
1.5 m in a few years to about 4 m from the ground level and may
still be rising (apparently this is due mostly to the construction,
in 1986, of a wall 3,5 km long and 35 m deep around the reactor
to protect the Kiev reservoir from possible spread of contamination
through the underground water, as well as to the ceasing of drainage
activities formerly connected with the construction of new units
on the site).
<p><LI>in the most targeted study area 32 of 43 explored trenches
are periodically or continually flooded; 
<p><LI>in that area the upper unconfined aquifer is contaminated
everywhere with strontium-90 to levels exceeding 4 Bq/L. Caesium
and plutonium are less mobile and contamination from these elements
is confined to the immediate vicinity of the disposal trenches;

<p><LI>the relative mobility of the strontium-90 is especially important
in that, from the closest trenches, it might reach the Pripyat
River in 10 to 20 years;
</UL>

<P>
It is clear that large uncertainties remain which require a correspondingly
large characterisation effort. For instance, at present, most
disposal sites are unexplored, and a few are uncharted; monitoring
for groundwater movement is insufficient and the interpretation
of the hydrologic regime is complicated by artificial factors
(pumping, mitigative measures, etc.); the mechanisms of radionuclide
leaching from the variety of small buried particles are not well
understood.
<P>
The problem of the potential spread of radioelements to the Pripyat
river is especially important in that the latter may act as a
shortcut for the dispersion of additional radioactive elements
outside the 30-km exclusion zone.
<P>
<B>In summary, the sarcophagus was never intended to be a permanent
solution to entomb the stricken reactor. The result is that this
temporary solution may well be unstable in the long term. This
means that there is the potential for collapse which needs to
be corrected by a permanent technical solution. </B>
<P>
<B>The accident recovery and clean-up operations have also resulted
in the production of very large quantities of radioactive wastes
and contaminated equipment which are currently stored in about
800 sites within and outside the 30-km exclusion zone around the
reactor. These wastes are partly conserved in containers and partly
buried in trenches or stored in the open air.</B>
<P>
<B>In general, it has been assessed that the Sarcophagus and the
proliferation of waste storage sites in the area constitute a
series of potential sources of release of radioactivity that threatens
the surrounding area. However, any accidental releases from the
sarcophagus are expected to be very small in comparison with those
from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and their radiological consequences
would be limited to a relatively small area around the site. On
the other hand, concerns have been expressed by some experts that
a more important release might occur if the collapse of the Sarcophagus
should induce damage in the Unit 3 of the Chernobyl power plant.</B>
<P>
<B>As far as the radioactive wastes stored in the area around
the site are concerned, they are a potential source of contamination
of the groundwater which will require close monitoring until a
safe disposal into an appropriate repository is implemented.</B>
<P>
<B>Initiatives have been taken internationally, and are currently
underway, to study a technical solution leading to the elimination
of these sources of residual risk on the site.</B>

<B>REACTIONS OF NATIONAL AUTHORITIES</B>
</center>
<P>
 The scale and severity of the Chernobyl accident with its widespread
radioactive contamination had not been foreseen and took by surprise
most national authorities responsible for emergency preparedness.
No provisions had been made for an accident of such scale and,
though some radiation protection authorities had made criteria
available for intervention in an accident, these were often incomplete
and provided little practical help in the circumstances, so that
very few workable national guidelines or principles were actually
in place. Those responsible for making national decisions were
suddenly faced with an accident for which there were no precedents
upon which to base their decisions. In addition, early in the
course of the accident there was little information available,
and considerable political pressure, partially based on the public
perception of the radiation danger, was being exerted on the decision-makers.
In these circumstances, cautious immediate action was felt necessary,
and measures were introduced that tended to err, sometimes excessively
so, on the side of prudence rather than being driven by informed
scientific and expert judgement.
<P>
<B>Within the former Soviet Union</B>
<P>
The town of Pripyat was not severely contaminated by the initial
release of radionuclides, but, once the graphite fire started,
it soon became obvious that contamination would make the town
uninhabitable. Late on 26 April it was decided to evacuate the
town, and arrangements for transport and accommodation of the
evacuees were made. The announcement of evacuation was made at
11:00 hr the following day. Evacuation began at 14:00 hr, and
Pripyat was evacuated in about two and one half hours. As measurements
disclosed the extensive pattern of deposition of radionuclides,
and it was possible to make dose assessments, the remainder of
the people in a 30-km zone around the reactor complex were gradually
evacuated, bringing the total evacuees to about 135,000.
<P>
Other countermeasures to reduce dose were widely adopted (<I>Ko90</I>).
Decontamination procedures performed by military personnel included
the washing of buildings, cleaning residential areas, removing
contaminated soil, cleaning roads and decontaminating water supplies.
Special attention was paid to schools, hospitals and other buildings
used by large numbers of people. Streets were watered in towns
to suppress dust. However, the effectiveness of these countermeasures
outside the 30-km zone was small. An attempt to reduce thyroid
doses by the administration of stable iodine to block radioactive
uptake by the thyroid was made (<I>Me92</I>), but its success
was doubtful. 
<P>
The Soviet National Committee on Radiation Protection (NCRP) proposed
a 350-mSv lifetime dose intervention level for the relocation
of population groups (<I>Il87</I>). This value was lower by a
factor of 2 to 3 than that recommended by the International Commission
on Radiological Protection (ICRP) for the same countermeasure.
Nevertheless, this value proposed by the NCRP was strongly criticised
as being a very high level. The situation was further complicated
by the political and social tension in the Soviet Union at that
time. As a result, the NCRP proposal was not adopted by the Supreme
Soviet. Later, a special Commission was established which developed
new recommendations for intervention levels. These recommendations
were based on the levels of ground contamination by the radionuclides
caesium-137, strontium-90 and plutonium239. As has been mentioned
above, large areas were contaminated mainly by caesium-137 and
a ground contamination level by this radionuclide of 1,480 kBq/m2
was used as the intervention criterion for permanent resettlement
of population, and of 555 to 1,480 kBq/m2 for temporary relocation.
<P>
 People who continued to live in the heavily contaminated areas
were given compensation and offered annual medical examinations
by the government. Residents of less contaminated areas are provided
with medical monitoring.  Current decisions on medical actions
are based on annual doses. Compensation is provided for residents
whose annual dose is greater than 1mSv. The use of locally produced
milk and mushrooms is restricted in some of these areas. Relocation
is considered in Russia for annual doses above 5 mSv. 
<P>
As is mentioned in the section on psychological effects, in Chapter
V, the Soviet authorities did not foresee that their attempts
to compensate those affected by the accident would be misinterpreted
by the recipients and increase their stress, and that the label
of &quot;radiophobia&quot; attributed to these phenomena was not
only incorrect, but was one that alienated the public even more.
Some of these initial approaches have been recognised as being
inappropriate and the authorities are endeavouring to rectify
their attitude to the exposed population.
<P>
<B>Outside the former Soviet Union</B>
<P>
The progressive spread of contamination at large distances from
the accident site has caused considerable concern in Member countries,
and the reactions of national authorities to this situation have
been extremely varied, ranging from a simple intensification of
the normal environmental monitoring programmes, without adoption
of any specific countermeasures, to compulsory restrictions concerning
the marketing and consumption of foodstuffs. This variety of responses
has been accompanied by significant differences in the timing
and duration of the countermeasures.
<P>
In general, the most widespread countermeasures were those which
were not expected to impose, in the short time for which they
were in effect, a significant burden on lifestyles or the economy.
These included advice to wash fresh vegetables and fruit before
consumption, advice not to use rainwater for drinking or cooking,
and programmes of monitoring citizens returning from potentially
contaminated areas. In reality, experience has shown that even
these types of measures had, in some cases, a negative impact
which was not insignificant.
<P>
Protective actions having a more significant impact on dietary
habits and imposing a relatively important economic and regulatory
burden included restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing
and consumption of milk, dairy products, fresh leafy vegetables
and some types of meat, as well as the control of the outdoor
grazing of dairy cattle. In some areas, prohibitions were placed
on travel to areas affected by the accident and on the import
of foodstuffs from the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.
In most Member countries, restrictions were imposed on the import
of foodstuffs from Member as well as non-Member countries.
<P>
The range of these reactions can be explained primarily by the
diversity of local situations both in terms of uneven levels of
contamination and in terms of national differences in administrative,
regulatory and public health systems. However, one of the principal
reasons for the variety of situations observed in Member countries
stems from the criteria adopted for the choice and application
of intervention levels for the implementation of protective actions.
In this respect, while the general radiation protection principles
underlying the actions taken in most Member countries following
the accident have been very similar, discrepancies arose in the
assessment of the situation and the adoption and application of
operational protection criteria. These discrepancies were further
enhanced by the overwhelming role played in many cases by non-radiological
factors, such as socio-economic, political and psychological,
in determining the countermeasures.
<P>
This situation caused concern and confusion among the public,
perplexities among the experts and difficulties to national authorities,
especially in maintaining their public credibility. This was,
therefore, identified as an area where several lessons should
be learned from the accident and efforts directed towards better
international harmonisation of the scientific bases and co-ordination
of concepts and measures for the protection of the public in case
of emergency.
<P>
Nowhere was this problem better illustrated than by the way that
contaminated food was handled. In some countries outside the Soviet
Union the main source of exposure to the general population was
the consumption of contaminated food. Mechanisms to handle locally
produced as well as imported contaminated food had to be put in
place within a few weeks of the accident. National authorities
were in an unenviable position. They had to act quickly and cautiously
to introduce measures to protect the &quot;purity&quot; of the
public food supply and, what is more, they had to be seen to be
effective in so doing. This inevitably led to some decisions which
even at the time appeared to be over-reactions and not scientifically
justified. In addition, dissenting opinions among experts added
to the difficulties of the decision-makers. 
<P>
Some countries without nuclear power programmes and whose own
food was not contaminated, argued that they did not need to import
any &quot;tainted&quot; food and refused any food containing any
radionuclides whatsoever. This extreme and impracticable measure
might well have been regarded as an example of how well the authorities
of those countries were protecting the health of their population.
Sometimes this attitude appeared to promote a neighbourly rivalry
between countries to see which could set the more stringent standards
for food contamination, as though, by so doing, their own citizens
were more protected. The result was that often slightly contaminated
food was destroyed or refused importation to avoid only trivial
doses. 
<P>
In 1986, the EC imposed a ban on the importation of food containing
more than 370 Bq/kg of radiocaesium for milk products and 600
Bq/kg for any other food, regardless of the quantity consumed
in the average European diet. Thus, food items with a trivial
consumption (and dose), such as spices, were treated the same
as items of high consumption such as vegetables. However, these
values were later relaxed for some food items in order to remove
inconsistent treatment of food groups.
<P>
In some special circumstances, decisions had to be made based
on the local situation. For example, in some Northern European
communities, reindeer meat is a major component of the diet; due
to the ecological circumstances, these animals tend to concentrate
radiocaesium, which will then expose the populations which depend
on them. Special countermeasures, such as pasturing reindeer in
areas of lower contamination, were introduced in some countries
to avoid this exposure. 
<P>
The variety of solutions led to confusion and made any international
consensus on Derived Intervention Levels for food extremely difficult
to achieve, and it was only with the WHO/FAO <I>Codex Alimentarius</I>
Meeting in Geneva in 1989 that any agreement was reached on guideline
values for the radioactivity of food moving in international trade (Table 2).
<P><br>

<p><br>

It should be remembered that these guideline values were developed
to facilitate international trade in food, and should be regarded
as levels &quot;below regulatory concern&quot;. Levels above these
do not necessarily constitute a health hazard, and if found, the
competent national authority should review what action should
be taken. 
<P>
Often the national authorities were not able accurately to predict
the public response to some of their advice and pronouncements.
For example, in some European countries, soon after the accident
the public were advised to wash leafy vegetables. The national
authority felt that this was innocuous advice as most people washed
their vegetables anyway, and they were unprepared for the public
response which was to stop buying these vegetables. This resulted
in significant economic loss to local producers which far outweighed
any potential benefit in terms of radiological health.
<P>
In some countries, the public was told that the risks were very
small but, at the same time, were given advice on how to reduce
these low risks. It was very difficult to explain this apparently
contradictory advice, and the national authority came under criticism
from the media (<I>Sj87</I>). Outside the Soviet Union, the initial
confusion led to inconsistent and precipitate actions which, although
understandable, were sometimes ill-advised and unjustified. 
<P>
However, it should be emphasised that great progress has been
made since this early confusion. As a result of the actions of
the international organisations to harmonise intervention criteria
and the willingness of countries to cooperate in this endeavour,
a firm groundwork for uniform criteria based on accepted radiation
protection principles has been established, so that relative consistency
can hopefully be expected in their implementation in the event
of a possible future nuclear accident.
<P>
<B>In summary, the Chernobyl accident took authorities by surprise
as regards extent, duration and contamination at long distance.
As no guidelines were available for such an accident, little information
was available and great political and public pressure to do something
were experienced, overprecautious decisions were often taken in
and outside the Soviet Union. The psychological impact of some
official decisions on the public were not predicted and variable
interpretations or even misinterpretations of ICRP recommendations,
especially for intervention levels for food, led to inconsistent
decisions and advice. These added to public confusion and provoked
mistrust and unnecessary economic losses. However, there were
exceptions and very soon international efforts started to harmonise
criteria and approaches to emergency management.</B>

<center><h1><I>Chapter VI</I></h1>

<B>AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS</B>
</center>
<P>
<B>Agricultural impact</B>
<P>
All soil used anywhere for agriculture contains radionuclides
to a greater or lesser extent. Typical soils (<I>IA89a</I>) contain
approximately 300 kBq/m3 of potassium-40 to a depth of 20 cm.
This radionuclide and others are then taken up by crops and transferred
to food, leading to a concentration in food and feed of between
50 and 150 Bq/kg. The ingestion of radionuclides in food is one
of the pathways leading to internal retention and contributes
to human exposure from natural and man-made sources. Excessive
contamination of agricultural land, such as may occur in a severe
accident, can lead to unacceptable levels of radionuclides in
food.
<P>
The radionuclide contaminants of most significance in agriculture
are those which are relatively highly taken up by crops, have
high rates of transfer to animal products such as milk and meat,
and have relatively long radiological half-lives. However, the
ecological pathways leading to crop contamination and the radioecological
behaviour of the radionuclides are complex and are affected not
only by the physical and chemical properties of the radionuclides
but also by factors which include soil type, cropping system (including
tillage),climate, season and, where relevant, biological half-life
within animals. The major radionuclides of concern in agriculture
following a large reactor accident are iodine-131, caesium-137,
caesium-134 and strontium-90 (<I>IA89a</I>). Direct deposition
on plants is the major source of contamination of agricultural
produce in temperate regions.
<P>
While the caesium isotopes and strontium-90 are relatively immobile
in soil, uptake of roots is of less importance compared with plant
deposition. However, soil type (particularly with regard to clay
mineral composition and organic matter content), tillage practice
and climate all affect propensity to move to groundwater. The
same factors affect availability to plants insofar as they control
concentrations in soil solution. In addition, because caesium
and strontium are taken up by plants by the same mechanism as
potassium and calcium respectively, the extent of their uptake
depends on the availability of these elements. Thus, high levels
of potassium fertilisation can reduce caesium uptake and liming
can reduce strontium uptake.      
<P>
<I><B>Within the former Soviet Union</B></I>
<P>
The releases during the Chernobyl accident contaminated about
125,000 km2 of land in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia with radiocaesium
levels greater than 37 kBq/m2, and about 30,000 km2 with radiostrontium
greater than 10 kBq/m2. About 52,000 km2 of this total were in
agricultural use; the remainder was forest, water bodies and urban
centres (<I>Ri95</I>). While the migration downwards of caesium
in the soil is generally slow (<I>Bo93</I>), especially in forests
and peaty soil, it is extremely variable depending on many factors
such as the soil type, pH, rainfall and agricultural tilling.
The radionuclides are generally confined to particles with a matrix
of uranium dioxide, graphite, iron-ceramic alloys, silicate-rare
earth, and silicate combinations of these materials. The movement
of these radionuclides in the soil not only depends on the soil
characteristics but also on the chemical breakdown of these complexes
by oxidation to release more mobile forms. The bulk of the fission
products is distributed between organomineral and mineral parts
of the soil largely in humic complexes. The 30-km exclusion zone
has improved significantly partly due to natural processes and
partly due to decontamination measures introduced. 
<P>
There were also large variations in the deposition levels. During
1991 the caesium-137 activity concentrations in the 0-5 cm soil
layer ranged from 25 to 1,000 kBq/m3 and were higher in natural
than ploughed pastures. For all soils, between 60 and 95 per cent
of all caesium-137 was found to be strongly bound to soil components
(<I>Sa94</I>). Ordinary ploughing disperses the radionuclides
more evenly through the soil profile, reducing the activity concentration
in the 0-5 cm layer and crop root uptake. However, it does spread
the contamination throughout the soil, and the removal and disposal
of the uppermost topsoil may well be a viable decontamination
strategy.
<P>
The problem in the early phase of an accident is that the countermeasures
designed to avoid human exposure are of a restrictive nature and
often have to be imposed immediately, even before the levels of
contamination are actually measured and known. These measures
include the cessation of field work, of the consumption of fresh
vegetables, of the pasturing of animals and poultry, and also
the introduction of uncontaminated forage. Unfortunately, these
measures were not introduced immediately and enhanced the doses
to humans in Ukraine <I>(Pr95). </I>
<P>
Furthermore, some initial extreme measures were introduced in
the first few days of the accident when 15,000 cows were slaughtered
in Ukraine irrespective of their level of contamination, when
the introduction of clean fodder could have minimised the incorporation
of radiocaesium. Other countermeasures, such as the use of potassium
fertilisers, decreased the uptake of radiocaesium by a factor
of 2 to 14, as well as increased crop yield.
<P>
In some podzolic soils, lime in combination with manure and mineral
fertilisers can reduce the accumulation of radiocaesium in some
cereals and legumes by a factor of thirty. In peaty soils, sand
and clay application can reduce the transfer of radiocaesium to
plants by fixing it more firmly in the soil. The radiocaesium
content of cattle for human consumption can be minimised by a
staged introduction of clean feed during about ten weeks prior
to slaughter. A policy of allocating critical food production
to the least contaminated areas may be an effective common sense
measure. 
<P>
In 1993, the concentration of caesium-137 in the meat of cows
from the Kolkhoz in the Sarny region, where countermeasures could
be implemented effectively, tended to be much lower than that
in the meat from private farms in the Dubritsva region (<I>Pr95</I>).
The meat of wild animals which could not be subjected to the same
countermeasures had a generally high concentration of radiocaesium.
Decontamination of animals by the use of Prussian Blue boli was
found to be very effective where radiocaesium content of feed
is high and where it may be difficult to introduce clean fodder
(<I>Al93</I>). Depending on the local circumstances, many of the
above mentioned agricultural countermeasures were introduced to
reduce human exposure.
<P>
Since July 1986, the dose rate from external irradiation in some
areas has decreased by a factor of forty, and in some places,
it is less than 1 per cent of its original value. Nevertheless,
soil contamination with caesium-137, strontium-90 and plutonium-239
is still high and in Belarus, the most widely contaminated Republic,
eight years after the accident 2,640 km2 of agricultural land
have been excluded from use (<I>Be94</I>). Within a 40-km radius
of the power plant, 2,100 km2 of land in the Poles'e state nature
reserve have been excluded from use for an indefinite duration.

<P>
The uptake of plutonium from soil to plant parts lying above ground
generally constitutes a small health hazard to the population
from the ingestion of vegetables. It only becomes a problem in
areas of high contamination where root vegetables are consumed,
especially if they are not washed and peeled. The total content
of the major radioactive contaminants in the 30-km zone has been
estimated at 4.4 PBq for caesium-137, 4 PBq for strontium-90 and
32 TBq for plutonium-239 and plutonium-240. 
<P>
However, it is not possible to predict the rate of reduction as
this is dependent on so many variable factors, so that restrictions
on the use of land are still necessary in the more contaminated
regions in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. In these areas, no lifting
of restrictions is likely in the foreseeable future. It is not
clear whether return to the 30 km exclusion zone will ever be
possible, nor whether it would be feasible to utilise this land
in other ways such as grazing for stud animals or hydroponic farming
(<I>Al93</I>). It is however, to be recognised that a small number
of generally elderly residents have returned to that area with
the unofficial tolerance of the authorities.
<P>
<I><B>Within Europe </B></I>
<P>
In Europe, a similar variation in the downward migration of caesium-137
has been seen, from tightly bound for years in the near-surface
layer in meadows (<I>Bo93</I>), to a relatively rapid downward
migration in sandy or marshy areas (<I>EC94</I>). For example,
Caslano (TI) experienced the greatest deposition in Switzerland
and the soil there has fallen to 42 per cent of the initial caesium-137
content in the six years after the accident, demonstrating the
slow downward movement of caesium in soil (<I>OF93</I>). There,
the caesium-137 from the accident has not penetrated to a depth
of more than 10 cm, whereas the contribution from atmospheric
nuclear weapon tests has reached 30 cm of depth.
<P>
In the United Kingdom, restrictions were placed on the movement
and slaughter of 4.25 million sheep in areas in southwest Scotland,
northeast England, north Wales and northern Ireland. This was
due largely to root uptake of relatively mobile caesium from peaty
soil, but the area affected and the number of sheep rejected are
reducing, so that, by January 1994, some 438,000 sheep were still
restricted. In northeast Scotland (<I>Ma89</I>), where lambs grazed
on contaminated pasture, their activity decreased to about 13
per cent of the initial values after 115 days; where animals consumed
uncontaminated feed, it fell to about 3.5 per cent. Restrictions
on slaughter and distribution of sheep and reindeer, also, are
still in force in some Nordic countries. 
<P>
The regional average levels of caesium-137 in the diet of European
Union citizens, which was the main source of exposure after the
early phase of the accident, have been falling so that, by the
end of 1990, they were approaching pre-accident levels (<I>EC94</I>).
In Belgium, the average body burden of caesium137 measured in
adult males increased after May 1986 and reached a peak in late
1987, more than a year after the accident. This reflected the
ingestion of contaminated food. The measured ecological half-life
was about 13 months. A similar trend was reported in Austria (<I>Ha91</I>).
  
<P>
In short, there is a continuous, if slow, reduction in the level
of mainly caesium-137 activity in agricultural soil. 
<P>
<B>Environmental impact</B>
<P>
<I><B>Forests</B></I>
<P>
Forests are highly diverse ecosystems whose flora and fauna depend
on a complex relationship with each other as well as with climate,
soil characteristics and topography. They may be not only a site
of recreational activity, but also a place of work and a source
of food. Wild game, berries and mushrooms are a supplementary
source of food for many inhabitants of the contaminated regions.
Timber and timber products are a viable economic resource. 
<P>
Because of the high filtering characteristics of trees, deposition
was often higher in forests than in agricultural areas. When contaminated,
the specific ecological pathways in forests often result in enhanced
retention of contaminating radionuclides. The high organic content
and stability of the forest floor soil increases the soil-to-plant
transfer of radionuclides with the result that lichens, mosses
and mushrooms often exhibit high concentrations of radionuclides.
The transfer of radionuclides to wild game in this environment
could pose an unacceptable exposure for some individuals heavily
dependent on game as a food source. This became evident in Scandinavia
where reindeer meat had to be controlled. In other areas, mushrooms
became severely contaminated with radiocaesium.
<P>
In 1990, forest workers in Russia were estimated to have received
a dose up to three times higher than others living in the same
area (<I>IA94</I>). In addition, some forest-based industries,
such as pulp production which often recycle chemicals, have been
shown to be a potential radiation protection problem due to enhancement
of radionuclides in liquors, sludges and ashes. However, harvesting
trees for pulp production may be a viable strategy for decontaminating
forests (<I>Ho95</I>).
<P>
Different strategies have been developed for combatting forest
contamination. Some of the more effective include restriction
of access and the prevention of forest fires.
<P>
One particularly affected site, known as the &quot;Red Forest&quot;
(<I>Dz95</I>), lies to the South and West close to the site. This
was a pine forest in which the trees received doses up to 100
Gy, killing them all. An area of about 375 ha was severely contaminated
and in 1987 remedial measures were undertaken to reduce the land
contamination and prevent the dispersion of radionuclides through
forest fires. The top 10-15 cm of soil were removed and dead trees
were cut down. This waste was placed in trenches and covered with
a layer of sand. A total volume of about 100,000 m3 was buried,
reducing the soil contamination by at least a factor of ten.
<P>
These measures, combined with other fire prevention strategies,
have significantly reduced the probability of dispersion of radionuclides
by forest fires (<I>Ko90</I>). The chemical treatment of soil
to minimise radionuclide uptake in plants may be a viable option
and, as has been seen, the processing of contaminated timber into
less contaminated products can be effective, provided that measures
are taken to monitor the by-products.
<P>
Changes in forest management and use can also be effective in
reducing dose. Prohibition or restriction of food collection and
control of hunting can protect those who habitually consume large
quantities. Dust suppression measures, such as re-forestation
and the sowing of grasses, have also been undertaken on a wide
scale to prevent the spread of existing soil contamination.
<P>
<I><B>Water bodies</B></I>
<P>
In an accident, radionuclides contaminate bodies of water not
only directly from deposition from the air and discharge as effluent,
but also indirectly by washout from the catchment basin. Radionuclides
contaminating large bodies of water are quickly redistributed
and tend to accumulate in bottom sediments, benthos, aquatic plants
and fish. The main pathways of potential human exposure may be
directly through contamination of drinking-water, or indirectly
from the use of water for irrigation and the consumption of contaminated
fish. As contaminating radionuclides tend to disappear from water
quickly, it is only in the initial fallout phase and in the very
late phase, when the contamination washed out from the catchment
area reaches drinking-water supplies, that human exposure is likely.
In the early phase of the Chernobyl accident, the aquaeous component
of the individual and collective doses from water bodies was estimated
not to exceed 1-2 per cent of the total exposure (<I>Li89</I>).
The Chernobyl Cooling Pond was the most heavily contaminated water
body in the exclusion zone. 
<P>
Radioactive contamination of the river ecosystems (Figure 8) was
noted soon after the accident when the total activity of water
during April and early May 1986 was 10 kBq/L in the river Pripyat,
5 kBq/L in the Uzh river and 4 kBq/L in the Dniepr. At this time,
shortlived radionuclides such as iodine-131 were the main contributors.
As the river ecosystem drained into the Kiev, then the Kanev and
Kremenchug reservoirs, the contamination of water,sediments, algae,
molluscs and fish fell significantly.  
<P>
In 1989, the content of caesium-137 in the water of the Kiev reservoir
was estimated to be 0.4 Bq/L, in the Kanev reservoir 0.2 Bq/L,
and in the Kremenchug reservoir 0.05 Bq/L. Similarly, the caesium-137
content of Bream fish fell by a factor of 10 between the Kiev
and Kanev reservoirs, and by a factor of two between the Kanev
and Kremenchug reservoirs to reach about 10 Bq/kg (<I>Kr95</I>).
In the last decade, contamination of the water system has not
posed a public health problem. However, monitoring will need to
be continued to ensure that washout from the catchment area which
contains a large quantity of stored radioactive waste will not
contaminate drinking-water.
<P>
A hydrogeological study of groundwater contamination in the 30-km
exclusion zone (<I>Vo95</I>) has estimated that strontium-90 is
the most critical radionuclide, which could contaminate drinking-water
above acceptable limits in 10 to 100 years from now.   
<P>
Outside the former Soviet Union, direct and indirect contamination
of lakes has caused and is still causing many problems, because
the fish in the lakes are contaminated above the levels accepted
for sale in the open market. In Sweden, for instance, about 14,000
lakes (<I>i.e.</I>, about 15 per cent of the Swedish total) had
fish with radiocaesium concentrations above 1,500 Bq/kg (the Swedish
guideline for selling lake fish) during 1987. The ecological half-life,
which depends on the kind of fish and types of lakes, ranges from
a few years up to some tens of years (<I>Ha91</I>).
<P>
In the countries of the European Union, the content of caesium-137
in drinking-water has been regularly sampled and reveals levels
at, or below, 0.1 Bq/L from 1987 to 1990 (<I>EC94</I>), which
are of no health concern. The activity concentration in the water
decreased substantially in the years following the accident due
largely to the fixation of radiocaesium in the sediments.<BR>

<B>In summary,</B>
<UL>
<p><LI><B>Many countermeasures to control the contamination of agricultural
products were applied with varying levels of efficacy. Nevertheless,
within the former Soviet Union large areas of agricultural land
are still excluded from use and are expected to continue to be
so for a long time. In a much larger area, although agricultural
and farm animal activities are carried out, the food produced
is subject to strict controls and restrictions of distribution
and use; </B>
<p><LI><B>Similar problems, although of a much lower severity, were
experienced in some countries of Europe outside the former Soviet
Union, where agricultural and farm animal production were subjected
to controls and limitations for variable durations after the accident.
Most of these restrictions have been lifted several years ago.
However, there are still some areas in Europe where restrictions
on slaughter and distribution of animals are in force. This concerns,
for example, several hundreds of thousands of sheep in the United
Kingdom and large numbers of sheep and reindeer in some Nordic
countries.</B>
<p><LI><B>Produce from forests may continue to be a radiological
protection problem  for a long time.</B>
<p><LI><B>At present drinking water is not a problem. Contamination
of groundwater, especially with strontium-90, could be a problem
for the future in the catchment basins downstream of the Chernobyl
area.</B>
<p><LI><B>Contaminated fish from lakes may be a long-term problem
in some countries. </B>

<B> EXPLANATION OF TERMS </B>
<P>
<B>Activity </B>
<P>
Quantity of a radionuclide. It describes the rate at which spontaneous
nuclear transformations (i.e., radioactive decay) occur in it.
It is measured in becquerels (Bq), where 1 Bq equals one nuclear
transformation per second.
<P>
Several multiples of the becquerel (Bq) are used throughout the
text. They are the following:
<P>
 exabecquerel (EBq)   =  1018 Bq
<P>
 petabecquerel (PBq)   =  1015 Bq
<P>
 terabecquerel (TBq)   =  1012 Bq
<P>
 gigabecquerel (GBq)   =  109 Bq
<P>
 megabecquerel (MBq)  =  106 Bq
<P>
 kilobecquerel (kBq)   =  103 Bq
<P>
<B>Collective dose </B>
<P>
Total dose over a population group exposed to a given source.
It is represented by the product of the average dose to the individuals
in the group by the number of persons comprising the group. It
is measured in person-sieverts (person-Sv).
<P>
<B>Dose </B>
<P>
A general term denoting a quantity of radiation. Depending on
its application it can be qualified as &quot;absorbed dose&quot;,
&quot;equivalent dose&quot; and &quot;effective dose&quot;.
<P>
<I><B> Absorbed dose </B></I>
<P>
Quantity of energy imparted by radiation to a unit mass of matter
such as tissue. Absorbed dose is measured in grays (Gy), where
1 Gy equals 1 joule of energy absorbed per kilogramme of matter.
One gray produces a different intensity of biological effects
on tissue depending on the type of radiation (alpha, beta, gamma,
neutrons). One common submultiple of the gray, the milligray,
is often used. One milligray (mGy) is equal to 10-3 Gy.
<P>
<I><B> Effective dose </B></I>
<P>
Weighted sum of the &quot;equivalent doses&quot; to the various
organs and tissues multiplied by weighting factors reflecting
the differing sensitivities of organs and tissues to radiation.
The weighting factor for each organ or tissue expresses the fractional
contribution of the risk of death or serious genetic defect from
irradiation of that organ or tissue to the total risk from uniform
irradiation of the whole body. Effective dose is measured in sieverts
(Sv). Some submultiples of the sievert are used throughout the
text. They are the following:
<P>
<B> </B>millisievert (mSv)  =  10-3 Sv
<P>
 microsievert (Sv)   =  10-6 Sv
<P>
<I><B> Equivalent dose </B></I>
<P>
Quantity obtained by multiplying the &quot;absorbed dose&quot;
in an organ (e.g., thyroid) or tissue by a factor representing
the different effectiveness of the various types of radiation
in causing harm to the organ or tissue. This factor, whose value
varies between 1 and 20 depending on the type of radiation, has
been introduced in order to allow grouping or comparing biological
effects due to different radiations. Equivalent dose is measured
in sieverts (Sv). One sievert produces the same biological effect,
irrespective of the type of radiation.
<P>
<B>Health effects</B>
<P>
<I><B> Acute radiation syndrome </B></I>
<P>
A clinical scenario characterized by a complex of acute deterministic
effects affecting various organs and body functions in the irradiated
person.
<P>
<I><B> Deterministic effects (</B></I>also called<I><B> acute
health effects) </B></I>
<P>
Early deleterious radiation effects on living tissues (e.g., body,
organ or tissue death, cataracts), which generally occur only
above a threshold of dose and whose severity depends on the level
of dose absorbed. They become generally evident within a short
time from the irradiation (hours, days or weeks, depending on
the dose received). Throughout the text the doses producing Deterministic
effects are expressed in grays (Gy).
<P>
<I><B> Genetic effects (</B></I>also called<I><B> hereditary effects)
</B></I>
<P>
Stochastic effect which occur in the progeny of the exposed person.
<P>
<I><B> Stochastic effects (</B></I>also called<I><B> late health
effects) </B></I>
<P>
Late deleterious radiation effects (e.g., leukaemia, tumours)
whose severity is independent of dose and whose probability of
occuring is assumed to be proportional to the dose received. It
is also assumed that there is no threshold dose below which stochastic
effects will not occur. The stochastic effects occur, therefore,
at doses lower than those producing deterministic effects and
may manifest themselves after a long time (years, decades) from
the irradiation. Throughout the text the doses producing stochastic
effects are expressed in sieverts (Sv).
<P>
<B>Intervention level </B>
<P>
The value of a quantity (dose, activity concentration) which,
if exceeded or predicted to be exceeded in case of an accident,
may require the application of a given protective action.

<A Name = "1.0"></A><H1>1. INTRODUCTION </H1>
Demand Side Management (DSM) is one of the most cost-effective
resources available to utilities today. DSM represents an important
policy choice for avoiding adverse impacts on health, environment,
and public amenity that result from the production of electrical
power -- impacts that include the societal costs of energy use
associated with the entire fuel cycle, not simply the impacts
at the point of generation. Furthermore, energy efficiency programs
targeted to low-income customers can provide important societal
benefits beyond those related to the customer's energy consumption.
DSM can also have a beneficial impact upon direct utility costs
through decreasing arrears and by decreasing exposure to risks
of future environmental regulation. Other social benefits associated
with job creation, government subsidies, oil import costs, and
depletion of natural resources are also important.
<P>
This report aims to comprehensively identify, and quantify where
appropriate, the societal benefits associated with DSM programs
in New England. <SUP><A HREF = "#FN1">1</A></SUP> Among the issues that are explored
in this report are societal benefits of avoided generation, effects
on local economies, hidden costs of fossil fuel dependence, effects
on low-income customers, and additional benefits of DSM programs.
The range of sources examined includes published documents from
academic institutions, state and federal government, utility planning
studies, a variety of unpublished information (e.g., utility RFP
protocols, testimony, commission orders) and personal communications.
Wherever possible, New England-specific data is used.<P>
<A Name = "1.1"></A><H2>1.1 Competitive Forces in the Electric Industry</H2>
<P>
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 brought about increased <I>wholesale
competition </I>where electric utilities have been able to choose
between purchases from Qualifying Facilities (QFs), Independent
Power Producers (IPPs), cogenerators, other utilities selling
bulk power, and from Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs). Utilities
could face increased <I>retail</I> <I>competition</I> as well,
whereby consumers (e.g., an industrial facility) or groups of
consumers could contract with whatever suppliers they wish, including
utilities outside the conventional service territory and/or IPPs.
<P>
Increasing competition in the electric industry will require a
rethinking of the means to achieve energy and environmental objectives.
Some of the results presented in this report are directly affected
by the profound changes affecting the electric industry. Initiatives
by state legislatures in New England, notably Rhode Island and
New Hampshire, have succeeded in expanding the agenda from wholesale
competition, which currently exists in limited form, to the possibility
of retail competition where all classes of customers could negotiate
generation contracts. For example, in Massachusetts, the Department
of Public Utilities has opened its own investigation into electric
industry restructuring, stating its intention to &quot;... take
steps to allow a greater reliance on competition and customer
choice for retail customers in order to increase efficiency and
reduce costs, while still providing safe, reliable and least-cost
service.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#FN2">2</A></SUP> 
<P>
These changes emphasize the need for New England utilities to
place an even greater emphasis on obtaining the right the mix
of resources to meet customer demand. Examining the societal benefits
associated with DSM programs is a means of addressing, not only
the risk of future regulations, but the uncertainty associated
with restructuring the electric industry. The results of our analysis
suggest that the non-price benefits of DSM currently unaccounted
for in the planning process can be quite large.
<P>
While many of the restructuring proposal substitute reliance on
markets for regulation claim they will secure significant economic
benefits for customers, fundamental concerns have emerged that
certain elements of these reform proposals could discourage continued
investments in DSM programs and detract from the environmental
protection gains achieved in recent years. 
<P>
If retail competition were implemented, it could significantly
affect the level of New England DSM programs and their impacts.
Retail competition in New England could fundamentally alter planning
processes, by (a) introducing significant uncertainty into the
short- and long-term planning, (b) altering utilities' priorities
and objectives, (c) possibly undermining opportunities for cost-effective
DSM as a result of uncertainty and competitive pressures, and
(d) limiting consideration of environmental and social externalities.
It will be important to find ways to ensure that the economic
and environmental goals of IRP, and the progress that has already
been made thus far, are preserved in new protocols and conditions
affecting planning.
<P>
A range of mechanisms are available that could be used to encourage
continued investments in DSM in a restructured industry, and thereby
take into account DSM's non-price factors to some degree. These
range from market-based approaches such as emission trading schemes
and Performance Based Ratemaking (PBR), to command and control
options such as additional environmental standards and regulations,
emission caps, pollution taxes, efficiency credits, and DSM resource
portfolio requirement. There may also be various combinations
of mechanisms. At a minimum, a systems benefits charge should
be established to allow utilities assurance for recovering the
costs of their DSM programs, and minimize the risks associated
with competition.<P>
<A Name = "1.2"></A><H2>1.2 Trends in Environmental Regulation</H2>
<P>
Over the years, an extensive array of state and federal regulation
has been enacted that deal with air and water pollution, solid
waste disposal, and nuclear power operation. These range from
specific control technologies to the enforcement of emission standards
and requirements for accident prevention. Generally, federal environmental
legislation does not preempt states from enforcing their own standards
for advancing environmental quality.
<P>
No matter how the electric industry is restructured, additional
environmental standards and regulations are expected to keep pace
with developments in toxicological and environmental research.
While regulations aim to proscribe action deemed to have unacceptably
high damages to the environmental or human health, they frequently
lag behind either confirmation of the particular adverse effects
or significant exposure to the pollutant. This raises the distinct
possibility that today's allowable residual emissions from power
generation may be challenged in the future as advances in medical
knowledge about dose-response functions and sensitive populations
develops. Utility planning must find a way to take account of
the risks of future environmental regulations while awaiting their
outcome.
<P>
The impact of future environmental regulation may take a variety
of forms. Additional restrictions of a given power plant may reduce
its level of operation or require investment in additional control
equipment. A tax on carbon dioxide emissions would affect the
cost of production from all fossil plants.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN3">3</A></SUP> In addition,
since resource decisions are always made in the context of an
utility system with a mix of resources, these uncertainties need
to be considered not only for a single resource option being evaluated,
but in a system-wide context for existing and alternative future
resource options. 
<P>
The exact nature of these impacts is hard to predict, but the
facilities most likely to be affected are those burning fossil
fuels. For example, the Clinton Administration's <I>Climate Change
Action Plan</I> has established specific goals affecting carbon
dioxide emissions, and has recognized the need to go much further
than the current voluntary program to contribute to climate stabilization
over the longer term. Also, pursuant to Title III of the 1990
Clean Air Act Amendments, the USEPA has initiated a study to examine
the health risks of air toxics emitted from fossil power plants
- the results of which could lead to costly emission control equipment.<SUP>
<A HREF = "#FN4">4</A></SUP>
<P>
In Massachusetts, for example, the importance of accounting for
the risk of future regulation has been emphasized by a recent
court decision on the use of externalities in electric resource
planning. Even while striking down the DPU rule that required
utilities to apply environmental adders to bids from new power
plants in resource solicitations, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
Court (SJC) ruled that the DPU has the right to order a utility
to avoid a resource that may be subject to expensive emissions
restrictions in the future. The SJC ruled that the DPU lacked
the statutory authority to consider <I>societal </I>impacts, while
affirming that risks to <I>ratepayers </I>associated with the
costs of future regulations is a valid consideration.
<P>
The FERC recently ruled in California regarding the avoided cost
payments made to QF's under PURPA, and addressed how non-price
factors and externalities may be applied to these payments.<SUP>
<A HREF = "#FN5">5</A></SUP> PURPA's avoided cost standard can be construed as &quot;allowing
consideration of non-price factors essential to integrated resource
planning.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#FN6">6</A></SUP> In particular, Commissioner Massey
emphasized that the FERC decision &quot;does not preclude states
from considering environmental costs in determining avoided costs
under PURPA.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#FN7">7</A></SUP> What is not clear is how these
non-price factors can be taken into account. FERC clearly pointed
to state tax laws as an acceptable mechanism.
<P>
<A Name = "1.3"></A><B>1.3 Approach of This Report</B>
<P>
An important objective of this report is to express values for
the benefits of DSM in specific quantitative and monetary terms
wherever possible. This approach should not be interpreted as
a position that monetization is the only, or even the best, method
for incorporating externalities and other policy factors into
electric power system planning. In some instances, the valuation
of environmental resources in monetary terms may be reasonable
and appropriate. The dollar value can then applied through a tax
or an &quot;externality adder&quot; in order to appropriately
incorporate that impact into utility planning. In other cases,
valuation may be difficult, impossible, or simply inappropriate,
and setting targets may be a better policy approach. In such instances,
where a <I>policy target</I> might be set for a state, region
or entire country, an &quot;externality adder&quot; might be a
useful <I>instrument</I> for the implementation of that policy.
<P>
However, some policy goals simply do not fit the category of &quot;externality&quot;.
These can, for example, relate to equity between individuals,
classes of customers, citizens of different states, or members
of different generations. Such equity considerations have to some
extent been, and should continue to be, recognized in utility
planning and DSM screening. Such distributional issues do not
readily lend themselves to economic valuation. For example, &quot;willingness
to pay&quot;, a key concept for economic analysis, may be constrained
by low-income customers' ability to pay. Similarly, future generations
are not available to express their views. Nonetheless, quantitative
analysis of distributional issues can be illuminating, and policy
factors for incorporating equity considerations into utility planning
may take a quantitative form.
<P>
Over the past several years, the range of &quot;other non-price
factors affecting the costs or benefits of the electrical service
(e.g., reliability, fuel diversity)&quot; has come under increasing
scrutiny. DSM represents an important policy choice for avoiding
adverse impacts on health, environment, and public amenity that
result from society's need for electrical power -- impacts that
include the societal costs of energy use associated with the entire
fuel cycle, not simply the impacts at the point of generation.
Furthermore, DSM programs targeted to low-income customers can
provide important societal benefits beyond those related to the
customer's energy consumption. DSM can also have a beneficial
impact upon direct utility costs through decreasing arrears and
by decreasing exposure to risks of future environmental regulation.
In addition, DSM programs have other social associated with job
creation, government subsidies, oil import costs, and depletion
of natural resources.
<P>
To quantify the benefits of DSM programs in New England, we have
examined total DSM programs for regional utilities that have made
substantial investments in DSM. Table 1.1 shows data for the three
utilities in New England with the largest 1993 expenditures on
energy efficiency programs. In our study, we considered DSM programs
to be equivalent to 100 MW of generating capacity. This is slightly
less that 101 MW of DSM savings that the Boston Edison Company
(BECo), has developed through 1993. It can be considered as a
lower bound figure when compared to the 267 MW which the Connecticut
Light &amp; Power achieved in 1993.

On the other hand, the 100 MW of DSM savings is essentially a
hypothetical quantity of savings that we have chosen for our illustrative
calculations. We make the simplifying assumption that the 100
MW of DSM savings is made up of a similar mix of DSM programs
as New England's current and future programs. This assumption
implies that the 100 MW will have a &quot;load factor&quot; of
roughly 60 percent, and associated energy savings of roughly 525
GWh. For each non-price factor, two scenarios are specified, a
low impact scenario and a high impact scenario, details of which
are given in the subsections that follow.<P>

<A Name = "2.0"></A><H1>2. BENEFITS OF NEW ENGLAND'S DSM PROGRAMS</H1>
<A Name = "2.1"></A><H2>2.1 Avoided Emissions of Criteria Air Pollutants and Greenhouse Gases</H2>
<P>
Criteria air pollutants include those that have been designated
by the EPA, under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, with National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set to protect human health
and welfare. The list of criteria pollutants includes sulfur dioxide
(SO<SUB>2</SUB>), volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxide
(NO<SUB>X</SUB>), total suspended particulates (TSP), carbon monoxide
(CO), lead, and others. 
<P>
Greenhouse gases include those pollutants which increase the heat-trapping
capacity of the earth's atmosphere and contribute to global warming.
The primary greenhouse gases emitted from power plants include
carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>), methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>), nitrous
oxide (N<SUB>2</SUB>O).
<P>
In 1990, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU)
adopted a policy requiring utilities to add monetary values of
five criteria pollutants and three greenhouse gases to the costs
of new generation facilities, as part of their integrated resource
plans. The monetary values chosen by the DPU for these air pollutants,
in terms of dollars per ton emitted, are presented in Table 2.1.
These values were subsequently thrown out by the Supreme Judicial
Court which ruled that the DPU lacked the statutory authority
to consider <I>societal </I>impacts, but affirmed the DPU's role
in ordering that utilities consider the risk of future regulations.

The monetary values of the criteria air pollutants have been estimated
using the &quot;regulator's revealed preference&quot; methodology,
sometimes referred to as the control cost approach. The monetary
values of the greenhouse gases have been estimated using the costs
of maintaining a target amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions, as
well as the relative global warming potential of the remaining
two pollutants relative to carbon dioxide.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN8">8</A></SUP>
<P>
The purpose of our analysis here is to apply the Massachusetts
DPU monetary values to generation resources on the NEPOOL system,
in order to provide a rough indication of the magnitude of the
cost of these pollutants, and to compare these pollutants with
other non-price factors. Accordingly, the DPU values for each
criteria pollutant and greenhouse gas have been converted into
monetary costs by assuming that DSM programs displace energy from
oil and natural gas plants on the NEPOOL margin.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN9">9</A></SUP>
The results are summarized in Table 2.2, which indicates that
the total costs of these air pollutants combined can be as high
as 5.45 cents/kWh.

<P>
For New England, we estimate that for the high impact scenario
the potential impacts of 100 MW of DSM for the NEPOOL margin is
$27 million, for generation-related greenhouse gas and criteria
air pollutant emissions. If upstream emissions are considered,
DSM programs save an additional $1.5 million. In the low impact
scenario, if the DSM were to displace generation from a new gas
combined cycle plant with steam water injection and selective
catalytic reduction, the benefits would amount to $6.9 million,
representing only the emissions associated with generation. If
upstream emissions are considered, DSM programs save an additional
$5.4 million.<P>
<A Name = "2.2"></A><H2>2.2 Heavy Metals</H2>
<P>
During combustion of coal and oil, heavy metals which occur naturally
in coal and oil deposits are released into the air, either in
a gaseous phase or bound to particles. Once released into the
environment, metals are persistent.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN10">10</A></SUP><FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT>People may be exposed to these metals through several pathways,
including inhalation. Through atmospheric deposition, metals can
be deposited on soil, in lakes, and in streams. Contaminated soil
may present a health risk due to ingestion of soil (especially
for children) and ingestion of crops which may take up the metal.
Metal deposition in lakes and streams may impact fish, humans,
and other species consuming these fish.
<P>
In general, two types of health impacts may occur - acute and
chronic. Acute health impacts, which may be reversible, are associated
with short term exposures to high concentrations of metals. However,
fossil fuel combustion can also result in long term exposure to
lower concentrations. These can cause chronic health effects which
typically are not reversible.
<P>
To date, very few air toxics have been regulated in the United
States. Title III of the U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA)
of 1990 lists 189 hazardous air pollutants which are to be regulated
on a source-by-source basis. Sources for each air pollutant will
be listed and regulations are still to be promulgated for each
air pollutant from each source. The CAAA directs the EPA administrator
to perform a study of the public health hazards associated with
hazardous air emissions from electric generation facilities, and
to regulate these emissions if deemed necessary by the EPA study.
<P>
Until recently, little attention has been given to the study of
air toxics. To date we are aware of only two methodologies for
estimating the monetary values of air toxics. The first method
develops the <I>marginal cost of control</I> for arsenic, chromium
and lead by assessing the marginal cost of complying with Massachusetts
regulations pertaining to those three pollutants, including standards
for arsenic emissions from copper smelters, chromium emissions
from cooling towers, and lead emissions from secondary lead smelters.
(Chernick and Caverhill 1991).
<P>
The second methodology is to develop <I>relative toxicities</I>
of each heavy metal by comparing their potential health impacts
to another heavy metal whose marginal cost of control is already
known. This methodology assumes that society's willingness to
pay to avoid damages from heavy metals is proportional to their
relative toxicities. For example, the monetary value of lead can
be determined using the marginal cost of complying with Massachusetts
regulations, as described above. The monetary value of another
metal which is twice as toxic as lead should be assigned twice
the monetary value of lead.
<P>
We recommend inferring relative toxicities from the Massachusetts
Allowable Ambient Limits (AAL) for the heavy metals. The AAL values
are an annual average exposure concentration designed to protect
human health. They are established by the Massachusetts Department
of Environmental Protection. The AAL values are preferable to
the alternative &quot;reference doses&quot; determined by the
EPA, because they consider both non-cancer and cancer health effects.
<P>
The resulting monetary values of heavy metals (in dollars per
pound of pollutant) are presented in Table 2.3. We present a range
of low and high values, derived by applying the relative toxicities
to arsenic, chromium and lead. The significant breadth of the
range for many heavy metals is an indication of the uncertainty
embodied in these values.

Accordingly, these values have been converted into monetary costs
by assuming that DSM programs displace energy from oil and natural
gas plants on the NEPOOL margin. The results are summarized in
Table 2.4, which indicates that the upper range costs of these
air toxics can be as high as 0.28 cents/kWh.
<P>
For New England, we estimate that for the high impact scenario
the potential impacts of 100 MW of DSM for the NEPOOL margin is
$1.5 million. For the low impact scenario, the lower bound of
air toxic values was used, yielding a cost of about $0.1 million.
<A Name = "2.3"></A><H2>2.3 Water Use Impacts</H2>
<P>
Electricity generation affects water resources at the point of
fuel mining and extraction, at the point of fuel combustion, and
at the point of waste disposal. Water use impacts can compromise
the integrity of aquatic systems, the viability of their biota,
as well as the health and amenity of the human populations that
they serve.
<P>
Fuel mining and extraction activities can have adverse water quality
impacts as a result of water drainage from mines, leaching and
erosion of solid wastes from mining and cleaning plants, slurry
dewatering, and modification of aquifers. Mining activities can
affect both surface and groundwater supplies. For coal mines,
potentially severe problems are created by acid drainage from
both underground and surface mines and from coal waste storage
piles. For uranium mines, the construction of dikes creates a
loss of aquatic habitat. More significantly, drainage from uranium
mine tailings can increase the concentration of dissolved radium
in surface waters; sometimes leading to acute short-term poisoning,
and sometimes leading to chronic long-term poisoning of aquatic
populations.

<P>
For oil and gas exploration, offshore and terminal operations
result in some discharge to surrounding waters. Tidal marshes,
coastal wetlands, river swamps, and sheltered bays support organisms
that may be affected by low levels of hydrocarbons. Brine separation
and transport incidents may also have impact on local water bodies.
<P>
At the point of generation, power plants can have three types
of direct impacts on water systems: impacts on aquatic populations
from water intake systems, thermal discharges into water bodies,
and solids and toxic chemical discharges into water bodies.
<P>
Most of the waste impacts result from the cooling process in thermal
power plants. Therefore, water impacts will depend largely upon
the type of cooling system used. In <I>once-through cooling</I>
systems, water is taken from a local body of water, passed through
steam condensers, and discharged at an elevated temperature. In
<I>closed-cycle cooling</I>, cooling water is circulated through
cooling towers to transfer heat to the atmosphere, and then recirculated
through the plant. Closed cycle cooling systems tend to have lower
water impacts than once-through.
<P>
The primary impacts on aquatic populations from water intake systems
include (a) <I>entrapment</I>, when fish and crustaceans are affected
by the currents that are created as large volumes of water are
drawn into power plants; (b) <I>impingement</I>, when large aquatic
organisms are trapped on the intake screens that are used to prevent
them from entering the power plant; and (c) <I>entrainment</I>,
when those aquatic organisms small enough to pass through the
intake screens enter the cooling pipes and are drawn through the
cooling system. Impingement losses can be considerable. A study
of the Great Lakes estimated that fish kills in excess of 40 million
per year result from the 90 once-through thermal electric stations
on the shores of the Great Lakes. (Ottinger et al., 1990)
<P>
Thermal discharges of cooling water from power plants can have
adverse ecosystem impacts in a variety of ways. Organisms respond
to changes in the aquatic environment with both behavioral and
physiological responses, including death. Submerged vegetation
can be increased or decreased in the nearby waters, thereby changing
the associated fauna, reproductive sites, and nesting areas of
organisms. New organisms may be attracted by the thermal effluent,
while some existing organisms may be repelled by them, resulting
in further modifications to the nearby habitat. Unanticipated
plant shutdowns or emergency responses can cause sudden changes
to cooling water usage, resulting in thermal shock to the nearby
aquatic environment.
<P>
Solids and toxic chemical discharges into water bodies result
from numerous operations within the plant, including: once-through
cooling processes, cooling tower blowdown, bottom ash and fly
ash transport water, chemical metal cleaning wastes, ion exchange
water treatment systems, and discharges from wet air pollution
control devices. Many types of water pollutants have been detected
in power plant effluent, with major classes including: dissolved
solids; chlorine residual; chlorinated organic compounds; corrosion
products such as copper and zinc; residual anti-corrosion/anti-scaling
water treatment chemicals; and grease and oil. To our knowledge,
no study has assessed the external cost of these water pollutants
from power plants.
<P>
Finally, power plants can have water use impacts at the point
of waste disposal. Waste streams associated with electricity generation
are disposed of in landfills or surface ponds. Once landfilled,
ash constituents may enter groundwater if the landfill lacks a
liner, leachate collection and monitoring systems. Water runoff
from the landfill may cause contamination of local surface waters.
Similarly, water overflow in surface ponds may also carry pollutants
into surface waters.
<P>
Water use impacts from all stages of electricity production tend
to be highly site-specific. In addition, relatively few studies
has been performed which attempt to quantify, or to monetize,
the environmental impacts of water usage. In theory, it would
be possible to develop monetary values of water impacts, using
the regulators' revealed preference methodology, for water intake
impacts, thermal discharge impacts, chemical discharge impacts,
and waste disposal impacts. 
<P>
However, we are aware of only one study that has developed monetary
values for any of these impacts. The Pace study estimated the
control costs of fish impingement resulting from cooling water
intake. Using an assumed fish impingement rate of 0.00061 fish/kWh,
the study estimated mitigation costs that ranged from 0.005 to
0.02 cents/kWh. To our knowledge, monetary values have not been
developed for the many other water use impacts described above.
<P>
For New England, we have estimated the potential impacts of 100
MW of DSM savings for water intake impacts only, because we have
not found monetary values of other water use impacts that are
sufficiently comprehensive. Under a high impact scenario, the
total cost is about $1.1 million; under the low impact scenario,
the total cost is about $0.3 million.
<A Name = "2.4"></A><H2>2.4 Land Use Impacts </H2>
<P>
Electric power facilities can have a variety of land use impacts,
including those from fuel extraction and mining, impacts from
the power plants themselves, and impacts as a result of waste
disposal. 
<P>
Mining activities can create impacts on terrestrial biota and
other land resources, e.g., forced migration and threats to endangered
species. Surface mining can have environmental and economic impacts
as a result of the removal of land from its use as farmland, forest
or rangeland. In addition, spoil from improperly controlled mines
can result in erosion and landslides, while unreclaimed coal highwalls
can be a major aesthetic problem. In some cases, noise and visual
impacts extend beyond mine boundaries, and affect wildlife habitats
and recreational activities in a larger area.
<P>
The amount of land used for the construction and operation of
power plants varies significantly by the type of plant. Coal plants
typically require significantly more land space due to coal preparation
and on-site waste disposal. According to the U.S. DOE, natural
gas and oil fired generators tend to require roughly 0.1 square
yards per MWh of generation, while conventional coal plants require
approximately 10 times that amount (1.2 sq. yards/MWh). Nuclear
plants also require a great deal of land space. Pressurized Water
Reactors use slightly more than conventional coal (1.5 sq. yards/MWh),
while Boiling Water Reactors require nearly twice that amount
(2.7 sq. yards/MWh) (US DOE 1983).
<P>
Hydroelectric facilities can also create land-use impacts, depending
upon the type and configuration of the installation, the mode
of operation, the environmental characteristics of the site, and
the use of the surrounding lands. Flooding of land behind a dam
can inundate large areas of forest, farmland, and even towns,
destroying a wide range of wildlife habitats and flora. Adverse
biological effects on fish life can be caused by the obstruction
of downstream sediment movement, the buildup of anaerobic gases,
obstruction of spawning pathways, and increased salt and mineral
contents. In addition, socio-economic impacts can occur as previous
recreational and commercial waters are impacted -- although creation
of the reservoir may also present alternative recreational and
commercial opportunities.
<P>
Energy distribution facilities such as gas or oil pipelines can
have a host of potential impacts on land use. The construction
and maintenance of pipelines and related facilities may affect
farming, forestry, and tourism, and may impair the aesthetics
and general amenity of life in the neighboring communities. In
addition, local employment might rise as a result of construction
and maintenance of pipelines, but at the cost of displacing or
disrupting existing communities. Several pipeline projects have
been stopped in part because they interfered with aboriginal communities;
while other projects have required payments ranging from four
to eight percent of the value of the project to protect tribal
fisheries and other traditional assets.
<P>
Finally, the land required for the disposal of solid wastes produced
by generating facilities may be substantial. For example, a 500
MW coal plant requires approximately 300 acres of land for disposing
of solid waste -- equal to over one-third of the land required
for the location of the plant itself.
<P>
Unlike many of the other non-price factors reviewed in this report,
part of the value of the land that is used for electricity generation
is reflected in the price that the utility must pay for the land.
However, a number of external costs remain. Converting open space
to an industrialized application involves a range of aesthetic,
recreational and ecosystem diversity impacts. In addition, plant
sites can have health, environmental, aesthetic, and noise impacts
which lower the value of surrounding properties. Furthermore,
the volume of combustion wastes from fossil fuel plants creates
pressure on landfill space, and accelerates the need for additional
landfill areas. The on-going controversy regarding the U.S. DOE's
inability to find a publicly-acceptable site for the disposal
of nuclear wastes indicates the degree of land use impacts that
extend beyond the price of the land.
<P>
The land-use impacts from every stage of electricity production
are highly site-specific, and will depend largely upon the facility
type, the surrounding geography, wildlife characteristics and
demographics. In addition, there have been very few studies performed
to develop monetary values of land-use impacts. Therefore, we
do not recommend that any particular value be used at this time
in New England.
<A Name = "2.5"></A><H2>2.5 Radiological Impacts of Nuclear Power </H2>
<P>
Emissions of radionuclides occur at each stage of the nuclear
fuel cycle. Some of the radionuclides are very long-lived and
will continue to decay over thousands of years, suggesting that
today's nuclear power plants may result in impacts that will last
over many generations. Other radionuclides are very short-lived,
but may nonetheless result in intense exposure due to the type
of radioactivity emitted.
<P>
Uranium tailings piles, associated with the mining and extraction
of nuclear fuels, release a variety of radionuclides into the
atmosphere. Of principle concern is radon (Rn-222) -- an inert
gas with a short half-life (less than four days), but which is
released into the atmosphere virtually forever because one of
its precursors (Th-230) has a half-life of 80,000 years. Depending
upon the future condition of the tailing pile, adverse health
effects may arise from radon and its daughters as they are inhaled,
deposited, and retained in the respiratory system.
<P>
A variety of radionuclides are routinely emitted from the operation
of nuclear generating stations as well. The emissions are routinely
produced by nuclear reactions occurring in the fuel, in the moderator
or heat transport systems, and in structural components. Radioactive
emission rates vary depending on structural design characteristics,
power rating, emission control systems, and waste handling methods.
The general public is exposed to radiation through a variety of
air and water pathways.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN11">11</A></SUP> 
<P>
The most uncertain factor in estimating externality costs from
nuclear power generation is the risk of possible catastrophic
radionuclide releases due to accidents. Opinions diverge greatly
regarding the frequency of a catastrophic release, the exposure
of local, regional and global populations, and the dose-response
relationships. Some recent studies conclude that external costs
associated with possible reactor accidents may account for the
largest single contribution to total nuclear externality costs.
<P>
Nuclear reactors could suffer an accident for a number of reasons.
Much of the analysis has focused on the possibility of a loss
of coolant accident (LOCA) which involves the rupture of a large
cooling pipe. However, many other accident scenarios are possible,
as well as multiple event combinations leading to a major accident.
The worst-case scenario occurs when severe core damage results
in the release of much of the radionuclide inventory into the
containment and eventually to the environment.
<P>
Finally, nuclear power plants produce nuclear waste which can
also release radionuclides into the environment. Low-level wastes
will remain hazardous for hundreds of years. Occupational exposure
to radionuclides can result from workers handling, packaging,
and storing the wastes. Moreover, long-term exposure may result
from radioactive effluent from waste buried in trenches and in-ground
containers. Another potential source of exposure is associated
with the possibility of accidents during handling, transport,
and final disposal. In the US, accidents during transport and
handling have produced contamination beyond the boundaries of
low-level waste sites. Long-term options for permanent storage
of low-level wastes are still under review.
<P>
High-level wastes consist primarily of spent fuel generated by
the nuclear fission process, and can remain highly radioactive
for thousands of years. High-level wastes are also subject to
occupational and accident-related risks. High-level wastes are
currently stored on the site of the generation facilities, pending
the development of a temporary or permanent storage site.
<P>
Estimating the direct physical impacts of damages due to radionuclide
emissions is a complex task replete with uncertainties, scientific
disagreements, and unresolved issues. Impacts will depend upon
a variety of factors, including the actual level of emissions
into air, water and soil; the transport of radionuclides through
those media, based on climatological and topographical conditions;
the exposure of receptor areas or populations, and the dose-response
relationship of those populations.
<P>
The primary emphasis in the literature that we reviewed was on
the human health impacts of radionuclide releases. Bioaccumulation
of radionuclides in many other kinds of living organisms can also
be significantly affected by the nuclear fuel cycle. Accordingly,
the results presented here should not be seen as encompassing
the full range of environmental and health impacts of radionuclide
releases.
<P>
Most of the studies we reviewed determined monetary values of
radionuclide emissions using the &quot;damage cost&quot; methodology.
One of the central assumptions in this approach is the dollar
value of a human life. While a broad range of values have been
used, the Pace study recommends a &quot;middle ground&quot; value
of a statistical human life of $4 million (Ottinger et al., 1990).
Alternatively, it is reasonable to assume $10,000 for a dose commitment
of one person-rem.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN1"2>12</A></SUP> This value is used by the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a guideline to determine if a
risk-reducing plant modification is economically justified.
<P>
Table 2.5 summarizes the results of several estimates of the dollar
costs of radionuclide emissions from uranium mining, routine reactor
operations, risk of nuclear accident, decommissioning and disposal
of nuclear wastes. This table indicates the wide range of estimates
that exist for each of the stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. It
also indicates that the risk of nuclear accidents, and the long-term
radon releases from unstabilized tailings piles, could potentially
have the greatest environmental impacts.
<P>
In New England, for the low impact scenario, these avoided costs
will be zero, because nuclear fuel production, generation and
disposal will not be affected by reducing the energy generated
on the NEPOOL margin. However, in the high impact scenario where
we assume that the DSM will avoid nuclear generation, the avoided
costs could be as high as $1.2 billion, dwarfing the other non-price
benefits of DSM. Most of this impact is due to the cost of long-term
radon releases from tailings piles that we have assumed will be
unstable.
<A Name = "2.6"></A><H2>2.6 Electricity Transmission and Distribution Impacts </H2>
<P>
There are a number of adverse health and environmental impacts
associated with electricity transmission and distribution (T&amp;D)
systems. Over the past decade, concern over siting of new T&amp;D
lines has become one of the more controversial topics of the electricity
industry.
<P>
Transmission towers are required to have a right-of-way, which
is an open space on either side of the line, used primarily for
safety, protection and maintenance. Construction and maintenance
of the right-of-way may cause local adverse impacts on soil, drainage
patterns, flora and fauna. New techniques in right-of-way management
have served to decrease considerably the impact on wildlife habitats.
However, powerline construction practices vary widely; careful
operations are able to mitigate land impacts, while poorly executed
operations may impose significant environmental impacts.
<P>
<Center>
<IMG ALT="Table 2.5" SRC ="tab25.gif">
</Center>
<P>
The maintenance and operation of a transmission
line and its right-of-way can have a negative effect on local
surface water quality and aquatic ecology. Where service roads
cross wetlands and surface waters, soil erosion can induce elevated
turbidity, sedimentation, and toxic effects from herbicide runoff.
Land values in rural areas can also be affected by the siting
of transmission lines, due to the interference posed to agricultural
production, irrigation schemes, and aerial pesticide applications.
<P>
In addition, small amounts of ozone and substantially smaller
levels of nitrogen oxides are produced along the length of the
transmission line by a phenomenon known as corona, a &quot;high
energy discharge&quot; which occurs when air ionizes on the conductor
surface. Transmission lines also result in negative aesthetic
and noise impacts. The noise impacts of transmission lines are
result of the corona effect on high voltage transmission lines.
<P>
A part of the value of the land that is used for electricity T&amp;D
is reflected in the price that the utility must pay for the land.
However, a number of external costs remain. Converting open space
to an industrialized application involves a range of aesthetic,
recreational and ecosystem diversity impacts. In addition, T&amp;D
lines can have a number of impacts which lower the value of surrounding
properties.
<P>
Much of the present controversy about T&amp;D systems is caused
by the concern about adverse biological effects of exposure to
electromagnetic fields (EMF). Although the epidemiological data
remains inconclusive, several studies suggest that exposure to
EMF may cause increased cancer risk. The increased risk is especially
pronounced for childhood leukemia.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN13">13</A></SUP> When viewed as
a whole, the literature suggests that EMF may not necessarily
be a cancer initiator, but it may be a cancer promoter.
<P>
To our knowledge, there has not yet been any study which develops
monetary values for the land-use impacts of T&amp;D systems. There
are reasonable approaches to estimating monetary values, such
as assessing the reductions in market values of the land used
and the surrounding properties. 
<P>
However, such techniques have not yet been applied.
<P>
Similarly, we are not aware of any study that has developed monetary
values for EMF impacts. In fact, the very existence of EMF impacts
is still heavily debated. Nonetheless, some analysts and policy-makers
have proposed a policy of &quot;prudent avoidance&quot; as a guiding
approach in T&amp;D planning and siting. The underlying principle
behind this approach is that the scientific evidence suggests
that EMF health risks are credible, even if they have not been
fully quantified or demonstrated. As a result, it is prudent to
take reasonable steps to avoid EMF health risks. Some Public Service
Commissions such as Wisconsin now require utilities, when proposing
transmission line projects, to consider the number of persons
potentially exposed to EMF, and to use low-EMF design structures
where practical.
<P>
Because of the lack of information available regarding monetary
values for T&amp;D impacts, we do not recommend that any particular
value be used at this time in New England. However, we do recommend
that the policy of prudent avoidance be applied for all transmission
and siting considerations.
<A Name = "2.7"></A><H2>2.7 Job Creation and Economic Development</H2>
<P>
Demand-side management can contribute to economic development
and job creation in a number of ways. First, implementing DSM
programs creates jobs in a variety of trades, such as carpenters,
plumbers, contractors, architects, engineers, and the many jobs
related to the production of energy efficiency products. 
<P>
Second, DSM reduces the cost of electricity, and thereby creates
additional jobs through &quot;respending&quot; effects. Residential
customers will have lower electricity bills, which provides them
with more disposable income to spend on goods and services, thus
expanding local markets. Commercial and industrial customers will
have lower production costs on average, and will therefore be
more competitive. Businesses and industries may pass on these
cost savings to customers by lowering their product prices, thus
expanding their market shares. They may also pass on some of the
cost savings in the form of profits to investors, resulting in
increased disposable income, which may further stimulate economic
activity and growth.
<P>
Third, DSM stimulates the production of goods and services that
are well-placed for future markets, and creates a manufacturing
base and fosters skills in an commercial area that may support
the local economy in the long-term. Fourth, DSM can improve the
quality of power delivered to businesses and industries, by reducing
outages, voltage surges, and bad frequency control. Finally, by
improving environmental quality in general, DSM can act as a stimulus
for attracting new businesses and residents.
<P>
Most of the literature on this topic focuses on the first two
effects -- the creation of jobs through implementation of DSM
and through respending effects. In almost all cases these job
impacts are estimated using an input-output (I-O) model. I-O models
can compute the increase in output, income, and employment in
all sectors of the economy that are affected when money is spent
on a specific product.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN14">14</A></SUP> 
<P>
Typically, an I-O analysis is applied to compare two projects;
for example, a new power plant versus a package of DSM projects.
The employment effect of DSM is determined by first taking the
difference between gross jobs created by the DSM and the gross
jobs created by the alternative power plant. The <I>net employment
effect</I> of DSM is then determined by adding in the jobs created
by the respending effect. The same approach could be used to compare
two alternative resource plans, each with their own combination
of DSM and supply-side options.
<P>
Table 2.6 summarizes some results of selected DSM I-O employment
studies. For each study, the table presents gross, respending,
and net employment effects of DSM relative to different supply-side
resources. Table 2.6 also presents the gross employment effects
in terms of jobs per million dollars spent to acquire a resource.
Finally, Table 2.8 presents a ratio of jobs created by DSM over
jobs created by supply-side resources. This ratio includes the
respending effects in the DSM jobs, and therefore captures the
net DSM employment effect relative to supply-side resources.
<P>
As demonstrated in Table 2.6, most studies find that gross employment
effects from DSM are roughly comparable to gross employment effects
of supply-side resources, and that the respending effect accounts
for the primary difference in employment impacts. The DSM/supply
job ratio suggests that when the respending effect is taken into
account, DSM programs tend to generate roughly 1.5 to 4 times
more jobs than supply-side resources.
<P>
In addition, the results in Table 2.6 indicate the extent to which
estimates of employment impacts will differ widely depending upon
the type and size of the DSM program, and the size and type of
the alternative supply-side resource. The range of results presented
in Table 2.6 demonstrates the many variables and uncertainties
involved in estimating job impacts, and suggest that caution be
used in directly applying the results.
<P>
The number of jobs presented in the table above does not capture
a variety of qualitative aspects of job creation. Employment in
the energy efficiency sector has a number of advantages over employment
in traditional utility construction and maintenance. For example,
conservation employment tends to be more evenly distributed over
time, providing a more sustained stimulus to the economy. As another
example, DSM employment utilizes labor with generally applicable
skills (e.g., carpenters, electricians, architects) that are often
available in the local economy. In contrast, utility plant construction
requires highly specialized labor that often has to be imported.
<P>
Estimating the potential job impacts of DSM programs would require
an in-depth economic analysis of the specific programs and the
types of supply-side resources that they would avoid.
Nonetheless, it is useful to present a simple, illustrative calculation
of the amount of employment that might be generated by a hypothetical
100 MW of DSM, as presented in Table 2.2.
<P>
For our low impact scenario, we assume that the gross employment
of DSM is equivalent to the gross employment of the avoided supply-side
resource, which means that the only employment impacts will result
from respending effects. We then assume that New England DSM programs
will result in respending employment of roughly 5 jobs per million
(i.e., the lowest end of the range from Table 2.6), and that the
typical New England utility continues to spend roughly $50 million
per year for the next ten years. These assumptions imply that
our hypothetical DSM programs will result in the creation of approximately
2,500 local jobs over those ten years. To the extent that these
programs are more cost-effective, additional jobs will be created.
<P>
In the high impact scenario, we assume that DSM does not avoid
any new supply-side capacity, but only avoids marginal energy
on the NEPOOL system. As a result, there will be significantly
less gross employment from the supply-side, because the DSM is
only avoiding the fuel and operations and maintenance costs of
supply-side resources. We therefore assume that the gross employment
from the supply-side is roughly 10 jobs per million dollars spent
(the low end of the range from Table 2.6), and that the DSM gross
employment will be roughly 20 jobs per million dollars spent (taken
from the low to middle end of the range presented in Table 2.6).
Again assuming that roughly $50 million per year in DSM expenditures
for the next ten years, there would be a total of 5,000 more job-years
created form the gross DSM employment than the gross supply-side
employment. Finally, we assume that the respending effect will
result in 20 jobs per million dollars spent, resulting in an additional
10,000 job-years of employment. The total employment impact of
this high scenario would then be 15,000 job-years over the next
ten years.
<P>
It is also important to consider <I>whether</I>, and <I>how</I>,
employment impacts should be accounted for in evaluating DSM programs.
In general, employment impacts are not necessarily an externality
because they are accounted for in prices and in the economic marketplace
in general. Therefore, employment impacts cannot be simply added
to the &quot;total cost to society&quot; in the way that, for
example, environmental externalities can. However, there are many
instances where policy-makers decide that improving local economic
development is desirable. Accordingly, the job creation impacts
can be considered a &quot;policy factor,&quot; which is somehow
qualitatively accounted for when evaluating resource options.
Clearly, the creation of 2,500 to 10,000 job-years has important
public policy implications that should be accounted for in evaluating
DSM programs.

<P>
In addition, it is important to note that as New England utilities
implement DSM programs whose costs are close to avoided costs,
the employment effects from respending (the primary employment
benefits) will be significantly reduced. If DSM programs are implemented
that are significantly less than avoided costs, than employment
impacts should play a greater role in evaluating different resource
options.
<A Name = "2.8"></A><H2>2.8 Government Subsidies for Energy Resources</H2>
<P>
The U.S. energy market is supported by a host of subsidies that
affect the market prices and the mix of energy sources. For example:
<UL>
<LI>A variety of federal tax benefits are offered in the form
of preferential tax rates, tax exemptions, tax deferrals, tax
credits, and measures that reduce taxable income. Tax benefits
are probably the most pervasive form of energy subsidy. 
<LI>Government agency programs support different energy resources
by providing research and development, loan guarantees and other
grants, and maintenance of energy-related operations that supply
products and services to energy producers at low cost.
<LI>Some regulatory interventions constitute preferential treatment
of certain energy sources. For example, the Price-Anderson Act
of 1959 limits the liability of nuclear power accidents, significantly
reducing insurance or liability costs for nuclear power plants.
Other interventions include price and import/export regulations,
and government procurement guidelines.
<LI>State and local governments also provide subsidies, primarily
by exempting energy products from a sales tax, reducing income
and property taxes of utilities, and subsidizing the production
of raw energy materials. 
</UL>
<P>
A summary of the results of the most recent, comprehensive assessment
of federal subsidies for energy resources is provided in Table
2.7, which presents high and low estimates of annual federal subsidies
in 1989. (ASE and Koplow 1993) The high case estimates indicate
that federal energy subsidies were roughly $42 billion, with $21
billion of that going towards tax breaks, and $18 billion going
towards federal agency programs.
<P>
In general, nuclear and fossil fuels receive most of the federal
subsidies. The authors estimate that nuclear and coal fuels received
roughly 24 percent of the total federal subsidies each, while
oil and renewable energy receive roughly 2 percent each.<SUP>
<A HREF = "#FN15">15</A></SUP> As indicated in Table 2.7, the Price Anderson Act is
estimated to be the second largest single component of federal
subsidies to energy resources.
<P>
It would be difficult to identify any federal or state energy
subsidies that could be avoided by DSM programs on the NEPOOL
system. Nonetheless, these subsidies do represent a cost associated
with certain resource types. It is therefore useful to estimate
the magnitude of that cost on a per unit (i.e., cents/KWh) basis,
in order to compare this cost across different resource types.
<P>
For example, Table 2.7 indicates that total federal subsidies
in 1989 amounted to roughly $25 to $42 billion. The nuclear electricity
share of this was 24 percent, and nuclear electricity generation
in 1989 was 529 billion kWh. This implies a range of nuclear subsidies
of roughly 1.1 to 1.9 cents/kWh (in 1994$). These subsidies are
significant, given that the cost of nuclear fuel is roughly 1
cent/kWh.
<P>
Similarly, the coal electricity share of the total was 24 percent,
and U.S. coal-fired electricity generation in 1989 was 1,454 billion
kWh, implying a range of coal subsidies of roughly 0.4 to 0.7
cents/kWh (in 1994$). These subsidies are also significant, given
that the production costs of coal are roughly 1.5 to 2 cents/kWh.
<P>
It is also useful to estimate the potential impact of these subsidies
in the context of avoided costs of the hypothetical 100 MW of
DSM savings, and the associated 525 GWh of energy savings. For
the low impact scenario, we assume that the DSM avoids coal generation
entirely, and we assume the high estimate of coal subsidies, resulting
in roughly $3.8 million of federal subsidies. For the high impact
scenario, we assume that DSM avoids nuclear generation entirely,
and we assume the high estimate of nuclear subsidies, resulting
roughly $10.2 million of federal subsidies.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN16">16</A></SUP>
<P>
It is important to note that subsidies for energy facilities are
not externalities, because they actually represent a transfer
of costs from utility ratepayers to taxpayers. Nevertheless, reducing
federal subsidies can imply a positive welfare effect. Federal
energy subsidies may be appropriate when there are positive external
effects associated with the product being supported. However,
when this is not the case, subsidization leads to an inefficient
allocation of resources and hence a loss in welfare.
<A Name = "2.9"></A><H2>2.9 The Costs of Relying Upon Imported Oil</H2>
<P>
In the wake of the oil crises of the 1970's, some analysts have
claimed that there are large, measurable costs to dependence on
oil, beyond those reflected in the current price. The argument
is that the concentration of ownership of world oil supplies causes
vulnerability to future supply shocks. Use of fuels subject to
sudden disruptions then adds costs and risks to the economy as
a whole.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN17">17</A></SUP>
<P>
<Center>
<A HREF = "tab27.gif"><IMG ALT="Table 2.7" SRC ="tab27sm.gif"><P>

</Center>
<P>
To the extent that the consumption of foreign oil increases U.S. security needs, oil consumption gives
rise to externalities. A study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory
estimates an annual cost to the U.S. economy due to the monopolization
of the world oil industry, of roughly $100 billion to $400 billion
from 1972 to 1991. (Greene and Leiby 1993) This cost includes
monopoly-induced transfer of U.S. wealth to foreign oil producers,
loss of potential output due to the increased price of oil, and
macroeconomic adjustment costs precipitated by oil price shocks.
<P>
In addition, some analysts argue that military costs attributable
to oil dependence, and protection of U.S. interests in oil producing
countries, may equal billions of dollars per year. Furthermore,
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, costing about $1 billion annually,
is another cost to the U.S. government of reducing the risk of
oil supply. 
<P>
On the other hand, studies by Resources for the Future indicate
that the magnitudes of costs of reliance on imported oil are not
well understood. These studies find that the evidence does not
support a conclusion that the market fails to internalize the
risks of oil supply shocks. (Bohi and Toman 1992).
<P>
It would be difficult to identify any particular cost of relying
upon foreign oil that would be avoided by DSM programs on the
NEPOOL system. Nonetheless, these costs do represent a cost associated
with the use of oil. It is therefore useful to estimate the magnitude
of that cost on a per-unit (i.e., cents/kWh) basis, in order to
compare this cost with the cost of electricity in general. 
<P>
For this purpose, we assume a cost of relying upon imported oil
of $2.56 per barrel of oil, based on the studies of Broadman and
Hogan. (Broadman and Hogan 1988; Broadman and Hogan 1986) Assuming
a heat rate of 10,000 for residual oil units on the NEPOOL margin,
this implies a cost of 0.4 cents/kWh.
<P>
In New England, for the high impact scenario, we assume that the
DSM avoids oil generation entirely, resulting in roughly $2.2
million for the costs of imported oil. For the low impact scenario,
we assume that DSM avoids energy on the NEPOOL margin (which is
96 percent oil), resulting roughly $2.1 million of federal subsidies.
<P>
<A Name = "2.10"></A><H2>2.10 Resource Depletion</H2>
<P>
The fossil and nuclear fuels used to generate electricity in New
England represent a finite energy resource. While fossil fuel
deposits appear to be plentiful and inexpensive in the short-term,
the time is approaching when these fuels may become economically
scarce, and society will be forced to switch to higher-cost energy
alternatives. Given the importance of fossil fuels to nearly all
aspects of our economy, these costs could be enormous. In addition,
there may be no viable substitutes for fossil fuels in some applications,
resulting in even higher costs to society. 
<P>
The predominant school of thought regarding resource depletion
is the <I>neoclassical</I> approach, which affirms that technological
progress stemming from human ingenuity will overcome any imminent
resource scarcity. The price of a resource is assumed to comprise
two components: a marginal cost reflecting the cost of exploration,
extraction and production, and a societal cost representing depletion.
Thus, in the neoclassical model, the increasing price of a natural
resource, such as oil or gas, that is growing scarce triggers
mechanisms that serve to augment the resource base: increased
exploration, recycling, substitution, as well as technological
innovation.
<P>
There are, however, several reasons why the short-term market
price non-renewable energy resources may not include the societal
cost component associated with depletion: i) markets do not operate
with perfect efficiency; ii) there is never perfect information
regarding the resource base; iii) the price of a resource is often
affected by extraneous factors such as political incentives, international
agreements, and collusion; and iv) resource production is often
influenced by short-term political action which may expedite resource
depletion, as seen in the Russian oil industry. 
<P>
The neoclassical model is sharply contrasted by the <I>biophysical</I>
approach to resource scarcity, which accounts explicitly for the
use of low-entropy energy and matter in both the energy resource
production process and in the economy as a whole. The biophysical
model regards high-quality energy and matter, which are elements
of natural capital, as the fundamental constituents of the labor,
capital and technological progress that drive our economy. The
<I>energy-return-on-investment</I> (EROI) index (the ratio of
the energy embodied in resources to the direct and indirect energy
input required to extract and refine them) used in the biophysical
model shows signs of depletion for oil and gas. 
<P>
The biophysical model to resource scarcity appears more consistent
with the goals of <I>sustainable development</I> and <I>intergenerational
equity</I>. Sustainable development strives to ensure that subsequent
generations have the same amount of natural capital (fuels, species
diversity, waste assimilation through the Earth's biogeochemical
cycles, etc.) at their disposal as previous ones. Intergenerational
equity promotes the equal treatment of all generations. 
<P>
The assignment of a monetary value to the costs of resource depletion
requires a number of assumptions and inputs, many of which are
clouded by uncertainty and imperfect information. These inputs
range from estimates of current reserves and undiscovered reserves
to the costs of technological change, and from the future demand
for resources to the appropriate discount rate. While there is
a vast body of literature on the subject of resource depletion,
there have been few studies that have determined the monetary
value of the costs of resource depletion for nuclear or fossil
fuels. One such study, by Hohmeyer, advocates penalizing the extraction
of fossil fuels by imposing a <I>reinvestment surcharge</I>, that
is explicitly included in the market price. Hohmeyer's methodology,
while requiring several estimates of future quantities which are
open to debate, is certainly consistent with the aims of sustainable
development and intergenerational equity. 
<P>
While the depletion of oil causes concern in today's society,
electricity production is only of secondary importance in this
issue, since it is responsible for only 4 percent of U.S. oil
consumption. Furthermore, most of the oil that is burned in power
generation is residual oil, which is a by-product of oil production.
However, if environmental sustainability policies begin to influence
oil consumption over the medium-term, electricity (and residual
oil) consumption may assume a more prominent role in the depletion
and the long-term costs of oil. Consequently, the resource depletion
costs of oil-fired electricity are likely to be low in the short-term,
but more pronounced in the long-term.
<P>
Coal is a major fuel for electric utilities in U.S., with electric
utilities consuming a very significant portion of U.S. coal (86%).
Consequently, reduction of electricity use may have a very significant
impact on coal production and eventually on coal depletion. However,
U.S. coal reserves are relatively plentiful. The current reserves-to-production
ratio, based on the Department of Energy estimates of recoverable
reserves, exceeds 150 years. Consequently, the depletion costs
of coal-fired electricity are likely to be low in the short-term,
but from a long-term sustainability perspective, coal depletion
could have a significant environmental externality cost associated
with it.
<P>
Natural gas also plays an important role in power generation.
Power generators, including independent producers, were responsible
for 14% of all natural gas consumed in the U.S. in 1992. The Department
of Energy projects that in 2010, power generation will be responsible
for over 20 percent of gas use in the U.S., given the increasing
reliance being placed upon gas. The natural gas industry currently
operates at a reserves-to-production ratio of 9 years. Although
U.S. gas reserves are significant, the National Petroleum Council
projects that by 2010, the gas industry will operate at a reserves-to-production
ratio of about 7 years. As a result, the costs associated with
natural gas depletion could be significant, both in the short-term
and long-term.
<A Name = "2.11"></A><H2>2.11 Benefits to Low-Income Customers</H2>
<P>
DSM programs targeted to low-income customers
in New England offer a variety of societal benefits to those customers
and the community in general. DSM programs can improve the amenities
and comforts available to low-income customers, because such customers
are often unable to afford the full amount of electricity services,
and their electricity service is sometimes disconnected due to
inability to pay their bills. Some of the benefits of low-income
DSM programs include the following:
<UL>
<LI>Reduced health impacts, ranging from the common cold to mortality
caused by hypothermia, as a result of customers being able to
properly heat their living spaces. (Brockway 1993a) 
<LI>Reduced dangers of fires and hazardous fumes from alternative
heating sources such as stoves and electric heaters. (Colton 1993)<SUP><A HREF = "#FN18">18</A></SUP>
<LI>Reduced forced mobility and homelessness, as a result of customers
being more able to make payments for rent and mortgages. (Brockway
1993b; Colton 1993)
<LI>Customers are more able to afford expenditures which improve
the quality of their health, such as better nutrition and preventive
health measures. (Cambridge Systematics 1994b)
<LI>Support for, and cooperation with, other low-income services
such as fuel assistance and Community Action Programs.
<LI>A host of less tangible benefits, such as improved goodwill
between the customers and the utility, and improved self-esteem
of low-income households. (Brockway 1993b) 
</UL>
<P>
A few studies have evaluated the extent to which particular low-income
DSM programs result in some of the benefits described above. For
example, a study of the U.S. Department of Energy's Weatherization
Assistance Program found that the program provided safety repairs
to heating systems in seven percent of the homes, as well as additional
safety repairs (e.g., carbon monoxide tests, window and door locks,
smoke detectors) in 27 percent of the homes. (Oak Ridge 1993)
The same study found that the Weatherization Assistance Program
(which reached 198,000 dwellings) prevented at least 4,000 forced
changes in occupancy in its first year. (Oak Ridge 1993) As another
example, a survey of participants in low-income DSM programs in
New York found that the participants had lower rates of colds,
influenza or bronchitis, and reported a much lower rate of heating
with the stove or oven.
<P>
The recent Oak Ridge study is the only effort we have seen to
attempt to place a dollar value on the non-energy benefits of
low-income DSM programs described above. The authors found that,
despite a good deal of anecdotal evidence of the non-energy benefits,
there was little evidence to support the assignment of dollar
values to the benefits.
<P>
Nevertheless, the literature indicates that non-energy benefits
of low-income customers do exist. In addition, public utility
commissions in Kansas, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New York and Texas
have acknowledged that such benefits exist. The Texas Public Service
Commission has explicitly allowed utilities to implement low-income
DSM programs that exceed the Total Resource Cost Test, on the
basis of the non-energy benefits. However, the Commission has
not specified by <I>how much</I> the utilities should be able
to exceed the test.
<P>
We recommend that the non-energy benefits of low-income DSM programs
be accounted for by applying an adder of 10 percent to the avoided
cost (i.e., the cost savings) of each program. Such an adder is
justified because it is clear that non-price benefits of DSM programs
do exist and are significant, even if they have not yet been adequately
monetized. Obviously, such an adder is approximate, but we believe
that it is the most appropriate number available at this time.
Using a rough adder offers the advantages of being easily applicable,
of scaling with the size of the DSM program, and of providing
New England utilities with an important planning benchmark.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN19">19</A></SUP>
<P>
In order to make an illustrative calculation of the potential
impacts of the low-income DSM adder, we assume an avoided cost
of roughly 3 cents/kWh in New England. The hypothetical 100 MW
of DSM would result in 525 GWh of energy savings, which would
result in avoided cost savings of roughly $16,125,000 per year.
For our low and high impact scenarios, we assume that low-income
DSM program savings represent 1 percent and 10 percent of total
DSM program savings, respectively.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN20">20</A></SUP> The 10 percent
adder would then represent roughly $16,125 in additional benefits
in the low impact scenario, and roughly $161,250 in additional
benefits in the high impact scenario.
<A Name = "2.12"></A><H2>2.12 The Costs Associated with Outstanding Bills</H2>
<P>
DSM programs can also enable a utility to reduce costs associated
with outstanding electric bills. By reducing the cost of electricity
service, and by improving customer payment practices, DSM programs
can increase some customer's ability to make timely payments on
their monthly bills.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN21">21</A></SUP> As a result, the utility can
reduce a variety of costs associated with payment-troubled customers,
including: the lost time value of money associated with arrears,
credit and collection expenses, bad debt, the costs of implementing
payment plans, and regulatory expenses associated with payment-troubled
customers. (Colton 1993)
<P>
A number of studies have estimated the ability of DSM programs
to reduce customer arrears, usually by monitoring the results
of actual low-income DSM programs. These studies have shown that
DSM programs can reduce customer arrears by anywhere from $3 to
$176 per customer, with most studies showing savings on the order
of $30-$40 per customer, depending upon the DSM program and the
customer's payment history.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN22">22</A></SUP> In addition, two studies
have indicated that the variable costs associated with credit
and collection expenses are approximately $68 to $85 per customer.
(Colton 1994b and Central Maine Power 1993)
<P>
Some public service commissions (e.g., Texas) have found that
DSM programs can reduce the costs of outstanding electric bills,
and that utilities should therefore account for this benefit of
low-income DSM programs. However, we do not know of any commission
that has required utilities to quantify the extent of this benefit.
<P>
The magnitude of costs associated with outstanding bills can be
significant. For example, in 1990 for BECo:
<UL>
<LI>average bills that were 60 days or more in arrears amounted
to roughly $31.6 million. 
<LI>The total number of customers given a termination notice was
533,392. 
<LI>The total number that actually were terminated was 12,388
-- roughly two percent of all residential customers. 
<LI>Total residential charges to bad debt was roughly $8.8 million
(NARUC 1992). 
</UL>
<P>
The literature indicates that well-designed DSM programs can help
utilities to reduce some of the costs of outstanding bills. Therefore,
we recommend that a 5 percent adder be included with the benefits
of low-income programs, as an approximation of the savings from
reducing the costs of outstanding bills. Obviously, such an adder
is approximate, but we believe that it is the most appropriate
number available at this time. Using a rough adder offers the
advantages of being easily applicable, of scaling with the size
of the DSM program, and of providing New England utilities with
an important planning benchmark.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN23">23</A></SUP>
<P>
In order to make an illustrative calculation of the potential
impacts of the 5 percent adder, we assume an avoided cost of roughly
3 cents/kWh in New England. The hypothetical 100 MW of DSM would
result in 525 GWh of energy savings, which would result in avoided
cost savings of roughly $16,125,000 per year. For our low and
high impact scenarios, we assume that low-income DSM program savings
represent 1 percent and 10 percent of total DSM program savings,
respectively. The 5 percent adder would then represent roughly
$9,675 of additional benefits in the low impact scenario, and
roughly $96,750 of additional benefits in the high impact scenario.
<P>
<A Name = "2.13"></A><H2>2.13 DSM Spillover and Market Transformation</H2>
<P>
DSM can sometimes result in &quot;spillover&quot; effects, i.e.,
impacts beyond just the specific end-uses targeted and the particular
program participants. Spillover effects can occur in three ways:
(a) when participants adopt non-program DSM measures, (b) when
non-participants adopt program measures, and (c) when non-participants
adopt non-program measures. In addition, some DSM programs result
in &quot;market transformation,&quot; where the commercialization
and market adoption of energy efficiency equipment and practices
are advanced to the point where they reach non-participants, and
even other service territories. (Cambridge Systematics 1994a)
<P>
DSM programs specifically designed to promote market transformation
have received increased interest lately, in part because they
may be more appealing to utilities if they are exposed to increased
retail competition. Market transformation programs may be seen
as a relatively low-cost way of providing customer services, and
may enable utilities to move away from customer-specific programs
to those that are based on a more comprehensive market approach.
(Feldman 1994; Kitchin 1993)
<P>
In general, spillover effects can be seen as the opposite of the
free-rider effect (i.e., when a customer benefits from a DSM program,
even though he or she would have adopted the efficiency measure
without the program). It has become general practice for utilities
to subtract the savings associated with free-riders from their
DSM program estimates, but not the costs. In the same way, it
is appropriate for utilities to add the savings associated with
spillover effects.
<P>
Until recently, there has been little attention paid to estimating
the magnitude of spillover effects from different DSM programs.
(Cambridge Systematics 1994a) It is difficult to generalize about
the magnitude of spillover effects, because they will be highly
dependent upon the specific DSM program, the specific end-use
measure, and even the particular market conditions in the utility's
service territory and surrounding regions. 
<P>
Nevertheless, given the size of the New England service territory
and the extent of its DSM programs, some of these programs are
likely to result in some level of spillover effects. Market transformation
impacts are likely to be the most significant type of spillover
effects, because they tend to be long-lasting and to affect more
than specific participating or non-participating customers. Accordingly,
we recommend that all DSM programs that are expected to transform
the market for energy efficiency products or services be credited
with a 20 percent adder to its energy (kWh) and capacity (KW)
savings. For example, this credit could be applied to Residential
and Commercial/Industrial New Construction programs.
<P>
Obviously, such an adder is approximate, but we believe that it
is the most appropriate number available at this time. The 20
percent adder should also be seen as a minimum planning <I>objective</I>.
In other words, because of the many benefits of market transformation
programs, utilities should be designing their programs with the
<I>intent of achieving</I> market transformation. The literature
on this subject suggests that well-designed market transformation
programs should be able to achieve at least an additional 20 percent
of typical DSM savings.
<P>
In order to make an illustrative calculation of the potential
impacts of the 20 percent adder, we assume an avoided cost of
roughly 3 cents/kWh. The hypothetical 100 MW of DSM would result
in 525 GWh of energy savings, which would result in avoided cost
savings of roughly $16,125,000 per year. For our low and high
impact scenarios, we assume that market transformation DSM program
savings represent 12 percent and 50 percent of total DSM program
savings, respectively.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN24">24</A></SUP> The 20 percent adder would
then represent roughly $387,000 and roughly $1,612,500 of additional
benefits in the low and impact scenarios, respectively. 
<A Name = "2.14"></A><H2>2.14 Additional Benefits of DSM</H2>
<P>
DSM can often provide benefits to participating customers, beyond
those associated with reduced electricity bills. These benefits,
are often referred to as &quot;non-energy&quot; benefits, include,
for example, 
<UL>
<LI>reduced water and sewer bills as a result of measures to reduce
electric water heater consumption; 
<LI>reduced lighting maintenance costs for commercial customers
who install long-lived fluorescent lighting; 
<LI>reduced air conditioning costs as a result of installing fluorescent
lamps that produce less heat; and
<LI>reduced heating costs (oil, gas or electric) as a result of
building shell measures installed to reduce air conditioning needs.
</UL>
<P>
In 1988, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities ruled
that in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of DSM resources, utilities
should include &quot;any known, quantifiable, and significant
end-user benefits... resulting from the installation of a particular
demand-side option.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#FN25">25</A></SUP> 
<P>
Commonwealth Electric Company (ComElectric) recently applied this
concept in a request for proposals (RFP) to purchase DSM resources
from Energy Service Companies and customers. The RFP allowed sellers
of DSM to identify non-energy benefits that could be used in ranking
the different proposals. ComElectric received proposals which
claimed several types of non-energy benefits. At the time of drafting
this study the proposals from the energy service companies were
considered confidential, and are therefore unavailable.
<P>
The &quot;value tests&quot; proposed in the last few years by
Benjamin Hobbs (1991), Barakat &amp; Chamberlain (Chamberlain
et. al. 1993) and others expand the traditional &quot;total resource
cost&quot; approach to cost-benefit analysis of DSM. These tests
attempt to include impacts of DSM upon participants through estimates
of changes in consumer surplus. Thus, for example, if after the
installation of a DSM measure, the participant consumes more &quot;energy
service&quot;, there may be an increase in welfare to the customer.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN26">26</A></SUP>
<P>
DSM programs can also have direct environmental and health benefits
beyond the environmental impacts of avoided electricity generation.
For example, a Tellus study for the Electric Power Research Institute
found that utility-sponsored replacement of old fluorescent light
ballasts is likely to provide net environmental benefits because
the PCBs in the old ballasts are more likely to be handled properly
by an organized program than if left to the normal replacement
cycle. Similarly, refrigerator replacement in a DSM program can
include a systematic means of capturing CFCs in the refrigerant
and perhaps even the foam that might otherwise be released to
the atmosphere. (Tellus 1992)
<P>
The non-energy and direct environmental benefits of DSM will be
measure-specific, and also customer specific. In addition, the
literature on the subject is quite limited. Therefore, it is difficult
to even make an illustrative estimate of the potential impact
of New England DSM. The best way to quantify these benefits would
be to follow Commonwealth Electric's example of requiring Energy
Service Companies to develop quantitative estimates as a part
of their DSM program proposals.<P>

<A Name = "3.0"></A><H1>3. SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</H1>
<P>
The research summarized in the previous chapter leads us to certain
specific conclusions and recommendations for evaluating the non-price
benefits of DSM programs in New England. In this chapter, we will
discuss the inferences from our analysis for valuation methodology
as well as the potential benefits from DSM under low/high impact
scenarios. In the last section, we offer recommendations for future
research priorities.
<A Name = "3.1"></A><H2>3.1 Valuation Methodology for Monetizing Non-Price Factors</H2>
<P>
Table 3.1 presents a broad summary of the information available,
the methods used, and the range of results for monetizing non-price
factors. The first column describes the extent to which the particular
impact of interest can be <I>quantified</I>. For example, it is
relatively easy to quantify the amount of NO<SUB>x</SUB> that
is emitted from power plants, as well as the environmental impacts
of those emissions in terms of increased acid rain or ground-level
ozone. Therefore, we indicate that the &quot;quantification information&quot;
for NO<SUB>x</SUB> is &quot;good.&quot; For other pollutants,
such as lead, the amount of emissions from power plants are less
well understood at this time, but the potential impacts on human
health are relatively well understood; so lead is rated as &quot;fair.&quot;
<P>

</Center>
<P>
The second column in Table 3.1 presents the methods that are applied
to monetize, or otherwise account for, the impact of each non-price
factor. For some factors (e.g., air pollutants), economic approaches
such as &quot;regulator's revealed preferences&quot; are used.
For other non-price factors (e.g., radiological impacts), damage
costs are used, based on quantified environmental and health impacts.
Some factors (e.g., low-income DSM benefits) could be accounted
for using approximate &quot;adders,&quot; which are based on our
review of DSM analyses provided in the literature that we reviewed.
<P>
The third column of Table 3.1 presents our conclusions regarding
the current ability to monetize the costs or benefits of each
non-price factor. For example, for certain criteria air pollutants
it is relatively easy to quantify their environmental impacts,
and to identify their costs based on regulator's revealed preferences.
Therefore, we conclude that the &quot;monetization ability&quot;
is &quot;good&quot; for such pollutants. On the other hand, for
other non-price factors (e.g., the benefits of low-income DSM),
monetary estimates have not been developed in much depth. We conclude
that, at present, such factors have &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;fair&quot;
monetization ability.
<P>
The fourth column in Table 3.1 presents
the range of monetary values (in c/kWh) of each non-price factor,
where appropriate. The values presented are based on the costs
associated with the relevant type of resource. For example, the
monetary values for criteria air pollutants are based on marginal
emissions from NEPOOL; the values for heavy metals are based on
emissions from coal plants; and the values of radiological impacts
are based on nuclear plants.
<P>
In a few cases, it may not be possible or appropriate to account
for non-price factors in monetary terms. For example, the benefits
of low-income DSM have been clearly demonstrated in the literature;
however, there has been little success in quantifying those benefits
in monetary terms. Therefore, we propose that for such non-price
factors a simple percentage adder to the direct avoided cost benefits
of the programs be applied. These recommendations are summarized
in the fifth column in Table 3.1.
<P>
Finally, the last column in Table 3.1 describes what <I>type</I>
of benefit or cost the particular non-price factor represents.
For example, environmental impacts (e.g., radiological impacts)
are considered externalities which can be directly added to the
total resource cost of a particular electricity resource. Other
impacts (e.g., job creation) may not technically be an externality
which can be added to the total resource costs, but may be considered
anyway as an important &quot;policy factor.&quot; Other factors
(e.g., spillover effects of DSM) represent utility savings, and
can be accounted for similarly to traditional utility savings.
<P>
The results in Table 3.1 indicate that criteria air pollutants
and greenhouse gases represent the largest costs, out of all the
costs that were monetized. Heavy metals can alias have a significant
cost, depending upon the source of generation. The costs associated
with radiological impacts span an enormous range, and are quite
uncertain at this time. Monetary values for land, water and transmission
and distribution were not available from the literature that we
reviewed, although the impacts can be potentially large. Monetary
values were also not available for the benefits of low-income
DSM, the benefits relating to outstanding bills, and DSM spillover
effects; however, we recommend that approximate percentage adders
be used to account for these benefits when evaluating resource
options.
<A Name = "3.2"></A><H2>3.2 Illustration of Potential Impacts of DSM Savings</H2>
<P>
The results of our analysis suggest that the non-price benefits
of DSM currently unaccounted for in the planning process can be
quite large. On the basis of the research summarized in the previous
chapter, we estimate that the lower and upper bound of the total
annual non-priced of these programs benefits (excluding nuclear)
are $19 million and $45 million, respectively. as shown in Figure
3.1. The basis for these results are explained further by Table
3.2 which presents illustrative calculations of the potential
impacts of each non-price factor, in monetary terms, of 100 MW
of DSM savings on the NEPOOL system. This indicates the potential
magnitude of the societal benefits of each non-price factor, under
low impact and high impact scenarios.
<P>
The actual costs and benefits of each
non-price factor will depend not only upon the monetary values
assigned to them, but also to the specific type and design of
DSM program and the particular supply-side resource that the program
displaces. Performing such calculations for specific DSM programs
and supply-side resources is beyond the scope of this study. However,
it is nonetheless informative to estimate the costs and benefits
based on generic DSM programs and generic supply-side resources,
using as much NEPOOL information as is readily available. As a
result, the impacts presented in Table 3.2 should not be seen
as definitive estimates of costs and benefits to New England utilities,
but rather as approximations to illustrate the range of potential
impacts.
<P>
<Center>
<A HREF = "tab32.gif"><IMG ALT="Table 3.1" SRC ="tab32sm.gif"><P>
Click to display large table</A>
</Center>
<P>
For our low impact scenario, we simply assume that the DSM savings
avoids the likely supply-side resource which would have the lowest
impact for each particular non-price factor. For example, for
criteria air pollutants, DSM that avoids generation and capacity
from new natural gas combined cycle units will have relatively
low benefits, because gas units emit relatively low amounts of
such pollutants.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN27">27</A></SUP>
<P>
For our high impact scenario, we simply assume that the DSM savings
avoids the likely supply-side resource which would have the highest
impact for each particular non-price factor. In this case, for
radiological impacts we assume that the DSM savings avoid capacity
and generation from a nuclear plant, because this obviously would
result in the greatest benefits. Similarly, for heavy metals we
assume that the DSM savings avoid generation from a coal plant,
because coal plants emit the most significant levels of heavy
metal pollutants.<P>
<Center>
<H3>Figure 3.1: Breakdown of societal benefits associated with
New England's DSM programs under low and high impact scenarios</H3>
<IMG ALT="Figure 3.1" SRC ="fig31.gif">
</Center>
<P>
Table 3.2 demonstrates that reductions in criteria air pollutants
through our hypothetical DSM could result in savings of roughly
$7 to $17 million. Reductions in heavy metals could result in
savings of roughly $0.3 to $1.5 million. The estimated savings
from avoiding radiological impacts are dominated by the costs
associated with unstabilized uranium mill tailings piles. Table
3.2 also demonstrates that our recommended percentage adders for
low-income DSM, benefits relating to outstanding bills, and DSM
spillover will not necessarily be large relative to other externalities,
but may nonetheless be important relative to the size of the specific
DSM program budgets. These recommended DSM adders may be more
important for the messages that they send to utility planners,
rather than the actual amount of money involved.
<P>
Actual DSM savings are likely to have impacts somewhere between
the low and high scenarios that we present. More specific and
focused estimates of the potential impacts should be determined
through more detailed future studies. In addition, since different
avoided resources are used to calculate the impact of each group
of non-price factors, these results should not be added across
different non-price factors.
<A Name = "3.3"></A><H2>3.3 Recommended Research Priorities</H2>
<P>
In the following list, we summarize the basis for each of these
research recommendations.
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Criteria air pollutants and greenhouse gases</B>: Given
that much of the information necessary to monetize these impacts
is already available, we recommend a low<B> </B>research priority.
<P><LI><B>Heavy Metals</B>: While additional research could significantly
reduce the uncertainty associated with current estimates of monetary
impacts of heavy metals. We conclude that reduced uncertainty
about the monetary impacts of heavy metals may not have a significant
impact on DSM planning in the short-term.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN28">28</A></SUP> Therefore,
we recommend a low to medium research priority
<P><LI><B>Water Use Impacts</B>: We recommend a medium to high research
priority because the environmental costs could be significant,
and the research necessary to monetize the impacts is relatively
low.
<P><LI><B>Land Use Impacts</B>: We recommend a high<B> </B>research
priority because of the lack of research into this area.
<P><LI><B>Radiological Impacts of Nuclear Power</B>: We recommend
a high research priority for the uranium fuel supply, the risk
of nuclear accident, and the costs of waste disposal. These costs
are not yet fully understood, and could have important impacts
on electricity planning in general. Future research regarding
the emissions from routine reactor operations and decommissioning
should have a medium priority.
<P><LI><B>Electricity Transmission and Distribution</B>: We recommend
a high<B> </B>research priority because very little research has
been done to date, and additional research can resolve some issues
which may have significant implications for electricity planning
in general.
<P><LI><B>Job Creation and Economic Development</B>: Given the public
policy implications of DSM employment impacts, and the size of
New England's investments in DSM, we believe that further research
in this area should be given a medium priority. We do not recommend
a high priority primarily because employment impacts are not necessarily
an externality. On the other hand, it is important to more fully
understand the general economic development benefits that DSM
offers by lowering energy costs to businesses and households.
<P><LI><B>Government Subsidies for Energy Resources</B>: We recommend
a low<B> </B>research priority, primarily because subsidies are
not an externality, and DSM programs are unlikely to have a significant
effect on federal energy subsidies.
<P><LI><B>The Costs of Relying Upon Imported Oil</B>: We recommend
a medium<B> </B>research priority because a significant portion
of New England's fuel mix. We also recommend that the risks associated
with reliance on foreign oil be appropriately addressed in utilities'
planning models.
<P><LI><B>Resource Depletion</B>: Despite the fact that there are
few, if any, signs of fossil fuel scarcity in the short-term,
we recommend that New England utilities consider the possible
future effects of oil and gas depletion. Regional utilities can
act by implementing an aggressive DSM regimen, promoting supply-side
energy efficiency, and investing in renewable energy research
and development. Further research should focus on applying Hohmeyer's
sustainability initiative to the U.S., and on obtaining improved
oil and gas reserve estimates. 
<P><LI><B>Benefits to Low-Income Customers</B>: While there currently
exists a significant amount of research regarding the existence
of low-income DSM benefits, there is very little information available
to develop monetary values of these benefits. Therefore, more
research is warranted on this important topic. On the other hand,
many of the low-income benefits could be represented with the
10 percent adder to avoided costs. Therefore, we recommend that
this topic receive a medium research priority. 
<P><LI><B>The Costs Associated with Outstanding Bills</B>: Because
of the potential reductions in costs to utilities, more research
is warranted on this topic. On the other hand, many of the benefits
could be represented with the 5 percent adder to avoided costs.
Therefore, we recommend that this topic receive a medium<B> </B>research
priority.
<P><LI><B>DSM Spillover and Market Transformation</B>: Given the
potential magnitude of additional savings available from spillover
effects, we recommend that this topic be given a high research
priority. There are currently a number of studies (in Massachusetts,
California, Wisconsin, and nationally) being undertaken to address
the potential magnitude of DSM spillover effects.
<P><LI><B>Additional Benefits of DSM</B>: The non-energy and direct
environmental impacts of DSM programs could provide significant
benefits to New England utilities and their customers. However,
we recommend that this topic area be given a relatively low research
priority, because of the potential for utilizing Energy Service
Companies to conduct customer-specific and measure-specific estimates.
</UL>
<P>
Beyond these <I>research </I>priorities<I>, </I>we note that the
continued implementation of DSM programs by New England Utilities
should be a <I>policy </I>priority. In considering various proposals
for restructuring the electric industry in New England, it will
be important to keep in view the full range of non-price benefits,
environmental. economic, and societal, that are associated with
energy efficiency.

Global Warming:
A Boon for Humans and Other Animals* 

Thomas Gale Moore
Senior Fellow 
Hoover Institution

				Abstract

     Contrary to the doom and gloom scenarios that
     environmentalists propound, both evidence and theory suggest
     that global warming would in general be beneficial for
     mankind.  Simple logic indicates that most of modern man's
     activities would be unaffected by warming of 5 to 9 degrees
     Fahrenheit.  Agriculture and some services might actually
     benefit.  Moreover, past history shows two periods that were
     significantly warmer than today and during both eras mankind
     flourished.  The first epoch, which has been dubbed by
     climatologists "The Climatic Optimum," brought temperatures
     which were as warm as the median prediction for the next
     century.  During this period, Homo Sapiens shifted from
     surviving in small tribes through hunting and gathering to
     settled farming communities and from the stone age to the
     bronze age.  During the second warming, "The Little Climate
     Optimum," Europe enjoyed the High Middle Ages and went on
     one of the largest building sprees ever recorded.

Why Global Warming Would be Good for You

     Climate extremes would trigger meteorological chaos ---
     raging hurricanes such as we have never seen, capable of
     killing millions of people; uncommonly long, record-breaking
     heat waves; and profound drought that could drive Africa and
     the entire Indian subcontinent over the edge into mass
     starvation. ...  Even if we could stop all greenhouse gas
     emissions today, we would still be committed to a
     temperature increase worldwide of two to four degrees
     Fahrenheit by the middle of the twenty-first century. It
     would be warmer then than it has been for the past two
     million years. Unchecked it would match nuclear war in its
     potential for devastation.1
          - Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell

Senator Mitchell's forecast and his history are both wrong. Warmer
periods bring benign rather than more violent weather. Milder
temperatures will induce more evaporation from oceans and thus more
rainfall---where it will fall we cannot be sure but the earth as a
whole should receive greater precipitation. Meteorologists now believe
that any rise in sea levels over the next century will be at most a
foot or more, not twenty.2 In addition, Mitchell flunks history:
around 6,000 years ago the earth sustained temperatures that were
probably more than four degrees Fahrenheit hotter than those of the
twentieth century, yet mankind flourished. The Sahara desert bloomed
with plants, and water loving animals such as hippopotamuses wallowed
in rivers and lakes. Dense forests carpeted Europe from the Alps to
Scandinavia. The Midwest of the United States was somewhat drier than
it is today, similar to contemporary western Kansas or eastern
Colorado; but Canada enjoyed a warmer climate and more rainfall.

Raising the specter of disaster as well, Vice President Al Gore has
called the threat of global warming "the most serious problem our
civilization faces."3 In fact, he has styled those who dispute it as
"self-interested" and compared them to spokesmen for the tobacco
industry who have questioned the relation of smoking to cancer. But
Gore is misinformed; many disinterested scientists, including
climatologists with no financial interest other than preventing
wasteful expenditures of society's limited resources, question the
evidence and the models that underlie the warming hypothesis.

In fact, the evidence supporting the claim that the earth has grown
warmer is shaky; the theory is weak; and the models on which the
conclusions are based cannot even replicate the current climate. It is
asserted, for example, that over the last hundred years the average
temperature at the earth's surface has gone up by 0.5 degrees
Centigrade or about 1 degree Fahrenheit. Given the paucity of data in
the Southern Hemisphere, the evidence that in the United States, with
the best records, temperatures have failed to rise; the British naval
records that find no significant change in temperatures at sea since
the mid- 1800s; and that the reported increases occurred mainly prior
to 1940 -- before the rapid rise in CO2 -- the public is entitled to
be wary. Moreover, even the National Academy of Sciences is skeptical
of the validity of the computer models and warns that the modeling of
clouds -- a key factor -- is inadequate and poorly understood.4

The dire forecasts of global warming hinge on a prediction that human
activity will provoke a continued upsurge in atmospheric carbon
dioxide. Many environmentalists believe that the burning of fossil
fuels, the release of methane from agricultural activities, and the
escape of other chemicals into the air over the next few decades will
lead to an effective doubling of greenhouse gases sometime in the next
century. Studies of carbon (CO and CO2) in the atmosphere show that at
times in the last 8,000 years the level has been substantially higher
than it is today and greater than it is likely to reach any time
soon. Although fluctuations in CO2 correlate with climate shifts, the
record cannot distinguish whether they followed the temperature
changes or preceded them.6 Theory suggests either is possible.

What is well known is that climate changes. The world has shifted from
periods that were considerably warmer--during the Mesozoic era when
the dinosaurs thrived the earth appears to have been about 18 degrees
Fahrenheit warmer than now--to spells that were substantially colder,
such as the Ice Ages when huge glaciers submerged much of the Northern
Hemisphere.  One paleoclimatologist estimated that, during the
Precambrian period, the polar regions were about 36 degrees Fahrenheit
colder than they are in the contemporary world.  During the last
interglacial, about 130,000 years ago or about when modern man was
first exploring the globe, the average temperature in Europe was at
least 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than at present.
Hippopotamuses, lions, rhinoceroses and elephants roamed the English
countryside. Areas watered today by the monsoons in Africa and east
Asia enjoyed even more rainfall then. Indeed during the last 12,000
years, that is since the end of the last glacial period, the globe has
alternated between times substantially warmer and epochs that were
noticeably cooler.

An examination of the record of the last twelve millennia reveals that
mankind prospered during the warm periods and suffered during the cold
ones. Transitions from a warm to a cold period or vice-versa were
difficult for people who lived in climates that were adversely
affected yet benefited others who inhabited regions in which the
weather improved. On average, however, humans gained during the
centuries in which the earth enjoyed higher temperatures. In writing
about the effect of climate change on human development, Senator and
now Vice-President Al Gore admits: 

	The archaeological and anthropological records indicate 
	that each time the ice retreated [during the ice ages], 
	the primitive peoples of the Eurasian landmass grew more 
	populous and their culture more advanced.  Then, 40,000
	years ago, the so-called cultural explosion of tools and 
	jewelry may have coincided with an unusually warm millen-
	nium in Europe.10

		Expected Effects of Global Warming

Although most of the forecasts of global warmingÕs repercussions have
been dire, an examination of the likely effects suggests little basis
for that gloomy view. Climate affects principally agriculture,
forestry, and fishing. Manufacturing, most service industries, and
nearly all extractive industries are immune to climate
shifts. Factories can be built in northern Sweden or Canada or in
Texas, Central America, or Mexico.  Banking, insurance, medical
services, retailing, education and a wide variety of other services
can prosper as well in warm climates (with air-conditioning) as in
cold (with central heating). A few services, such as transportation
and tourism, may be more susceptible to weather. A warmer climate will
lower transportation costs: less snow and ice will torment truckers
and automobile drivers; fewer winter storms - bad weather in the
summer has less disruptive effects and is over quickly - will disrupt
air travel; a lower incidence of storms and less fog will make water
transport less risky. Hotter temperatures will leave mining and the
extractive industries largely unaffected; they might even benefit oil
drilling in the northern seas and mining in the mountains. A warmer
climate could, however, change the nature and location of tourism.
Many ski resorts, for example, might face less reliably cold weather
and shorter seasons. Warmer conditions would mean that fewer
northerners would feel the need to vacation in Florida or the
Caribbean. On the other hand, new tourist opportunities might develop
in Alaska, northern Canada and other locales at higher latitudes or in
upper elevations.

A rise in world-wide temperatures will go virtually unnoticed by
inhabitants of the advanced industrial countries. In his 1991 address
to its members, the President of the American Economic Association
asserted: "I conclude that in the United States, and probably Japan,
Western Europe and other developed countries, the impact on economic
output [of global warming] will be negligible and unlikely to be
noticed." As modern societies have developed a larger industrial base
and become more service oriented, they have grown less dependent on
farming, thus boosting their immunity to temperature variations. 
Warmer weather means, if anything, fewer power outages and
less frequent interruptions of wired communications.

Only if warmer weather caused more droughts or lowered agricultural
output would even Third World countries suffer. Should the world
warm--and there is little evidence or theory to support such a
prognostication--the hotter temperatures would enhance evaporation
from the seas, producing more clouds and more precipitation world-
wide. Although some areas might become drier, others would become
wetter. Judging from history, Western Europe would retain plentiful
rainfall, while North Africa and the Sahara might gain moisture. The
Midwest of the United States might suffer from less precipitation and
become more suitable for cattle grazing than farming. On the other
hand, the Southwest would likely become wetter and better for crops.

A warmer climate would produce the greatest gain in temperatures at
northern latitudes and much less change near the equator. Not only
would this foster a longer growing season and open up new territory
for farming but it would mitigate harsh weather. The contrast between
the extreme cold near the poles and the warm moist atmosphere on the
equator drives storms and much of the earthÕs climate. This difference
propels air flows; if the disparity is reduced, the strength of winds
driven by equatorial highs and Arctic lows will be diminished.

As a result of more evaporation from the oceans, a warmer climate
should intensify cloudiness. More cloud cover will moderate daytime
temperatures while acting at night as an insulating blanket to retain
heat. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found exactly
this pattern both for the last 40 years, indeed for the whole of the
twentieth century.12 For the Northern Hemisphere in summer months,
daytime high temperatures have actually fallen; but in the fall,
winter and spring, both the maximum and especially the minimum
temperatures (nighttime) have climbed.


Warmer nighttime temperatures, particularly in the spring and fall,
create longer growing seasons, which should enhance agricultural
productivity. Moreover, the enrichment of the atmosphere with CO2 will
fertilize plants and make for more vigorous growth. Agricultural
economists studying the relationship of higher temperatures and
additional CO2 to crop yields in Canada, Australia, Japan, northern
Russia, Finland, and Iceland found not only that a warmer climate
would push up yields, but also that the added boost from enriched CO2
would enhance output by 17 percent.13 Researchers have attributed a
burgeoning of forests in Europe to the increased CO2 and the
fertilizing effect of nitrogen oxides.14 Professor of Climatology
Robert Pease writes that we may now be living in an ÒicehouseÓ world
and that a warming of about two degrees Celsius, which is what his
model indicates,

	may actually make the earth more habitable. The higher 
	temperatures combined with more carbon dioxide will favor 
	plant and crop growth and could well provide more food for 
	our burgeoning global populations. Geologic history reveals 
	that warmer global temperatures produce more, not less, 
	precipitation, a fact reflected by a recent scientific 
	investigation that shows the Greenland ice-cap to be 
	thickening, not melting.  So much for the catastrophic 
	prediction that	our coastlines will be flooded by a rise 
	in sea level from polar	meltwaters.15

The United States Department of Agriculture in a cautious report
reviewed the likely influence of global warming on crop production and
world food prices. The study, which assumed that farmers fail to make
any adjustment to mitigate the effects of warmer, wetter, or drier
weather--such as substituting new varieties or alternative crops,
increasing or decreasing irrigation--concludes that:

	The overall effect on the world and domestic economies 
	would be small as reduced production in some areas would 
	be balanced by gains in others, according to an economic 
	model of the effects of climate change on world agricultural 
	markets. The model ... estimates a slight increase in world 
	output and a decline in commodity prices under moderate 
	climate change conditions.16 [Emphasis added.]

Economists Robert Mendelsohn, William D. Nordhous, and Daigee Shaw
researched the relationship of climate to land values in the United
States.17 After holding land quality, the proximity to urban areas and
the nearest coast, and income per capita constant, they found that
climate explained over two-thirds of the value of crop lands.  They
concluded that for the lower-48 states, a rise in average temperature
of about 5 degees Fahrenheit and an 8 percent increase in rainfall
stemming from global warming would, depending on their model, reduce
the value of output between 4 and 6 percent or boost the value of
output slightly. This result ignored the effect of increased CO2 on
farm output. It is also consistent with the Department of Agriculture
study that suggests the U.S. might see a slight fall in output while
the rest of the world increased production.

Forestry is another sector that is potentially subject to change due
to an increase in world temperatures. Canadian agricultural economists
have examined the effect of a doubling of CO2 on forestry
production. They concluded that increased carbon dioxide would boost
productivity by 20 percent and that overall the harvest of timber in
Canada would climb by about 7.5 percent.18

			Historical Evidence

History provides the best evidence for the effect of climate change on
humans, plants and animals, but a few researchers have challenged its
relevance. David Rind, a climate modeler and NASA scientist, has
questioned the applicability of past warming episodes to the modern
issue of climatic alteration caused by increased CO2 concentrations.19
He attributes the origin of past periods of warmth and cold to shifts
over time in the orbital position of the earth which impose more or
less energy on the poles, as contrasted to a general world-wide
warming that might result from the addition of man-made greenhouse
gases. [See Appendix A on factors determining climate]. He also argues
that the swiftness in warming that would occur following increased
levels of CO2 is unprecedented in history. On the latter point, he
ignores other research, such as that by a German academic, Burkhard
Frenzel, who writes, "During the Holocene, very rapid changes of
climate occurred. According to dendroclimatology [tree ring analysis
applied to climatology], they often lasted about 20 to 30 years, or
[were] even as brief as 2 to 3 years."20 Other climate historians have
found that a rapid cooling in the late glacial period--about 11,000
years ago--took about 100 to 150 years to complete and realized about
5 degree Fahrenheit variation in temperature within 100 years, more
than is being forecast for the next century.21

Although changes in the earth's orbital position may easily have
played a role in warming the earth after the last Ice Age, the effect
was world-wide rather than concentrated in northern latitudes. Ice
retreated in the Southern as well as in the Northern Hemisphere.
Moreover, in the subsequent warming, from around 7,000 to 4,000 years
ago, the climate around the world appears to have improved. Although
the evidence for warming in the Southern Hemisphere is weaker, even if
higher temperatures had been localized in one hemisphere or one
continent, the effect on human beings would still tell us about the
benefits or costs of climatic change. Dr. Rind argues that greenhouse
warming would raise winter as well as summer temperatures while past
warmings, driven by orbital mechanics, have raised summer temperatures
alone. Even though his models suggest that these past warmings should
have boosted temperatures solely in June, July, and August, the
evidence, albeit a little tenuous for the three thousand year period
of Climatic Optimum, supports warmer winters. For the Little Climate
Optimum that coincided with the High Middle Ages, researchers have
found strong support for mild winters.

Moreover, at a recent conference the Russians have put forward the
hypothesis that past climate changes support the proposition that the
cause of the warming or cooling is irrelevant; the pattern has been
the same.22 This conclusion, disputed by some, is based on a large
number of past shifts in average weather conditions dating back
millions of years. The Russians contend that the climate models
overstate the amount of temperature change at the equator and
understate it at the poles.

			Measurement of Human Well-being

Since statistics on the human condition are unavailable except for the
most recent centuries, I shall use indirect methods to demonstrate the
influence of climate on manÕs well-being. A growth in the population,
major construction projects, a significant expansion in arts and
culture, all indicate that society is prosperous. If the population is
expanding, food must be plentiful, disease cannot be overwhelming, and
living standards must be satisfactory. In addition, if building, art,
science, and literature are vigorous, the civilization must be
producing enough goods and services to provide a surplus available for
such activities. Renaissance Florence was rich; Shakespeare flourished
in prosperous London; wealthy Vienna provided a welcome venue for
Haydn, Schubert, Mozart, and Beethoven.

Clearly climate is far from the only influence on man's
well-being. Governments that extort too much from their people
impoverish their countries. A free open economy stimulates growth and
prosperity. War and diseases can prove catastrophic. On the other
hand, a change in climate has frequently been a cause of war or aided
the spread of disease. A shift to more arid conditions, for example,
impelled the Mongols to desert their traditional lands to invade
richer areas. A cold wet climate can also confine people to close
quarters, which can abet contagion. Moreover, a shift towards a poorer
climate can lead to hunger and famine, which make disease more
virulent.

Throughout history climatic changes probably forced technological
innovations and adaptations. The shift from warm periods into Ice Ages
and back again likely accelerated the evolution of modern man. Each
shift would have left small groups of hominoids isolated and subject
to pressures to adapt to new weather conditions. These shifts,
especially to the more adverse conditions created by the spread of
extreme cold, would put strong selection pressure on the human
forebears that ultimately led to modern man. Even after Homo Sapiens
started spreading across the earth, climate shifts fostered new
technologies to deal with changed circumstances.

The influence of climate on human activities has declined with the
growth in wealth and resources. Primitive man and hunter-gatherer
tribes were at the mercy of the weather, as are societies which are
still almost totally bound to the soil. A series of bad years can be
devastating. If, as was the usual case until very recently,
transportation is costly and slow, even a regionalized drought or an
excess of rain can lead to disaster, although crops may be plentiful a
short distance away. Thus variation in the weather for early man had a
more profound influence on his life and death than do fluctuations in
temperature or rainfall in modern times when economies are more
developed. Since the time of the Industrial Revolution, climate has
basically been confined to a minor role in human activity.

				Climate History

Since its origins, the earth has experienced periods significantly
warmer than the modern world - some epochs have been even hotter than
the most extreme predictions of global warming - and times much colder
than today. TodayÕs cool temperatures are well below average for the
globe in its more than four billion year history.23 During one of the
warmest such eras the dinosaurs roamed the earth and a rich ecological
world flourished.

Studies of climate history show as was mentioned above that sharp
changes in temperatures over brief periods of time have occurred
frequently without setting into motion any disastrous feedback systems
that would lead either to a runaway heating that would cook the earth
or a freezing that would eliminate all life. In addition, carbon
dioxide levels have varied greatly. Ice core data exhibit fluctuating
levels of CO2 that do not correspond to temperature changes.24 Most
past periods display a positive relationship between CO2 and
temperature, however, with a relationship roughly corresponding to
that of the Global Climate Models.25 During interglacial periods high
latitudes enjoyed temperatures that were about 5 to 11 degrees
Fahrenheit warmer than today.26 Middle latitudes experienced
temperatures only about 4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer. These warmer
periods brought more moisture to the Northern Hemisphere with the
exception during the Holocene of central North America. At the time of
the medieval warm period, temperatures in Europe, except for the area
around the Caspian Sea basin, were 1 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit higher
and rainfall more plentiful than today.27

This historical evidence is consistent with only some of the forecasts
of the computer climate models. Most climate estimates indicate that a
doubling of CO2 would generate greater rainfall in middle latitudes,
and history shows that warm climates do produce more wet weather.28 As
has been found in the historical record, land temperatures should
increase more than water thus strengthening monsoons. The models also
predict that sea-surface temperatures in the tropics would be higher
with increased CO2 but evidence from the past evinces no such
relationship.29

Carbon dioxide concentrations may have been up to sixteen times higher
about 60 million years ago without producing runaway greenhouse
effects.30 Other periods experienced two to four times current levels
of CO2 with some warming. Scientists have been unable to determine
whether the warming preceded or followed the rises in carbon
dioxide. For virtually all of the period from around 125 million to
about 75,000 years ago, CO2 levels were markedly higher than now.

The prevailing view among climatologists is that the Climatic Optimum
--9,000 to 4,000 years ago--resulted from orbital mechanics which
increased summer radiation in the Northern Hemisphere, although
winters received less heat than they do in the modern world.31 The
warmer summers melted the northern glaciers over several
millennia. Warmer lands in the interior of northern continents and
cooler oceans expanded the monsoons further north to bring greater
rainfall to the Sahara, Arabia and southern and eastern Asia.32 North
of the monsoon area, the climate was drier than today. Anatolia,
Northwestern Africa, parts of China and northern Japan experienced
less rainfall.33 By 4000 B.C., however, a slackening of the trade
winds had produced warmer Atlantic ocean water off northwestern
Africa, and as a consequence the Middle East, including Greece and
modern Turkey, were enjoying more reliable rain.

If orbital variations produced the Climatic Optimum, the Southern
Hemisphere should have been cooler. Between 10,000 B.C. and 7000 B.C.,
however, winter temperatures (June, July, August) below the equator
warmed to higher levels than now while summer temperatures (December,
January, February) were cooler than the modern world.34 Rainfall over
South America, Australia and New Zealand apparently was lighter than
the present. Although the Southern Hemisphere moved out of the Ice Age
with the Northern Hemisphere, its climate since then has not tracked
well weather patterns north of the equator.35 Data based on vegetation
suggest that annual temperatures in New Zealand were coldest between
20,000 and 15,000 years ago, warmed subsequently and peaked between
10,000 and 8,000 years before the present - somewhat earlier than they
did in the Northern Hemisphere.36 Temperatures appear to have been
falling over the last 7,500 years. By 1500 B.C., the climate was quite
similar to todayÕs.37

Whether the whole globe warmed or not during the period 7,000 to 4,000
years ago is really irrelevant to the question of how hotter
temperatures affect humans. If the Northern Hemisphere warmed, and
there is good evidence that it did, then comparing how people survived
in that portion of the globe provides information about how higher
global temperatures would influence mankind.

Modern man apparently evolved into his current genotype between 40,000
and 200,000 years ago, probably in Africa during an Ice Age.38 Around
150,000 years ago the extent of ice coverage reached a maximum,
followed around 130,000 years before the present (YBP) by a rapid
deglaciation.39 The warm interglacial era, during which temperatures
may have exceeded those forecast under a doubling of greenhouse gases,
lasted about 15,000 years until the onset of renewed glaciation at
115,000 YBP. Over the next 100,000 years the glaciers fluctuated with
the climate, but at no time did the average temperature equal the
level of the previous interglacial epoch or reach the warmth of the
last 10,000 years.40

In the thousands of years of the last Ice Age preceding the current
warm epoch, man existed as a hunter-gatherer in a world that looked
quite different from todayÕs.  Herds of large animals such as bison,
mammoths, and elk roamed a largely treeless savanna in Europe. These
beasts made easy prey for human hunters that enjoyed as a consequence
a rich diet of wild animal meat plus, in season, local fruits and
vegetables. It was during the Ice Age that the level of the ocean fell
sufficiently that Asian peoples were able to migrate across what is
now the Bering Strait but then was dry land. Most archaeologists date
the first arrivals of humans in the Americas from around 15,000 years
ago, although some have claimed evidence for an earlier arrival. No
doubt the lower sea levels during the Ice Age also facilitated the
arrival of the aborigines in Australia some 35,000 years ago.

Climatologists consider that the last Ice Age ended about 12,000 to
10,000 years ago when the glaciers covering much of North America,
Scandinavia and northern Asia began to retreat to approximately their
current positions. In North America the glacial covering lasted longer
than in Eurasia because of topographic features that delayed the
warming. Throughout history warming and cooling in different regions
of the world have not been exactly correlated because of the influence
of oceans, mountains, prevailing winds, and numerous other
factors. Nevertheless, across the Northern Hemisphere large
temperature shifts have occurred roughly together - perhaps in some
areas they have lagged other zones by a century or more. The
correspondence between warming and cooling in the Northern Hemisphere
and that in the Southern is less well known and may be less well
correlated because of the predominance of water south of the equator
and the existence of Antarctica.

Human progress, a few improvements in hunting tools and some cave art,
was incredibly slow during the Ice Age - a period whose length dwarfs
the centuries since.  Over the last 12 millennia of interglacial
warmth, however, modern man has advanced rapidly. The growth in
technology and living standards required a climate that was more
hospitable than existed throughout that frozen period.

During the last Ice Age humans survived through hunting and
gathering. Initially archeologists believed that these tribes, which
typically consisted of 15 to 40 people, eked out a precarious
existence.41 Many modern archeologists, however, feel, based on
studies of the few bands of hunter-gatherers that survived into the
twentieth century, that they normally found plentiful foods in their
forays and would rarely have been hungry.  Modern primitive people,
however, may not have been typical of earlier groups. The ones that
did face food pressures would have adopted farming while those that
found plentiful supplies in their environment would be less concerned
with new ways of acquiring sustenance.42 Food pressures could have
arisen from either a change in climate that made previous ways-of-life
untenable or an expansion of population in the region that began to
overwhelm the natural supply.

As the earth warmed with the waning of the Ice Age, the sea level rose
as much as 300 feet; hunters in Europe roamed through modern Norway;
agriculture developed in the Middle East. For about 3,000 to 4,000
years the globe enjoyed what historians of climate call the Climatic
Optimum period--a time when average world temperatures--at least in
the Northern Hemisphere - were significantly hotter than today. At its
height between 4000 B.C. and 2000 B.C., H.H. Lamb, a leading climate
historian, judges that the world was 4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer
than the twentieth century.43 During the relatively short period since
the end of glaciation the climate has experienced periods of stability
separated by "abrupt transition."44 Lamb calculates that at its
coldest, during the Mini Ice Age, the temperature in central England
for January was about 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit colder than today.45 He
also concludes that in the central and northern latitudes of Europe
during the warmest periods, rainfall may have been 10 to 15 percent
greater than now and during the coldest periods of the Mini Ice Ages,
5 to 15 percent less.46 On the other hand, cooler periods usually
suffered from more swampy conditions because of less evaporation.

If modern humans originated 200,000 years ago, why did they not
develop agriculture for the first 190,000 years? Even if Homo Sapiens
originated only 40,000 years ago, people waited 30,000 years to grow
their first crops--an innovation which yielded a more reliable and
ample food supply. Farming developed first in the Middle East, right
after the end of the last Ice Age--a coincidence? The evidence
suggests that from 11,000 to 9,000 years ago the climate became warmer
and wetter in the Middle East shifting the ecology from steppe to open
woodland.47 This led to the domestication of plants and animals,
probably because the warmer, wetter weather made farming
possible. From its origins around 8000 B.C., agriculture spread
northward, appearing in Greece about 6000 B.C., Hungary 5000 B.C.,
France 4500 B.C. and Poland 4250 B.C.48 Is it chance that this
northward spread followed a gradual warming of the climate that made
agriculture more feasible at higher latitudes?

As Anthropologist Mark Cohen writes, "If, as the archaeological record
indicates, hunting and gathering was such a successful mode of
adaptation over such a long period of time, and if most human
populations are as conservative as anthropologists have observed them
to be, we are faced with answering the question why this form of
adaptation was ever abandoned."49 He gives estimates of the efficiency
of hunting and gathering that indicate that the latter was more
efficient than farming--at least for large game. He reports that when
large animals are available, hunting brings 10,000 to 15,000
kilocalories per hour of hunting. However, if large animals are
unavailable--because the environment is poor or because they have all
been killed--hunting of small game will return only a few hundred to
1,500 kilocalories per hour devoted to the effort. Collecting and
processing small seeds from such plants as wild wheat may produce only
700 to 1,300 kilocalories for each hour. Shellfish collection can
produce 1,000 to 2,000 kilocalories per hour of work. On the other
hand subsistence farming produces 3,000 to 5,000 kilocalories per hour
devoted to agriculture.50 This connotes that hunting large animals,
when and if they are available, is the most economical method of
subsistence, but if these beasts are exterminated or if the humans
move to areas without such species, domestication of plants and
animals can produce more food for the effort than any other strategy.

Moreover hunter-gatherers can only survive if the density of their
population is low. Too many mouths would strain the environment and
preclude survival. Once, humans developed farming which could support
larger families and a denser population, however, the number of people
did explode. Primitive tribes, dependent on hunting, scavenging, and
collecting edibles to survive, had to hold their populations below
what they would individually have preferred or nature kept them in
check through periodic food shortages. A number of twentieth century
hunter-gatherers have practiced infanticide and induced abortions to
restrict the number and spacing of their children.51 Constant travel
by nomads may increase infant mortality, maternal mortality and
produce more miscarriages than a sedentary life and thus have kept the
numbers in check. In any case farming solved a major problem for
primitive peoples. Once people settled down into fixed abodes, the
population apparently ballooned.

Although many people view the current worldÕs huge population with
alarm, most ecologists take the size of the population of a species as
an indicator of its fitness. By this criterion, the domestication of
plants and animals improved greatly Homo Sapiens fitness. This essay
is not the place to discuss the capacity of the globe to sustain the
number of people expected to populate the world in the next century,
but certainly anything that produced greater numbers of people
thousands of years ago must have been beneficial for mankind.

Over history the number of humans has been expanding at ever more
rapid rates.  Around 25,000 years ago, the world's population may have
measured only about 3 million.52 Fifteen thousand years later, around
10,000 B.C., the total had grown by one-third to 4 million. It took
5,000 more years to jump one more million, but in the 1,000 years
after 5000 B.C. it added another million. Except for a few disastrous
periods, the number of men, women and children has mounted with
increasing rapidity. Only in the last few decades of the twentieth
century has the escalation slowed. Certainly there have been good
times when man did better and poor times when people suffered--
although in most cases these were regional problems. However, as the
following chart shows, in propitious periods, that is, when the
climate was warm, the population swelled faster than during less
clement eras.

This chart is based on a paper by economist Michael Kremer who argues
that, until the Industrial Revolution, existing technology limited the
size of the population.53 As innovators discovered new techniques and
invented new tools, more people could be fed and housed and the
population expanded. Moreover, the greater the number of people, the
more innovations would be hit upon. He assumed that every individual
had an equal but very small probability of uncovering a new technique
or device and that the probability of being an innovator was
independent of the size of the population.  Therefore the number of
inventions would be proportional to the number of people. Thus as the
world population expanded--slowly at first--the rate of
technological innovation escalated and hence the rate of growth of the
population that could be sustained. Only in recent times has
technological change become so rapid that it has run ahead of
population growth, leading to a rising standard of living, which in
turn has reduced the birth rate.

Kremer's hypothesis signifies that for most of history the rate of
population growth should be proportional to the size of the
population. To link his model and data with climate change, I started
with his estimate of the worldÕs people in 10,000 B.C. and calculated
the rate of growth of the population over the next 5,000 years. For
each subsequent period, I also computed the rate of increase in
numbers of people. Comparing these expected rates with actual growth
revealed eras in which the number of humans has expanded faster than
predicted and periods during which the worldÕs people has grown more
slowly. The chart then shows the centuries in which the growth rate of
the globeÕs populace has exceeded or fallen short of the rate expected
under this simple model. As can be seen, warm periods have done
considerably better than cold periods in terms of human expansion. The
warmest period since the end of the last Ice Age produced the highest
rate of population growth compared to what would have been expected--
in this era agriculture was spreading. Moreover, the Mini Ice Age,
which saw the coldest temperatures in the last 10,000 years, underwent
the slowest relative population expansion. This chart demonstrates
that mankind has prospered in warm periods and the hotter the better!

Another measure of the well-being of humans is how long they live. The
life of the hunter-gatherer was not as rosy as some have contended.
Life was short--skeleton remains from before 8000 B.C. show that the
average age of death for men was about 33 and that of women 28.54
Death for men was frequently violent, while many women must have died
in childbirth. Since women died so young, they had only around
thirteen years in which to bear children. Anthropologists have
estimated that on average they could have given birth to less than
five live babies, assuming that they bore a child every 22 months.55
An infant and childhood mortality rate of about 60 percent would have
kept the population stagnant.

Table 1 below shows some relevant data. The warmest periods, the
Neolithic, Bronze Ages and England in the thirteenth centuries enjoyed
the longest life spans of the entire record. The shortening of lives
from the late thirteenth to the late fourteenth centuries with the
advent of much cooler weather is particularly notable. Moreover, the
rise in life expectancies during the warm period could easily explain
the population explosion that took place during that period.

Good childhood nutrition is reflected in taller adults. Skeleton
remains collected over wide areas of Eurasia from the period when
roving bands shifted from eating large animals and a few plants to
smaller prey and a much wider variety of foods attest to a decline in
height for both men and women of about five centimeters (two
inches).56 The shorter stature came at the end of the Ice Age when
large animals were disappearing.  Some archaeologists have found that
average age of death for adults also declined during this
transitionary period.57 Studies of bone chemistry from Middle Eastern
skeletons indicate a reduction in meat consumption. The new diet
although more dependent on grains, fruits, and vegetables must have
been less nutritious than the old. As large game animals disappeared
with the end of the Ice Age, humans widened the variety of plants in
their diet, increasingly consuming vegetable matter that they had
ignored for thousands of years either because it was less nutritious,
more difficult to secure and process, or less tasty.

Research on American Indians before the arrival of Europeans also
reveals a decline in health between early periods and later.58 The
evidence for the Americas is more mixed, however, than for
Europe. Based on the Eurasian studies and those of North American
aborigines it seems safe to conclude that health and nutrition were
declining before the advent of agriculture and that it may be that
agriculture was invented to stave off further decreases in food
availability. The absence of agriculture for most North American
peoples may have reflected that their nutrition fell less than it did
in Europe.

In southern Europe, the shift to agriculture coincides with a
reduction in skeleton size of 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) for men and 4
centimeters (1.6 inches) for women.59 Although some other
archaeological studies have found that agriculture led to shorter
people, a few have found the reverse. In Israel, for example, one
study found that people grew taller with the domestication of
animals.60 Overall the evidence supports the view that the diet may
have become less nutritious with the shift from large animal hunting
to food production but that its quality initially exceeded that of
medieval Europe. Table 2 on heights, however, signifies that food was
more plentiful and better during the medieval Period than during the
mini Ice Age.

In summary, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposition that
during warm periods, humans prospered. They multiplied more rapidly;
they lived longer; and they apparently were healthier. We now turn to
a closer examination of the two major warm epochs.

			The First Climatic Optimum 

Around 9,000 to 5,000 years ago the earth was much warmer than today;
perhaps 4 degrees Fahrenheit hotter, about the average of the various
predictions for global warming after a doubling of CO2.61 Although the
climate cooled a bit after 3000 B.C., it stayed relatively warmer than
the modern world until sometime after 1000 B.C., when chilly
temperatures became more common. During this Climatic Optimum epoch,
Europe enjoyed mild winters and warm summers with a storm belt far to
the north. Not only was the country less subject to severe storms, but
the skies were less cloudy and the days sunnier.

Notwithstanding the less stormy weather, rainfall was more than
adequate to produce widespread forests. Western Europe, including
parts of Iceland and the Highlands of Scotland, was mantled by great
woods.62 The timber, until average temperatures dipped temporarily for
about 400 years between 3,500 B.C. and 3,000 B.C., consisted of
warmth-demanding trees, such as elms and linden in North America and
oak and hazel in Europe. These species have never regained their once
dominant position in Europe and America. Not only did Europe enjoy a
benign climate with adequate rainfall, but the Mediterranean littoral,
including the Middle East, apparently received considerably more
moisture than it does today.63 The Indian subcontinent and China were
also much wetter during this Optimal period.64

As a Senator, Al Gore, writing on the prospect of further global
warming and its potential harm, contended that the temperature rise
over the last century has led to increased drought in Africa.65 To
bolster his argument, he presented a chart which shows a drop in
rainfall from 1930 to the early 1980s for portions of sub-Saharan
Africa. His conclusion, however, is based on a false premise: for most
of that period the earth was cooling, not warming! His chart actually
implies that further cooling would be undesirable. In fact, history
demonstrates and climatology attests that warming should drive the
monsoon rains that originate near the equator farther north, possibly
as far as the Sahara, contributing to a moister not a drier climate!

Compared to cooler periods in the last few thousand years, the Sahara
was much wetter and more fertile during the Climatic Optimum.66 Cave
paintings from the epoch depict hippopotamuses, elephants, crocodiles,
antelopes and even canoes.67 The water level in Lake Chad about 14
degrees north of the equator in central Africa was some 30 to 40
meters, that is, 90 to 125 feet higher, than it is today, indicating
much greater precipitation. Ruins of ancient irrigation channels in
Arabia, probably from the warmest millennia, derived their water from
sources well above current water supplies, indicating a wetter
climate.68 A warming would likely lead to similar conditions, not a
strengthening of African drought. With the cooling that started after
3000 B.C., North Africa dried up and the abundance of life
disappeared.

Research has shown, however, that some portions of the globe did
suffer from drier conditions. The Caspian Sea may have been at its
lowest level in over 80,000 years during the warmest recent period--
4,000 to 6,000 years ago--when it was some 20 to 22 meters--66 to 72
feet--below its modern height.69

The Southern Hemisphere seems to have flourished as well during the
warm millennia after the most recent Ice Age. Professor Lamb reports
that the southern temperate zone enjoyed both warmer weather and more
moisture than it does currently.70 Scholars have found that Australia
was consistently wetter than today in both the tropical and temperate
regions.71 Since the end of that epoch, the great deserts of Australia
have expanded and the climate has become both cooler and
drier. Apparently most of the other great desert regions of the world
enjoyed more rainfall during the Climatic Optimum than they do
now. Lamb contends that the period of temperature maximum was also a
period of moisture maximum in subtropical and tropical latitudes and a
good period for forests in most temperate regions.72 During this warm
era, Hawaii experienced more rainfall than in the twentieth century.73
Even Antarctica enjoyed warmer weather, about 4 to 5 degrees
Fahrenheit higher, and during the summer in some of the mountains the
weather was warm enough to produce running streams and lakes which
have subsequently frozen.74 Nevertheless, the basic ice sheet remained
intact.

As already mentioned, the invention of agriculture coincided with the
end of the last Ice Age and the melting of the glaciers.
Archaeologists have found the earliest evidence for husbandry and
farming in Mesopotamia around 9000 B.C.75 As the earth warmed, the
Middle East became wetter and the Iranian plateau shifted from an open
dry plain with roving bands of game to a more wooded environment with
less reliable food sources and a diminished supply of large animals.
No one really knows how man first domesticated plants and animals, but
the coincidence in time and the forcing nature of climate change
suggest that the warmer wetter weather, especially in the mountains,
may have encouraged new techniques.

The transition from the Ice Age to a warmer climate that led
eventually to agriculture is best documented in Europe. During the
cold period, most of Europe was a dry plain, an open savanna, in which
large herds of reindeer, mammoths, and bison roamed. As has been shown
by the cave drawings in France and Spain, the population secured a
good living by preying on these ungulates. As the climate warmed and
as rainfall increased, forests spread north limiting the habitat for
these large mammals. This forced humans into following northward the
dwindling herds or developing new sources of food. As the large
animals disappeared the local people shifted to exploiting red deer,
wild boar and smaller species. Those located near the seas or large
rivers found seafood a plentiful source of substance. On the other
hand, people who made their living at the edge of the ocean faced seas
that were rising about 3 feet each century and which often drowned
them when high tides and storms washed over their primitive villages.

The domestication of plants appears to have occurred around the world
at about the same time: from 10,000 YBP to 7,500 YBP.76 The earliest
well documented employment of agriculture arose in the Middle
East. Planting of wheat and barley began in southwest Asia between
8000 B.C. and 7000 B.C. In north ChinaÕs Shensi Province between 4500
B.C. and 3500 B.C., peasants grew foxtail and millet and raised
pigs. Food production in this part of China extends back at least into
the sixth millennium B.C. In the Americas domestication of some grains
and chili peppers dates from between 7000 B.C.  and 6000 B.C.;
anthropologists have documented maize in the Tehuacan Valley by 5700
B.C. and production may have started earlier. In South America the
evidence suggests that domestication of two species of beans and chili
pepper as well in the Andean highlands arose 8,500 years ago. Maize
appears in this area only about 3000 B.C. In Africa the evidence
implies the cultivation of plants after 3500 B.C. Domestication of
cattle occurred in the Sahara about 8,000 years before the present.77

As Professors Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza put it, "One of the few
variables that would seem to be shared is timing: early experiments at
plant domestication occurred in southwest Asia, east Asia, and Central
America during the period between 8000 B.C. and 5500 B.C."78 The
coincidence of the invention of agriculture with a general warming of
the climate, an increase in rainfall, and a rise in carbon dioxide
levels, all of which would have made plant growth more vigorous and
more plentiful, cannot be accidental.

Domestication of plants and animals represented a fundamental shift in
man's involvement with nature. Prior to this humans simply took what
nature offered. People hunted or scavenged the local animals that
happened their way. Women gathered fruits and vegetables that grew
wild in their territory. With farming and herding, mankind, for the
first time, began to modify his environment. Humans determined what
would be grown, which plants would survive in their gardens, which
animals would be cultivated and bred, and which would be shunned or
eliminated. "Homo Sapiens" ceased being simply another species that
survived by predation coupled with grazing and became a manager of his
environment.

The shift from a hunter-gatherer existence to a sedentary one may be
the most important innovation in human existence. Prior to this
change, humans lived in small groups and moved frequently with the
seasons to find new sources of meat, fruit and vegetables. Being
mobile meant carrying few goods and only those that were light and not
fragile. Thus pottery, which is both heavy and easily breakable, was
not part of their culture. Any musical instruments must have been
small and portable. Many small children would have been a hindrance as
would elderly feeble individuals. Such small groups would have had
little opportunity to develop specialization. Virtually all males must
have participated in the hunt while all females, not giving birth or
caring for infants, must have helped gather edibles. These tribal or
family groups could not have supported elaborate priesthoods,
bureaucratic governmental structures, or even people who specialized
in artistic, cultural or intellectual activities. As a consequence
these societies were probably quite egalitarian with only a few, such
as the chief or elder and perhaps a medicine man, that stood out from
the rest.

The development of agriculture and the establishment of fixed
communities led to a population explosion and the founding of
cities. Agricultural societies produce enough surplus to support such
urban developments, including the evolution of trades and new
occupations. A large community could afford to have specialists who
made farm tools, crafted pots, and traded within the village and
between the locals and outsiders. The people in today's Palestine
established the first known city, Jericho, and thus the first step
towards specialization--which lies at the heart of economic
advancement - around 8000 B.C.79

Farming required the development of property rights in lands, although
initially pastures may have been held in common. Even though in the
beginning farm holdings were probably fairly equally distributed, over
time some families must have acquired larger holdings than
others. This increase in income inequality may offend modern
sensibilities, but it provided a major benefit. A wealthy class or a
rich ruler could afford to maintain individuals who would create
desirable objects, such as art, elaborate pots, and musical
instruments, and who could record eclipses, star movements or trade
with other centers.

Man's taming of animals and plants represents a movement towards
establishing property rights. In a hunter-gatherer's world no one owns
the wild beasts or the fruit and grains until they are collected. This
can work satisfactorily only as long as demands for the resources are
quite limited. But as the literature on the tragedy of the commons
shows, once pressures for more grow too large, the resource base can
be exhausted. In what is now called North America, many large species,
such as horses, were apparently hunted to extinction. Domestication--
privatization of animals and plants--became the answer to over
hunting and over grazing.

In Europe, the Optimum period produced an expansion of civilization
with the construction of cities and a technological revolution. The
Bronze Age replaced the New Stone Age.80 The more benign climate with
less severe storms encouraged travel by sea.

Trade flourished during this warm period. People from ancient Denmark
shipped amber along the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean. As early
as 2000 B.C., the Celts apparently were sailing from Cornwall and
Brittany to both Scandinavia and southern Italy. Astrological
monuments built around this time, such as Stonehenge, indicate that
the skies were less cloudy than now.81 With the glaciers in the Alps
during the late Bronze Age being only about 20 percent of the size of
the ice in the nineteenth century, merchants made their way through
the Brenner Pass, the dominant link between northern and southern
Europe. Northern Europeans exchanged tin for manufactured bronze from
the south. Alpine people mined gold and traded it for goods crafted
around the Mediterranean. Baltic amber found its way to Scotland.

During the warm period prior to 3000 B.C., China enjoyed much warmer
temperatures. In particular midwinters were as much as 9 degrees
Fahrenheit hotter and rice was planted a month earlier than is now
common.82 Bamboo, valued for food, building material, writing
implements, furniture and musical instruments, grew much farther
north--about 3 degrees in latitude--than is now possible.83 Chinese
archaeologists have found evidence in a district near Sian that the
climate 5,000 to 6,000 years ago was warmer and wetter than the
present.

Prior to around 2500 to 1750 B.C., northwestern India, which is now
very dry, enjoyed greater rainfall than it does in the twentieth
century.84 In the Indus Valley, the Harappas created a thriving
civilization that reached its apogee during the warmest and wettest
periods, when their farmers were growing cereals in what is now a
desert.85 The area was well watered with many lakes. This civilization
disappeared around 1500 B.C. at a time when the climate became
distinctly drier.86 The earth was cooling. Historians and
archaeologists also attribute the failure of this civilization to poor
agricultural techniques that may have exacerbated drought.

Virtually all change can make some worse off and the warming after the
last Ice Age is no exception. Although as the population explosion
indicates most humans benefited, the growing warmth harmed some
people, especially those who lived near the coast or who had earned
their living hunting large animals. As the ice sheets melted, the sea
level rose sharply and probably peaked around 2000 B.C.87 During the
many centuries in which the waters mounted, storms often led to ocean
flooding of coastal communities.  A few times each century, people
were forced to abandon well-established villages and move to higher
ground.

		Cooler, More Varied, and Stormy Times 

From the end of the Optimum period of sustained warmth until around
800 A.D. to 900 A.D., what we know of the world's climate and, in
particular, the European varied between periods of warmth and
cold. Based on the height of the upper tree lines in middle latitudes'
mountains, the temperature record following the peak warm period
around 5000 B.C. demonstrates a more or less steady decline right up
to the 20th century.88 As mentioned above, tree ring data for New
Zealand indicate that after temperatures reached a maximum around 6000
to 8000 B.C., the climate cooled in that part of the world.

After 1000 B.C. the climate in Europe and the Mediterranean cooled
sharply and by 500 B.C. had reached modern average temperatures.89 The
period from 500 B.C. to 600 A.D. was one of varied warmth, although
cooler on average than the previous 4,500 years.  However, the climate
became more clement and somewhat more stable from 100 B.C. to 400
A.D., the period of the Roman Empire.90 The Italians grew grapes and
olives farther north than they had prior to this period. During these
centuries of varied weather, Classical Greece flourished and then
declined; the Roman Empire spread its authority through much of what
is now Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, only to be overrun by
barbarians from central Asia whose eruption out of their homeland may
have been brought on by a change in the climate.

The cooler climate after the start of the last millennium B.C. appears
to have contributed to a southern migration of people from northern
Europe.91 Archaeologists have also found evidence that Greeks adopted
warmer clothing after 1300 B.C. The population living in the Alps
diminished sharply with the cooler weather and mining
ceased. Classical historian Ray Carpenter attributes a depopulation of
Greece and Turkey between 1200 and 750 B.C. to long term drought that
must have reflected the increased coolness of the climate.92

Evidence for a cooler Mediterranean climate from 600 B.C. to 100
B.C. comes from remains of ancient harbors at Naples and in the
Adriatic which are located about one meter (three feet) below current
water levels.93 Further support for lower sea levels has been found on
the North African coast, around the Aegean, the Crimea, and the
eastern Mediterranean. Lower oceans imply a colder world leading to a
build-up of snow and ice at the poles and in major mountain
glaciers. By 400 A.D., however, temperatures had warmed enough to
raise water levels to about three feet above current elevations. The
ancient harbors of Rome and Ravenna from the time of the Roman Empire
are now located about one kilometer from the sea.94 Evidence exists
for a peak in ocean heights in the fourth century for points as remote
as Brazil, Ceylon, Crete, England, and the Netherlands, indicating a
world-wide warming.

Changes in the climate in Eurasia appear to have played a major role
in the waves of conquering horsemen who rode out of the plains of
central Asia into China and Europe. Near the end of the Roman Empire,
around 300 A.D., the climate began to warm and conditions in central
Asia improved apparently leading to a population explosion.95 These
people, needing room to expand and a way to make a living, invaded the
more civilized societies of China and the West. The medieval warmth
also seems to have also triggered an expansion from that area. During
this second optimum period, the homeland of the Khazars centered
around the Caspian Sea enjoyed much greater rainfall than earlier or
than it does now. The increased prosperity in this area produced a
rapidly rising number of young men that provided the manpower for
Genghis Khan to invade China and India and to terrorize Russia and the
Middle East.96

After 550 A.D. until around 800, Europe suffered through a colder,
wetter, and more stormy period. As the weather became wetter, peat
bogs formed in northern areas.97 The population abandoned many
lakeside dwellings while mountain passes became choked with ice and
snow, making transportation between northern Europe and the south
difficult. The Mediterranean littoral and North Africa dried up,
although they remained moister than now.

Inhabitants of the British Isles between the seventh and the ninth
centuries were often crippled with arthritis while their predecessors
during the warmer Bronze Age period suffered little from such an
affliction. Although some archaeologists have attributed the
difficulties of the dark age people to harder work, the cold wet
climate between 600 and 1000 A.D. may have fostered such ailments.98

During the centuries after the fall of the Roman empire and with the
deterioration of the climate, Greece languished. In 542 A.D., the
population was decimated by the plague, aggravated by cold damp
conditions; the Black Death struck again between 744 and 747.99 As a
consequence the number of people was sharply reduced. Greece was
partially re-populated in the ninth and tenth centuries when the
Byzantine Emperors brought Greek settlers from Asia Minor back into
the area. For the first time in centuries Greek commerce and
prosperity returned--probably due to an improved climate.100

In the ninth century, land hunger and a rising population in Norway
and Sweden spurred the Scandinavians on to loot and pillage by
sea. Their first descent was on the monastery of Lindisfarne in
northern England in 793. This was followed by raids on Seville in
Muslim Spain in 844 and later farther into the Mediterranean.101 In
870 they discovered Iceland and in the next century, Greenland. In 877
they began an invasion of England and conquered from the north to the
whole of the midlands--all of which became a Danish overseas kingdom
by the mid-tenth century. At the same time, they stormed France and
the king had to cede them Normandy as a fief. They also crossed the
Baltic (known as Rus in that time) and sent traders south to Islam and
Byzantium.

		The High Middle Ages and Medieval Warmth

From around 800 A.D. to 1200 or 1300, the globe warmed considerably
and civilization prospered. This Little Climate Optimum generally
displays, although less distinctly, many of the same characteristics
as the first climate optimum.102 Virtually all of northern Europe, the
British Isles, Scandinavia, Greenland, and Iceland were considerably
warmer than at present. The Mediterranean, the Near East, and North
Africa, including the Sahara, received more rainfall than they do
today.103 North America enjoyed better weather during most of this
period. China during the early part of this epoch experienced higher
temperatures and a more clement climate. From Western Europe to China,
East Asia, India, and the Americas, mankind flourished as never
before.

Evidence for the medieval warming comes from contemporaneous reports
on weather conditions, from oxygen isotope measurements taken from the
Greenland ice, from upper tree lines in Europe, and from sea level
changes. These all point to a more benign, warmer, climate with more
rainfall but because of more evaporation less standing water. Not only
did northern Europe enjoy more rainfall but the Mediterranean littoral
was wetter. An early twelfth century bridge with twelve arches which
still exists over the river Oreto at Palermo exceeds the needs of the
small trickle of water that flows there now.104 According to Arab
geographers two rivers in Sicily that are too small for boats were
navigable during this period.105 In England at the same time, medieval
water mills on streams that today carry too little water to turn them
attest to greater rainfall. Although England apparently received more
rainfall than in modern times, the warm weather led to more drying out
of the land. Support for a more temperate climate in central Europe
comes from the period in which German colonists founded villages. As
average temperatures rose people established towns at higher
elevations. Early settlements were under 650 feet in altitude; those
from a later period were between 1,000 and 1,300 feet high; and those
built after 1,100 were located above 1,300 feet.106

H. H. Lamb counted manuscript reports of flooding and wet years in
Italy.107 He discovered that starting in the latter part of the tenth
century, the number of wet years climbed steadily, reaching a peak
around 1300. Over the same period northern Europe was enjoying warmer
and more clement weather. Not only was the temperature higher than now
in Europe during the twelfth and thirteenth century but the population
enjoyed mild wet winters. In the Mediterranean it was moist as well
with summer thunderstorms frequently reported.108

Studies have shown that some areas became drier during these
centuries. In particular, the Caspian Sea was apparently four meters--
over 13 feet--lower from the ninth through the eleventh century than
currently.109 After 1200 A.D. the elevation of the lake rose sharply
for the next two or three hundred years.110 In the Asian steppes, warm
periods with fine summers and often little snow in the winter produced
lake levels that were low by modern standards.111 A recent study of
tree rings in California's Sierra Nevada and Patagonia concluded that
the "Golden State" suffered from extreme droughts from around 900 to
1100 and again from 1210 to 1350 while the tip of South America during
the first 200 years also enjoyed little precipitation.112

The timing of the medieval warm spell, which lasted no more than 300
years, was not synchronous around the globe. For much of North
America, for Greenland and in Russia, the climate was warmer between
950 and 1200.113 The warmest period in Europe appears to have been
later, roughly between 1150 and 1300, although parts of the tenth
century were quite warm. Evidence from New Zealand indicates peak
temperatures from 1200 to 1400. Data on the Far East is meager but
mixed. Judging from the number of severe winters reported by century
in China, the climate was somewhat warmer than normal in the ninth,
tenth, and eleventh centuries, cold in the twelfth and thirteenth and
very cold in the fourteenth. Chinese scholar Chu Ko-chen reports that
the eighth and ninth centuries were warmer and received more rainfall,
but that the climate deteriorated significantly in the twelfth
century.114 He found records, however, that show that the first half
of the thirteenth century was quite clement and very cold weather
returned in the fourteenth century.115 Another historian found on the
basis of records of major floods and droughts that between the ninth
and eleventh century China suffered much fewer of these calamities
than during the fourteenth through the seventeenth.116 The evidence
for Japan is based on records of the average April day on which the
cherry trees bloomed in the royal gardens in Kyoto. From this record,
the tenth century springs were warmer than normal; in the eleventh
century they were cooler; the twelfth century experienced the latest
springs; the thirteenth century was average and then the fourteenth
was again colder than normal.117 This record suggests that the Little
Climate Optimum began in Asia in the eighth or ninth centuries and
continued into the eleventh. The warm climate moved west, reaching
Russia and central Asia in the tenth through the eleventh, and Europe
from the twelfth to the fourteenth. Some climatologists have theorized
that the Mini Ice Age also started in the Far East in the twelfth
century and spread westward reaching Europe in the fourteenth.118

Europe

The warm period coincided with an upsurge of population almost
everywhere, but the best numbers are for Europe. For centuries during
the cold damp "dark ages" the population of Europe had been relatively
stagnant. Towns shrank to a few houses clustered behind city
walls. Although we lack census data, the figures from Western Europe
after the climate improved show that cities grew in size; new towns
were founded; and colonists moved into relatively unpopulated areas.

Historians have failed to agree on why after the eleventh century, the
population soared. It might be more enlightening to ask why the
population remained stagnant for so long. As John Keegan, the eminent
military historian put it: "The mysterious revival of trade between
1100 and 1300, itself perhaps due to an equally mysterious rise in the
European population from about 40,000,000 to about 60,000,000, in turn
revived the life of towns, which through the growth of a money economy
won the funds to protect themselves from dangers beyond the walls".119

Although it is impossible to document it, the change in the climate
from a cold, wet one to a warm, drier climate--had more rainfall,
but more evaporation reduced bogs and marshy areas--seems likely to
have played a significant role. In the eighth through the eleventh
centuries, most people spent considerable time in dank hovels avoiding
the inclement weather. These conditions were ripe for the spread of
disease.  Tuberculosis, malaria, influenza, and pneumonia undoubtedly
took many small children and the elderly--those over 30.

Written records confirm that the warmer climate brought drier and
consequently healthier conditions to much of Europe. Robert Bartlett,
citing H.E. Hallam in Settlement and Society, quotes the people of
Holland who invaded Lincolnshire in 1189 that "because their own marsh
had dried up, they converted them into good and fertile
ploughland."120 Moreover, prior to the twelfth century German settlers
on the east side of the Elbe frequently named their towns with mar,
which meant marsh, but later colonists did not use that
suffix. Bartlett's explanation is that the term had gone out of use,
but an alternative one is that the warmer climate had dried up the
marshes.121

With a more pleasant climate people spent longer periods outdoors;
food supplies were more reliable. Even the homes of the peasants would
have become warmer and less damp. The draining or drying up of marshes
and wetlands reduced the breeding grounds for mosquitoes that brought
malaria. In all the infant and childhood mortality rate must have
fallen spawning an explosion in population.

From the ninth century, with a climate still quite cool, to the
eleventh, medieval Europe was almost totally agricultural. The few
cities that existed consisted mainly of religious seats with their
support personnel. Even as late as the twelfth century, city dwellers
made up less than 10 percent of the population.122 Trade before the
eleventh century was virtually non-existent.123 People were tied to
the land through custom and necessity. The great feudal estates grew
what they ate and ate what they grew; they wove their own cloth and
sewed their own clothes; they built what little furniture was needed.
In a word they were almost entirely self-sufficient. The serfs that
tilled the land had inherited rights to enough land to sustain a
family. Typically the older son would follow his father. Any other
sons either joined the priesthood, became monks, vagabonds, or in
later centuries, mercenaries. Given the cold climate before the
eleventh century, the lack of medical care, and a restricted diet
fostering poor nutrition, few babies lived to adulthood. The problem
of an excess of labor was, therefore, nonexistent. The truth is that
the population was growing so slowly that a labor shortage persisted
and the feudal nobility established laws prohibiting serfs from
leaving their land.

Until the twelfth century when the weather became significantly more
benign, a Europe fettered by tradition remained cloistered in
self-sufficient units. The next two centuries, however, witnessed a
profound revolution which, by the end of the fourteenth century,
transformed the landscape into an economy filled with merchants,
vibrant towns and great fairs. Crop failures became less frequent; new
territories were brought under control. With a more clement climate
and a more reliable food supply, the population mushroomed. Even with
the additional arable land permitted by a warmer climate, the
expansion in the number of mouths exceeded farm output: food prices
rose while real wages fell. Farmers, however, did well with more
ground under cultivation and low wages payable to farm hands.124

The rise in the population may have contributed to the spread of
primogeniture.  Prior to the twelfth century, infant and child
mortality coupled with short life expectancy required parents to be
flexible in designating their heirs. Robert Bartlett quotes an
estimate for the eleventh century that the probability of a couple
raising sons to adulthood was only 60 percent.125

Although the first sons born on the estates could follow their
fathers, other children, especially the men, had to find new
opportunities. The crusades furnished an occasion for both the sons of
serfs and of the nobility to enrich themselves and even to find new
land to cultivate. Others moved to virgin territory in eastern Europe,
Scandinavia or previously forested or swampy areas.126 The Franks and
Normans launched invasions of England, southern Italy, Byzantine
Greece, and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1130 the Tancred de
Hauteville clan, a notable example, founded the Kingdom of
Sicily. This family, a classic case of an "over-breeding, land-hungry
lesser nobility," consisted of 12 sons from two mothers who,
recognizing that their Norman property was inadequate, invaded
southern Italy in search of land and riches.127

During the High Middle Ages, the Germans advanced across the Elbe to
take land from pagan Serbs. The spread of knights and soldiers out of
France and Germany demonstrates that the population was multiplying
more rapidly in northern Europe than in southern. The rapid rise in
numbers north of the Alps fits the improved climate scenario: global
or continental warming brought greater temperature change and more
beneficial weather to higher latitudes.

The more skilled and enterprising who did not seek their fortune in
foreign lands typically flocked to towns and urban centers, becoming
laborers, artisans, or traders. Both those who moved to the new cities
and those who founded colonies were legally freed of feudal
obligations. This new liberty, making risk taking and innovation
possible, was essential for those in commerce.

The warmth of the Little Climate Optimum made territory farther north
cultivable.  In Scandinavia, Iceland, Scotland, and the high country
of England and Wales, farming became common in regions which neither
before nor since have yielded crops reliably. In Iceland, oats and
barley were cultivated. In Norway, farmers were planting further north
and higher up hillsides than at any time for centuries. Greenland was
4 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than at present and settlers could
bury their dead in ground which is now permanently frozen. Scotland
flourished during this warm period with increased prosperity and
construction.128 Greater crop production meant that more people could
be fed, and the population of Scandinavia exploded.129 The rapid
growth in numbers in turn propelled and sustained the Viking
explorations and led to the foundation of colonies in Iceland and
Greenland.

The increasingly warm climate was reflected in a rising sea
level. People were driven out of the low lands and there was a large
scale migration of men and women from these areas to places east of
the Elbe, into Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. Flemish dikes to hold
back the sea date at least from the early eleventh century. Although
Pirenna and Bartlett attribute them to attempts to reclaim land from
the sea to provide new areas for farming, the evidence points towards
a higher water level that farmers in the low countries had to
battle.130 The earliest texts setting out rights on the reclaimed land
fail to mention any obligation to maintain the dikes, although later
ones spell out the requirement, suggesting that the problem of holding
back the sea became worse over time. Robert Bartlett quotes from a
Welsh chronicle on the influx of people from Flanders:

	that folk, as is said, had come from Flanders, their land, 
	which is situated close to the sea of the Britons, because the sea 
	had taken and overwhelmed their land...after they had failed to 
	find a place to live in - for the sea had overflowed the coast 
	lands, and the mountains [sic] were full of people so that it was 
	not possible for everyone to live together there because of the 
	multitude of the people and the smallness of the land...131

In addition to the land north of the Alps, the warm rainier climate
benefited southern Europe, especially Greece, Sicily and southern
Italy. All of the Mezzogiorno in the Middle Ages did well.132 Nicolas
Cheetham, a former British diplomat who authored a recent book on
"Mediaeval Greece", reports that during the first half of the thirteenth
century, the plains and valleys of the Peloponnese were fertile and
planted with a wide variety of valuable crops and trees. They produced
wheat, olives, fruits, honey, cochineal for dyeing, flax for the linen
industry and, silk from the mulberry trees. The wealthy in
Constantinople prized highly the wines, olives, and fruit from
Greece. Thessaly's grain fed the Byzantine Empire.133 Patras exported
textiles and silk of very high quality.  Extensive forests, which were
full of game, supplied acorns for hordes of pigs. Herders raised sheep
and goats in the mountain pastures, while in the valleys farmers kept
horses and cattle.134

The Mediterranean flourished in the twelfth century. Christian and
Moslem lands achieved great brilliance. Cordova, Palermo,
Constantinople and Cairo all thrived, engendering great tolerance for
contending religions.135 Christian communities survived and prospered
in Moslem Cairo and Cordova. The Rulers of Byzantine countenanced the
Moslems and often preferred them to "barbaric" Westerners.

In the West, Charlemagne, creator of the Holy Roman Empire, may have
inaugurated the era of the High Middle Ages while Dante, writing The
Divine Comedy, may have closed it. In A History of Knowledge, Charles
Van Doren contended that: "the...three centuries, from about 1000 to
about 1300, became one of the most optimistic, prosperous, and
progressive periods in European history."136 All across Europe, the
population went on an unparalleled building spree erecting at huge
cost spectacular cathedrals and public edifices. Byzantine churches
gave way to Romanesque, to be replaced in the twelfth century by
Gothic cathedrals. During this period construction began on the Abbey
of Mont-St-Michel (1017), St. Marks in Venice (1043), Westminster
Abbey in London (1045), the Cathedral of our Lady in Coutances (1056),
the Leaning Tower at Pisa (1067), the Cathedral of Santiago de
Compostela in northern Spain (1078), the Cathedral of Modena (1099),
Vzelay Abbey in France (1130), Notre-Dame in Paris (1163),
Canterbury in England (1175), Chartres (1194), Rouen's cathedral in
France (1201), Burgos' cathedral in Castile (1220), the basilica of
Saint Francis in Assisi (1228), the Sainte Chapelle in Paris (1246),
Cologne Cathedral (1248) and the Duomo in Florence (1298). Virtually
all the magnificent religious edifices that we visit in awe today were
started by the optimistic populations of the eleventh through the
thirteenth centuries, although many were not finished for
centuries. In southern Spain, the Moors laid the cornerstone in 1248
for perhaps the worldÕs most beautiful fortress, the Alhambra. The
Franks founded Mistra near ancient Sparta in the middle of the
thirteenth century.

It took a prosperous society to launch such major architectural
projects. In Europe, building the cathedrals required a large and
mostly experienced pool of labor. During the week of June 23 to June
29, 1253, the accounts of the construction at Westminister Abbey, for
example, showed 428 men on the job, including 53 stonecutters, 49
monumental masons, 28 carpenters, 14 glassmakers, 4 roofers, and 220
simple laborers.137 Nearly half of all workers were skilled
specialists. Even during the slowest season in November, the Abbey
employed 100 workers, including 34 stonecutters.  Masons and
stonecutters earned the highest wages and usually hired a number of
workers as assistants. Master craftsmen moved from job to job around
Europe without any concern about national borders--the first truly
European Community. Historians have found that only 5 to 10 percent of
the masons and stonecutters were local people, but 85 percent of the
men who quarried the stones--an unhealthy and arduous job Ñ were from
the vicinity.138 Thus during these centuries a European-wide market
flourished in skilled craftsmen.

Economic activity blossomed throughout the continent. Banking,
insurance, and finance developed; a money economy became well
established; manufacturing of textiles expanded to levels never seen
before. Farmers were clearing forests, draining swamps and expanding
food production to new areas.139 The building spree mentioned above
was made possible by low wages resulting from a population explosion
and by the riches that the new merchant classes were creating. In
England, virtually all of the churches and chapels which had
originally been built of wood were reconstructed in stone between the
twelfth and fourteenth centuries.140 With the clergy still opposing
buying and selling for gain, those who became wealthy often
constructed churches or willed their estate or much of it to religious
institutions as acts of redemption.141 They supplied much of the funds
to erect the great Gothic cathedrals.

Starting in the eleventh century European traders developed great
fairs that brought together merchants from all over Europe. At their
peak in the thirteenth century they were located on all the main trade
routes and served not only to facilitate the buying and selling of all
types of goods but also functioned as major money markets and clearing
houses for financial transactions. The fourteenth century saw the
waning of these enterprises probably because the weather became so
unreliable and poor that transport to and from these locations with
great stocks of goods became impractical. Belgian historian Henri
Pirenne attributes their decline to war, which may indeed have played
a role, but the failure of crops and the increased wetness must have
made travel considerably more difficult.142 Wet roads were muddy
rendering it arduous to transport heavy goods. Crop failures made for
famines and more vagabonds who preyed on travelers.

During the High Middle Ages, technology grew rapidly. New techniques
expanded the use of the water mill, the windmill, and coal for energy
and heat. Sailing improved through the invention of the lateen sail,
the sternpost rudder and the compass.  Governments constructed roads
and contractors developed new techniques for use of stone in
construction. New iron casting techniques led to better tools and
weapons. The textile industry began employing wool, linen, cotton, and
silk and, in the thirteenth century, developed the spinning
wheel. Soap, an essential for hygiene, came into use in the twelfth
century. Mining, which had declined since the Romans, at least partly
because the cold and snow made access to mountain areas difficult,
revived after the tenth century.

Farmers and peasants in medieval England launched a thriving wine
industry south of Manchester. Good wines demand warm springs free of
frosts, substantial summer warmth and sunshine without too much rain,
and sunny days in the fall. Winters cannot be too cold - not below
zero Fahrenheit for any significant period. The northern limit for
grapes during the Middle Ages was about 300 miles above the current
commercial wine areas in France and Germany. These wines were not
simply marginal supplies, but of sufficient quality and quantity that,
after the Norman conquest, the French monarchy tried to prohibit
British wine production.143 Based on average and extreme temperatures
in the most northern current wine growing regions of France and
Germany compared to current temperatures in the former wine growing
regions in England, Lamb calculates that the climate in springs and
summers were somewhere between 0.9 and 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer
in the Middle Ages.144

Not only did the British produce wines during the Little Climate
Optimum but farmers grew grapes in East Prussia, Tilsit, and south
Norway.145 Many areas cultivated in Europe were much further up
mountains than is possible under the modern climate.  Together these
factors suggest that the temperatures in central Europe were about
1.8 to 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit higher than during the twentieth century.

Europe's riches and a surplus of labor enabled and emboldened its
rulers to take on the conquest of the Holy Land through a series of
Crusades starting in 1096 and ending in 1291. The Crusades, stimulated
at least in part by a mushrooming population and an economic surplus
large enough to spare men to invade the Muslim empire, captured
Jerusalem in 1099--a feat not equaled until the nineteenth century. A
major attraction of the first crusade was the promise of land in a
"southern climate."146

Even southern Europe around the Mediterranean enjoyed a more moist
climate than currently.147 In the reign of the Byzantine Emperor
Manuel I Comnenus, art and culture flourished and all the world looked
to Constantinople as its leader.148 Under the control of the Fatimid
caliphate, Egypt cultivated a "House of Science," where scholars
worked on optics, compiled an encyclopedia of natural history, with a
depiction of the first known windmills, and described the circulation
of the blood. In Egypt block-printing appeared for the first time in
the West.149 The caliphate turned Cairo into a brilliant center of
Moslem culture. In Persia, Omar Khayyam published astronomical tables,
a revision of the Muslim calendar, a treatise on algebra and his
famous Rubiyt.150

As European commerce expanded, traders reached the Middle East,
bringing back not only exotic goods, but new ideas and information
about classical times. Drawing on fresh information about Aristotelian
logic, St. Thomas Aquinas defined medieval Christian doctrine in his
Summa Theologica. Possibly the oldest continuous university in the
world was founded in Bologna for the study of the law in 1000
A.D. Early in the twelfth century a group of scholars under a license
granted by the chancellor of Notre-Dame began to teach logic, thus
inaugurating the University of Paris. Cambridge University traces its
foundation to 1209 and Oxford to slightly later in the thirteenth
century. Roger Bacon, one of the first to put forward the importance
of experimentation and careful research, studied and taught at Oxford
in the thirteenth century.

Secular writing began to appear throughout northern Europe. In the
twelfth century the medieval epic of chivalry, the Chanson de Roland,
was put into writing.  Between 1200 and 1220 an anonymous French poet
composed the delightful and optimistic masterpiece, Aucassin et
Nicolette. An anonymous Austrian wrote in Middle High German the
Nibelungenlied.151

The Arctic 

From the ninth through the thirteenth centuries agriculture spread
into northern Europe and Russia where it had been too cold to produce
food before. In the Far East, Chinese and Japanese farmers migrated
north into Manchuria, the Amur Valley and northern Japan.152 As
mentioned above, the Vikings founded colonies in Iceland and
Greenland, a region that may have been more green than historians have
claimed. It was also during this period that Scandinavian seafarers
discovered "Vinland"--somewhere along the East Coast of North
America. The subsequent Mini Ice Age cut off the colonies in Greenland
from Europe, and they eventually died off. Even today, during this
warm period of the late twentieth century, the British climate
forecloses large-scale grape production and Greenland is unsuitable
for farming.

The Eskimos apparently expanded throughout the Arctic area during the
medieval warm epoch.153 Starting with Ellesmere Land around 900 A.D.,
Eskimo bands and their culture spread from the Bering Sea into the
Siberian Arctic. Two centuries later, these people migrated along the
coast of Alaska and into Greenland. During this period the EskimosÕ
main source of food came from whaling, which had to be abandoned with
the subsequent cooling. The Mini Ice Age forced the Thule Eskimos
south out of northern Alaska and Greenland. These hardy aborigines had
abandoned Ellesmere Land by the sixteenth century.

At the same time that the Eskimos were moving north, Viking explorers
were venturing into Greenland, Vinland, and even the Canadian
Arctic. Scandinavian sailors found Iceland in 860, Greenland around
930, and reached the shores of North America by 986.154 By the turn of
the millennium, when the waters south-west of Greenland may have been
at least 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmers than now, Vikings were regularly
visiting Vinland for timber.155 They were received with great
hostility by the natives and eventually abandoned contact, although
the last trip may have occurred as late as 1347, when a Greenland ship
was blown off course.156 At the height of the warm period,
Greenlanders were growing corn and a few cultivated grain. Some
archaeologists have found evidence that Vikings from Greenland may
have visited remote portions of the Canadian archipelago and even may
have sailed through the Northwest Passage to the West Coat of America
traveling as far south as the Gulf of California. At least one
scientists believes that this visit is the origin of the Aztec belief
in the visit of ÒfairÓ people from the East.157

The Far East

As noted above, the warming in the Far East seems to have preceded
that in Europe by about two centuries. Chinese Economist Kang Chao has
studied the economic performance of China since 200 B.C. In his
careful investigation, he discovers that real earnings rose from the
Han period (206 B.C. to 220 A.D.) to a peak during the Northern Sung
Dynasty (961 A.D. to 1127).158 This coincides with other evidence of
longer growing seasons and a warmer climate. He explains the fall in
worker productivity after the twelfth century as stemming from
population pressures, but a change in climate may have played a
significant role. Chao reports that the number of major floods
averaged fewer than 4 per century in the warm period of the ninth
through the eleventh centuries while the average number was more than
double that figure in the fourteenth through the seventeenth centuries
of the Mini Ice Age.159 Not only floods but droughts were less common
during the warm period. The era of benign climate sustained about 3
major droughts per century, while during the later cold period, China
suffered from almost 13 each hundred years.

The wealth of this period gave rise to a great flowering of art,
writing, and science. The Little Climate Optimum witnessed the highest
rate of technological advance in Chinese history. During the 300 years
of the Sung Dynasty, farmers invented 35 major farm implements--that
is, over 11 per century, a significantly higher rate of invention than
in any other era.160 In the middle of the eleventh century, the
Chinese invented movable type employing clay pieces.161

During the Northern Sung Dynasty Chinese landscape painting with its
exquisite detail and color reached a peak never again matched.162 Adam
Kessler, curator of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History
dates the earliest Chinese blue-and-white porcelain to the twelfth
century.163 The Southern Sung produced pottery and porcelains
unequaled in subtlety and sophistication. Literature, history and
scholarship flourished as well. Scholars prepared two great
encyclopedias, compiled a history of China, and composed essays and
poems. Mathematicians developed the properties of the circle.
Astronomers devised a number of technological improvements to increase
the accuracy of measuring the stars and the year.164

Chinese civilization has waned and waxed for about 3500 years, yet
during all those centuries only once has it ventured to spread its
culture or its people beyond its normal borders. Beginning with the
twelfth century A.D., however, Chinese explorers and merchant ships
plied the Indian Ocean and landed on the East African coast.165
Although favorable weather may not have motivated these voyages, which
ended in the fourteenth century, they coincided with both the warmest
temperatures in much of the world and the time of the richest per
capita incomes in China. Certainly the more clement climate meant
fewer storms and easier sea travel.

Japan also prospered during the Little Climate Optimum. In the Heian
Period (794 A.D. to 1192) the arts thrived as emperors and empresses
commissioned vast numbers of Buddhist temples. Murasaki Shikibu,
perhaps the world's first female novelist, composed Japan's most
famous book, The Tale of Genji. Other classical writers penned essays:
Sei Shonagon--another court lady--wrote Makura-no-Soshi (the Pillow
Book). The Japanese aristocracy vied in composing the best poems. All
of this attests a prosperous economy with ample food stocks to support
a leisured and cultivated upper class.

Over the four hundred years between 800 A.D. and 1200, the peoples of
the Indian subcontinent prospered as well. Society was rich enough to
produce colossal and impressive temples, beautiful sculpture,
elaborate carvings, many of which survive to this day.166 The
Lingaraja Temple, one of the finest Hindu shrines, as well as the
Shiva Temple date from this period.167 Seafaring empires existed in
Java and Sumatra, which reached its height around 1180. Ninth century
Java erected the vast stupa of Borobudur; other temples--the Medut,
Pawon, Kelasan and Prambanan--originate in this era. In the early
twelfth century, the predecessors of the Cambodians, the Khmers, built
the magnificent temple of Angkor Wat.168 In the eleventh century
Burmese civilization reached a pinnacle. In or around its capital,
Pagan, between 931 and 1284, succeeding kings competed in constructing
vast numbers of sacred monuments and even a library.169 Today the area
is a dusty plain littered with the crumbling remains of about 13,000
temples and pagodas, built in a more hospitable era.

Archaeologists studying the compositions of forests in New Zealand
have found that the South Island enjoyed a warmer climate between 700
A.D. and 1400, about the time when Polynesians were colonizing the
South Pacific Islands and the Maoris were settling in New Zealand.170
Partially confirming that warming are data from Tasmania of tree rings
which show a warm period from 940 to 1000 and another from 1100 to
1190.171

The Americas

Less is known about civilizations in the Americas during the Little
Climate Optimum or even how the prevailing weather changed. Much of
the currently arid areas of North America were apparently wetter
during this epoch. The Great Plains areas east of the Rocky Mountains,
the upper Mississippi Valley and the Southwest received more rainfall
between 800 A.D. and 1200 than they do now.172 Radiocarbon dating of
tree rings indicates that warmth extended from New Mexico to northern
Canada. In Canada, forests extended about sixty miles north of their
current limit.173

Starting around 800 to 900 A.D., the indigenous peoples of North
America extended their agriculture northward up the Mississippi,
Missouri, and Illinois river basins. By 1000 they were farming in
southwestern and western Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota.174 They grew
corn in northwestern Iowa prior to 1200 in an area which is now
marginal for rainfall.175 Indian settlements on the northern plains of
Iowa were abandoned with colder drier weather that set in after 1150
to 1200. After that time, the natives substituted bison hunting for
growing crops. In general the land east of the Rocky Mountains enjoyed
wetter conditions from 700 to 1200 and then turned drier as it
experienced greater intrusions of colder Arctic weather.

The Anasazi civilization of Mesa Verde flourished during the warm
period, but the cooling of the climate at the end of the medieval
warmth around 1280 probably led to its disappearance.176 This climatic
shift brought drier conditions to much of the region, leading to a
retreat from the territory and forcing the Pueblo Indians to shift
their farming to the edge of the Rio Grande River.

Around 900, the Chimu Indians in South America developed an extensive
irrigation system on Peru's coast to feed their capital of between
100,000 to 200,000 souls--a huge number for the era.177 The Toltec
civilization, which occupied much of Mexico, reached its apogee in the
thirteenth century.178 By 1200, the Aztecs had built the pyramid of
Quetzalcoatl near modern Mexico City.179 The Mayas' civilization,
however, reached a peak somewhat earlier, before 1000, and declined
subsequently for reasons that remain unclear. It is possible that the
warming after 1000 led to additional rainfall in the Yucatan, making
the jungle too vigorous to restrain and causing a decline in farming,
while at the same time improving agricultural conditions in the
Mexican highlands and farther north into what is now the southwestern
United States.

Thus warmer times brought benefits to most people and most regions,
but not all.  As is always the case with a climate shift, the changes
benefited some while affecting other adversely. Change is disruptive;
at the same time it produces new ideas and new ways of coping with the
world. Nevertheless, for most of the known world, the Little Climate
Optimum of the ninth through the thirteenth centuries brought
significant benefits to the local populations. Compared with the
subsequent cooling it was nirvana.

The Mini Ice Age

The Little Ice Age is even less well defined than the medieval warm
period.  Climatologists are generally agreed that, at least for
Europe, North America, New Zealand and Greenland, temperatures fell
after 1300 to around 1800 or 1850, although with many ups and
downs. There was a cold period in the first decade of the fourteenth
century, another around 1430 and again in 1560. The end of this period
of increasingly harsh temperatures could have been as early as 1700,
1850 or even 1900 for Tasmania.  The worst period for most of the
world occurred between 1550 and 1700.180 One reasonable interpretation
of the data is that the world has been cooling since around 4500
B.C. with a temporary upswing during the High Middle Ages.

Europe and Asia cooled substantially from around 1300 to 1850,
especially after 1400, with temperatures falling some 2 to 4 degrees
Fahrenheit below those of the twentieth century. This indicates that
temperatures may have dipped by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit in the
two hundred years from 1200 to 1400, a drop of about the same
magnitude as the maximum rise forecast from a doubling of CO2. These
frigid times did bring hardships, and as the chart shows world
population growth slowed. For much of these centuries, famine and
disease stalked Europe and Asia.

Glaciers in North America and northern Europe peaked between the late
1600s and 1730 to 1780. In the Alps these ice sheets reached their
maximum between 1600 and 1650. The coldness came later below the
equator where the glaciers reached their extreme between 1820 and
1850.181

Oxygen isotope ratios from oak trees in Germany document a steady
decline in average temperatures from 1350 to about 1800, with the
exception of a few small upsurges and one strong temperature spike in
the first half of the eighteenth century.182 Since late in the 19th
century they confirm a recovery to much higher levels. Icelandic
records of sea ice attest to an increase between 1200 and the middle
of the fourteenth century and then, starting in the latter half of the
sixteenth century, a marked upswing in ice which appears to have
peaked around 1800.183 As H. H. Lamb points out, "in most parts of the
world the extent of snow and ice on land and sea seems to have
attained a maximum as great as, or in most cases greater than, at any
time since the last major Ice Age."184

The Little Ice Age, especially the century and a half between 1550 and
1700 - the exact timing varied around the globe - produced low
temperatures throughout the year and considerable variation in weather
from year to year and from decade to decade.  It included some years
that were exceptionally warm.185 The polar cap expanded as did the
circumpolar vortex, driving storms and the weather to lower
latitudes. Although much of Europe experienced greater wetness than
during the earlier warm epoch, this dampness was more the product of
less evaporation due to the cold than an excess of precipitation.

The cooling after the High Middle Ages can be seen in the lowering of
tree lines in the mountains of Europe, changes in oxygen isotope
measurement, and advances of the glaciers and of sea ice. This cooling
diminished the abundance and quality of wine production in France,
Germany and Luxembourg as depicted in historical documents such as
weather diaries and farm records.186 The ocean, which had reached
relatively high levels both in the late Roman period and again during
the High Middle Ages, fell to lower elevations in the seventeenth and
nineteenth centuries.187 As a result of an expanded ice cap, the
circumpolar vortex, which funnels weather around the globe, moved
south and spawned increasingly cold and stormy weather in middle
latitudes. With the exception of southern United States and central
Asia, both of which enjoyed more rainfall, this brought a worsening of
the climate and disasters to people almost everywhere. During the
coldest period of the seventeenth century, snow fell in the high
mountains of Ethiopia above 10,000 feet which today never see
snow. The subtropical monsoon rains decreased and receded farther
south causing droughts in East Asia and parts of Africa.188

The expansion of the circumpolar vortex produced some of the greatest
windstorms ever recorded in Europe. A terrible tempest destroyed the
Spanish Armada in 1588. Fierce gales wracked Europe in December 1703
and on Christmas Day 1717.189 The contrast between the cold northern
temperatures which moved south and the warm subtropical Atlantic
undoubtedly generated a fierce jet stream. Although we lack any
information, this may also, have enhanced tornado activity on the
plains of the United States.190

The reduced temperatures had the following general effects: (1) Arctic
sea ice expanded in the Atlantic eventually cutting off Greenland; (2)
glaciers advanced in Iceland, Norway, Greenland, and the Alps; (3) the
upper tree line in North America and central Europe lowered; (4)
enhanced wetness spawned bogs, marshes, lakes, and floods; (5) rivers
and lakes froze more frequently; (6) the number and strength of
storms, some of which were extraordinarily destructive, intensified
sharply; (7) harvests failed engendering famine and higher prices for
basic foods; (8) peasants abandoned farms that no longer enjoyed
reliable weather; (9) disease for both animals and humans spread.191

As early as 1250, floating ice from the East Greenland ice cap was
hindering navigation between Iceland and Greenland.192 Over the next
century and a half the prevalence of icebergs became worse and by 1410
sea travel between the two outposts of Scandinavia ceased. Based on
the ratio of isotopes of oxygen in teeth of ancient Norsemen,
researchers have estimated that the climate in Greenland cooled by
about 3 degrees Fahrenheit between 1100 and 1450.193 For about 350
years, from the third quarter of the fifteenth century to 1822, no
ships found their way to Greenland and the local population
perished.194

The deteriorating climate in Europe was heralded by harvest failure in
the last quarter of the thirteenth century. Compounding the
insufficiency was a shift of land from farming, which because of the
change in climate was more chancy, to enclosure and sheep rearing.195
Average yields, which were already low by modern standards, worsened
after the middle of the thirteenth century.196 One of the first severe
bouts of cold wet weather afflicted Europe from 1310 to 1319, leading
to large scale crop failures.197 Food supplies deteriorated sharply
generating famine for much of Europe in 1315-18 and again in 1321.198
Harvest deficits and hunger preceded the Black Death by 40 years.199
According to Lamb, for much of the continent, "the poor were reduced
to eating dogs, cats and even children."200 This scanty food output
contributed to a decline in population which was aggravated by
disease. The history of many villages shows that they were abandoned
before the beginning of the plague not afterwards. By 1327, the
population in parts of England--especially those later devastated by
the plague--had fallen by 67 percent.201 People poorly nourished were
quickly carried off by disease.  Between 1693 and 1700 in Scotland,
seven out of the eight harvests failed and a larger percentage of the
population starved than died in the Black Death of 1348-50.202

In two terrible years, 1347 and 1348, famine struck northern Italy,
followed by the Black Death, which decimated most of those not already
carried away by lack of food.203 Bubonic plague spread across the Alps
after 1348, killing in the next two years about one-third of northern
Europe's people. Life expectancy fell by ten years in a little over a
century: from 48 years in 1280 to 38 years in the years 1376 to
1400.204 Crops often failed; peasants abandoned many lands that had
been cultivated during the earlier warm epoch. Between 1300 and 1600
the growing season shrank by three to five weeks with a catastrophic
impact on farming.205 In Norway and Scotland, the population declined
and villagers deserted many locales well before the plague reached
those areas.206 The capitals of both Scotland and Norway moved south
before both areas lost their autonomy.

The cooling after 1300 may also have contributed to the bubonic
plague, the greatest disaster to ever befall Europe. The disease
appears to have originated around 1333 in China, shortly after major
rains and floods in 1332, which are reputed to have caused 7 million
deaths, while disturbing wildlife and displacing plague-carrying
rats.207 The Black Death then spread to central Asia around 1338-9,
which, with the increased coldness, was also drying out. By 1348
rodents carrying fleas infested with bubonic plague had marched or
been carried from the Crimea into Europe. Historians have estimated
that as many as one-third of all the people in Europe died in the
raging epidemic that swept the continent.208 This outburst of the
plague, like a similar one in the sixth century, occurred during a
period of increasing coolness, storminess, and wet periods, followed
by dry hot ones. The unpleasant weather is likely to have confined
people to their homes where they were more likely to be exposed to the
fleas that carried the disease. In addition the inclement weather may
have induced rats to take shelter in human buildings, exposing their
inhabitants to the bacillus.

Not only did the cold facilitate the spread of the plague, but it
caused much other human suffering. In July of 1789, just prior to the
French Revolution, wet weather and air temperatures between 59 and 85
caused an ergot blight in the rye crop of Brittany and other parts of
France. This blight caused hallucinations, paralysis, abortions and
convulsions and came after a very cold winter that had created severe
food shortages.209 Earlier in that century wet cold summers had
produced two famine years in Europe.

The end of the medieval warmth had devastating effects on populations
that lived at the edge of habitable lands. For example, historians
have estimated the population of Iceland at the end of the eleventh
century at about 77,000, and early in the fourteenth it still numbered
over 72,000. By the end of the eighteenth century, after several
hundred years of coolness and stormy weather, the number of Icelanders
had been cut in half to 38,000.210

The poorer climate in Europe after the thirteenth century brought a
halt to the economic boom of the High Middle Ages. Innovation slowed
sharply.211 Except for military advances, technological improvements
ceased for the next 150 years. Population growth not only ended but,
with starvation and the black death, fell. Without the drive of
additional numbers of people, colonial enterprise ceased and no new
lands were reclaimed nor towns founded. The economic slump of 1337
brought on the collapse of the great Italian bank, Scali, leading to
one of the first recorded major financial crises.212 Construction on
churches and cathedrals halted.

The hardships of the fourteenth century induced a search for
scapegoats. In 1290 after some years of crop failures, the king of
England expelled the Jewish population from the country. The French
king followed this example in 1306 and again in 1393.213 In 1349, the
Christians of Brabant massacred the local Jews and expelled the
remainder twenty-one years later.

The Mini Ice Age at its coldest devastated the fishing industry. From
1570 to 1640, during the most severe period, Icelandic documents
record an exceptionally high number of weeks with coastal sea
ice. Except for a few years, fishermen from the Faeroe Islands
suffered from a lack of cod from 1615 to 1828--cod needs water warmer
than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit to flourish. During the worst periods,
1685 to 1704, fishing off southwest Iceland failed totally.214 In
the very icy year of 1695, Norwegian fishermen found no cod off their
coast. Lamb calculates that the sea around the Faeroe Islands was
probably 7 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit colder than it has been over the
last century.215

The Mini Ice Age brought hard times to Southern Europe as well. Severe
winters and wet summers created shortages and famines in the south of
France and in Spain. The great variability in the weather made
agricultural output quite uncertain and contributed to a farming
crisis in the Iberian Peninsula. Although one cannot know for sure
that it was the weather, the whole of the Mediterranean littoral
declined economically in the seventeenth century.216

The cold had devastating effects elsewhere in the world. In China,
frosts killed the orange trees in Kiangsi province between 1646 and
1676.217 Per capita incomes fell as food prices rose. As already
mentioned, cooler weather brought an end to the Anastazi Indian pueblo
culture, as well as ending native American farming in the upper middle
west.

According to Nicolas Cheetham, in the second half of the thirteenth
century warfare in Greece and the necessity of keeping a large
military establishment under arms reduced its previous prosperity. War
does exact a high toll on economies, but it seems extraordinarily
coincidental that economic troubles occurred at the time Europe was
experiencing a deteriorating climate. In 1268, the King of Naples, in
gratitude for military service send wheat, barley and cattle to the
Peloponnese.218 Was this needed because of crop failures solely due to
military disruptions? Although not necessarily weather related, in
1275 Geoffroy de Briel, a major figure in medieval Greece, died during
a military campaign of dysentery, a disease often exacerbated by cold
wet conditions.219

Notwithstanding the cooling climate and the ravages of disease after
1300, European civilization recovered with the advent of the
Renaissance in the fifteenth century. This burst of cultural activity
represented a continuation, an expansion, and a deepening of the
artistic and intellectual activity of the High Middle
Ages. Ironically, the outpouring of art, science and literature that
made up the Renaissance may have been sustained by the plague. The
colder climate made agriculture more chancy, reduced the territory
available for farming, and cut yields. Yet without the one-third drop
in Europe's population caused by the Black Death, food supplies would
have been too meager to support a large artistic and cultured class
that promoted and supported the arts. The reduced agricultural output,
however, was still large enough to support the even more diminished
population. In China, which experienced a slower decline in numbers,
real wages fell and the people became increasingly impoverished.220
But in Europe, as a result of such a terrible death rate over a very
short period, real incomes for the survivors actually climbed.221

From around 1550 to 1700 the globe suffered from the coldest
temperatures since the last Ice Age. Lamb estimates that in the 1590s
and 1690s the average temperature was 3 degrees Fahrenheit below the
present. Grain prices increased sharply as crops failed. Famines were
common. The Renaissance had ended; Europe was in turmoil. The
Continent suffered from cold and rain, which produced poor growing
conditions, food shortages, famines and finally riots in the years
1527-29, 1590-97, and the 1640s. The shortages between 1690 to 1700
killed millions and were followed by more famines in 1725 and 1816.222

China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent were also afflicted with
severe winters between 1500 and 1850-80. Despite the development of a
new type of rice that permitted the cultivation of three crops a year
on the same land--up from two--the population of China, as well as
that of Korea and the Near East, declined for two centuries after
1200, undoubtedly reflecting a deteriorating climate.223 The
abandonment of sea trade by the Chinese most likely resulted from
deteriorating weather and less population pressure.

		Costs and Benefits of Efforts to Mitigate Warming

If mankind had to choose between a warmer or a cooler climate, humans,
most other animals and, after adjustment, most plants would be better
off with higher temperatures. Not all animals or plants would prosper
under these conditions; many are adapted to the current weather and
might have difficulty making the transition. Society might wish to
help natural systems and various species adapt to warmer temperatures
(or cooler, should that occur). Whether the climate will warm is far
from certain; that it will change is unquestionable. The weather has
changed in the past and will no doubt continue to vary in the
future. Human activity is likely to play only a small and uncertain
role in climate change. The burning of fossil fuel may generate an
enhanced greenhouse effect or the release into the atmosphere of
particulates may cause cooling. It may also be simply hubris to
believe that Homo Sapiens can affect temperatures, rainfall and winds.

As noted, not all regions or all peoples benefit from a shift to a
warmer climate.  Some locales may become too dry or too wet; others
may become too warm. Certain areas may be subject to high pressure
systems which block storms and rains. Other parts may experience the
reverse. On the whole, though, mankind should benefit from an upward
tick in the thermometer. Warmer weather means longer growing seasons,
more rainfall overall, and fewer and less violent storms. The optimal
way to deal with potential climate change is not to strive to prevent
it, a useless activity in any case, but to promote growth and
prosperity so that people will have the resources to deal with any
shift.

It is much easier for a rich country such as the United States to
adapt to any long term shift in weather than it is for poor countries,
most of which are considerably more dependent on agriculture than the
rich industrial nations. Such populations lack the resources to aid
their flora and fauna in adapting, and many of their farmers earn too
little to survive a shift to new conditions. These agriculturally
dependent societies could suffer real hardship if the climate shifts
quickly. The best preventive would be a rise in incomes, which would
diminish their dependence on agriculture. Higher earnings would
provide them with the resources to adjust.

The cost of trimming emissions of CO2 could be quite high. William
Cline of the Institute for International Economics - a proponent of
major regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of fossil fuels - has
calculated that the cost of cutting emissions from current levels by
one-third by 2040 as 31/2 percent of World Gross Product.224 Given his
assumption that cutbacks of CO2 emissions are done by the least cost
methods and his bias, we can be certain that in the real world outlays
to slow warming would be considerably higher. In terms of the
estimated level of world output in 1992, his estimate would amount to
roughly $900 billion annually, an amount that could slow growth and
impoverish some who survive on the margin. These resources could be
better spent on promoting investment and growth in the poorer
countries of the world.

Should warming become apparent at some time in the future and should
it create more difficulties than benefits, policy makers would have to
consider preventive measures. Based on history, however, global
warming is likely to be positive for most of mankind while the
additional carbon, rain, and warmth should also promote plant growth
that can sustain an expanding world population. Global change is
inevitable; warmer is better; richer is healthier.

<h1>Renewable Energy: Photovoltaics</h1><p>
<p>
Photovoltaics (PV), the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity, has 
made
remarkable strides since its invention in the 1950s. Most locations in 
this
country are good for photovoltaics. PV systems are assembled by grouping 
cells
into modules and, in turn, connecting modules into arrays.  As the cost 
of PV
modules continues to decrease, the size and value of PV systems that are 
cost
effective increase steadily. PV systems have no moving parts to wear out 
or
break down, make no noise, and cause no pollution while generating
electricity.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Land use for PV is reasonable; PV modules covering 0.3% of the land of 
this
country, one-fourth of the area occupied by roadways, could provide all 
of its
electricity.  <p>

PV electrical output correlates well with the daily load pattern of many
utilities, which generally increases during daylight hours when people 
are more
active and decreases again at night. This means that PV systems can help
alleviate peak loads and reduce the need for new power plants. <p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use, Cost, and Market Growth</h2>
The combined efforts of industry and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
have
reduced PV system costs by more than 300% since 1982.  The PV market is
estimated to be growing at 20% per year today.  The number of U.S. 
companies
producing PV panels has doubled since the late 1970s to about 20 
today.<p>

The most frequently seen application of PV is in consumer products, using 
tiny
amounts of direct current (dc) power, less than 1 watt (W).  More than 1
billion hand-held calculators, several million watches, and a couple of 
million
portable lights and battery chargers are all powered by PV cells. <p>

PV is rapidly becoming the power supply of choice for all remote and
small-power, dc applications of 100 W or less.    <p>

More than 200,000 homes worldwide depend on PV to supply all of their
electricity.  Most of these systems are rated about 1 kW and often supply

alternating current (ac) power. <p>

PV module production for terrestrial use has increased 500-fold in the 
past
20 years. Worldwide PV module shipments in 1993 were 60 megawatts (MW).
The U.S. share of this market is now one-third.  Worldwide production of 
PV
modules includes 48% single-crystal silicon, 30% polycrystalline silicon, 
and
20% amorphous silicon, mostly used in consumer products.  <p>

The cost of larger PV systems (greater than 1 kW) is measured in 
"levelized"
costs per kWh--the costs are spread out over the system lifetime and 
divided by
kWh output.  The levelized cost is now about $0.25 to $0.50/kWh.  At this

price, PV is cost effective for residential customers located farther 
than a
quarter of a mile from the utility line.  Reliability and lifetime are 
steadily
improving; PV manufacturers guarantee their products for up to 20 years. 
<p>

The worldwide manufacturing capacity of PV modules will almost double by 
1996
from 60 MW to 100 MW.  The increase will take place in all of the major 
PV
technologies.  Most of this increase in capacity is taking place in the 
United
States; however, new manufacturing plants are also under construction in
Brazil, China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, and the United Kingdom.  
<p>

The worldwide PV industry has grown from sales of less than $2 million in 
1975
to greater than $750 million in 1993. The companies with the largest 
increase
in sales in the 1990s have been U.S. companies, reflecting their strong,
competitive position. The U.S. just regained the lead over Japan in gross

annual sales of PV.<p>
<p>
<h2>Technology Development</h2>
All types of PV technologies are improving their performance.  The 
efficiency
of existing commercial PV modules is 5% to 13%.  Manufacturers are using
automation and taking advantage of economies of scale in production and
purchasing to further lower costs.  These costs are expected to be cut in 
half
within a decade.  The United States is leading the world in developing 
and
commercializing high-performance and low-cost PV technology.<p>

     CAPTION A typical modern wind turbine.
     DETAILS The machine is a typical Danish type:  horizontal-axis, three-bladed and stall-regulated.  It is manufactured by Vestas/Danish-Wind-Technology.  The machine has a 20m diameter rotor and is rated at 100kW;  the rotor turns at 46rpm.  The machi
ne can start to operate in winds as low as 4m/s but would shut down in winds exceeding 25m/s;  it achieves its rated power in winds of 15m/s.  The picture appears to show a wind farm in a Danish landscape:  although the source does not say so explicitly, 
 I *think* the farm is Velling Maersk/Taendpibe located near the town of Herning on the main land (Jylland) of Denmark.

Wind energy is currently viewed as one of the most promising of the 
renewable energy sources, with an enormous resource in the 
British Isles and a steadily maturing technology base in Europe 
and North America.  Wind turbines deployed in single units, in 
small groups of four or five, and increasingly in wind farms of 
up to fifty machines, are becoming a feature on the landscape of 
many European countries, especially Denmark, the Netherlands, 
northern Germany, and now Spain and Britain.  In three areas of 
California (Altamont, Tehachapi and San Gorgonio) wind farming 
developed on a massive scale in the 1980s with well over 15000 
machines now installed.  But what does this renewable technology 
involve, and how much of a contribution can it actually make to 
the UK electricity supply industry?  This two hour lecture will 
give a picture of the present state of this technology and 
describe current trends in its application.
<p>


<h2>Technology I</h2><p>

The most distinctive feature of a wind turbine is its <b>rotor</b>, 
converting the fluid mechanical energy of the wind to rotational 
energy in the main shaft.  Most modern machines work by 
developing aerodynamic lift from the air flow; this is created 
by the suction caused on the <b>blade</b> by the acceleration of the 
air over it, along the same principle as an aircraft wing.  Any 
aerodynamic force is proportional to the square of the incident 
air speed.  For the <b>horizontal-axis</b> wind turbine (HAWT), where 
the axis of the rotor is parallel to the wind direction, the 
angle of attack at any point along the blade is more-or-less 
constant for a given wind speed.  Up to the stall point, the 
lift force created is proportional to this angle of attack.  The 
rotor driving force is largely made up of the in-plane component 
of the lift along the blade, but the out-of-plane component 
causes a thrust load on the rotor, tending to bend the blades 
and blow the turbine over.  Put very simply: it is the in-plane 
component of force which 'brings in the money' since it 
determines the driving torque, but the thrust load 'costs the 
money' since it determines the strength requirement and to a 
large extent the fatigue life of the machine.  For the 
<b>vertical-axis</b> configuration (VAWT), where the rotor axis is 
perpendicular to the wind stream, the angle of attack at any 
point on the blade varies in time, so the aerodynamic power and 
loads are unsteady.  Although this is a complication, the 
vertical-axis wind turbine does have the advantage of not 
requiring re-alignment with the wind when its direction changes.<p>

The power of a wind turbine is proportional to the swept area of 
its rotor, and at a typical site about 500W per square metre 
would be the upper limit of what could be expected from any 
machine.  Machines vary in <b>size</b> from 600mm diameter, rated at 
about 50W, to 60m diameter, rated at about 3MW.  The 'best' size 
for a turbine for a particular application will be a topic we 
shall return to later.  The main components of a turbine are 
illustrated in the
<a href="vestasline.gif">annotated drawing (size 84kb)</a>

that drawing.
A wide variety of 
materials have been used for blade manufacture, including glass 
fibre on a foam core, glass-reinforced polyester (GRP), 
wood/epoxy laminate, and steel.  The <b>number of blades</b> (4) on a 
rotor is to some extent dependent on size, with two blades being 
generally preferred on larger machines, and three blades for 
machines under 500kW.  For a two-bladed rotor there would be a 
cost reduction associated with the reduced rotor weight, and a 
reduced gearbox cost because of the higher running speed; but 
the three-bladed rotor produces slightly more power and 'looks 
better'.  The increased tip speed of a two-blader might also 
cause increased aerodynamic noise.  On some HAWTs the rotor is 
placed <b>downwind</b> of the tower to improve the <b>yaw</b> behaviour of the 
rotor - its ability to track the wind as its direction changes 
- and improve the clearance between tower and blades under load; 
but an <b>upwind rotor</b> does not have the disadvantage of operating 
through the disturbed air flow behind the tower, with the 
associated aerodynamic noise penalty that would bring.<p>

Rotational speed is roughly inversely proportional to rotor 
diameter, so as to give a blade tip speed somewhere between 
50m/s (smaller machines) and 100m/s (larger machines).  The 
rotor <b>main shaft</b> (2), which will often carry a <b>disc brake</b> (5), 
transmits the torque to the <b>gearbox</b> (not numbered in the 
drawing, but located under the brake <b>hydraulic unit</b> (7)).  On 
larger machines (MW scale) a planetary gearbox is often used for 
reasons of weight and size, but for smaller (kW scale) machines 
a simpler parallel shaft gearbox is often preferred.  The 
<b>generator</b> (6) will commonly be of the simple induction type, 
providing damping to the transmission system; the alternative 
synchronous type has the advantage of being excited from the 
grid, but demands precise rotor speed control for synchronising 
at start up.  The function of the <b>controller</b> is to match the 
output of the wind turbine generator (WTG) to the wind available 
and to the power demand; an important function on a HAWT is to 
change the orientation of the turbine, via a <b>yaw drive</b> (8), to 
match the wind direction.  All of this equipment will be mounted 
in a <b>nacelle</b> to provide protection from the elements, but access 
will always be required for maintenance.<p>

The rotor and nacelle are mounted atop a <b>tower</b>, nowadays often of 
tubular steel construction but many lattice towers can still be 
seen supporting earlier WTGs; guyed pole towers are an option 
for VAWTs and for smaller HAWTs.  The height of the tower is a 
trade-off between the benefits of catching the 'better' wind at 
some height above ground level versus the increased 
bending moment at the base.  The <b>foundations</b> must not only 
withstand the bending moment arising from the thrust load on the 
rotor, but also cope with any vibrations arising from the 
rotational frequency.  On any given site, the solid rock from 
which the foundations are built may be many metres below the 
surface.  These civil engineering aspects of the project then 
raise the whole question of WTG <b>installation</b>.  For a larger 
machine (over say 100kW) the tower will be built up on site from 
sections fabricated elsewhere, but the nacelle (possibly 
weighing several tons) must be hoisted to the top and the blades 
mounted at the hub.  This would require a large crane, which is 
usually expensive and, if the terrain is very rough, impossible 
to deploy.  An alternative method of installation would require 
some kind of hoisting from the ground, necessitating 'hard 
points' on both the nacelle and on the site.  The volume and 
weight of the WTG and installation equipment may be such as to 
demand the construction of <b>access roads</b> to the site, depending 
on the nature of the terrain and the distances involved; such a 
road network could add substantially to the total cost of a wind 
energy project.<p>

For operational convenience, the monitoring and control panel 
will be located at the base of the tower, within the shelter of 
the tubular tower itself.  Power cables, possibly under ground, 
will lead from the base of the tower to a <b>transformer station</b>; 
in a wind farm consisting of a number of WTGs, a local network 
of distribution points will be installed, leading eventually to 
the electricity utility's nearest <b>substation</b> where the 
connection to the grid is made.  Cabling costs to a very remote 
site could easily outweigh the benefit to income of even a most 
favourable wind regime.  Although by no means essential 
equipment at a wind farm site, the use of <b>anemometry</b> to measure 
wind speed could give the operator useful performance indicators 
on individual turbines and the farm as a whole.<p>

This then has been a first look at what the technology involves; 
we shall return to the subject again after giving some attention 
to the wind itself, both as the bountiful resource and the 
hostile environment.<p>


<h2>The Wind</h2><p>
<p>
The local wind speed is the most important parameter for a 
prospective site.  The energy in the wind is proportional to the 
cube of the wind speed (its force - or more precisely its 
pressure - multiplied by its velocity), so the energy yield of 
the proposed WTG is most sensitive to the site wind speed.  
Since the wind is continually varying, we use the <b>mean annual 
wind speed</b> (MAWS) to give a broad indication of the site's 
potential.  Generally the windy parts of Europe are the Western 
and Northern coastal regions, but of course the regional 
landscape and local topography affect this picture greatly.  The 
mistral winds of southern France and the seasonal winds over the 
islands of Greece are a distinctive exception to this broad 
rule.  The <a href="atlas.gif">map (size 70kb)</a>

The map is 
presented in terms of a 'flattened landscape', so the 
appropriate topographic conditions must be selected from the following 
table to give an indication of the regional wind resource.
By means of this table, the available wind energy can be estimated at the height of 50m for four topographic conditions.  (Regions where local concentration effects may occur are not indicated.  Such regions are expected to exist in the United Kingdom, Fr
ance, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece.)<p>

All 
the well-exposed hills and ridges of mainland Scotland, the 
Western Isles, the Orkney Isles, and the Shetland Isles have a 
MAWS greater than 12m/s and an energy density greater than 2kW 
per square metre.  As will be discussed in the final chapter, 
current wind farm developments in the UK are concentrated on the 
good sites of Cornwall, Wales, Cumbria, and the East coast 
regions of England, with MAWSs greater than 7m/s.  The 
'technical potential wind energy resource' for the UK has been 
conservatively estimated (Ref 2) to be 45 TWh/y, around 15% of 
annual electricity supply.<p>
<p>
As has been mentioned earlier, the wind varies (in both speed 
and direction) with height above ground level, as in any 
boundary layer flow.  This <b>wind shear</b> effect can be quite 
significant for a large WTG (more than 20m diameter), in 
providing a wind pressure gradient across the rotor disc; the 
loading on a turbine blade will fluctuate periodically as it 
rotates.  The wind shear profile is often assumed to follow a 
'one seventh power law', but the reality can be significantly 
different where for example a hill top causes a local 
acceleration of the wind.  The wind speeds given in the European 
wind atlas are quoted for a reference height of 50m above 
ground, which is representative of the hub height of a MW scale 
wind turbine; standard UK Meteorological Office data is quoted 
for a height of 10m, which is therefore probably an 
under-estimate of the hub-height wind speed.  Historical records 
of wind speed at the Cranfield control tower anemometer indicate 
a MAWS of around 4m/s which is rather less than the 6-7m/s 
suggested by the wind atlas.<p>
<p>
<b>Variations of wind speed</b> occur over a wide range of time scales.  
Some years are windier than others, and there may well be an 
historical trend of changing wind speeds.  Seasonal variations 
are marked, even for the temperate climate of Northern Europe; 
the monsoons of SE Asia for example would place critical 
loadings on a WTG.  The variations associated with the passage 
of weather systems over the site have a time scale of around 
three days.  Diurnal variations also have an implication for 
wind power production: when the wind dies down in the late 
afternoon, other grid-connected sources are required to provide 
the power for the early evening peak demand.  Our personal 
experience of the wind, standing on the top of an exposed hill 
for instance, tells us that second-by-second variations can be 
very considerable.  This variability is caused by turbulent 
eddies in the flow, generated by thermal gradients and 
topographic features.  Wind <b>gusting</b> superimposes random blade 
vibrations on top of the periodic oscillations due to wind shear; 
fluctuations in rotor torque impose severe demands on the wind 
turbine gearbox and could mean that the electrical power quality 
is unacceptable to the utility.  For the estimation of 
structural excitation and fatigue damage, it is often useful to 
use a spectral approach to the wind variability, considered as 
continuous <b>turbulence</b>.<p>

     DETAILS The figure illustrates the fact that "atmospheric turbulence causes important fluctuating aerodynamic forces on wind turbines - the stress and power output fluctuations of a wind turbine are strongly a function of both the rotation of the rot
or and the moment-by-moment variations of turbulent wind velocity in both space and time".

It can be seen, therefore, that associated with high wind speeds 
are various harmful effects of great concern to the wind turbine 
manufacturer.  To first order, turbulence levels are 
proportional to the wind speed - levels of 20% are not atypical 
for good sites.  Sites in mountainous regions may have quite 
excellent average wind speeds, but the air is so churned up by 
the terrain itself that the turbulent loadings demand a costly 
'over-design' to a number of critical components.  Simply 
because the wind turbine is placed high up on a tower it will be 
exposed to the worst of driving rain.  In Northern regions, and 
at high altitudes, the precipitation comes down as snow and 
forms ice.  In coastal regions, the wind turbine must be 
protected against the corrosive effects of sea water.  And at 
the other extreme, in the deserts of California, temperatures 
are very high, and sand erosion and dust penetration are 
important problems.  These elements form the hostile environment 
in which a WTG must operate.<p>


<h2>Technology II</h2><p>

The target lifetime for a wind turbine is generally 20 years.  
Since they are intended for installation in remote and exposed 
areas, maintenance will be both costly and limited.  On-site 
inspections of many components can be carried out regularly, but 
failed components will be replaced rather than repaired.  
Sophisticated examination procedures cannot be carried out 
on-site, and specialist repairs (to the gearbox for example) 
must be carried out at the factory.  Problems with the rotor 
(blades and hub) are likely to be costly since they will require 
access and possibly removal.  Elaborate monitoring 
instrumentation (over and above basic operational status and 
power production) on every machine in a wind farm would add 
significantly to the total project cost.<p>

Component fatigue is obviously a major concern to a 
manufacturer, and very roughly speaking the <b>stochastic loading</b> 
associated with turbulence accounts for 50% of the fatigue 
damage on the rotor.  But for a HAWT, particularly vulnerable 
components are the yaw drive and yaw brake which take a lot of 
punishment especially on turbulent sites.  Continual wind 
veering means that for a large proportion of the time the rotor 
is misaligned to the wind, resulting in loss of power, increased 
blade bending moments, and torque at the yaw axis.  It has been 
found counter-productive to make the yaw controller too active 
in following the wind direction changes, since that in itself 
can significantly increase fatigue damage.  Any kind of 
imbalance in the rotor can also add to the vibratory loading on 
the yaw drive.<p>

The variability of the wind also raises the need for power 
control.  Power cannot be allowed to increase much beyond the <b>
rated power</b>  of the machine because of the risk of damage to the 
gearbox and generator.  There are three methods of power control 
in wide use.  <b>Full-blade pitch control</b> provides a mechanism for 
varying the pitch angle of each blade so as to reduce the angle 
of attack in high winds; the hub of a pitch-controlled HAWT is 
quite complicated and the actuator system must have enough power 
to rotate the whole blade.  A simpler solution is <b>tip control</b> 
where only the outer 20% (say) of the blade is rotated.  The

             -->
shows power versus wind speed (m/s) of a 
tip-controlled rotor - the measured mean power over each 10 
minute interval has been normalised by the rated power of 330kW.  
The hub and blade root details of a tip-controlled HAWT will be 
simpler than for full-blade pitch control; maintenance of the 
actuator and tip bearings of a tip-regulated blade can be done 
from an access door half way up the tower with the blade at 
bottom-dead-centre.<p>

<b>Stall regulation</b> on the other hand, relies on the inherent 
aerodynamic stalling of the aerofoil sections to limit the power 
in high winds, and so in principal is the simplest and cheapest 
method of power control to engineer.  The 
<a href="stallperf.gif"> next figure (size 21kb)</a> shows

a similarly-treated power curve for a stall-regulated HAWT, this 
time normalised for a maximum power of 125kW; actually this 
turbine is rated by the manufacturer at 108kW, which illustrates 
the problem of over-production for stall-regulated turbines.  
Stall-regulated rotors must also have small, pitchable tips 
fitted to provide aerodynamic braking in an emergency if the 
rotor should over-speed (when the mechanical brake would be 
unable to stop the rotor).  Most small WTGs (under say 150kW) 
are stall-regulated; there is some interest in simplifying the 
rotors of larger machines by using stall-control, if only there 
was confidence that the power would actually be limited.<p>

<b>Variable speed</b> control aims to continuously vary the rotor speed 
with the wind speed so as to keep the ratio of the two constant 
for optimum rotor efficiency.  The necessary AC-DC-AC inverter 
links have now been developed to make this a possibility.  An 
innovative German manufacturer has now developed a variable 
speed WTG without gearbox, using a directly-coupled large rim 
generator.<p>

The point has been made earlier about the desirability of 
simplifying the rotor for the sake of <b>reliability and 
maintainability</b>.  Indeed, the achievement of <b>simplicity</b> has 
become something of a creed in the wind industry, with the 
widespread view that the more complicated a component is made 
(often for the purpose of increasing energy capture), the less 
reliable and more difficult to maintain and repair it will be.  
By far the biggest proportion of reported component failures is 
to the electrical control system.  Failure of the grid itself is 
not infrequent and will result in the WTG shutting down.  
Failures on the rotor are significant and, as has already been 
mentioned, are generally difficult to correct.  Problems with 
the specialist equipment such as gearbox and generator, though 
not particularly frequent, are associated with a high level of 
down time.<p>

Where mechanical failures have occurred in great numbers, they 
were invariably the result of poor design detailing and/or 
manufacturing quality control.  These <b>type failures</b> are most 
serious for the operator.  One of the most (in)famous examples 
concerned the Alternegy GRP blades fitted to something like 1500 
wind turbines in California; after a relatively short period of 
operation, some of these blades experienced root failures which 
were subsequently found (1986) to be associated with inadequate 
quality control (incorrect tightening of root bolts, excessive 
stiffness in the root bushings, and lack of root filling).  Law 
suits were the inevitable outcome, and an extensive blade 
replacement programme.  This, and a few other failures like 
it, are now seen to be the result, to a large extent, of the 
'over-stimulation' of a juvenile wind energy industry by the tax 
credits offered for renewable energy plant in California in the 
early 1980s.<p>

Since that time, the technology has improved considerably, 
through a process of emulation of the best and rejection of the 
worst.  <b>Availability factors</b> of 95% or more, and <b>overall load 
factors</b> of up to 40%, are now being claimed for the most 
successful machines.  And many of the reasons for 
'under-performance' of wind turbines are now better understood: 
poor positioning in relation to the local landscape and to other 
turbines (micro-siting) is the cause in many cases.  Operation 
in the rain and blade soiling are also reasons for 
under-performance in various locations.<p>

<b>Vertical-axis wind turbines</b> have been mentioned only briefly so 
far.  In general, they have not lived up to the expectations 
their proponents have raised;  none of the supposed advantages 
over the HAWT configuration have been realised in practice, and 
they have suffered more than their share of vibration problems 
and type failures.  Worldwide, there are now very few 
manufacturers actively producing vertical-axis machines.  Indeed 
the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee has recently 
criticised the UK's VAWT development as a waste of resources.<p>


<h2>Economics</h2><p>

Like any other renewable energy source, the fuel for a WTG is 
free, with no delivery charges to the site.  So why is economics 
an issue?  Well, the turbine must be bought, delivered to the 
site, installed and commissioned.  This requires capital, and 
there is a cost associated with that capital, even if only the 
'loss' of not getting any interest when you 
take the money out of your savings account to buy the wind turbine.  
Then there are costs incurred when the WTG is operated and 
maintained.  All these costs are encapsulated by the concept of 
the  <b>cost of energy</b>  (CoE), which is an expression for the total 
generation cost per unit of electricity produced:<p>
<pre>
<h3>                  G  =  C ( R + M ) / E </h3>
</pre>
<p>
where <b>C</b> are the initial capital costs, <b>R</b> is the annual charge 
rate on capital, <b>M</b> is the annual operation and maintenance costs 
as a fraction of the initial capital, and <b>E</b> is the annual energy 
yield given by:<p>
<pre>
<h3>                  E  =  h W F </h3>
</pre>
<p>
where <b>h</b> is the number of hours in a year (8760), <b>W</b> is the rated 
power of the wind turbine, and <b>F</b> is the overall load factor.  So 
the generation costs are:<p>
<pre>
<h3>                  G  =  ( C / W ) ( R + M ) / ( h F ) </h3>
</pre>
<p>
This is the expression given for CoE in Ref 3, which is 
essentially that presented in the final chapter (Ref 4) of the 
most useful British text book.
The ratio <b>C / W</b>  describes the initial capital cost per 
kW of rated power, the sum <b>R + M</b>  describes the annual costs of 
capital and maintenance as a fraction of the initial capital, 
and the product <b>h F</b> is the effective number of hours in the year 
when the WTG can be considered to be operating at rated power.<p>

The annual charge rate can be expressed in terms of the interest 
or discount rate <b>r</b> net of inflation, and the repayment term <b>n</b> 
years:<p>
<pre>
<h3>                  R  =  r / { 1 - ( 1 + r ) ^ (-n) } </h3>
</pre>
<p>
The overall load factor may be expressed as the product of the 
capacity factor <b>L</b> of the wind turbine, reduced by factors 
representing machine availability <b>A</b> and other causes of loss of 
energy or efficiency <b>a</b>, such as inter-machine interference or 
transmission losses, which are not accounted for in the machine 
performance characteristics:<p>
<pre>
<h3>                  F  =  L A a </h3>
</pre>
<p>
The capacity factor <b>L</b> is determined from the machine performance 
characteristics and the wind speed frequency distribution.  
Reasonable assumptions can be made for the performance 
characteristic as a function of wind speed (or wind speed 
normalised by the rated wind speed <b>Ur</b>  ); the

(reproduced from Ref 4)
shows a cubic curve over the range between the start-up wind speed and the 
rated speed, with zero power above the shut-down speed.  For the 
wind speed probability, a Rayleigh distribution is usually 
assumed in the absence of any site-specific data: this gives an 
expression for the probability of exceeding a given speed as a 
function of the site MAWS <b>Um</b> .  The 
 <a href="windperf.gif">same figure </a>
also shows such probability distributions for typical 
values of the ratio <b>Ur / Um</b> .  The capacity factor is then 
determined as the integrated sum (over all possible wind speeds) 
of the power production multiplied by the wind speed 
probability.  For a given wind turbine, this is a strong 
function of the site MAWS.<p>

The expression for the cost of energy can now be evaluated using 
some representative values: 2% for operation and maintenance 
costs, 95% for machine availability, and a factor of 90% for 
other losses.  Assuming a turbine with a rated wind speed of 
13.3m/s and a site with a MAWS of 7.8m/s (so that the ratio <b>Ur / Um</b>  
is equal to 1.71), the capacity factor turns out to be 37% which 
is representative of the first wind farm sites to be developed 
in the UK.  If we further assume that the capital is borrowed 
at a real rate of return of 8% per annum, and repayed over a 
term of 8 years, then the annual charge comes to 17.4%.  
Finally, for a capital cost of 
 £880 
 per kW of rated power, the 
cost of energy (over the period of the repayment) comes out as 
6.3p/kWh.  This number should not be taken as the definitive 
cost of wind-generated electricity, but merely an indicative 
value; the

(again reproduced from Ref 4) shows the sensitivity of this CoE to 
variations in the assumed values (logarithmic scales).  Wind 
speed is more significant than any other factor.  We have 
earlier discussed the issues affecting machine availability; 
capital cost is a function of machine size, production volume, 
and site accessibility.<p>

The current trend is to use an alternative formulation for cost 
of energy based on costs per unit of rotor swept area, rather 
than costs per unit of rated power.  Thus the CoE equation 
becomes:<p>
<pre>
<h3>                  G  =  ( C / S ) R / (E / S)  +  M C / E </h3>
</pre>
<p>
where <b>S</b> is the rotor swept area, and the <b>specific yield</b> is given 
by the empirical relation<p>
<pre>
<h3>              E / S  =  2.5 Um ^ 3 </h3>
</pre>
<p>
In a recent analysis of UK developments (the BWEA submission to 
the Renewable Energy Advisory Group (Ref 5)), the following 
table of capital costs was given as a linear function of site 
MAWS<p>

and a value of 2.5% was recommended for the O&M costs.  
Assuming a capital recovery factor <b>R</b>  of .174 as before, and 
taking a hub-height wind speed of 7.8m/s, gives CoE of 
6.2p/kWh which is very close to the previous value.<p>

In making 
<b>cost comparisons</b> with other sources of electricity, it is 
important to use similar assumptions concerning the capital 
recovery in each case.  The generation of electricity by coal, 
gas and nuclear is a capital-intensive operation carried out 
by a large industrial company (National Power, PowerGen, and 
Nuclear Electric in the UK), and new generation plant is 
financed internally over a long time-scale.  The Renewable 
Energy Advisory Group (Ref 5) has recently estimated that "a 
typical onshore wind turbine would generate electricity at a 
cost of about 7p/kWh assuming a 20 year life, 7.5m/s wind 
speed at hub height and a 15% required rate of return".<p>

There have been two distinct trends in the <b>size of wind 
turbines</b>.  What may be described as "the Danish approach" 
involved stretching the simple and small-scale technology 
which had its roots in agricultural engineering; this led from 
machines of 22kW, upwards to 100kW and currently machines of 
around 300kW.  The other approach started with an initial 
decision to develop large (MW) machines using aerospace 
engineering, but the prototypes were prone to failure and 
uneconomic - these "manufacturers have gradually reduced the 
size to find a machine which is commercially viable.  The two 
approaches have now met at machines with rated capacities of 
approximately 300kW and rotor diameters of 25m." (Ref 6). A 
recent study on the potential of large machines (Ref 7) has 
concluded there will be little difference in the manufacturing 
cost (per annual kWh) of turbines with diameters in the range 30m to 80m; a 
related study (Ref 8) makes the same conclusion in relation to 
CoE over this diameter range, with the implication that "the 
best use of land" will be a decisive criterion for selecting the 
size of large wind turbines.<p>

An <b>energy accounting</b> approach to the cost of wind energy has 
been taken in Ref 9.  A 'harvest factor' was defined as the 
ratio of displaced primary energy by energy generated from the 
WTG to the primary energy consumed in its manufacture; the best 
machines were shown to have a harvest factor of 4, which means 
that within one year, 4 times the primary energy input was 
displaced by the wind electricity generation.<p>

It is beyond the scope of this lecture to present comparative 
costs of the different supply technologies, since that would 
require the adoption of common standards in each case.  But the 
opportunity must be taken to raise the issue of <b>external costs</b>, 
the costs which may be added to the financial costs to account 
for the external consequences of electricity production, 
including damage to the environment and health, the cost of 
clearing up polluted areas, defending oil routes, etc.  Many 
countries are now introducing 'carbon taxes' which are a 
practical attempt to add something for external costs to the 
fossil-fuel sources.  An estimate of the avoided cost of using 
wind energy is given in Ref 10 for both the Netherlands and UK.  
In the UK, that study finds a figure of 4.6p/kWh is saved by 
using wind energy, of which 1.9p/kWh is for the cost of 
emissions; these estimates may be conservative since they 
exclude the external costs associated with particulate and solid 
pollutants.  Clearly estimates of this magnitude would make a 
significant difference to our interpretation of comparative 
costs, but the methodology needs to gain a broad acceptance 
before it can provide a rational basis to decision making.  A 
recent critical survey (Ref 11) of published electricity 
generation costs and trends has concluded that a realistic 
carbon tax, scheduled for the year 2000, would add 1.2p to the 
cost of generating a kWh from coal, 0.8p for gas, and 0.5p for 
nuclear.<p>


<h2>Current Developments in the UK</h2> <p>
<h4>this section is most in need of updating:  scheduled for January 1995</h4>

The situation of wind power (and, indeed, the other renewables) 
has changed dramatically in the UK since the turn of the decade.  
Prior to then, there were just a few, isolated and experimental, 
wind turbines scattered across England, Wales and Scotland.  The 
UK's Department of Energy (now disbanded) began a modestly-
funded R&D programme in the mid 1970's, concentrating most of 
its support for the large prototypes eventually built on the 
Island of Orkney, Scotland (the 60m diameter HAWT rated 3MW) and 
at Carmarthen Bay, Wales (the 25m diameter VAWT rated 130kW).  
From the late 1970s onwards, the electricity utility for England 
and Wales, the Central Electricity Generating Board (now 
disbanded) showed a steadily-increasing interest in wind energy, 
to the extent of developing the site at Carmarthen Bay as a 
demonstration centre for wind energy, and building a 55m 
diameter HAWT (rated 1MW) at Richborough in Kent.  Then, at the 
end of the 1980s, the CEGB announced a major plan to develop 
wind farms, of about 25 machines each, at three named sites.<p>

But that plan was blown sideways by the Government's decision to 
privatise the UK electricity supply industry.  The CEGB was 
split into four companies:  National Power, PowerGen, Nuclear 
Electric and the National Grid Company.  The 12 regional area 
boards, which distributed and sold on the electricity to the 
consumer, became independent companies, called Regional 
Electricity Companies, jointly owning the National Grid Company.  
Also at this time (late 1989 - early 1990), the real costs of 
nuclear power were emerging from the public inquiry into the 
proposed Sizewell B reactor (now started up), giving 
rise to the need for the Government to retain ownership of the 
nuclear power stations through Nuclear Electric.  
Simultaneously, a change to the rating system (local property 
tax) eliminated the unfair distinction between generation plant 
operated by the CEGB and plant operated by the independents.  
From this major upheaval, via the mechanism of the Non-Fossil 
Fuel Obligation, has emerged the Government stimulus which has 
had such a dramatic impact on renewables in the UK.<p>

The NFFO is a requirement placed upon the 12 RECs "to contract 
for a specified amount of generating capacity from non-fossil 
sources (ie nuclear and the renewables, including wind). ... The 
additional cost to the RECs resulting from satisfying NFFO 
orders is recovered by them via a levy on electricity sales. ... 
The first renewables order was made [in 1990] and the contracts 
made by the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency to comply with it 
include nine for wind, of which five are wind farms" (Ref 12). 
A second order was placed in 1991, including a total of 49 wind 
projects, of which 38 are wind farms. These wind projects are 
listed in the attached <a href="farmlist.html">table</a>, 
and their locations indicated on 
the attached <a href="map.gif">map</a>.<p>

<H1>The causes of the accident and its progress.</H1>
<HR>
Untill the end of the day of <B>25 April 1986</B>, operators  of  the
forth unit of the <B>Chernobyl NPP</B> did some  erroneous  actions.  It
resulted in unstable operation mode of the reactor expressed in the decrease
of its power with unacceptably small reactivity margin  <A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A>.  This
circumstance had combined with design drawbacks of  reactors  of  this
type (positive reactivity coefficient and instability of operation
at small power, imperfection of control and protection system <A HREF = "sources.html#15">[15]</A>
and with most serious violations of the safety operation rules
(for instance, <B> switching-off blocking of  the  reactor  protection
system</B>). After the second electroturbogenerator was  turned  off
as it was planned before in order to make an electrotechnical experiment, all these factors had led to a practically  instantaneous  catastrophic
increase of thermal power on 26  April  1986  at  1  hour  23  min
(Moscow time). As  a  result,  <B> steam  explosion occured</B>,  <A HREF = "fruin4m.gif">the
reactor and a part of the building were destroyed</A>.
Radioactive materials accumulated in  the reactor core started to be thrown out into the environment
<P>
Multiple fire sites were formed both inside the reactor  hall
and on roofs of nearby buildings  because  of  the  explosion  and
throwing out fragments heated up to high temperatures. By 5  o'clock on
26  April  1986  the  fire men smothered  main  fire  sites
except the  central  reactor  hall,  where  graphite  continued to
burn in the close vicinity of the destroyed reactor
<P>
     In subsequent days, about 5000 tons of  materials,  including
about  40  tons  of  substances  containing  boron  and  absorbing
neutrons, 2400 tons of lead, 1800 tons of sand and clay, 600  tons
of dolomite, trinatriumphosphate  and  polymerizing  liquids  were
thrown into the reactor well from <A HREF = "helabove.gif">helicopters  of  air  forces</A>  to
extinguish burning graphite and suppress radioactive release.  The flow
of different substances continued untill the  beginning  of
June 1986. It is not clear yet, whether the throwing of materials  off
the reactor  ruins  reached  its goal.  According  to  the  data  of
subsequent observations, only a small part of the thrown materials
got into the reactor well, and they mainly formed hills  with  the
height up to 15 m in the central hall of the unit 4.  Partial  filling
of the channels formed at the explosion could take place.  As  the
channels were the ways for flows of hot air leaving  the  reactor
self-heating of the reactor  core  ruins  could  take  place.  The
action could also be in the form of  mechanical  destructions  and
displacements, and this also caused redistribution of  the  energy
balance formed after the accident.
<P>
    After accident <A HREF = "sarclast.gif">the object "Shelter"</A>  was constructed. Its construction was one of the most complicated building work in the world. In condition of high radiation this unique object was finished by November of 1986.
<P>
<IMG SRC  = "sarclast.gif" ALIGN="MIDDEL"> "Shelter". Winter, 1986.
<P>
   Unfortunately, 30 persons (staff of block and fire  brigade) died 
receiving high doses of radiation. The square of contaminated area has 
been more than 130000 sq. km (by <A HREF = "estim.gif">Cs in USSR only</A>). 
Near 4.9 millions people lived on this territory before the Accident. 
All population from 30-km zone was evacuated totally. A lot of people 
were relocated.
<P>  
   Impact of the Chernobyl Accident on a Nuclear Energy Policy is tremendous. Some countries stopped national nuclear energy programs. A construction of new plants in USSR were frozen. Public opinion was directed against Nuclear Power Plants. Some plants was closed (Armenian NPP, for example. Nowadays, Armenia has decided to reactivate plant for energy production).
<P>
   Chernobyl Accident had initiated an international activity in the area of nuclear safety and nuclear emergency planning. Many countries started a development of decision support systems for nuclear accident case.

<TITLE> Radionuclide composition of the  Chernobyl-4 reactor core. </TITLE>

<H1> Radionuclide Composition of the  Chernobyl-4 Reactor Core. </H1>
<HR>
At present the radionuclide inventory of the  reactor core  is  calculated  with  the  help  of special  computer programs, as far as physical processes of nuclide  formation and  their  characteristics  are  well  known.  For  each particular  reactor  design,  knowing  fuel  composition and parameters   characterizing   time   variation   of    power generation,   this   problem   has   sufficiently   accurate solution. Calculation error depends on particular situation  and  the  radionuclide  type. For 
instance, for calculations made in <A HREF = "sources.html#9">[9]</A> this  error is about 5%  for Cs-137 and 20% for  Pu-236.  In  <A HREF = "sources.html#9">[9]</A> the radionuclide  inventory of the  core  at  the  accidental  moment  is  not presented in explicit form.  However, as far as it presents the  absolute value  of  the  release  of  basic  radionuclides  (with the estimate  of  error  +50%)  and  their  part with respect to 
activity of nuclides in  the reactor, the core  inventory at the  accidental  moment  can  be  easily  reconstructed   by calculations,  and  this  was  done  in <A HREF = "sources.html#18">[18]</A> (<A HREF = "#coretable">Table at the end of current topic</A>). The authors  of <A HREF = "sources.html#1"> [1]</A>  used  in  their  calculations the averaged value burn-up equal to 10.3 MW*day/kg of uranium.  There  is a  number  of  later   works,  for  instance, <A HREF = "sources.html#
12">[12,  14, 16]</A>, the  authors  of  which  calculate  the  same   radionuclide inventory with  different accuracy. 
<P> 
There are  no  serious differences in  the general  approach. However, in a 
number of works made soon after the accident, their authors had  to use 
approximate  initial data,  because they  had no accurate data  on  fuel 
burn-up  and  enrichment. Thus, employees of Bremen  university sampled  soil  in  the  region of Munchen, 
measured the  ratio of  activity of  reference isotopes  and estimated  the  average  fuel  burn-up  at the moment of the accident as  (12.85-0.15) MW*day/kg <A HREF = "sources.html">[13]</A>. The  authors from the Livermore  Laboratory <A HREF = "sources.html#16">[16]</A>  used underestimated  data on fuel burn-up  and time  of reactor  operation This  explains somewhat   lower   results   as   compared   with  <A HREF = "sources.html#1">[1,  12]</A>. Specialists  of  the  USSR  hydro
meteorological service <A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14]</A> relied mainly  on the  data of  <A HREF = "sources.html#1">[1]</A>, but  corrected some  of them with the results of their own field measurements.   The most accurate value of average burn-up is presented  in <A HREF = "sources.html#12">[12]</A> and is 10.9 MW*day/kg. It is essential that there  were fuel  assemblies  with  different  burn-up  in  the reactor. Therefore,  the  usage  of  the  average  burn-up  value for calculation 
without   accounting   for   nonlinearity of radionuclide formation  in separate  assemblies also  causes considerable  inaccuracy.  These  processes  of   individual burn-up  and  generation  of  radionuclides  in each of 1659 fuel assemblies  were taken  into account  only in  the work "Fuel in the reactor of  unit 4 at the Chernobyl  NPP" <A HREF = "sources.html#12">[12]</A>, which   gives   the   most   accurate,   to   our   opinion, characteristics  of  radionuclide  inventory  of  the 
 core. Unfortunately,  this  work  considers  only the inventory of basic   long-lived   isotopes.    Further   refinement of calculations connected with accounting for inhomogeneity  of neutron  field  in  the  reactor  weakly  told on the values presented in  <A HREF = "#coretable">table placed below</A>,  excluding the  data on  inventory of transuranium elements.

     At the first stage the mechanical release  of  the  dispersed 
fuel took  place  as  a  result  of  the  initial  explosion.  Its 
radionuclide composition corresponds to fuel inventory of the core 
with enrichment by volatile nuclides  of  iodine,  tellurium,  and 
cesium (Load <A HREF = "rstages.gif">picture</A> for illustration if it is needed).

<HR>
     At the second stage, from 26 April till 2 May(<A HREF = "rstages.gif">picture of release</A>), the  power  of 
the release fell, obviously because of the measures undertaken for 
extinguishing of burning graphite, and formation of the filtrating 
layer. The dependence of the  release  power  on  time  <B>Q(t)</B> 
at this stage can be presented in the  first  approximation 
as 
<P> 
<B>   Q(t) = 0.25.exp(-0.28.t), day  ,             (1)</B> 
<P> 
where <B>0.25</B>, <B>day</B>  , is the part of the total release  corresponding 
to the first day; <B>t</B>, <B>days</B>, is the time after the explosion. 
<P> 
     At  this  stage  the  release  consisted  of   fine-dispersed 
particles of fuel dust entrained by the flow of  hot  air  and  of 
graphite burning products. The <A HREF = "coreinv.html">radionuclide  composition  is  also 
close to the fuel one</A>.

<H1>Third Stage of Radionuclides Release.</H1>
<HR>
     The next, the third stage of the accident is characterized by 
fast increase of the release power(<A HREF = "rstages.gif">picture of stages</A>), at first with predominance  of 
the  volatile  component,  especially  of  iodine,  and  then  the 
composition became again close to the fuel one. The  approximation 
of the release power in this period is the following: 
<P> 
           Q(t) = 0.09.exp(0.35.(t-5)), day  .           (2) 
<P> 
     The release at this stage was attributed to fuel heating over 
2000 C  by  the  residual   heat   release.   As   a   result   of 
temperature-dependent migration of  decay  products  and  chemical 
conversions of uranium dioxide, the decay  products  were  released 
in the form of aerosols or of the particles  of  graphite  burning 
products.

<h1>Energy Awareness Month--Speech</h1>

<h2>Energy Awareness--Why Should We Care?</h2>




<ul>
 <li>For the fifteenth year in a row, the Department of Energy (DOE) has 
declared
that October is Energy Awareness Month.  Some people may ask why?  Prices 
are
reasonable.  There are no gas lines or fuel shortages.  Why should you 
care?

<ul>
<li>The reason is our children, their children, and the generations that 
follow.
The United States and other nations are making decisions today that will 
affect
the global economy and environment for centuries to come.
</ul>
 <li>In 1860, when Abe Lincoln was running for President, the United 
States was
using the equivalent of 111 million barrels of oil annually.  Today, we 
use
that much oil in less than a week.
<ul>

<li>Energy--where we get it, how we use it affects virtually every aspect 
of our
lives--our health, our budgets, our national economy, our national 
security, our
lifestyles.

<li>We think it's worthwhile once a year to stop and think about this 
pervasive
influence on our lives.
</ul>
 <li>To understand the role of energy today, and properly plan for its 
future, it
is important to understand its past.

<ul>
<li>Since the first Native Americans, we have constantly sought new 
sources of
energy.  We first used our own physical energy, then harnessed the 
strength of
animals.

<li>We tapped the power of streams and rivers to operate machines, caught 
the
wind to pump water and to sail our ships.

<li>We found ways to use fossil fuels for energy, and today they account 
for 85%
of the energy used in the United States.

<li>We learned to harness the energy from nuclear power, which provides 
20% of
our electricity.  

<li>We also are learning ways to more efficiently use renewable energy: 
solar,
hydro, wind, and thermal.  Renewables today account for 8% of our 
nation's
energy.

</ul>
 <li>Energy surrounds us, yet it is seldom noticed.  It is hidden behind 
walls and
underground, or is designed to prevent us from having to think about 
energy
within our cars.  Our homes, cars and consumer products often are 
designed to
prevent us from having to think about energy.

<ul>
<li>For example, we all know that automobiles use a lot of energy, but do 
you know
how much of the energy contained in your car's gasoline actually turns 
the
wheels?  The answer is only 13%. The rest of the energy is wasted.

<li>Another example:  the United States has 5% of the world's population.  
Do you
know what percent of the world's energy we use?  The answer: 25%.

<li>One more quiz question:  we know that motor vehicles cause air 
pollution. Do
you know how much we spend for health care related to air pollution? The
answer:  $50 billion each year.  By one estimate, that pollution is 
responsible
for 120,000 premature deaths each year in the United States. 
</ul>
 <li>Though we may take it for granted, energy costs amount to a 
significant
portion of the dollars we spend.  We don't realize the cost, because the 
energy
costs of our products are imbedded in them--we don't see the energy costs 
for
manufacturing, transporting, or marketing. 

<ul>
<li>Last year, we spent $51 billion on imported oil.  By the end of this 
decade,
the amount of U.S. dollars leaking away to oil-producing nations overseas 
is
expected to grow to $94 billion. 

<li>Today, we spend almost $500 billion annually in the U.S. to light and 
heat
our homes and offices, run our transportation systems, and operate our 
farms
and factories.

<li>Even modest energy savings can produce new tax-free disposable income 
for our
families, new capital for our businesses, and lower overhead to make our
industries more competitive. 

</ul>
 <li>But money is not the only reason we should be aware of energy.  The
production and consumption of energy causes more environmental damage 
than any
other single human activity.

<ul>
<li>To give just one example:  the energy that runs our appliances, 
furnaces,
water heaters, air conditioners, and lighting produces two tons of carbon

dioxide each year for every man, woman, and child in the United States. 
</ul>

 <li>This October, the world stands at a crossroads in regard to energy 
use and,
by extension, the quality of our natural environment and our lives.

<ul>
<li>During this decade, the United States is expected to spend as much as 
$200
billion on new electric generating capacity.  

<li>Worldwide, nations will spend an estimated $1 trillion in the next 
few years
to bring electric power to the billions of people who don't have it. 

<li>The choices we make about where that energy comes from and how it is 
produced
and consumed will affect the world environment for a long, long time to 
come.
</ul>

 <li>That's why DOE established this year's Energy Awareness Month theme 
as
"Energy--Our Future Is Today."

<ul>
<li>The goal of Energy Awareness Month this year is not only to promote a 
greater
public understanding and awareness of energy sources, but to encourage 
all of
us to take the long view--to consider the kind of future we want to 
create for
our children, and the children being born in other nations around the 
world.
</ul>

 <li>Today, policy makers in Washington and in the international 
community often
refer to this long-range view as "sustainable development."

<ul>
<li>The goal of sustainable development is to meet the needs of today's
generation without impairing the ability of tomorrow's generations to 
meet
<u>their</u> needs.

<li>In sustainable development, we engage in economic development in ways 
that do
not harm the environment.  In other words, we find ways to achieve both
economic development and environmental health.

<li>Our future depends on our ability to make peace between economic 
development
and the environment.  And how we produce and consume energy will be the 
key to
our success or failure.
</ul>

 <li>To understand the need for sustainable development, let's take just 
a moment
to look at this global view--at the big picture. 

<ul>
<li>25% of the population lives in developed countries like the United 
States.
They consume 75% of the energy worldwide.  

<li>Today, an estimated two billion people around the world do not have
electricity.  In the years ahead, there will be a major push among 
nations to
meet their energy needs.

<li>China and India--the world's two most populous nations--are among the 
many
underdeveloped countries undertaking aggressive economic development 
programs
and planning major investments in energy systems. 

<li>The world investment in energy, with its attendant impact on 
environment,
will keep growing. The world's population is expected to shoot from 5.6 
billion
to 8 billion in the next quarter-century. Driven by this continuing 
population
growth and by economic development, global energy consumption is expected 
to
increase as much as 50% by the year 2010.
</ul>

 <li>The United States must lead the world in developing and using energy

efficiently, and in making the transition to clean, renewable resources 
like
solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal energy.<p>

 <li>One thing is for certain:  we can use the energy sources we have 
more
efficiently and get more power for our money.  We can and are finding new

sources of energy, and we can reduce the impact of energy on the 
environment. <p>

 <li>As Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary puts it: "There has never been a 
greater
opportunity for the United States and other nations around the world to
harmonize the needs of people with the protection of the environment.  If 
we
don't produce and use energy correctly today, we risk damage to our 
environment
tomorrow...The discovery and use of sustainable energy resources advance
economic growth, energy security and environmental health at the same 
time." <p>

 <li>As we celebrate Energy Awareness Month, we all can renew our 
commitment to
using energy resources wisely for the generations that will follow.

<H1>General Characteristics and Evaluation of the Radioactive Release</H1>
<HR>
<A HREF = "rstages.gif"><IMG SRC  = "frelstm.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE>It would be useful to load an illustrative picture here to comparing text with one.</A>
<HR>
     Basic information on radionuclide release at the active stage 
of the accident has been presented in  
<A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A>.   
In  this  work the  data  on  the  amount  and  composition   of    
the   released radionuclides were obtained by calculations, using  
the  models  of transfer of contaminants in the atmosphere.  
The initial information for calculations was: 
<UL> 
<LI> the results of investigations of a small number of  aerosol 
samples taken over the accidental unit; 
<LI> the data of aerial gamma monitoring of the  region  of  the 
Chernobyl NPP; 
<LI> the results of analysis of samples of  depositions  in  the 
near zone; 
<LI> the data on weather conditions in the regions of transport 
of contaminated air masses. 
</UL> 
<P> 
     The process of release of  radioactive  substances  from  the 
accidental reactor was relatively long and  consisted  of  several 
stages, which differed in radionuclide composition  and  intensity 
<A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14]</A>.  
<UL> 
<LI><B><A HREF = "rfstage.html">First stage</A></B>. 
<LI><B><A HREF = "rsstage.html">Second stage</A></B>. 
<LI><B><A HREF = "rtstage.html">Third stage</A></B>. 
<LI><B><A HREF = "rfostage.html">Fourth stage</A></B>. 
</UL> 
Obviously, the release of radioactive noble gases during the 
accident  was  about  100%  (we  have  met  no  discrepancies   in 
estimation of this value). 
<P> 
     Since the moment of the accident <A HREF = "hrel.gif">a high-power stream  of  hot 
air</A> was formed, which carried out radioactive substances from  the 
reactor ruins into the atmosphere. Its power  was  maximal  during 
the first 2-3 days. The height of the stream, as it was  indicated 
in <A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A>, reached more than 1200 m on 27 April,
 1986, 30 km  to  the 
north-west from the Chernobyl NPP: 
<P><IMG SRC  = "cloud3.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE> North-west shadow in progress.
<P> 
The level of radiation  in  the 
stream was about 1 mR/h at the height of 1200 m. In the  following 
days the stream  height  did  not  exceed  200-400  m,  as  it  is 
indicated in [14]. The level of radiation in  the  stream  at  the 
distance of 5-10 km and the height of 200 m was about 1 R/h on  27 
April, and 0.5 R/h on 28 April. 
<P> 
     This estimation of the release height is true 
only for the relatively heavy fuel  component.  According  to  the 
data of <A HREF = "sources.html"#9>[9]</A>, iodine and cesium radioisotopes  were  found  at  the 
heights of 6-9 km. The appearance  of  the  iodine-131  traces  in 
Japan and the USA not later 5 May indicates the same fact. 
<P> 
     The qualitative picture  of  the  release  briefly  presented 
above has not been subjected in its main  details  to  changes  in 
subsequent investigations (see, for instance, <A HREF = "sources.html#2">[2 and  14]</A>),  where 
the data on the initial amount of radionuclides in the reactor and 
the values of the release components were made more accurate. Only 
the statement about termination of significant releases in 10 days 
after the accident (see <A HREF = "rnucrel2.html">"New data on radioactive release"</A>) raises doubts. 
<P> 
     The total amount of the radionuclides  released  out  of  the 
bounds of the Chernobyl NPP area is   50 MCi as  of  6  May  1986, 
with the error of 50% (excluding radioactive gases and  fuel)  and 
the fuel component estimated in <A HREF = "sources.html">[1, 2]</A> as 3.5%-0.5%  of  the  fuel 
inventory in the core  of  the  reactor  with  accuracy  -50%,  is 
confirmed by subsequent investigations <A HREF = "sources.html">[4, 5]</A>. The  estimation  of 
the fuel release less than 1% presented in the USA work  <A HREF = "sources.html#16">[16]</A>  can 
be explained by the  fact  that  its  authors  used  the  data  on 
fallouts and concentration of radionuclides in the air in the  far 
zone, whereas the main part of the fuel component of  the  release 
is concentrated inside the 30-km zone. 
<P> 
<A HREF = "zone.gif"><IMG SRC  = "zonesm.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE> Pu spot inside 30-km zone(press here for more details).</A><P> 
     Main disagreements belong to the estimation of the release of 
iodine and cesium isotopes. The estimation of Cs-137 release  made 
in <A HREF = "sources.html"[1]</A> as 13% was the  subject  of  discussion  in  <A HREF = "sources.html">[1-4,  6,  14, 16-18]</A>, and subsequently increased up to 25 % in <A HREF = "sources.html#4">[4]</A>, over 25%  in 
<A HREF = "sources.html#17">[17]</A>, 33%  -  13%  in  <A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14]</A>,  33%  -  10%  in  <A HREF = "sources.html#2">[2]</A>  bases  on  the 
measurement of  Cs-137  in  fuel  masses  inside  the  containment 
structure (<A HREF = "sarclast.gif">"sarcophagus"</A>) of unit 4, up to 40%  according  to  the 
data of <A HREF = "sources.html#16">[16]</A> based on the data of global fallouts, and reached 60% 
in <A HREF = "sources.html#6">[6]</A>. The authors consider the most  convincing  the  estimation 
presented in <A HREF = "sources.html#2">[2]</A>: 33% - 10%, or  (2.3-0.7)  MCi,  which  coincides 
with the estimation in <A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14, 16]</A>. More detailed  investigations  of 
fuel masses inside the containment structure could  possibly  give 
more accurate information on this subject. 
<P> 
     Still more ambiguous is the  estimation  of  the  release  of 
iodine radioisotopes, first of  all  of  I-131,  which  has  great 
practical importance for reconstruction of the doses to thyroid in 
population.  Unfortunately,  the  measurements  on  26  April  are 
absent, and the first release  of  the  short-lived  radionuclides 
(not   only   of   iodine-131,   but   also   of    tellurium-132, 
molybdenum-99,etc.) is not outlined completely. Besides, there  is 
a circumstance unfavorable for measurements, the release of iodine 
partly in  the  aerosol  and  partly  in  the  gaseous  form.   The 
measurement  of  the  gaseous  iodine  requires  special   complex 
technique. Besides, the relation of the  forms  noticeably  varied 
with time during  the  active  phase  of  the  accident  <A HREF = "sources.html#7">[7]</A>.  The 
approximate constancy of the ratio  of  activities  of  I-131  and 
Cs-137 in fallouts observed in the majority of European  countries 
gives an opportunity to estimate iodine  depositions  with  cesium 
maps. In particular, such estimation was performed in <A HREF = "sources.html#17">[17]</A>,  where 
the conclusion was made that the iodine release was least 45%.  In 
different works the iodine release is estimated from  20%  to  60% 
<A HREF = "sources.html#3">[3-5, 16, 17]</A>, up to 80% in <A HREF = "sources.html#6">[6]</A>. 
<P> 
 To  our  opinion,  the  most  realistic  is  the  estimation   of 
iodine-131 release equal to 50-60% of its content in the  reactor, 
or 40-50 MCi as of 26 April 1986. Accounting for radioactive decay 
in the reactor in the period of active release,  this  corresponds 
to total activity of 30-35 MCi released  into  the  atmosphere  in 
different days. According to the general estimation, about 80%  of 
iodine came out from the reactor in the gaseous form.

     Table presents numerical data on the release  of  different

presents the estimations from the report by  academician  Legasov 
in 1986 <A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A> decay-corrected to 26  April  1986  <A HREF = "sources.html#18">[18]</A>.  The  second 
column gives the estimations from the work by P.H.Gudiksen  et.al. 
<A HREF = "sources.html#16">[16]</A> decay-corrected to 26 April 1986. The  third  column  is  the 
summary of the most reliable (as to the expert evaluation  of  the 
authors) data  on  the  release.  The  data  on  the  radionuclide 
inventory in the reactor are taken in accordance with <A HREF = "sources.html#12">[12, 18]</A>. 
<P> 
     Notice that the release of iodine-131, as well as  of  cesium 
radioisotopes, was evidently underestimated according to the results 
of <A HREF = "sources.html">[1, 18]</A>. The release of iodine-131 was  assumed  equal  to  the 
middle  (45  MCi)  of  the  estimated  interval  40-50  MCi.   The 
estimation of the cesium release as 33%, or 2.3 MCi, is  based  on 
the amount of cesium-137 in the destroyed reactor, which coincides 
with its global distribution in the atmosphere and  deposition  on 
surface. The Cs-134 release was  assumed  equal  to  0.53  of  the 
Cs-137 release (see section 3.2), i.e., 1.2 MCi. The data  on  the 
tellurium release have no discrepancies.  Strong  connection  with 
the <A HREF = "coreinv.html">fuel matrix</A> is assumed for the rest of radionuclides, at least 
during the explosion, and their release is calculated as  3.5%  of 
the amount accumulated in the core.

<H2> <A NAME="options"></A>UK Renewable Energy Options:<br> A Brief Overview</H2>

Renewable energy is so called because it relies on  natural energy flows and sources in the environment, which, since they are continuously replenished, will never run out. The UK  is well placed: it has amongst the world's largest resources of wind, wave and tidal energy.
<p>
Wind turbines sited in windy parts of the countryside could in principle generate perhaps 20% of the UK's electricity, while the potential for wind turbines mounted in shallow water off-shore is even larger - perhaps up to 50% of UK electricity requirements, although the cost would be higher than for on-land machines.  Typical modern wind turbines have a rated output (at full power) of around 400 kilowatts.  They are usually grouped together in `wind farms'.<p>
Wind moving over water creates waves, and the UK wave energy potential, if suitable floating devices could be located in deep water out to sea, (i.e. `deep-sea' systems) could be up to 20% or more of UK electricity requirements.  Smaller amounts of power, at possibly less cost, could be obtained from devices operated nearer to the shore, (`in-shore' or `coastal' systems) and from shore mounted units e.g. sited in gullies, (`on-shore' systems).
<p>
The gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on the seas, produces two tides per day as the earth rotates.  The high tides can be trapped behind a `barrage' on suitable estuaries, creating a head of water which, when released,  can be used to drive turbines, as with low head hydro-electric plants.  Like some existing hydro schemes, some tidal barrages might be large. For example, the scheme proposed for the Severn Estuary would have around 8000 megawatts of installed generating capacity and could supply 6% of UK electricity requirements.  The total UK tidal barrage potential is around 20% of UK electricity requirements. 
<p>
In addition, the fast moving tidal streams in some areas (e.g. around Scotland and the Channel Islands) can also be used to generate power, using propeller type devices located in the flow. If all suitable tidal stream sites were used, they might provide up to 19% of UK electricity requirements.
<p>
More conventionally, although the energy potential is relatively limited, electricity can be generated form the flow of rivers and even streams, via small low head /'run of the river' hydro electric turbines, as well as via the more familiar and larger hydro electric dams; with their construction costs now paid off, the latter  produce the cheapest electricity in the UK.
<p>
In addition to these electricity supplying options, the UK has, surprisingly, a significant solar energy potential, the currently most cost-effective way of exploiting it being via well insulated `passive solar' houses, designed with large south facing windows to trap solar heat.
<p>
Solar energy can also be converted into electricity via the photovoltaic `solar cell' , and solar energy is of course the key power source for plant (and animal) life via photosynthesis.  The harvesting of `energy crops' looks increasingly likely to provide a significant source of `bio-fuels' of various sorts - liquids (like ethanol and bio-diesel) for transport use, and gases (like methane), or solids (eg wood) used for heating or electricity production. 
<p>
 Short rotation 'coppicing' of rapid growing willow or poplar is one option, with the resultant wood chips being converted in a  gasifier plant to produce hot gasses, which in turn are used to drive electricity-producing gas and steam turbines. This could become a major new energy source. 
<p>
Some industrial and domestic wastes can also be used also be used as fuel , although there has been some concern expressed by environmentalists over emissions from waste combustion plants, and not everyone would see waste as strictly 'renewable'.
<p>
Similarly, collecting heat from `geothermal' sources deep underground is not strictly renewable - the geothermal wells would be gradually exhausted.  But the energy potential is quite large - perhaps 10% of UK electricity requirement from `hot dry rock' deep underground.
<p>
The UK already obtains about 2% of its electricity from renewable sources,  chiefly from large to medium scale hydro-electric plants.  There is some potential for expansion of medium and small scale hydro, but wind and waste projects are now being developed around the country on a significant scale and energy crops seen as the next likely area for development.  The Government has however relegated offshore wind, wave and tidal energy  to the long shot categeory, on the basis of cost, although it would seems unlikely, given the UK's maritime history and extensive offshore engineering expertise, for these quite considerable energy resources to be ignored indefinitely.
<p>
<H3>Potential Contributions</H3>
The Department of Trade and Industry's 1994 Energy Paper 62 (DTI 1994), estimated that, in principle, electricity producing renewables might economically supply up to a maximum of 190 TWh/yr by 2025, or around 63% of current consumption.  This is the resource at around 4.5 p/kWh at 15% discount rate.
<br>  
This however is the maximum practical resource and in reality there would be a range of technical, environmental and economic constraints on what could actually be achieved in practice. A more realistic, fairly conservative, mid range estimate, adopted by the UK Governments Renewable Energy Advisory Group, is a 20% contribution to electricity by 2025 (60 TWh/yr) involving around 10, 000 MW (net) of renewable generating capacity. 
<p>
By way of comparison,. at present  (mid 1990's) the UK has around 65,000 MW of conventional electricity generating capacity: more than 50% of this is coal fired, but natural gas fired combined cycled gas turbines have increasingly been introduced. The nuclear element provides around  20% of UK electricity supply, although as the older plants reach the end of their operating life, this will progressively fall. Currently only one new plant has been built  - Sizewell' B'.- and it seems unlikely that, once the nuclear industry is privatised, any further nuclear plants will be ordered in the UK. 
<p>
It seems likely that renewable energy technology will continue to develop in terms of performance and reliability, and become more cost effective. For example the costs of electricity from wind turbines has fallen by around 70% within a decade or so, and similar reductions for photo voltaic solar cells have taken place.
<p>
However, there are obviously some technical constraints. Some renewable  energy sources of course are  intermittent e.g.  the winds and waves, and of course, the sun!   However it has been suggested that intermittency need not be a major operational problem, if  the electricity from these devices is fed into the national power grid network. So long as the total  contribution from  the various intermittent renewables does not exceed around 30-40% of the total electricity on the grid, the grid can in effect 'even out ' local variations, so that the net overall power available from the grid remains more or less constant, without the need for expensive storage systems..  
<p>
Although renewables generally have much less environmental impact than conventional sources, no technology can be totally benign, and they have varying degree of local impact. The development of some renewable energy technologies is therefore also likely to be constrained by local environmental, planning and land use factors. Indeed there have already been some local planning disputes and local opposition in relation to the spread of wind farms in the UK: see 'the <A HREF="#wind">Windpower Debate</A> in the UK'.
<p>
Equally  however, the deployment  of renewables may be stimulated by increasing environmental concerns over the generally much more significant global impacts of using conventional energy technologies e.g. global warming from the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide produced when fossil fuels are burnt. The local and global impacts have to be traded off against each other.
<p>
<H3>Conclusions</H3>
Obviously the future of renewables will depend on a wide range of  technical, economic, environmental and political factors , as well as other policy concerns and political developments, nationally and internationally. Some of the key issues are the question of whether nuclear power can be relied on in the future, the security of supply and balance of payment problems that may face the UK when and if  it has to import natural gas from overseas, the role of energy conservation, and the wider environmental issues relating to greenhouse gas emissions, acid rain and so on. 
<p>
The UK is fortunate in having relatively large reserves of oil, gas and coal, and this, and the relative cheapness of gas, has, arguably,  led to a degree of complacency, not least on energy conservation. But, quite apart from the fact that these fossil fuel reserves are finite, the question remains whether all of them can be used without producing unacceptable environmental problems, most notably in terms of global warming. New technologies are emerging which use fossil fuels more efficiently, thus reducing net  emissions. 
<p>
Obviously in the short term energy conservation and the potential for energy saving via the introduction of more energy -efficient  energy -using technology would  merit top priority. After all, cost effective savings of between 50-80% are claimed as feasible in many end-use sectors,  and it would seem to be foolish to consider any new supply options unless we were also tackling energy waste.  However, although much can be done to avoid energy waste, the UK will still need new sources of energy, as old plant is retired.  Given that nuclear power seems unlikely to revive in the UK at least, the renewable energy based technologies represent  the most promising non -fossil options. 

<p><hr>
<A NAME="wind"></A>
<H2>The Windfarm Debate</H2>
 <H3>The Pro's and Con's of Windfarm</H3>
The UK's potential resource for wind generated electricity, using windturbines sited in windy parts of the countryside, is put at about 20% of current  electricity requirements. That's about what nuclear power provides at present. 
<br>
However the amount of power that can actually be obtained form the winds will depend on how many acceptable sites can be found. Currently nearly thirty windfarms - groups of windturbines on one site - have been set up, in Cornwall, Wales, Yorkshire, Scotland and else where. Most have been welcomed locally, but, in some locations, there have been some strong local protests, chiefly over noise problems and visual intrusion. 
<br>
The Case for Wind Farms is straight forward. Windpower is clean - extracting power from the wind produces no chemical or radioactive emissions, and has minimal physical impacts on the local ecosystem. The land around the windturbines in windfarms can be used for conventional agricultural purposes- indeed sheep seem to welcome  them as windbreaks.
<br>
Birds tend to avoid moving windturbine blades: indeed they seem much more at risk from the large national grid cables. Windturbines are more like bird scarers.
<br>
When and if  needed, decommissioning is easy: when removed, windfarms leave no toxic residues or environmental damage. 
There are no direct fuel  costs,  and the cost of extracting power is bound to fall as the technology improves. It is already seen as commercially competitive in the USA and elsewhere around the world.
<br>
In summary, windpower is sustainable, clean and is increasingly  competitive economically. Its local impacts are relatively small compared with the global impacts of using conventional fuels.
<br>
<H3>But there is also a case against windfarms.</H3> 

<b>Firstly, the local impacts are not always insignificant</B>- local residents may be disturbed by noise and the windfarms intrude on the landscape. Some local residents have reported annoying levels of noise from the blades or the gearing systems of some windturbines - with some, for example, finding it hard to sleep. Others have complained that the machines are ugly, and may deter tourists from the area. Some objectors feel the planning bodies have not been sufficiently rigorous in applying the necessary planning controls. 
<br>
<B>Secondly, some say that the wind programme is counterproductive</B>- it would be better to invest in energy conservation.
Some opponents feel that the wind farms produce expensive electricity and that the developers have simply taken advantage of the interim cross subsidy scheme introduced by the Government to make easy profits, paid for by consumers, whereas the amount of power generated is small compared to what could be saved if we invested instead in energy conservation measures. 
<br>
<B>Finally, some say that the UK is too densely populated</B> to be able to absorb a significant number of wind farms. Wind farms must inevitably be sited on prominent ridges and hills, and these are usually in attractive areas. These should be protected for everyones use. If we must have windturbines, why not put them off shore?
<p>
In summary, wind farms are noisy, ugly, expensive and are not needed or appropriate in the UK countryside.
<br>

<H3>Discussion</H3>

With the foregoing in mind, it seems useful to make the following points.
<br><menu><LI>
<b>Firstly, the economic of windpower are improving</B>, but profit margins are still tight. Even so the extra cost to consumers is small.
<br>
The Governments Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) provides a protected market for both nuclear power and some renewables, together with a surcharge on fossil fuel generation. This fossil fuel levy is passed on ultimately to consumers, and has been running at around 10% of generating costs. It has raised &pound;1.3 billion or so each year so far, &pound;1.2 billion of this going to Nuclear Electric. 
<br>
The small amount left over has supported just under 200 renewable projects, including the 30 or so windfarms so far built. 
<br>
The cost  to the consumer of supporting the wind projects  is very small - less than  a tenth of a percent extra on their bills. The cost was actually artificially high initially because the Government chose to link renewables to nuclear in the NFFO scheme, and this led to a 1998 deadline being imposed by the European Commission, who objected to what they saw as an unfair subsidy for nuclear power.
<br>
The result was that the initial wind power schemes had to be offered a relatively high price in order to recoup their investment by 1998. 
However, the 1998 deadline has now been removed, so the next wave of wind projects have been able to go ahead with less subsidy, and  windpower is approaching commercial competitiveness, as is happening, after a period of subsidy, elsewhere in the world. 
<br>
Even so, the profit margins for bold new projects like this are tight: it is hardly a case of easy money for the developers and backers.
<br></LI><LI>
<b>Secondly, the initial projects were generally welcomed locally</B> - with some of the initial objectors changing their mind once the projects were up an running.
<br>
The UK's first windfarm was at Deli farm near Delabole in Cornwall. An independent 'before and after' study indicated that 80% of the local people asked said it made no difference to their daily life, 44% approved and 40% approved strongly. In the 'before' study, 40% of local people interviewed thought it was going to be visually intrusive, but this fell to 29% after it was set up and running. Whereas  many expected it to present noise problems beforehand, after it was running 80% felt this had turned out not to be a problem.
<br>
The windfarm had 100,000 visitors in its first year of operation.
<br>
A more recent Countryside  Council for Wales study, in areas of Wales where windfarms have been operating, indicated that 68% of the sample felt that the windfarms had little impact  and that they would be prepared to see more. 
<br>
Interestingly many more objections came from a control sample in an area where there were no windfarms.
<br></LI><LI>
<B>Thirdly, the main objections</b> have been about projects where there have been specific local problems.
<br>
The LLandinam windfarm is acceptably quiet close up,( most people are surprised at how quiet windfarms are when they first visit them) but down in the valley  resonance effects seem occasionally to amplify the noise.  Effects like this will have to be responded to carefully, and avoided in future. Similarly, as experience with windfarm deployment grows, siting policy can be improved to avoid interfering with  sensitive local views. Full local consultation, well in advance, is an obvious priority.
<br></LI><LI>
<b>Fourthly, around 70% of the 3000 or so Windturbines in Denmark are owned locally</B>- would local ownership reduce the level of opposition in the UK?  'Your own pigs don't smell' say the Danes. 
<br>
So far all the UK projects have been developed by  conventional medium to large scale companies, with some of the funding and the technology coming from overseas eg from Japan. Would a shift to 'co-ops', like the Danish Guilds, improve the situation in the UK, with the local community thereby benefiting directly from the project?
<br></LI><LI>
<b>Fifthly, the UK has the worlds best wind power resource</B>- with Scotland having more windpower available than the rest of  Europe put together. Denmark, which is mainly flat, aims to generate 10% of its electricity from wind turbines by 2005. Surely the UK which has a much better wind regime, can do at least as well?
<br></li></menu><b>
If we turn our back on this option, what are the alternatives? 
</B><br>
Energy conservation is an obvious priority, but even if we can block up the leaky bucket of current very inefficient energy use system, we will still need sustainable energy supplies to fill it. i.e. we need both conservation and renewables- including offshore wind and the other renewables. 
<br>
Its worth noting in this context that  if the UKs current target of installing 1500 Mega watts of renewable generating capacity by the year 2000 is successfully achieved, this would, according to the DTI's  1994 Energy Paper 62, avoid the emission of some 2 Million tonnes of Carbon pa, at a cost of around only one percent extra on consumers electricity bills, via the NFFO. By comparison the Energy Saving Trusts energy conservation  programme, if successful, would save around 2.5 mTCpa by 2000 and add 1-2% to consumers bills- possibly more. So renewables and conservation are fairly evenly matched in terms of the cost  of cutting emissions, with wind power playing a useful role in this process.
<br>
Finally, we are not faced with a static situation. As wind turbine technology develops, some of the initial problems should be resolved. For example, new, variable speed, machines are being developed which are more efficient, economic and less noisy.
<br>
<H3>The Wind Farm Debate</H3>

The debate over windpower has become increasingly polarised in the UK recently, with extreme positions often being taken, particularly by the objectors, who sometimes evidently feel that windprojects are being forced on them.
<br>
One unsigned leaflet circulated in Wales in 1993  warned that Wales was 'being covered in swathes of ugly turbines to line the pockets of foreigners and greedy owners'
<br>
 A little more moderately, Sir Bernard Ingham, vice president of the Country Guardian anti-wind lobby group, commented 'people who think they're attractive are aesthetically dead'. (Newsweek 28 March,1994)
Clearly everyone is entitled to their opinion.: after all, in the end it is often a subjective issue.
<br> 
For example, some people are very sensitive to low level noise- and can't sleep with a fridge running. Some are  very sensitive to changes in the landscape- even though of course the current UK landscape is mostly man made, the result of centuries of modifications due to agriculture, land clearance and so on. 
<br>
Some find windfarms very appealing- as witness the large number of tourists visiting them. Some local people have actually objected to not  being able to see them.
<br>
Some see them  ugly monstrosities, as 'lavatory brushes in the sky', while other see than as symbols of a sustainable future, and as a clear alternative to nuclear power. 
<br>
Given the wide range of responses to the windfarm issue, it is understandable that the debate can become a little shrill. 
<br>
However, what is needed is a constructive debate on the role of renewables generally, and on exactly what the carrying capacity of a country like the UK is as far as windturbines are concerned. Is the 20%  theoretical resource too much to hope for? Will it be cut down in practice to 10% or even less? What about offshore wind? And the other renewables? What would be their impacts? For example, would short rotation arable coppicing be a better bet, more suited than wind farms to farming communities, as some suggest? Or, if carried out on a large scale, wouldn't that be to  return to a ' slash and burn' approach, with  its own set of environmental dangers? Aren't there likely to be just as many objections to extensive coppice plantations,  wood chip incineration plants, and significantly increased local truck traffic?   
<p>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>

All technologies have impacts. In general, however, the impacts of the renewables are much smaller and more local than the usually large and global impacts of conventional energy technologies. Some of the renewables seem likely to have minimal local impacts- as well as offering large energy potentials- offshore wind for example, as well as offshore wave and tidal stream turbines. Unfortunately however, these are all currently seen as expensive options- and have been more or less abandoned in the UK, following the policy outlined in the  DTI's  Energy Paper 62. Many of the other renewable energy technologies, although currently more economic, have land use implications- most obviously in the case of windfarms, but also in the case of energy crops and arable coppicing.
<br>
Even given a properly integrated national policy on renewable development, we would still probably have to strike a balance between these various options, and, therefore, to get to grips with land use issue.
<br> 
Hopefully, however, the smaller scale and more local nature of most renewable energy technologies should make this process easier. For unlike conventional power stations, whose  often large scale, global, social and environmental costs and risks are often hidden away, the  impact of renewables like windfarms is more obvious and local. Basically, the technologies are easier to understand and assess. What you see is what you get: there are no hidden costs. 
<p>
Given that the nature and function of the technology is more transparent, it ought to be possible to have a constructive debate, involving a wide range of people, over how, where, on what scale and by whom renewable energy systems like windfarms should be developed.
<p>
NATTA produces a bi-monthly journal, Renew, which, amongst other things, covers the windfarm debate. Recent coverage of the debate is brought together in 'Windpower in the UK', Vols 1 & 2, ( 1993 & 1995; 2 pounds each), culled from the pages of RENEW.

<H2>Water Power</H2>                     

Of all the elements, water can produce the most dramatic effects on the environment- whether it's floods, rainstorms, or tidal waves. There is obviously a lot of power there. Where does it come from?
<h3>Solar Power</h3>
Most of it comes, one way or another, from the sun. The suns heat evaporates off moisture to form clouds, then rain falls, some of it ending up in rivers and streams. And we can use this hydrological cycle -by damning up rivers and streams to produce useful heads of water. That's the basis of hydroelectric power- the mass of water trapped behind a huge damn is passed through a turbine, generating electricity. Its cheap and clean, and the energy source will last for ever-its renewable. And it can be used on a small scale as well as on the more familiar large scale.
<p>
Currently about 20% of the worlds electricity is generated by hydro plants-so in reality renewable energy has already arrived.
<br>
But there is another way in which solar energy can provide us with power via water- wave power. Waves are created by the action of wind over water, the winds in turn being the result of the differential heating of different parts of the land and sea by the sun. In fact waves are really a form of stored wind power.
<br>
We can harness the power of the waves by absorbing the energy in giant floating devices- like the nodding duck developed by Stephen Salter at the University of Edinburgh, or the squeezed airbag 'Clam' system  developed at Coventry University. 
<br>
The potential is vast- perhaps 20% of the UK's electricity could be generated in this way, maybe more. The UK initially pioneered wave energy, but Norway and Japan took over the lead following a  disputed decision by the UK Government to wind up the UK wave Research Programme. Some smaller inshore and coastal units have been developed, but for the moment the large scale development of wavepower is stalled..
<p>
<H3>Lunar Power</H3>
The other main way in which water can be used to provide power is by the use of the tides. Tidal energy shouldn't be confused with wave power: the energy comes from the gravitational pull of the moon which attracts masses of water to create tidal rises and falls., as the earth rotate, modified by the pull of the sun and the shape of the landmass. 
<br>
Again the potential is huge- perhaps 20% of the UKs electricity requirements, with the Severn Estuary being one of the worlds best sites. Of course, given that we are talking about large civil engineering structures across estuaries there will be some local environmental impacts. But the Tidal Barrage on the Rance estuary in Brittany has been operating for  more than twenty years with few problems.....
<p>
Taken together the UKs water power resources-hydro, large and small;wave , deep sea and inshore; and tidal power, could ultimately provide  a large proportion of the power we need-and on an indefinitely sustainable basis. Obviously there will  and should be debates about the environmental trade offs that might have to be made eg in the case of tidal barrages and large hydro plants, but  many of our water power sources can be developed on a smaller scale basis. There are already many dozens of new micro-hydro schemes in operation or under construction and  there are scores of potential sites for smaller scale tidal barrages.
<br>
At present the economics tends to favour larger schemes, but when and if we begin to take the environmental  costs of existing  forms of power generation into account, it seems likely that most types and scales of water power, will increasingly be seen as viable.

<A NAME="solar"></A>
<H2>Solar Power in the UK</H2>

The sun provides the basis for life on earth and delivers sufficient energy to each 
square foot to meet all our needs -if we could tap that energy efficiently. Historically 
 human beings have tried to do that via agriculture, using wood as a fuel and by 
using the indirect solar energy represented by winds  and streams More recently we've 
used the stored solar energy of fossil fuels-coal, oil and gas. But it may be that 
we can make use of the sun more directly.<BR>
<BR>
Around the world recent years have seen large scale experiments with solar power- 
for example via giant solar heat concentrating mirrors and dishes, tracking the sun 
across the sky and focusing its rays so as to raise stream for electricity generation. 
 Large scale 'Solar Thermal 'plants like this  are becoming increasingly popular in  
desert areas of the USA. and elsewhere.<BR>
<BR>
 But solar energy  can also be utilised on a smaller scale - and even in cooler climates 
like the UK.<BR>
<BR>
<h3>Solar Britain</h3>

At first glance you would not think that solar power stood much of a chance in the 
UK, what with our short summers and cloudy days.  But the UK receives on average 
 over the year around  half the amount of energy from the sun per square foot as 
countries on the equator, and  that heat is likely to be of more use here than in hot countries. 
<BR>
<BR>
During the 1970's there was something of a boom in sales of roof mounted solar collectors 
in the UK That was hardly surprising, since flat plate solar heat collectors, looking 
something like a radiator, plugged into  a hot water system, could typically cut domestic fuel bills by a half.  But  it soon became apparent that the overall economics 
were not that attractive-commercial systems had payback times of five to ten years 
or more, and there were also some cowboys operating in the field who undermined consumers confidence.  The boom consequently faded, although  many enthusiasts continued 
with diy units. <BR>
<BR>
The 1980's saw something of a renewal of interest, following the oil price shocks. 
Local councils made much of the running- with rehab  council houses being retrofitted 
with solar assisted heating and several new  solar council house projects  were initiated.  By the end of the Greater London Council's reign in London for example there 
were  more than 200 solar houses in use, and, meanwhile, Milton Keynes Development 
Corporation was turning the new city of Milton Keynes into a solar showplace, with 
more than 300 solar housing projects.<BR>
<BR>
However, the emphasis had  gradually shifted  away from flat plate solar collectors 
on individual houses.  One of the last of the Greater London  Council supported schemes 
was a grouped heating scheme, with an array of solar collectors feeding a common 
hot water store, shared by 15 separate dwellings.  This system averaged out variation 
in use rates for each house and improved the overall economics. <BR>
<BR>
More fundamentally, there was a switch to the even more cost effective  passive solar concept.  Conventional Roof top solar collectors need small pumps to drive the heated 
water around the heat circuit, but you can also collect useful amounts of heat, if 
you have large south facing glazed areas.  Its much like the greenhouse concept- and 
involves no moving parts.  Hence the term 'passive' as opposed to  conventional 
'active' solar collectors, with pumps.<BR>
<BR>
Typically, with a well insulated house, you can cut overall fuel bills annually by 
a third in this way.  Milton Keynes has two hundred or so passive solar council houses, 
and passive solar design has now become almost a byword in modern architectural practice.  Large scale solar atriums for office and commercial buildings are now a familiar 
sight, and, at the more lowly level, many people have added solar heat trapping conservatories 
to their homes.<BR>
<BR>
<h3>Slowly Does It.</h3>

So slowly solar power is becoming a reality in the UK.  It has been a slow process 
in the main because solar power has had to compete unaided against often heavily 
subsidised conventional fuels-like electricity and gas.  Only the more environmentally 
conscious homeowners have opted for solar out of commitment to a sustainable future.  But 
the balance is slowly tipping, and new techniques and technologies are emerging which 
could well bring about more radical changes. <BR>
<BR>
Already there are more efficient, although more expensive, evacuated tube solar collectors, 
as well as various clever new selective absorption systems to improve heat collection 
<BR>
<BR>
But the big breakthrough is likely to be in the photo voltaic solar field.  Photo 
cells, like those on cameras and  pocket calculators, convert sunlight directly into electricity.  The only problem is that they are expensive.  They were initially used 
mainly for powering space satellites, but developments in the semiconductor field have 
gradually brought prices down. Within a decade or so they are likely to be competitive 
with conventional power sources.<BR>
<BR>
In which case we are likely to see photo voltaic ('pv') cells being used widely- even 
for domestic supplies.  They are already in use in some outlying rural areas where 
there is no grid electricity and the alternative is diesel, or nothing, in the Australian outback, in dessert areas and in African villages, for water pumping, running fridges 
for key medical supplies, or powering remote telecommunications equipment. <BR>
<BR>
Soon we may see much wider scale use.  New types of cell  materials have been developed 
which are more efficient and cheaper and some can be mounted on flexible backings, 
so it may even be possible to buy electricity generating sheets to hang up wherever 
you want. <BR>
<BR>
<h3>Ten Wasted Years?</h3>
<BR>
Even if you discount this sort of development, one way or another the potential of 
solar energy  would seem to be considerable.  But, as we've seen, it has been a long 
time coming. at least in the UK. The UK Government  has until recently been pretty 
dismissive of its potential.  Photo voltaics have been seen as pretty much irrelevant to 
the UK and in 1982 the Government decided to abandon further support for active solar 
projects.  Only passive solar continued to receive support, while a few UK companies, 
like BP, continued to push ahead  with pv for the export market.<BR>
<BR>
However recently there has been something of a U -turn, following a report which concluded 
that there might soon  be a very significant market for pv.  Certainly the USA, Japan 
and more recently Germany, have been putting billions into  pv in recent years.. <BR>
<BR>
<h3>Environmental Impacts</h3>

One of the reasons why at least some people have not seen solar as a viable option 
for the UK is that it has been seen as a very land hungry technology.  There has 
been talk of having to cover the whole of the UK with solar cells in order to generate 
any significant power.  The reality is very different   For example, the potential for 
using roof tops and walls for solar cells is very large: and pv cells can be used 
as cladding material, thus reducing some building costs and offsetting the cost of 
the cells.  There is already a house (in Oxford) equipped in this way and an office building 
at the University of Northumbria in Newcastle upon Tyne.<BR>
<BR>
Prof Bob Hill at the University of Northumbria has been carrying out aerial photography 
to identify suitable south facing surfaces around the UK and in London, and  he has 
pointed out that a similar study done in Berlin estimated that the city could generate 2.5 GW of pv power - equivalent to two nuclear power plants. London is likely to 
have a similar potential, while the  potential for the UK as a whole, if fully developed, 
might be greater than the total UK electricity requirement.<BR>
<BR>
Of course that still begs the question of the economics.  But environmentally, there 
would seem to be few problems, at least in terms of the uses of pv.  There are however 
some question marks associated with the manufacture  of pv cells.  This is very much 
a high tech industry using exotic and often hazardous chemicals-potentially representing 
a significant health and safety problem for workers.  There could also be ex-plant 
pollution issues to contend with. But assuming these potential problems can be avoided, pv could become the breakthrough technology of the next decade.<BR>
<BR>
<h3>What next?</h3>

The photoelectric effect, on which pv cells are based, was first explained by none 
other than Albert Einstein, at about the same time as he developed his famous E=MC 
2 equation, which lay the basis for nuclear energy.  At one time, it was felt that 
solar cells were going to be a much more likely contender as power generators than nuclear 
energy.  But then came the wartime Manhattan atom bomb project and one way or another, 
solar cell research lost out.  It has only been in recent decades that interest has 
returned.<BR>
<BR>
For the enthusiasts, the future could be one in which not only is pv used widely in 
the north, but third world countries in the sunny south use electricity from vast 
solar cell arrays in desert areas to generate hydrogen  gas by splitting water into 
its constituent part via electrolysis.  The desert nations, many of them currently locked 
into oil production, could then become a major exporter of a new form of  less damaging 
energy to the cold north.<BR>
<BR>
Certainly there is growing interest in the use of hydrogen as a fuel to replace petrol, 
and in photo voltaics as a power source for producing the hydrogen -pvh is the buzzword. 
 The attractions are clear:  hydrogen can be burnt with no byproduts other than water, it can be used in a fuel cell to generate electricity, again very cleanly, 
and you can store hydrogen easily, and thereby avoid one of the key problems with 
all form of solar energy- its  intermittancy. <BR>
<BR>
Solar hydrogen, and hydrogen generated from indirect solar sources, like the winds 
and waves, could be piped down the gas main for domestic use, perhaps mixed in with 
our progressively diminishing north sea gas reserves.  It could become the  heating 
fuel of the future.  And used directly as a fuel, or with fuel cells in electric cars, 
it could help us deal with the pollution problems of petrol engines.<BR>
<BR>
If these sorts of projects, and others like them, get off the ground, we could be 
moving towards a future in which the sun plays a major role in helping us live once 
again in a sustainable way.

<A NAME="encrops"></A>
<h2>Energy Crops</h2>
Growing fuel rather than food could well become a significant new option for farmers - especially given the European Union's land set aside policy.  Liquid biofuels (biodiesel) are already being produced in some parts of the EU from oil seed rape.  Solid fuels from `woody biomass' are another option.
Short rotation arable coppicing, e.g. using fast growing willows or poplar is currently seen as likely to be an important source of fuel for electricity generation in the UK - indeed the UK Governments Department of Trade and Industry estimated (in Energy Paper 62) that the maximum total realistic UK resource potential by 2025 could be up to 150TWh/yr - half current UK electricity requirements.
<p>
At first sight increased afforestation would seem a very attractive proposition - trees are beautiful and we need more to help combat global warming.  But large scale short rotation arable coppicing does not involve full tree development - instead the thin willowy growths, reaching perhaps 15 feet, are cut back to stumps every 3-5 years.  That may not prove to be so visually attractive.
<p>
Large areas could also be involved with mechanised cutters passing periodically along corridors through the coppice plantations.  The resultant wood chips would also have to be   transported periodically to combustion plants - with traffic, and its associated pollution, in rural areas therefore perhaps increasing.  And combustion itself can involve pollution.
<p>
Overall then, as with all technologies, even renewable energy based technologies, there  are environmental trade offs.
<p>
<H3>The Case for Coppicing</H3>
Existing forms of power generation are very environmentally damaging.
Burning coal, oil and gas inevitably produces carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas, as well as other pollutants, including acid rain related gasses.
Nuclear power generation inevitably involves the generation of highly dangerous and very long lived nuclear wastes, and there is the risk of major accidents.
<p>
By contrast, growing and burning energy crops is greenhouse gas neutral, as long as the regrowth rate balances the use rate so that as much carbon dioxide is absorbed as is produced by combustion.  Regularly coppiced plantations will actually absorb more carbon dioxide than mature trees - since carbon dioxide absorption slows once a tree nears maturity.
<br>
All the existing fuels will eventually run out, whereas wood is renewable - it can always be available.
<p>
The UK's reserves of north sea oil and gas are limited, and even our coal reserves will not last for ever.  Used in the current types of nuclear reactors, the worlds uranium reserves will only last around 60 years.  Perhaps more importantly the cost of using these fuels will increase as stricter environmental control are applied.
<br>
By contrast arable coppicing represents a very large new energy resource - which can be sustainably harvested, at reasonable cost, and costs should drop as more experience is gained.
<br>
In summary energy crops are sustainable, environmentally sound, and represent a huge new energy source.
<br>
<h3>The Case Against Coppicing</h3>

The local impacts may be significant - depending on the scale.
<menu><li><b>The coppice plantations  may not be very visually appealing.</b><br>
It is envisaged that large parts of the set aside land - representing 15% of UK arable land - might be used, and that could change the character of the UK landscape.  Fertilizer and Pesticide run off could also be a problem. As could the risk of fire.</li><li>
<b>Wood chips are a bulky fuel</b> and there could also be local environment impacts from the extra truck traffic (and its pollution).
</li><li><b>Combustion is environmentally undesirable.</b><br>
Burning wood produces toxic pollutants - including, possibly, dioxins from chemical residues from herbicides and pesticides.
</li><li><b>Focusing on single crops can undermine biodiversity.</b><br>
Monoculture plantations are aesthetically unappealing (as with the vast existing conifer plantations).  Being less ecologically diverse than, for example, natural forests, they tend to be at risk of disease and pests, so herbicides and pesticides may have to be used to compensate.
</li><li>
<B>Farming should be for food - not energy</B>.<br>
With much of the world starving, it is immoral to switch to a new energy cash-crop in order to fuel our wasteful energy habits.  Energy conservation would be a better bet - and is a cheaper option.  So far coppicing seems unlikely to be economic without subsidy although equally it could become a vast new extension of agri-business.</li></menu>
<br>  
In summary, there are environmental, social and economic question marks.
<br>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
With the foregoing in mind, it seems useful to make the following points:
Only a few experimental projects exist at present - and rapid expansion would take some time.
<br>
Coppicing would initially have to be subsidised from the EU's set aside scheme, the woodland development grant scheme and via the NFFO `fossil fuel levy' ( as is likely to happen under the third NFFO order from Nov 1994 onwards) and it could take some years to become established on a wide scale. 
<br>
So there is time to discuss the pro's and con's.
<menu>
<li>Arable coppicing is one of several renewable options with land use implications:  wind farms are another example.
<br>Each of the renewables have their advantages and disadvantages.  For example, some might argue that coppicing is more suited to the UK landscape than wind farms, although the best sites for coppicing are usually not the best sites for windturbines and vica versa. Others might feel that what is to some extent a `slash and burn'  energy cropping approach is a backward step, although global hunger is a problem of distribution and local politics. We already produce enough food to feed the world.  
</li><li>
Even so, we need to decide on the right balance between the various renewable options and energy conservation.
</li><li>
In technical terms, energy coppicing can be very efficient.
<br>The energy ratio (i.e. available energy output in the crop divided by the energy input requirement, for growing, harvesting and transport) has been put at between 10 and 100.  And the combustion process can be very efficient, especially given the development of advanced co-generation/CHP techniques. For example with  gassified biomass used to power steam injected turbines (the so called BIG-STIG technology), operated in the combined heat and power mode, conversion efficiencies of up to 80% can be obtained.
</li><li>
The environmental impacts can be limited - and some can be positive.
<br>
Herbicides would only be used in the first year of the cycle. Less pesticides would be needed than for conventional arable crops and coppices tend to mop up pollutants, thus reducing 'run off' into water courses.  Coppices would be located mainly on marginal land, and can offer habitats eg for birds and insects, especially given the open access corridors that would traverse the plantations.  Bio-diversity can also be ensured by using multi-cloned plants or by mixing species: coppices have already been shown to attract woodland animal species.
Overall, if degraded or abandoned cropland were used, the environmental and wildlife impact would be positive.
</li><li>
The Transport Impact will be low
<br>
Wood chips would be stored on site and probably be transported annually for combustion. For say a 10 hectare coppice plantation, with 5 hectares harvested annually, only 75 tonnes of wood chip would need transporting annually. This would involve 4X20 tonne loads or 8X10 tonnes loads - not a huge annual volume. And it would replace the transport of  the  crops that might have been grown otherwise.

</li><li>Conversion into electricity could be done locally.
<br>
The combustion plants could be on local industrial estates. A 10 MWe unit run continuously at 80% efficiency would require around 60 tonnes of wood chip per day i.e. 3X20 tonne lorry loads per day. It would be unlikely for wood chips to be transported more than 20 miles. And there are prospects for  power generation on the farm site itself, thus eliminating transport requirements almost entirely. Either way, local employment would be boosted.
Initial studies indicate broad support.
</li></menu>
A study of the attitudes of country users for ETSU in 1993 indicated that although there were some reservations, in general, there was support for coppicing, as long as the scale was not too great.  Some concern was however expressed at leaving its development up to commercial pressures and interests.
<br>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
On balance arable coppicing seems to offer significant advantages. However, there are clearly some unknowns:  what exactly are the environmental and pollution implications, how economic will it be, how will it be planned, what scale is appropriate?  Is it just an extension of conventional farming or something new?
<br>
Currently, no change of use application need to be sought for switching set aside or arable land to coppicing.  At the very least, some form of planning control would seem necessary to avoid land use conflicts and visual disruption.  Existing planning rules and emission standards would presumably cover the processing and combustion plants:  but an integrated planning approach to the whole system seems called for, with full local consultation and detailed guidelines, as have been developed in the USA and elsewhere.
More generally, there would seem a need for a debate over renewable energy development generally.  At present the pattern of development has been left primarily to short term market forces to define - with the emphasis being on waste combustion and wind farms, arable coppicing being the next major commercial contender.  All have environmental impacts - even if they are much smaller than the global impacts of conventional energy systems.  They may have a place in a sustainable energy system, but the correct balance is as yet unclear.  As is the fate of some of the larger-scale renewables, most of which, although currently seen as more expensive, have very low environmental impacts - e.g. off-shore wind and deep-sea wave.  At present these are receiving no support in the UK.  This could be short-sighted, given that environmental concerns e.g. over global warming, may grow.
The debate over coppicing should therefore not be carried out in isolation from the broader debate over our energy future.
<br>
<h4>The debate on coppicing.</h4>
Large scale coppicing is a new concept which the Government clearly favours.
The National Farmers Union is also strongly in favour of coppicing - sensing a new opportunity for its members. Clearly employment is a key issue.
The environmental and strategic debate has, however, only just started.

<H1> Specific features of the design of the RMBK-1000 reactor </H1>
<HR>
The unit  4 reactor  of the  Chernobyl NPP is 
of the RMBK-1000 type, with thermal power 3200  MW 
and  electric  power  1000  MW.   It  was put into 
operation in  December 1983  <A HREF = "sources.html">[1, 2-15]</A>.   Graphite
moderator  was  placed  between  vertical channels 
with fuel  and light-water  boiling coolant.  This 
scheme  has  the  advantage  that  it  requires no 
large body of  high  pressure,   as  in  PWR or BWR
 reactors,  and  the  graphite  moderator allows to 
use   the   fuel   with   low   enrichment    with 
uranium-235. Corresponding control and  protection 
systems  in  such  scheme  can  provide acceptable 
security.  However,  according  to  opinion  of  a
 group  of  international  experts,  the  systems  of 
control  and  protection  which  existed  at   the 
Chernobyl NPP did  not conform to  modern security 
requirements  <A HREF = "sources.html15">[15]</A>.   In  a  RMBK-1000 reactor the
coolant  is   circulated  in   the  contour  under 
pressure,  and  the  generated  steam  is directly 
applied to the generator turbine.

Uranium 
dioxide  enriched  with  2%  of  uranium-235 is in 
zirconium  cylindrical  fuel   elements  joined   in 
bundles 18 pieces (fuel assemblies) placed in  the 
channels.  There  were  1659  fuel assemblies with 
about 114.7 kg of uranium in each assembly in  the 
cylindrical core with the  radius of 6 m  and height 
of 7 m at the  moment of the accident.   The total 
mass of uranium in the  core was 190.2 ton. It  is 
important to note  that the reactor  design allows 
local  fuel  replacement,  when  a  reactor  is in 
operation,  and  there  were  fuel assemblies with 
very different levels  of burn-up to  20 NW*day/kg 
of uranium  at the  moment of  the accident.   The 
reactor   core   is   surrounded   by   biological 
shield in the form of cylindrical coaxial tank  with 
water  16.6   m  in   diameter,  which    remained 
practically undamaged after  the explosion at  the 
Chernobyl NPP . The tank of biological shield  and 
the core are closed tight from above and below  by 
cylindrical   "covers"   filled   with  seprentinit, 
through which  multiple communication  pipes pass. 
During the  explosion these  parts of  the reactor 
were displaced, and the formed passages served  as 
the ways for  egress of the  contents of the  core 
out.  The system of control and protection of  the 
reactor   is   based   in   displacement   of  211 
rods-absorbers  in  special  channels  of the core 
and is  to provide  automatic maintain  of a given 
power  level,  rapid  decrease  of  the  power  in 
response  to  signals  of  main equipment failure, 
accidental  termination  of  reactor  operation in 
response  to  dangerous  deviations of parameters. 
The   systems   of   localization  of  radioactive 
releases   is   intended   for   condensation  and 
collection of radioactive  water in closed  spaces 
under the reactor and is not meant for  break-down 
of  the  core  and  for  release  of  considerable 
amount of radioactive materials out of it.

<h1>Fossil Fuel: Oil</h1><p>
<p>
Each day, the United States produces about 9 million barrels of oil (7.2
million barrels of crude oil plus 1.7 million barrels of natural gas 
liquids),
while importing almost 8 million barrels.  Much of the easiest oil to 
produce
has already been extracted from existing fields, and improved 
technologies will
be required to recover and refine the generally lower quality remaining
resource.  <p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Oil is a liquid fossil fuel produced in 31 states and the federal outer
continental shelf from onshore (82%) and offshore (18%) wells.<p>
In 1992, the United States produced 8.9 million barrels of oil per day 
(BOPD),
including natural gas liquids; 1.0 million BOPD were exported, mostly to
Mexico, Japan, and the Virgin Islands. <p>

In 1992, the United States imported 7.9 million BOPD; the largest 
suppliers
were Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Canada, Mexico, and Nigeria. 1992 net 
imports of
6.9 million BOPD accounted for 41% of petroleum products supplied and
about 60% of the U.S. trade deficit.<p>

Known domestic in-the-ground oil resources are 350 billion barrels, a 
portion
of which can be recovered with advanced technologies. The cumulative 
total of
past domestic oil production to date is 160 billion barrels.<p>

At year-end 1992, proven domestic oil reserves were 25 billion 
barrels.<p>
There are an estimated 49 billion barrels of undiscovered recoverable oil 
in
the United States.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
The entire automotive and petroleum industries are built around gasoline 
and
there is extensive infrastructure already in place.<p>

Gasoline, diesel fuel, and other petroleum products are convenient,
concentrated energy sources for transportation.<p>

Extensive domestic supplies remain to be recovered or developed with 
proper
technology and higher prices.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2>
In 1992, the U.S. share of world petroleum consumption was 26%.<p>
In 1992, oil provided 26% (17.5 quadrillion Btu) of domestic energy 
production
and 41% of energy consumption (33.5 quadrillion Btu).<p>

The principal uses of oil are in the transportation (64% in 1992), and
industrial sectors (26%).<p>

The principal products made from oil are gasoline (42%), distillate fuel 
oil
(17%--for space heating, diesel engines, electrical generation), and jet 
fuel
(9%).<p>

The 1992 average crude-oil refiner cost was $18.43 per barrel.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use and Cost</h2>
Domestic crude oil production is projected to decrease from 7.4 million 
BOPD in
1990 to 4.8 million BOPD in 2006 with relatively low prices, then to 5.1
million BOPD in 2010 with rising prices and improved technology.<p>

Consumption is projected to increase from 17.0 million BOPD in 1990 to
21.3 million BOPD in 2010.<p>

Net imports are projected to increase from 6.7 million BOPD in 1990 to
12.8 million BOPD in 2010--increasing from 39% to 60% of domestic
consumption.<p>

World oil prices are projected to increase from $18.20 in 1992 to $28.16 
in
2010 (1992 $).<p>
Issues<p>

Increasing imports of oil create trade deficit problems and 
foreign-supply
dependency.<p>

Use of petroleum products is the largest contributor--by fuel source--of
greenhouse gases (44% of man-made carbon emissions).<p>

<h2>Opportunities and Challenges</h2>
Because much of the easiest oil to produce has already been extracted 
from
existing fields, oil remaining in those fields--some 60% to 80% of known 
U.S.
resources--could be abandoned by 2010 unless new technology becomes
available.<p>

Both domestic and imported oil is becoming heavier and higher in sulfur,
requiring improved refining technologies.<p>
<p>
<h2>New Technologies</h2>
Computerized three-dimensional seismic surveying and reservoir modeling 
can
identify significant additional resources.<p>

Improved "secondary" water flooding plus "tertiary" recovery techniques
increase yield from existing reservoirs.<p>

As a promising end use, a forthcoming Mercedes gets 75 miles per gallon 
(mpg)
of diesel while meeting California low-emission vehicle standards; a 
currently
available Audi gets more than 60 mpg of gasoline.<p>

Advanced processing technologies reduce pollution from processing.<p>

<H2> Dear Colleagues. </H2>
<P>
We are glad to present a hypertext data base describing an accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. As a platform of this data base  a recent official version of events published in 1992<A HREF = "/polyn/sources.html#20">[20]</A>, has been used as well as materials of Chernobyl Kurchatov Institute Expedition and a number of publications in scientific press and mass media.
<P>
<I>"POLYN"</I> is a Russian word and means <I>"Chernobyl'"</I>. After an accident all works in a 30-km zone were named after this word, so we keep it as a name of our data base.
<P>
This data base is not an official publication but an initiative work of our group. If "Polyn" is useful for anybody , it will be pleasure for us. Any ideas, remarks and corrections are welcome.

     The plan of putting into operation the power generating capacities on the
nuclear power plants (NPPs) of the USSR of 11.9 million KW within 1966-1977, including NPPs with the reactors of the new type namely RBMK-1000 of 8 million KW was confirmed by the resolution of the Council of Ministers of the USSR on 29.09.66. The Leningrad NPP became the head nuclear power plant with these reactors.
<P>
     In line with mentioned plan the deficit problem of electrical energy in the Central energy consumption region of the United Energy System (UES) of the south being the largest among UES of the European part of the country by both volume of electrical energy consumption and sizes of installed capacity could be solved by the help of one of the nuclear power plants. UES of the South has covered the area of 27 administrative districts  of Ukrainian SSR as well as of Rostov district with 0.7 million square km and with population up to 53 million people.
In the European part of the country about 26% total installed capacity and 25% total electricity consumption was fallen to UES share.
<P>
     Electricity consumption was to be increased by approximately 3.5 times in this region from 1970 to 1990 to assessments of the Ukraine department of "Ehnergoset'proekt" Institute of Minehnergo (Ministry of Energy) of USSR made in 1974.

     The location of the new NPP in Ukraine's Central districts would be economically attractive when it was considered that the rational radius of NPP influence formed 350-450 km.
<P>
     This NPP originally named as Central-Ukrainian was to be consisted of two generating units 
by 1000 MW each.
<P>
     Place selection for construction of Central-Ukrainian NPP was performed by Kiev department
of "Teploehnergoproekt" Institute of Minehnergo of USSR and Kiev design bureau "Ehnergoset'proekt".
<P>
Two construction places were proposed:
<UL>
<LI> Ladyzhiny (Vinnitskij district);
<LI> Kopachi (Kievskij district).
</UL>
The board of Gosplan of Ukr.SSR specifies the NPP location near Kopachi and named it as Chernobyl by resolution on 18.01.67.
<P>
Resolution of the central Committee of USSR Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of USSR
by 02.02.67 stated the resolution of UkrSSR Gosplan. In this case the following aspects were taken into account:
<UL>
<LI> Low density of population within the NPP location.
<LI> Availability of the significant water supply source (Pripyat` river).
<LI> Low productivity of alienable lands.
<LI> Proximity of the main line (station Yanov of the South-West railway).
<LI> Developed network of automobile roads with solid coating.
<LI> Favourable geographic, climatic and etc. conditions allowing the fast employment of personnel.
</UL>
<P>
The industrial site of Chernobyl NPP is located in the eastern part of the region named Belorussko-Ukrainskoe Poles'e, 160 km to the north-east of Kiev, 15 km to the north-west of Chernobyl (Kiev district).

     During the process of the accident the nuclear fuel from  the 
destroyed reactor was subjected to high temperature and mechanical 
failure. Heating up to the temperatures  of  about  <B>2000 C</B>  caused 
complete or partial evaporation of volatile radioactive elements 
from the fuel.  A  part  of  the  fuel  was  released  during  the 
explosion  in  the  form   of   fine-dispersed   component   which 
distributed in the atmosphere. Subsequent fires and  natural  fuel 
heating by radioactive decay caused  that  hot  air  continued  to 
carry out  of  the  reactor  the  products  of  graphite  burning, 
radioactive gases, aerosols, and  fine-dispersed  fuel  dust  with 
dimensions of particles from parts of a micron to  tens  and  even 
hundreds micron. 
<P> 
     Thus,  radioactive  releases  from  the   destroyed   reactor 
consisted of at least two different components: 
<UL> 
<LI> radioactive  nuclides  included  into  the  matrix  of  the 
dispersed fuel and released in the form of radioactive dust, 
<LI> separate volatile radioactive substances  in  the  form  of 
gases or aerosols, which evaporated from the hot fuel. 
</UL> 
The detail description of different radioactive release characteristics is divided 
on the following parts: 
<UL> 
<LI><A HREF = "rnucrel1.html">General characteristics and evaluation of radioactive release</A>. 
<LI><A HREF = "nucrel2.html">New data on radioactive release</A>. 
</UL> 
<P> 
According to estimations, during the accident: 
<UL> 
<LI>inert gases came out of the destroyed reactor completely <A HREF = "sources.html">[1.2]</A>; 
<LI>iodine-131 release was 50-60%, which is 40-60 MCi (on the average, 45 MCi) as of 26 April 1986, 
<A HREF = "sources.html#3"</A>[3, 4, 5, 16, 17]</A>; 
<LI>cesium release was (33 +/- 0.7)MCi; 
<LI>strontium release was about 4%, or 0.2 MCi <A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A>; 
<LI>fuel release outside the plant area was (3.5 +/- 0.5)% <A HREF = "sources.html">[1, 4, 5]</A>. 
</UL> 
<P> 
Besides, some general remarks can be made: 
<UL> 
<LI>In the modelling of radionuclide transport at the Chernobyl accident one should differ the fuel and volatile components, and the transport of relatively refractory fuel component can be described by local and mesoscale models, whereas volatile (cesium and iodine) component require attraction of global transport models; 
<LI>the considerable release of radionuclides could continue even after 5 May 1986.

<h1>General Energy Facts</h1>
<p>
<h2>Worldwide </h2>
World energy consumption is expected to increase 40% to 50% by the year 
2010,
and the global mix of fuels--renewables (18%), nuclear (4%), and fossil
(78%)--is projected to remain substantially the same as today; thus 
global
carbon dioxide emissions would also increase 50% to 60%.<p>

Among industrialized and developing countries, Canada consumes per capita 
the
most energy in the world, and Italy consumes the least among 
industrialized
countries.<p>

Developing countries use 30% of global energy.  Rapid population growth,
combined with economic growth, will rapidly increase that percentage in 
the
next 10 years.<p>

The World Bank estimates that investments of $1 trillion will be needed 
in this
decade and upwards of $4 trillion during the next 30 years to meet 
developing
countries' electricity needs alone.<p>

Traditional biomass fuels, such as wood, crop residues, and animal dung, 
remain
the primary energy source for more than 2 billion people.<p>
<p>
<h2>United States</h2>
In 1991, Americans spent about $1,975 per person on all energy purchases.  
This
represents about 7.7% of the U.S. gross domestic product.  For 
comparison, in
1991 Americans spent about $2,280 per capita for housing and about $2,565 
for
medical needs.<p>

Per capita, the United States ranks second in worldwide energy 
consumption
among the industrialized nations.<p>

America uses about 15 times more energy per person than does the typical
developing country.<p>

The United States spends about $440 billion annually for energy.  Energy 
costs
U.S. consumers $200 billion and U.S. manufacturers $100 billion 
annually.<p>
The U.S. industrial sector consumed 39% of the nation's energy in 
1990.<p>
In 1990, commercial buildings accounted for nearly 11% of U.S. total 
energy
consumption.<p>

Residential appliances, including heating and cooling equipment and water

heaters, consume 90% of all energy used in the U.S. residential 
sector.<p>
Today, 36% of U.S. energy is consumed in electricity generation.  By 
2010, that
will rise to 41%.<p>

The transportation sector consumed 35% of the nation's energy in 1990; 
this
sector is 97% dependent on petroleum.<p>
<p>
<h2>Fossil Fuel Use</h2>
The United States consumes about 17 million barrels of oil per day, of 
which
nearly two-thirds is used for transportation.  Oil provides more than 40% 
of
the nation's primary energy (energy in its naturally occurring form 
before
conversion to end-use forms).<p>

The United States imports more than seven million barrels of oil per 
day.<p>
Fossil fuels are depleted at a rate that is 100,000 times faster than 
they are
formed.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
A decrease of only 1% in industrial energy use would save the equivalent 
of
about 55 million barrels of oil per year, worth about $1 billion.<p>
Within 15 years, renewable energy could be generating enough electricity 
to
power 40 million homes and offset 70 days of oil imports.<p>

Natural gas supplies the equivalent of 35 million barrels of oil each 
day, and
its use is growing more rapidly than that of any other major source.<p>
<p>
<h2>New Technologies and Initiatives</h2>
The high initial cost of active solar systems--ranging from $2,000 for 
small
water-heating systems to more than $8,000 for residential space-heating
systems--is the main reason for low sales in the United States.  Cooling
systems cost $10,000 to $20,000 for typical homes.<p>

Wind power has the potential to supply a large fraction--probably at 
least
20%--of U.S. electricity demand at an economical price.<p>

Providing power for villages in developing countries is a fast-growing 
market
for photovoltaics. The United Nations estimates that more than 2 million
villages worldwide are without electric power for water supply, 
refrigeration,
lighting, and other basic needs, and the cost of extending the utility 
grids is
prohibitive, $23,000 to $46,000 per kilometer in 1988.<p>

<title>Gloabal Climate Change</title>
<html><head><!-- This document was created from RTF source by rtftohtml 
version
2.7.3 --></head><body>
<h1>Global Climate Change</h1><p>
<p>
Climate change refers to the trends that persist for decades or even 
centuries,
over and above natural seasonal and annual changes.  Climate changes are
influenced, among other things, by a natural "greenhouse" effect that 
maintains
a warm and inhabitable Earth. Climate changes can also adversely affect 
ocean
water levels and agriculture production. Pollution prevention and
energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies can significantly help 
in
efforts to stabilize and reverse global climate change.<p>
<p>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
The amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased about 25% 
worldwide
since the early 1800s.  In just the last 35 years, amounts of the gas 
have
increased 10% and are currently increasing nearly half a percent each 
year.<p>
Because of excess greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activities, 
average
global temperatures could rise 2.2 degrees F by 2030, and regional 
climate
changes could be dramatic.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
Among individual countries, the United States is the leading contributor 
of
greenhouse gases. Although the United States accounts for only 5% of the
world's population, we contribute 20% of the world's greenhouse gases.<p>


The United States, with less than 5% of the world's population, is 
responsible
for 25% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, more than any other 
nation.<p>

The transportation sector produced 32% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions 
and
will be the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide emissions through 
the year
2000.<p>

The carbon dioxide emission rates for a typical automobile are 1.12 
pounds per
mile.  This means that a car traveling a typical commute of 20 miles can 
emit
more than 20 pounds of carbon dioxide.<p>

Including emissions from electricity generation, the industrial sector
accounted for 33% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in 1990.<p>

Our homes were responsible for 20% of the U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, 
and
commercial buildings were responsible for another 16%.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use</h2>
Net emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, 
nitrous
oxides, and hydrofluorocarbons in the United States are projected to grow 
by
about 7% between 1990 and 2000.<p>

Currently, developing countries account for 30% of global energy use and
emissions.  However, that rate is projected to rise from 25% to 44% by 
2025;
this rate is based on the additional electric power needed to maintain 
moderate
levels of economic growth.<p>
<p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
If extensively used, renewable energy sources could save as much as 10% 
of the
emissions produced by the electricity sector during a year.<p>

Opportunity is ripe for U.S. businesses to increase exports of 
energy-efficient
and renewable energy technologies to developing countries and to offer 
support
to these countries to minimize their greenhouse gas emissions without 
slowing
down needed economic development.<p>

Worldwide, the market for environmentally benign technologies is huge.  
The
Center for the Exportation of Science and Technology estimates that the
European Community will spend more than $400 billion and the United 
States more
than $770 billion to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade.<p>

The United Nations is developing a climate fund to channel $200 million 
to
developing countries to help them combat global warming.<p>

Industrialized nations have recently decreased carbon dioxide emissions 
by
almost 10%. Smaller, lighter cars have helped improve gas mileage.  More
efficient refrigerators and ovens and better insulated homes have all 
helped
accomplish the goal of reducing emissions.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projects and Initiatives</h2>
The Climate Change Action Plan prepared by President Clinton and Vice 
President
Gore in October 1993 outlines a goal to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas 
emissions to
1990 levels by the year 2000.<p>

Through the Climate Change Action Plan, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
initiatives will produce an emissions savings equivalent to the emissions

produced by electricity generation for all households in California, 
Texas, and
New York combined.<p>

Under "accelerated policies," renewables could reduce greenhouse 
emissions by
40% through 2050, according to a United Nation's Conference on 
Environment and
Development report.<p>

<html><head><!-- This document was created from RTF source by rtftohtml

2.7.3 --><title>Transportation</title></head><body>
<h1>Transportation</h1>
<p>
<h2>General</h2>
The nation's transportation sector, comprised of approximately 195 
million
vehicles of all types, is 97% dependent on petroleum and consumes 63% of 
all
oil used in the United States. Foreign oil constitutes nearly half 
(49.3%) of
all oil used--and the use of imported oil is growing.<p>

Total energy consumption in transportation is expected to grow from 20.1 
quads
in 1985 to 24.3 quads in 2010.  Efficiency in personal travel is expected 
to
increase by 44%; efficiency of freight transportation is expected to 
increase
by only 11%.<p>

The average fuel efficiency of the U.S. motor vehicle fleet has already
improved 50% since 1973.  But the number of vehicle miles driven has 
increased
45%, offsetting the gains made in efficiency.<p>

In 1990, 86.5% of American workers rode in a car, light truck, or van to 
work.
Single-occupancy vehicles made up 73.2% of the total, and only 5.3% used 
public
transportation. The remainder walked, worked at home, or used a 
motorcycle or
bicycle. <p>
<p>
<h2>Pollution Prevention and Costs</h2>
A reversible high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane can save 6200 gallons of
gasoline and 13,420 pounds of carbon monoxide per day compared to adding 
a lane
in each direction.<p>

Rail uses about 25% the energy per ton-mile of trucks and is expected to 
expand
its share of the market for freight.<p>

Vehicle emissions continue to exacerbate air pollution.  Transportation
accounts for 66% of carbon monoxide emissions, 21% of particulates, 35% 
of
volatile organic compounds,  and 40% of nitrogen oxides--the precursors 
to
ozone and smog.<p>

Along with the irritation it creates, traffic congestion costs U.S. 
communities
at least $43 billion in lost productivity, wasted gasoline, and increased 
air
pollution. This amount of money equates to the annual sales of the 
Chrysler
Corporation in 1993.<p>
<p>
<h2>Economics and Employment</h2>
The transportation sector accounts for almost 15% of the nation's GNP and

almost 15% of its jobs.<p>

In 1992, Americans spent $424 billion on user-operated transportation. 
This
included all costs of owning and operating a vehicle. About 25% of this 
cost
was for gasoline and oil.<p>
<p>
<h2>Market Growth</h2>
Oak Ridge National Laboratory's predicted growth of truck traffic (2.5% 
per
year from 1995 to 2010) is greater than that of light-duty vehicles, 
while the
fuel economy of trucks increases at a slower rate (0.8% per year from 
1995 to
2010) than that of light-duty vehicles.<p>
<p>
<h2>Sustainable Alternatives and Advantages</h2><p>
<b><i>Ethanol:</i></b>  By 2000, 500 million gallons of ethanol made from

biomass will displace 13 million barrels of oil; by 2020, 14 billion
gallons of ethanol will displace 348 million barrels of oil. Ethanol
currently supplies nearly 1% of the nation's transportation fuel needs;
production is based in the Midwest; about 400 million bushels of corn is
converted to more than 1 billion gallons of ethanol annually.<p>

<b><i>U.S. Jobs:</i></b>  The biomass-to-ethanol industry will create 
more than
2800 new jobs by 2000 and more than 100,000 jobs by 2020.<p>

<b><i>Reduce Global Climate Change:</i></b>  Ethanol made from biomass
generates 90% less carbon dioxide (the leading cause of global warming) 
and 70%
less sulfur dioxide (the leading agent responsible for acid rain) than 
does
reformulated gasoline.<p>

<b><i>Ease of Use:</i></b>  Mixing 20% biodiesel with 80% diesel will 
enable
U.S. diesel-fueled fleet operators to comply with stricter emissions
regulations with no major modifications to existing equipment.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
Renewable fuels are a key to achieving sustainable development in the 
United
States; the Department of Energy's (DOE's) biofuels programs will 
stimulate
investment in the nation's agricultural, fuel production, and automobile
manufacturing industries.<p>

By 1996, the federal Clean Cities Program anticipates commitments for 
250,000
alternative fuel vehicles in federal, state, local, and private 
fleets.<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Fossil Fuel: Natural Gas</title></head><body>
<h1>Fossil Fuel: Natural Gas</h1><p>
<p>
The United States has abundant natural gas reserves.  And because it is
relatively inexpensive and nonpolluting, natural gas is being used 
increasingly
for electricity generation and other industrial uses.  New technologies 
will
help to extend the types and productivity of gas resources.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Natural gas is a combustible, gaseous mixture of hydrocarbons including 
mostly
methane; it is called "dry" gas when liquid hydrocarbons and 
nonhydrocarbon
gases are removed. <p>

Total 1992 U.S. natural gas production of 17.8 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) 
was 27%
of total U.S. energy production; that production came from more than 
250,000
wells in 33 states and in federal waters (Gulf of Mexico, offshore 
California).
Texas produced 6.7 Tcf, Louisiana 5.0 Tcf, and Oklahoma 2.0 Tcf.<p>

Year-end 1992 U.S. dry-gas proven reserves were just more than 165 Tcf.  
As
much as 1295 Tcf is technically recoverable in the Lower 48 States--a 
60-year
supply at projected consumption rates.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
Natural gas is the most environmentally friendly fossil fuel. <p>
There are adequate domestic resources and proven reserves of natural 
gas.<p>
Natural gas can be converted to high-value liquid petroleum products such 
as
automotive fuel.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2><p>
In 1992, the United States consumed 19.5 Tcf of natural gas--more than 
24% of
all U.S. energy consumption; industrial use was 7.5 Tcf (39% of total gas

consumption); residential use was 4.7 Tcf (24%); commercial use was 2.8 
Tcf
(14%); electric utility use was 2.8 Tcf (14%); and other use was 1.7 Tcf 
(9%)<p>
1992 imports of natural gas were 2.1 Tcf--more than 9% of total U.S.
consumption; nearly all of that came from Canada via pipeline.<p>
During 1992, residential sector users paid an average price of $5.89 per
thousand cubic feet (Mcf); commercial, industrial, and electric utilities

sector users paid $4.88, $2.84, and $2.36 per Mcf, respectively.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use and Cost</h2>
U.S. gas consumption is expected to increase from 18.7 Tcf in 1990 to 
24.1
Tcf in 2010. Domestic production is expected to increase from 17.8 Tcf to 
20.2
Tcf.  Imports are expected to provide 16% of consumption in 2010.<p>

Residential consumption is forecast to increase 10% from 1990 to 2010;
industrial consumption will increase 12%.  These increases are 
attributable to
gas conversions, continued gas dominance in new housing, and new uses for

gas.<p>
On January 1, 1993, all price controls on first sale of natural gas were
removed.<p>
<p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
Natural gas is not easily transported to or from countries outside North
America.<p>

Pipelines are generally required for distribution to end-users.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities and Challenges</h2>
Demands for a cleaner environment and advances in gas-fired generation
technology are increasing the use of gas for the generation of 
electricity.  At
least half the generating capacity added in the United States in the next 
15
years will be from gas-fired turbines. <p>

Of the estimated 1295 Tcf of recoverable gas in the Lower 48 States, 
recovery
of more than 200 Tcf depends on developing better technology.<p>

Compressed natural gas represents the largest share of alternative-fuel
consumption projected for the transportation sector in 2010.<p>

More interregional pipeline capacity is needed to support expansion of 
gas
markets.  Total pipeline capacity is projected to increase from 89.6 
billion
cubic feet per day (Bcfpd) in 1992 to 107.2 Bcfpd in 2010.<p>

<p>
<h2>New Technologies</h2>
Advanced exploration technologies, such as 3-D seismic mapping, can 
locate
previously undetected resources.<p>

Unconventional gas recovery technologies include production from
low-permeability reservoirs, recovering methane from coal beds, and 
recovering
gas from Devonian shales.<p>

Research and development in high-efficiency gas technologies (e.g., fuel 
cells)
is strongly supported by the Climate Change Action Plan.<p>
Advanced gas turbines operate at higher temperatures and efficiencies; 
nitrogen
oxide emissions will be cut in half.<p>

New drilling technologies are reducing the cost of producing gas now.<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Fossil Fuel: Coal</title></head><body>
<h1>Fossil Fuel: Coal</h1><p>
<p>
The United States has abundant coal resources, and coal is the least 
expensive
fossil fuel on an energy-per-Btu basis.  But environmental issues related 
to
coal-fired power-generating plants could limit its effectiveness.  New 
clean
coal technologies will allow coal to meet emission requirements 
established by
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Coal is a solid fossil fuel mined in several parts of the United States 
from
open pits (59%) and underground mines (41%).  Bituminous/sub-bituminous 
coal
provides 89% of domestic demonstrated reserves.<p>

Mining of western U.S. coal--typically low-sulfur coal from open pits--is

projected to increase from 41% in 1992 to 47% in 2010.<p>

Annual domestic coal production is about 1 billion tons, with about 100 
million
tons exported to Canada, Japan, and Italy.<p>

Domestic in-the-ground coal resources are estimated at 4 trillion tons.
Estimated recoverable-coal reserves total 261 billion tons--more than 200 
years
supply at current production rates.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
Coal is an abundant domestic resource that strongly supports the mining
industry and provides numerous jobs.<p>
Coal is the least expensive electrical energy source.<p>
Coal provides a dependable resource and technology for baseload 
electrical
generation.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2>
The principal use of coal is electricity generation by utility companies 
(87%
in 1992); industrial use (11%) is declining.<p>

Since 1984, coal has been largest source of domestic energy (33%, or
22 quadrillion Btu in 1992).<p>

Coal provides more than half the energy consumed by utilities to produce
electricity (55% of total energy, 81% of fossil fuel energy, or 16 
quadrillion
Btu in 1992).<p>
Coal is the least expensive fossil fuel on energy-per-Btu basis 
($1.42/million
Btu in 1992).<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use and Cost</h2>
Coal production is projected to increase to 1.2 billion tons in 2010, 
providing
35% of domestic energy production.<p>
Coal's cost per Btu is expected to rise by less than 2% until 2010, thus
maintaining its price advantage over other fossil fuels.<p>
<p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
Coal is not well suited to peaking electrical generation.<p>
With today's technology, coal is a major source of air pollution (66% of 
total
U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions) and greenhouse gases (36% of total 
man-made
carbon emissions).<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
Large-scale retirement of coal and nuclear baseload electric plants will 
begin
around 2000; these plants could be replaced with clean coal 
technology.<p>

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 place new requirements on future 
power
generation; these could be met affordably with clean coal technology.<p>

The worldwide market for clean power technologies will range between
$270 billion and $750 billion during the next 20 years; this is a
tremendous opportunity for U.S. industry and jobs.<p>
<p>
<h2>New Technologies</h2>
Dramatically improved coal liquefaction technologies--to replace imported

oil--have cut projected costs in half to $35 per barrel, matching the 
peak 1981
cost for crude oil (recent costs have been around $20 per barrel).  <p>

Today's coal-fired power plants average 33% efficiency (energy conversion 
to
electricity); new technologies are projected to greatly improve 
efficiency
while reducing air pollution per amount of coal:<p>

Low-emission boiler systems (43% efficiency)<p>

Pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (50% efficiency)<p>
Integrated gasification combined cycle (52% efficiency)<p>
Indirectly fired cycles (55% efficiency)<p>
Gasification/fuel-cell combinations (60% efficiency, or 85% with
cogeneration).<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Nuclear Power</title></head><body>
<h1>Nuclear Power</h1> <p>
<p>
Nuclear power uses the energy trapped in the atoms of heavy elements like

uranium.  Splitting these atoms to form lighter elements--a process 
called
fission--causes a release of energy, which is used to boil water into 
steam.
The steam then spins a turbine, which in turn spins a generator to 
produce
electricity.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
The 109 operating nuclear power plants in the United States produce about 
21%
of the nation's electricity--only coal produces more electricity.<p>

Nuclear power plant performance is steadily improving.  In the early 
1970s,
nuclear power plants typically operated at only 50% of their total 
capacity.
Today they operate at consistently more than 70% of their capacity. <p>

Although no nuclear power plants have been ordered since 1978, many 
plants that
were under construction at that time have been completed and are now 
operating.
This steadily increased electricity generation by nuclear power and 
provided
electricity to meet increased U.S. power needs.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
Nuclear power--unlike fossil fuels--generates no air pollutants (such as
nitrous oxides or sulfur dioxide) or greenhouse gases, so it does not
contribute to acid rain, smog, or climate change.<p>

The nuclear and coal power plants that entered service in the last 20 
years
have cut oil use for electricity production by 1 million barrels per day,

helping reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil.<p>
<p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
There are several barriers to the expanded use of nuclear power.  Among 
the
leading ones are:<p>

(1)  Delays in providing for nuclear waste management<p>
(2)  Economic competitiveness with other fuels<p>
(3)  Public concerns about safety, despite actual safety records<p>
(4)  Investment community concerns about financial risks.<p>

Waste management is one of the most difficult problems for nuclear power.  
The
technology exists for the burial of wastes from nuclear power plants and
studies are under way to test the suitability of a potential site for an
underground repository.  However, no site has been formally selected, and

reaching a final decision requires much more work.<p>

Because of the lack of a permanent waste repository, nuclear plants have
stockpiled spent fuel on site in large pools of water.  These pools were 
only
built large enough for temporary storage needs, so many are close to 
capacity,
requiring operators to look for other storage options.<p>
<p>
<h2>DOE Projects and Initiatives</h2>
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is working with the nuclear industry 
in a
cost-shared, cooperative program to develop standardized, certified 
designs for
the next generation of nuclear power plants--advanced light-water 
reactors.
These new, economic plants, incorporating improved safety features, will 
be
available for electric utility orders about the turn of the century.<p>

DOE is also making major changes in the civilian reactor waste management

program to get the program on schedule and avoid further delays.<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Energy Efficiency</title></head><body>
<h1>Energy Efficiency</h1><p>
<p>
Energy efficiency is a measure of how much value we get from energy that
we consume; any increase in efficiency means a decrease in use and
consequently savings in cost, pollution, carbon emissions, and foreign
dependence.  Estimates of past and potential future energy and cost 
savings
resulting from increases in energy efficiency vary widely, but all 
suggest that
it is one of our most substantial "new energy" resources.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
One U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) study calculated that energy 
efficiency and
conservation activities from 1973 to 1986 reduced growth of U.S. energy 
use by
30%, saving $225 billion annually.<p>

DOE projects that energy efficiency measures will reduce energy use in 
2010 by
13%, but another DOE study estimated that use of existing cost-effective
technology for end-use energy efficiency could reduce energy use by an
additional 13%.<p>

Reductions in electricity use through efficiency measures save more than 
three
times as much primary energy because of the losses in conversion to
electricity.  Primary energy is energy in its naturally occurring form 
(e.g.,
coal or oil) before conversion to end-use forms.<p>

An Alliance to Save Energy study concluded that the United States could 
reduce
primary energy demand by at least 20% using only investment opportunities 
with
a payback of 5 years or less.<p>

An American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy study concluded that
vigorous adoption of cost-effective energy efficiency and renewable 
energy
measures could reduce national energy use in 2030 by 50% compared to
1988--saving $2.3 trillion and reducing carbon emissions by 70%.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
Reducing energy demand by efficient use is often the cleanest, least 
expensive,
and most effective way to improve the adequacy of energy supply.<p>
Energy efficiency reduces air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions and
alleviates energy dependence and balance-of-payments problems.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
The United States consumes 33 times as much energy per person as India,
13 times as much as China, two and a half times as much as Japan, and
two times as much as Sweden.  Only Canada and two small, oil-rich 
countries
use as much energy per capita.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use</h2>
DOE projects a 25% increase in energy consumption by 2010, mostly from 
the
industrial and transportation sectors; commercial and residential energy 
growth
are expected to be relatively flat.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
The economies of developing countries will be expanding rapidly in the 
future,
and world energy use could expand dramatically.  By developing energy
efficiency and renewable energy technologies now, the United States can 
lead by
example, reducing growth of energy use and carbon emissions while 
creating
major markets for the technologies.<p>
<p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
Energy use is closely tied to economic activity.  But it does not have to 
be
that way--energy efficiency can hold down growth of energy use and 
contribute
to economic health.  From 1977 to 1987, energy use in the United States
actually decreased slightly while the gross national product increased 
27% in
real dollars.<p>

<h2>New Technologies</h2>
General Motors and Ford have built prototype five-passenger cars that get

90 miles per gallon (mpg); a forthcoming Mercedes will get 75 mpg of
diesel while meeting California low-emission vehicle standards; an Audi 
that is
currently available gets more than 60 mpg of gasoline.<p>

3M Corporation has reduced energy use per unit of production by more than 
50%
during the last 17 years.<p>

A Center for Applied Research study found that fully adopting 
cost-effective
efficiency improvements for commercial lighting, industrial motors, and
household appliances would reduce energy consumption by 38%.<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Electrical Utilities and Energy
Efficiency</title></head><body>
<h1>Electric Utilities and Energy Efficiency</h1><p>
<p>
More than one-third (37%) of the energy used in the United States is used 
to
produce electricity.  Roughly 70% of that energy is lost in the process 
of
converting it to electricity and distributing the electricity to 
customers.
Any gains in the efficiency of this process could result in significant 
energy
savings for the country.  Electric utilities also have a unique ability 
to
encourage energy efficiency among their customers--an approach known as
demand-side management.  Both of these approaches help the environment by

avoiding power-plant emissions.<p>
<p>
<h2>Energy Efficiency in Production and Distribution of Electricity</h2>
Although most power plant efficiencies are limited to about 30% to 40%, 
some
efficiency improvements can be gained through the use of more efficient 
motors,
generators, and other electrical equipment.  The electrical equipment in 
power
plants consumes a significant fraction of the generated electricity.<p>

Advanced technologies for new fossil-fueled power plants may boost the
efficiencies in many cases to 50% (e.g., fuel gasification combined with 
an
advanced gas turbine), and in some cases to as high as 85% (e.g., fuel 
cells
combined with cogeneration). <p>

The current transmission and distribution systems in the United States 
are
designed for safety and reliability, but they are not necessarily energy
efficient.  The current designs allow power to travel through longer 
paths than
needed and even to circulate in loops through the distribution system.  
This
causes energy losses that could be avoided with better technology. <p>

New technologies (e.g., thyristor-controlled series capacitor [TCSC]) 
under
development by industry and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) allow an 
active
control of the distribution system to route power more efficiently 
through the
distribution grid.  This will save energy.<p>
<p>
<h2>Demand-Side Management</h2>
Utility investments in energy efficiency can keep utility bills lower 
because
they are more cost effective than building new power plants. For example, 
the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) has avoided rate increases 
for its
customers for 5 years by carrying out an aggressive energy efficiency
program.<p>

To meet the nation's projected growth in electricity needs during the 
next 10
years, $100 to $200 billion in new capital investment will be needed.  
However,
new power plants are quite expensive, and there is often strong local
resistance to power plant construction.  Because of this, many utilities 
are
doing whatever they can to reduce the demand for electricity and to defer 
new
power plant construction.<p>

The current situation is leading utilities to work with customers to 
reduce the
customer's electrical demands or to shift the customer's electricity use 
away
from the periods of high electrical demand.  This approach is called
demand-side management (DSM).<p>

Because DSM reduces the customers' electricity bills, it saves the 
customer
money. Some rate structures allow utilities to capitalize the money that 
they
spend on DSM, spreading the costs over 30 years.  The customer pays this 
cost,
but because it is less than the cost of the electricity saved, the 
customer
saves money.  The utility can also profit if it is allowed to collect a 
profit
on the DSM investment.  This creates a win-win situation for utilities 
and
their customers. <p>

DSM is a relatively new and growing service for electric utilities.  In 
1991,
U.S. utilities invested $2 billion in DSM technologies.<p>

In 1990, there were more than 1300 utility DSM programs in the United 
States
with 13 million customers participating, saving 0.6% of the nation's
electricity.  Experts predict that by 2000, the savings could increase to

2.2%.<p>
<p>
<h2>Economic Benefits</h2>
A 2% reduction in electricity use would cut the nation's electric bills 
by $6.1
billion per year, freeing up this money for investment or other 
spending.<p>
DSM programs are very labor intensive, so they produce new jobs.  In 1991

alone, utility DSM programs in Massachusetts created 2350 jobs.<p>

Buildings</title></head><body>
<h1>Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in Buildings</h1>  <p>
<p>
Buildings include residential, commercial, institutional, and federal
structures. Energy efficiency and renewable energy in buildings encompass

building design, building materials, heating, cooling, lighting, and
appliances.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2>
U.S. buildings consume 36% of the country's energy supply at a cost of
$193 billion--nearly as much as the combined annual sales of General
Motors Corporation and Exxon in 1993, and energy use is growing at a rate 
of
3.3% a year.<p>

Including the fossil fuel used to generate the electricity, commercial
buildings account for more than 15% of U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions;
residential buildings account for 19%.<p>
<p>
<h2>Building Design</h2>
Passive solar buildings are being built today that save as much as 50% on

heating bills for only 1% more in construction costs.<p>
Exemplary buildings--which use the sun, efficient technologies, and the
environment to provide for a building's heating, cooling, and lighting
requirements--will reduce energy bills by as much as 75%. And these 
buildings
cost no more than conventional buildings.<p>

New building technologies, such as low-emissivity (low-E) windows, 
compact
fluorescent lights, and energy-efficient clothes washers and dryers,
dishwashers, refrigerators, and freezers have created new business
opportunities and growth markets. <p>
<p>
<h2>Building Materials</h2>
Poorly insulated windows account for 25% of all heating and cooling
requirements in the United States at a cost of $22 billion--more than the

annual sales of Shell Oil Company in 1993. This is equivalent to the 
amount of
energy flowing through the Alaskan pipeline each year.<p>
New insulating foams do not use chlorofluorocarbon blowing agents or 
materials
and have the same superior thermal and physical characteristics as those 
they
replace. <p>
<p>
<h2>Heating and Cooling</h2>
Heating and cooling equipment consumes 42% of all building energy use at 
a cost
of $81 billion--nearly twice the dollar amount of Chrysler Corporation's 
annual
sales in 1993. <p>

A transpired solar collector--which is a dark, perforated metal 
wall--converts
up to 80% of the sunlight striking it into heated ventilation air for
commercial buildings.<p>

Residential natural gas absorption heat pumps with more than a 50% 
improvement
in heating efficiency over the best gas furnaces will be available in 
1997. By
2000, those units will be improved to provide over 50% more efficient 
cooling
than the best current absorption air conditioning units.<p>

Commercial gas cooling units that are 50% better than the best existing
absorption chillers will be available by 1998.<p>
<p>
Lighting and Appliances<p>
Lighting accounts for about 25% or $44.25 billion of all electricity 
consumed
in the United States--more than the annual sales of the Chrysler 
Corporation in
1993. <p>

Compact fluorescent lamps consume 75% to 85% less electricity than do
incandescent ones and, typically, last 4 to 5 times longer than 
incandescent
flood lamps and 9 to 13 times longer than ordinary incandescent bulbs.<p>

Appliances (other than heating and cooling) use 40% of all electricity 
consumed
in residential and commercial buildings. This equates to a cost of $54.6
billion dollars in 1991.<p>

Energy efficiency standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, 
clothes
washers, clothes dryers, and dishwashers are expected to save 
approximately 20
quadrillion Btu (equal to 24% of the nation's energy use in 1992) of 
energy
during 1993 to 2015.<p>

Beginning with some 1997 models, refrigerator walls and doors will have
advanced vacuum insulation panels which have five times the insulating 
value of
current units. <p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
The Federal Energy Management Program will reduce energy use in federal
buildings 30% by 2005, based on 1985 use. This will save taxpayers more 
than
$1 billion dollars a year by the year 2000.<p>

Technologies</title></head><body>
<h1>Energy Efficiency in Industrial Technologies</h1><p>
<p>
Industry consumes about 37% of the total energy used in the United States 
each
year, at a cost of about $115 billion--nearly as much as the 1993 annual 
sales
of General Motors Incorporated, the largest U.S. company.  Helping our 
nation's
industries become more productive by using new technologies increases 
energy
efficiency, minimizes or reuses wastes, improves profits, and reduces
pollution.  Additionally, energy efficiency improvements and pollution
prevention measures often complement each other.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities in Industrial Technologies</h2>
<b><i>Cogeneration</i></b> generates steam and electrical energy using 
30% less
fuel than if each is produced separately.  Industrial cogenerators sell 
their
excess power to local electric utilities, generating revenue for their 
plant.<p>

<b><i>Industrial electric motor systems</i></b>--motors, speed drives, 
fans,
compressors, and power distribution systems--account for more than 20% of 
all
electricity used in the United States. That's more electricity than the 
entire
South Atlantic region of the United States uses annually.<p>

By 2010, using more <b><i>efficient electric motor systems</i></b> in the

industrial sector could save 240 billion kilowatt hours of electricity 
annually
(8.5% of total annual electricity production), provide an industrial 
energy
cost savings of $13 billion (nearly equal to the 1993 annual sales of the

Coca-Cola Corporation), and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 48.5 
million
tons.<p>
More than a third of the energy consumed by U.S. industry is used to 
provide
<b><i>process heat, such as hot water and steam</i></b>.  This is about 
equal
to the entire amount of energy used in Texas.<p>

Energy use in intensive process industries such as <b><i>metals, glass, 
paper,
and chemicals, along with petroleum refining and food processing</i></b>, 
can
account for as much as one-fourth of their production costs.  If the
manufacturing processes used by these energy-intensive industries could 
be made
more efficient, then these firms could be more competitive.<p>

<b><i>Direct steelmaking</i></b>, which eliminates steps from the steel
production process, could reduce energy use by 20%, while reducing
air-polluting emissions.<p>

<b><i>Chemical feedstocks</i></b>, the raw materials used to make other
products such as drugs, plastics, or fertilizer, can be made with 
forestry and
agricultural products instead of petroleum-based feedstocks.  These
biomass-based chemical feedstocks help create significant new markets for

agricultural products.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities in Waste Reduction Technologies</h2>
U.S. industry produces more than 14 billion tons of waste that cost more 
than
$45 billion to treat and dispose of properly in 1990--that's more than
Chrysler Corporation's annual sales revenues for 1993.<p>

A program operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has shown that 
an
energy/waste assessment can save the average small- to medium-sized plant 
more
than $20,000 per year.<p>

<b><i>Solar energy</i></b> can destroy hazardous wastes.  Concentrated 
sunlight
can be used to decontaminate and detoxify water and air.<p>

<b><i>Landfill gas</i></b>, an environmental and safety problem, can and 
is
being captured and converted to energy to produce electricity, heat, or 
steam.
With minimal cleaning, it can be used directly in boilers to create steam 
for
industrial uses.  Using landfill gas does not require a large capital
investment for equipment such as generators.<p>

Landfills for municipal solid waste are becoming scarce.  Today we have 
about
6000 landfills, down from 30,000 in 1976.  About 45% of these 6000
landfills are close to capacity and may close in the near future.<p>

Each year, Americans discard more than 200 million tons of solid waste.  
At
present, about 33% of these wastes are used to generate energy or produce 
raw
materials for recycling into new products.  The remainder, about 135 
million
tons, is sent to landfills and represents a great potential for 
additional
energy production or recycling.<p>

Municipal solid waste can be converted to energy by (1) directly burning 
it to
produce steam or electricity, or (2) converting municipal solid waste 
into fuel
pellets and mixing it with coal.  Both methods improve the environment by

reducing the amount of solid wastes that must be landfilled.<p>

<h1>Renewable Energy</h1><p>
<p>
Renewable energy sources are either continuously resupplied by the sun or 
tap
inexhaustible resources--as in geothermal energy.  In contrast, fossil 
fuels
form so slowly in comparison to our energy use that we are essentially 
mining
finite, nonrenewable resources and could exhaust quality supplies within 
the
foreseeable future.  The use of renewable energy does not produce 
greenhouse
gases and either does not pollute or emits far less pollution than 
burning
fossil fuels.  Renewable energy sources also represent a secure and 
stable
source of energy for our country.  These diverse technologies represent 
an
important source of new industries.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Solar thermal and photovoltaics use solar energy directly; wind, biomass, 
and
hydropower indirectly use the products of their energy.<p>

For most of the United States, the electrical needs for a typical family 
could
theoretically be met by the solar energy shining on about 30 square feet 
of
roof space.<p>

If solar energy systems that were only 10% efficient (well within reach 
of
current solar cell and solar thermal technology) were placed on 1% of the 
U.S.
land area (such as two or three large counties in Nevada), they could 
provide
energy equivalent to that used by the United States.<p>

Wind energy in North Dakota alone could provide one-third of the U.S.
electrical demand.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
U.S. industry now spends about $12 billion annually to control air
emissions; most renewable energy uses do not pollute at all; others emit 
far
less pollution than burning fossil fuels; use of renewables alleviates 
air
quality and acid rain problems.<p>

Federal renewable energy and energy efficiency programs will create 
20,000 jobs
in 1995.<p>

Renewable energy equipment exports reached $245 million in 1992; a 
massive
worldwide market is anticipated for environmentally benign technologies 
such as
renewables.<p>

Renewable energy uses do not release carbon dioxide or other greenhouse
gases that threaten to cause global warming, as fossil fuel use does.<p>

Renewable energy would all be generated domestically, creating jobs and
alleviating energy dependence and balance-of-payments problems. <p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
In the United States, renewables now supply about 8% of the total energy 
demand
(compared to 18% worldwide) and 11% of the electricity generation.<p>
Hydroelectric power in the United States accounts for about half of the 
total
renewable energy supply and most of the renewable electricity 
generation.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use</h2>
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) projects that renewable energy 
production
will increase to 15% of U.S. energy needs by 2030; a program of price 
premiums
would increase it to 22%, a program of intensive research and development 
would
increase that projection to 28%. <p>

DOE is seeking to double nonhydro renewable energy generating capacity by

2000.<p>

Within 15 years, renewable energy could be generating enough electricity 
to
power 40 million homes and to offset 70 days of oil imports.<p>

Renewables could be saving 65 million tons of carbon emissions--equal to 
10% of
the emissions produced by the electricity sector.<p>

President Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan estimates that more than
3000 megawatts of electricity will be generated by commercial forms of
renewable solar thermal energy by the year 2000.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
There will be large-scale retirement of electric generating plants 
starting
around 2000; nearly one-fourth of the electric utility industry's 2010 
capacity
will be built between now and then; this is a major opportunity to 
install
renewable technologies.<p>

The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments place major new requirements on
transportation vehicles and future power generation; renewables are an
excellent way to meet these demands.<p>

Several studies on energy subsidies, while they differ widely in their 
total
calculation, agree that renewables have thus far received only a very 
small
percentage of energy subsidies.<p>

As much as $200 billion in new capital investment will be needed this 
decade to
meet the nation's growing electricity needs.  These investments will 
determine
the sources of our electrical power for years to come.<p>

<h1>Renewable Energy: Hydropower</h1><p>
<p>
Hydropower converts the energy of flowing water into electricity.  The 
flowing
water passes through a turbine that spins like a pinwheel, in turn 
spinning a
generator to produce electricity.  Although most people associate 
hydropower
with large dams on rivers, hydropower also includes small dams that can 
be
located on a diversion from the main river. <p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
Hydropower is the largest renewable energy source in the U.S.  It 
currently
generates about 10% of the nation's electricity, and even more during 
periods
of high electrical demand.<p>

Each year, hydropower generates enough power to supply 28 million U.S.
households and represents the energy equivalent of nearly 500 million 
barrels
of oil.<p>


Hydropower is the most efficient and reliable of all renewable energy 
sources.
Hydropower plants typically operate at efficiencies of 85% to 95%. <p>
<p>
<h2>Potential Use</h2>
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission estimates that the nation's 
existing
hydropower capacity could theoretically be more than doubled.  
Small-scale
hydropower plants with small diversion structures would provide much of 
this
additional capacity.<p>

New hydropower capacity does not necessarily require new dams:  only 2400 
of
the nation's 80,000 existing dams are used to generate power.  Many of 
the
others could be modified to generate power.<p>

New technologies can allow existing hydropower plants to operate more
efficiently, producing more electricity.  A 1% improvement in the 
efficiency of
the existing U.S. hydropower plants would produce enough extra power to 
supply
283,000 households.  This would save the energy equivalent of more than
5 million barrels of oil each year.<p>
<p>
<h2>Economic Benefits</h2>
The United States has invested more than $150 billion (in 1993 dollars) 
in
hydropower facilities.  This investment, largely made in the 1940s, is 
now
yielding a significant economic benefit for the nation by providing an
inexpensive, sustainable supply of electricity.<p>

In 1987, hydropower produced 17% of the electricity in industrialized 
countries
and 31% of the electricity in developing countries.  The World Energy
Conference has estimated that this number could increase fivefold.  This
represents a large market for the export of U.S. hydropower 
technologies.<p>
<p>
<h2>Environmental Benefits and Challenges</h2>
Hydropower plants produce no carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, or nitrous
oxides--no air emissions at all.  Because they produce no greenhouse gas
emissions, hydropower plants help to minimize global climate change.<p>
Hydropower plants produce no solid or liquid wastes.<p>

Hydropower projects can have an impact on water quality and fish and 
wildlife
habitats.  To address these concerns, many hydropower projects are being
retrofitted with fish ladders to encourage the upstream migration of fish 
to
their spawning grounds in the rivers' headwaters.  Many projects are also

maintaining minimum flows through the dams to encourage downstream 
migration
and maintain downstream wildlife habitats.<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Renewable Energy: Wind</title></head><body>
<h1>Renewable Energy: Wind</h1><p>
<p>
Wind has become a viable source of electric energy for utilities. 
Utility-scale
wind power plants consist of 100 to 1000 wind turbines that are located 
close
to each other, have a single electrical connection to the utility grid, 
and can
be managed from a single control room.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Excellent wind resources are widely dispersed throughout the world.  
Almost
every country has some areas with good wind resources.<p>

Power in the wind is proportional to the cube of the wind speed.  
Therefore,
locations with higher average wind speeds have much higher energy 
resources.
The windier the location, the more kilowatt-hours (kWh) can be produced 
by the
same equipment, and the lower the overall cost of energy.<p>

The total U.S. wind resource is very large.  Although every region in the

country has some windy areas, much of the U.S. wind resources are 
concentrated
in the Great Plains.  For example, <b><i>the state of North Dakota alone 
has
enough energy from good wind areas to supply 36% of the 1990 electricity
consumption in the lower 48 states</i></b>. <p>

Many windy locations are in remote areas, far from load centers, and do 
not
have transmission lines nearby.   <p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2>
Wind power plant electricity generating costs have gone from $0.30/kWh in 
1981
to $0.05/kWh in 1990--an 84% decrease in cost.<p>

In California, 1700 megawatts (MW) of rated capacity is installed (as 
much as
that of two large coal-fired power plants); in Europe, another 1000 MW is

installed (as much as that of one nuclear power plant).  The wind power 
plants
in California produce 3.1 billion kWh/year; this is 1.2% of the
electricity used by California or 0.1% of the electricity used by the 
United
States--enough to supply a residential city the size of San Francisco and

Washington, D.C., combined.  <p>

Existing wind power plants produce electricity at a levelized cost of 
$0.05 to
$0.08/kWh at a site with an average annual wind speed through the rotor 
of
15.4 miles per hour (mph).  Those turbines have a first cost as little as

$1,000/kW and last as long as 20 years.  New turbines are coming on line 
that
produce electricity at less than $0.05/kWh; they cost as little as 
$750/kW and
have expected lifetimes of 20 to 30 years. Turbine availability of power 
plants
is 95% or more, better than that of most conventional power plants.  
Operation
and maintenance costs are typically lower than those for conventional 
power
plants.<p>

Existing wind power plants exploit very windy locations with average 
annual
wind speeds of at least 16 mph.  The United States could supply 20% of 
its
electricity from these very windy locations with existing 
technology--producing
560,000 million kWh per year.  These areas cover 18,000 square 
miles--0.6%
of the lower 48 states.  Less than 5% of this land would be used by the
equipment and access roads; most of the existing land use, such as 
ranching and
farming, would continue as it is now.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use and Cost</h2>
In the United States, 2000 to 5000 MW of new capacity are planned or are 
under
construction. A similar amount is planned or under construction in 11 
countries
in the European Union. Worldwide, sizable wind power plants are on the 
drawing
boards in Argentina, Chile, China, India, Mexico, and the Ukraine.<p>
By 2000, wind-generated electricity will cost as little as $0.04/kWh.  At 
this
price, it can compete with any type of conventional generation.<p>

<h2>Technology Development</h2>
Costs will be reduced through employing advanced wind technology; further

reducing operation and maintenance associated with new, larger power 
plants;
and manufacturers taking advantage of economies of scale in unit size,
purchasing, and production.<p>

New wind technologies to improve reliability and reduce costs include 
improved
aerodynamic performance of blades; improved design of mechanical 
components;
variable-speed and/or low-speed generators; and controls that increase 
system
efficiency and lifetime.<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Renewable Energy: Biomass and
Biofuels</title></head><body>
<h1>Renewable Energy: Biomass and Biofuels</h1><p>
<p>
The nation's transportation sector is 97% dependent on petroleum and 
consumes
63% of all oil used in the United States.  Foreign oil contributes nearly 
half
(49.3%) of all oil used--and the use of imported oil is growing.  Biomass 
is
organic material that can be converted into enough transportation fuels, 
called
biofuels, to displace significant amounts of the imported oil without
encroaching on food and forestry crops.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Nonfood agricultural energy crops and more than half of the nation's 
household,
industrial, agricultural, and forestry wastes could produce enough 
ethanol to
supply most of the nation's current gasoline consumption.<p>

Microscopic aquatic plants called microalgae could produce enough 
biodiesel to
satisfy the entire U.S. diesel market.<p>

Electricity produced from biomass has grown from 200 megawatts (MW) in 
the
early 1980s to more than 8000 MW today, representing a 4000% increase.<p>

<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<b><i>Reduce imported oil consumption</i></b>:  By 2000, 500 million 
gallons of
ethanol made from biomass will displace 13 million barrels of oil; by 
2020, 14
billion gallons of ethanol will displace 348 million barrels of oil.<p>

<b><i>Create U.S. jobs</i></b>:  The biomass-to-ethanol industry will 
create
more than 2800 new jobs by 2000 and more than 100,000 jobs by 2020.<p>

<b><i>Reduce global climate change</i></b>:  Ethanol made from biomass
generates 90% less carbon dioxide (the leading cause of global warming) 
and 70%
less sulfur dioxide (the leading agent responsible for acid rain) than 
does
reformulated gasoline.<p>

<b><i>Ease of use</i></b>:  Mixing 20% biodiesel with 80% diesel will 
enable
U.S. diesel-fueled fleet operators to comply with stricter emissions
regulations with no major modifications to existing equipment.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2>Ethanol currently supplies nearly 1% of the nation's transportation fuel 
needs;
production is based in the Midwest; about 400 million bushels of corn is
converted to more than 1 billion gallons of ethanol annually.<p>

<b><i>Current conversion costs</i></b>:  Biomass can be converted to 
ethanol
for less than $1.00/gallon--down from $3.42/gallon in 1980; biomass can 
be
converted to methanol for $0.84/gallon; soybeans can be converted to 
biodiesel
for $2.50/gallon.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use and Cost</h2>
Department of Energy goals:<p>

<b><i>Conversion costs</i></b>:  Biomass to ethanol for $0.67/gallon by 
2000;
biomass to methanol for $0.55/gallon; microalgae to biodiesel for 
$1.00/gallon
by 2015.<p>

10% of cars on U.S. highways will use alternative fuels by 2000; 25% by 
2010.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
Renewable fuels are a key to achieving sustainable development in the 
United
States; the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) biofuels programs will
stimulate investment in the nation's agricultural, fuel production, and
automobile manufacturing industries.<p>

More than 36 million acres enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program 
(CRP)
since 1986 could produce energy crops while improving the quality of the
cropland, which is the purpose of the CRP.<p>

Energy crops, such as switchgrass, poplars, and willows, will soon be 
grown by
many of America's farmers to provide fuel for high-efficiency biomass 
power
plants.  These biomass plants will contribute to the battle against 
global
warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions significantly compared to
conventional power production.<p>
<p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<b><i>Costs</i></b>:  Enable biofuels to be cost-competitive with 
gasoline when
oil is $25/barrel.<p>

<b><i>Developing a fuel industry infrastructure</i></b>:  Farmers want 
markets
before they plant energy crops; fuel producers want guarantees of stable
supplies before they build a new infrastructure.<p>
<p>
<h2>New Technologies</h2>
Technologies that enable producers to extract and ferment sugar from 
nonstarch
materials are being developed now; this would allow use of nonfood crops 
and
other biomass resources.<p>

Technologies that can convert oils found in microalgae to biodiesel are 
being
developed now.<p>

Also under development are new gasifier designs and other thermochemical
advances that enable methanol and biocrude, a crude oil replacement, to 
be made
from biomass.<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Alternative Fuel Vehicles</title></head><body>
<h1>Alternative Fuel Vehicles</h1>
<p>
<p>
Alternative fuels include ethanol, methanol, natural gas, liquefied 
petroleum
gas, hydrogen, electricity, and any other fuel or energy source that is 
not
produced from petroleum. Alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) can be 
passenger cars
or trucks (light-duty vehicles), heavy-duty trucks, or buses that have 
been
designed or modified to operate on alternative fuels.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
Only 13% market penetration for AFVs in the year 2010 could save 3.5 
quads of
energy by that year. This equals about 15% of the total energy used by 
the
transportation sector or the total amount of energy used by Illinois.<p>
Widespread AFV use will reduce atmospheric pollutants, stimulate job 
creation,
and strengthen domestic energy security.<p>
Federal tests showed that AFVs compare favorably to conventional vehicles 
in
terms of fuel economy and generally produce fewer harmful emissions than
gasoline counterparts.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
About 275,000 AFVs were running on American roads at the end of 1993; 
these are
nearly all federal or private fleet vehicles.<p>
Most AFVs are powered by liquefied petroleum gas, followed by compressed
natural gas, and next, by a blend of 85% gasoline and 15% methanol, also 
known
as M85.<p>
<p>
Through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the federal government is 
leading
the drive to increase the number of AFVs on road.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use</h2>
The federal Energy Information Administration projects that there will be 
2.5
million AFVs on the nation's highways by 2010.<p>
AFV use is continuing to increase; for example, an executive order signed 
by
President Clinton in 1993 requires that 75% of the vehicles acquired by 
the
federal fleet by 1999 be AFVs.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
An important piece of legislation, <b><i>The Alternative Motor Fuels Act 
of
1988</i></b>, is spurring America's adoption of AFVs.<p>
This legislation directed DOE to work with other agencies to promote the
development and widespread use of alternative fuels, thus propelling AFVs

toward commercial application and consumer acceptance.<p>
Another crucial piece of federal legislation, <b><i>The Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990</i></b>, requires modified gasoline content and 
established
stricter emissions regulations for vehicles in designated ozone 
nonattainment
regions of the country.<p>
<p>
<b><i>The Energy Policy Act of 1992</i></b> requires that federal, state, 
and
local governments, alternative fuel providers, and private fleets buy 
AFVs in
increasing percentages over time. This act also includes tax incentives 
for
buying AFVs and developing retail service stations. <p>
<p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
DOE is working on infrastructure development, cost reduction, and vehicle 
range
improvements to achieve consumer acceptance.<p>
<p>
<h2>DOE Projects and Initiatives</h2>
The <b><i>Clean Cities Program</i></b>: Aims to establish a 
self-sustaining AFV
infrastructure by involving federal, state, and local governments; fuel
suppliers; vehicle manufacturers; consumers; fleet managers; utilities; 
and
environmental groups.<p>

The <b><i>California Pilot Program</i></b>: Sets nonmethane hydrocarbon
emission standards for California fleet vehicles beginning in model year 
1996.
California will have to acquire 150,000 "clean" vehicles by that year.<p>

The <b><i>Clean-Fuel Fleet Program</i></b>: Requires one-third of the
acquisitions by centrally fueled fleets to use clean fuels and meet more
stringent tailpipe standards by 1998.<p>
The National Alternative Fuels Hotline/Alternative Fuels Data Center:
Establishes a centralized hotline number for nationwide AFV information
(1-800-423-1DOE).<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Hydrogen</title></head><body>
<h1>Hydrogen Energy</h1><p>
<p>
Hydrogen, as an energy carrier, is anticipated to join electricity to 
become
the foundation for a national sustainable energy system using renewable 
energy.
Hydrogen can be made safe, environmentally friendly, and versatile, and 
it has
many potential energy uses, including powering nonpolluting vehicles, 
heating
homes and offices, and fueling aircraft.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Energy from renewable sources--sunlight, wind, hydropower, and 
biomass--must be
stored and transported so it is available when and where it is needed.
Hydrogen potentially could be produced using renewable sources, then 
stored and
used later in homes, factories, businesses, vehicles, and airplanes.<p>

Hydrogen can be produced from water using electricity, in a process 
called
electrolysis. Production is also possible from direct sunlight acting on 
water
or biological organisms and from organisms that create hydrogen in the 
dark
from carbon monoxide and water.  These processes are all subjects of 
current
research and development programs.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
Most of the domestic hydrogen used today is produced from fossil 
fuels--natural
gas or petroleum derivatives.  The major markets for hydrogen are in the
petrochemical and fertilizer industries.<p>

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration uses hydrogen to propel 
its
space shuttles into orbit and to provide all of the shuttles' electric 
power
from on-board fuel cells.  Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to 
generate
electricity; the fuel cells' exhaust--pure water--is used for drinking 
water by
the crew.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages and Opportunities</h2>
The production of hydrogen from renewable electricity and from biomass 
could
reduce our dependence on imported petroleum.  If the U.S. Department of 
Energy
(DOE) reaches its goal of hydrogen energy providing 10% of the total U.S.

energy consumption by 2025, our dependence on oil imports could be cut in

half.<p>

Hydrogen can be combined with gasoline, ethanol, methanol, or natural 
gas; just
adding 5% hydrogen to the gasoline-air mixture in an internal combustion 
engine
(ICE) could reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 30% to 40%.  An ICE 
converted to
burn pure hydrogen produces only water and minor amounts of nitrogen 
oxides as
exhaust.<p>

California's new "zero-emission" standard for passenger
cars--requiring that 2% of new cars sold in the state be nonpolluting by
1998--could be met by electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells, 
or
hybrids powered by hydrogen-fueled ICEs and batteries or flywheels.
Manufacturing fuel cells to meet the potential demand could add 70,000 
new jobs
to the state.<p>

Hydrogen can be produced from a variety of renewable sources and has many 
uses
in our economy.  Because of the versatility of production methods and end 
use,
wide-spread hydrogen energy use will create significant benefits to the
agricultural, manufacturing, transportation, and service sectors of the 
U.S.
economy.<p>
<p>
<h2>DOE Projects and Initiatives</h2>
Large-scale use of renewable hydrogen energy requires advances in 
production,
storage, and utilization technologies.  Improvements in stationary and 
on-board
hydrogen storage technologies are necessary to meet mass market energy 
demands;
transportation requires special tanks or pipelines; and some advances are 
still
required to make vehicles powered by fuel cells practical.  Research and
development programs encouraged by DOE are concentrating in all of these 
key
areas.<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Renewable Energy: Solar Thermal</title></head><body>
<h1>Renewable Energy: Solar Thermal</h1><p>
<p>
Solar thermal technology converts sunlight into usable forms of heat.  
This
heat can be used directly, for example, in passive solar building design 
and
roof-mounted water heating systems used for residential, commercial, and
industrial applications.  Other solar thermal systems use the captured 
heat to
drive electric generators, producing electricity on a utility scale; 
these are
known as solar thermal electric systems.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Solar thermal technology is diverse.  Small systems can be installed on 
the
roofs of homes to heat water for domestic use.  Moderate-size systems can

supply hot water, steam, and hot air to schools, hospitals, businesses, 
and
industries.  Large solar thermal electric installations can generate
electricity in quantities comparable to those generated in 
intermediate-size
utility generating plants (that is, 100 to 200 megawatts [MW] of
electricity).  The technology can also be used to destroy environmental
contaminants in air, water, and soil.<p>

Among the first mechanical uses of solar thermal energy was a 20 square
meter, parabolic concentrating reflector, steam-driven printing press at 
the
World's Fair in Paris in 1878.<p>

Within 15 years, renewable energy, including solar thermal technologies, 
could
be generating enough electricity to power 40 million homes and to offset 
70
days of oil imports.  This technical potential equates to 42% of the 
number of
homes in the U.S. in 1994.<p>

Solar collectors covering less than half of Nevada could supply all of 
the
United States' energy needs.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
Passive solar buildings are being built today that save as much as 50% on

heating bills for only 1% more in construction costs.<p>

More than 350 MW of solar thermal electric systems have been installed in 
the
United States, enough to serve the residential needs of the city of 
Seattle;
this equals 90% of the world's installed solar capacity.<p>

Solar thermal electric systems operating in the United States today meet 
the
needs of 350,000 people (equal to the population of the city of Miami) 
and
displace the equivalent of 2.3 million barrels of oil annually.<p>

The U.S. has about 400 MW of privately financed solar 
steam-to-electricity
facilities that are interconnected to utility-grade power plants.<p>

More than one-half million solar hot water systems have been installed in 
the
United States, mostly on single-family homes.  The majority of these 
systems
are used to heat swimming pools.<p>

Typically, a homeowner relying on electricity to heat water could save up 
to
$500 in the first year of operation by installing a solar water heating 
system.
The savings over time increases due to increasing electricity rates.  The

average solar heating system pays for itself in 4 to 7 years.<p>

Roof-mounted solar hot water systems are often designed to look like 
skylights,
making them more pleasing in appearance to homeowners and their 
neighbors.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use</h2>
Solar thermal electric capacity is predicted to increase 130% worldwide 
by the
year 2000.<p>

The cost of building, operating, and maintaining solar thermal electric 
systems
has decreased dramatically--in some cases by a factor of ten--during the 
last
decade.  Some designs will be economically competitive with conventional
electricity-generating technologies by the year 2000.<p>

By the middle of the next decade, some solar thermal electric 
technologies
could be producing electricity at $0.06 to $0.07 per kilowatt hour (kWh).

Average electricity prices were $0.08/kWh for residential users and $0.05 
for
industrial users in 1993.<p>

The cost of solar water heating systems declined by 30% between 1980 and 
1990.
Further cost reductions will not be as dramatic, but prices will continue 
to
decrease as demand increases and manufacturers take advantage of 
economies of
scale.<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Renewable Energy: Geothermal
Energy</title></head><body>
<h1>Renewable Energy: Geothermal Energy</h1><p>
<p>
Geothermal energy is renewable heat energy from the Earth.  Geothermal
reservoirs of hot water or steam are tapped with wells, and their heat is

either used directly or converted to electricity.  Geothermal 
applications can
range in scale from small, residential heat pumps to large district 
heating
systems.<p>
<p>
<h2>Geothermal Electric Power: Current and Potential Use</h2>
The 45 geothermal power plants in the United States produce enough 
electricity
to power the homes of more than 3.5 million people--that's about how many

people live in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. <p>

Geothermal power plants are very reliable and require minimal 
maintenance.  The
average geothermal plant operates 95% of the time, compared to 70% to 80% 
for
nuclear and coal-fired plants.<p>

The Geysers, a large steam reservoir north of San Francisco, is the 
largest
source of geothermal power in the world.  California obtains about 7% of 
its
electricity from geothermal power plants.<p>

The total amount of geothermal energy that could be exploited with 
today's
technology is estimated at 27 times more than energy used throughout the 
entire
country each year.  <p>
<p>
<h2>Economic Benefits of Geothermal Electric Power</h2>
Geothermal plants in the United States employ approximately 3700 people, 
with
electricity sales of about $1 billion per year.  A typical large 
geothermal
plant pays as much as $4.2 million annually in local property taxes.<p>

Today's geothermal plants produce power at a cost competitive with 
conventional
energy sources and ranging from $0.03 to $0.075 per kilowatt-hour.<p>

During the next 20 years, foreign countries are expected to spend $25 to
$40 billion constructing geothermal power plants, creating a significant
opportunity for U.S. suppliers of geothermal goods and services.  U.S. 
firms
recently announced contracts totaling approximately $4.5 billion to build

geothermal power plants in Indonesia and the Philippines.<p>

Royalties received by the U.S. government for geothermal leases are more 
than
$30 million annually.<p>
<p>
<h2>Environmental Benefits of Geothermal Electric Power</h2>
Geothermal power plants have very low air emissions.  Producing the same 
amount
of electricity, a typical geothermal power plant would emit no nitrous 
oxides,
only 1% of the sulfur dioxide, and only 5% of the carbon dioxide of a
coal-fired plant.<p>

Some geothermal power plant designs emit no carbon dioxide, which is a
greenhouse gas.  This makes geothermal power an ideal technology for 
helping to
minimize global climate change. <p>

In 1991, California's Lake County, home to many of the power plants at 
The
Geysers, became the first and only county to fully meet California's 
stringent
air quality regulations. Lake County received an award in 1992 and 1993 
for the
county with the cleanest air in California.<p>
<p>
<h2>Direct Use of Geothermal Energy: Current and Potential Use</h2>
Direct uses of geothermal heat include heating buildings and greenhouses,

pasteurizing milk, deicing roads, heating water in fish farms, 
dehydrating
foods, growing mushrooms, secondary oil recovering, and heating leaching
solutions at gold mines.  Such applications currently save the energy
equivalent of 2 million barrels of oil each year.<p>

The known geothermal hot water resources could produce enough energy to 
replace
1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas every year for 30 years.  This is
more than 60 times the amount of natural gas currently used each year.<p>


<h2>Geothermal Heat Pumps</h2>
Geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) use the Earth as a heat source and sink.  
Their
high efficiency can cut annual home heating costs by as much as 50% and 
cut
cooling costs by 25%.  GHPs can be used throughout the country and are 
rapidly
gaining popularity in the Midwest and Northeast.<p>

GHPs are a major component of President Clinton's Climate Change Action 
Plan.
recently announced contracts totGHP installations are projected to exceed 
400,000 annually by the year 2000, up
from 40,000 units per year today. This would avoid the need to construct 
four
medium-size (300-MW) power plants each year.<p>

<h1>Job Creation, Economic Development, and Sustainability</h1><p>
<p>
<h2>Current Benefits</h2>
The <b><i>wind</i></b> energy industry presently supports more than 50
businesses in California; 1200 people are employed directly in these 
businesses
and another 4300 jobs have been created indirectly.  Nearly all jobs are
related to operating, maintaining, and servicing wind turbines.<p>

From <b><i>biomass</i></b> alone, 66,000 jobs are supported in the United

States, with a great many in rural areas.  By 2010, biomass power
could support more than 283,000 U.S. jobs.<p>

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District's (SMUD's) Conservation Power 
Program
has (1) spent $59 million locally on <b><i>energy-efficiency</i></b>
measures, (2) avoided spending $45 million to purchase power from other
regions, (3) increased regional income by $124 million,
(4) created about 880 direct jobs, 250 of which were SMUD employees, and
(5) added $22 million to the wage-earning households in the area.<p>

The Massachusetts State Energy Office reports that the state has realized 
a
257% growth in <b><i>energy-efficiency</i></b> firms (such as energy 
service
companies) between 1988 and 1992.<p>

Fox River Mills of Osage, Iowa, has reduced the energy cost of producing  
a
pair of socks by 29% since 1984.  This cost reduction has contributed to
<b><i>increased productivity</i></b> and increased orders from customers.  
The
mill, which employed 110 workers in 1984, employs 310 people today.  The
plant owners have expanded the size of the plant twice and added another
shift.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Benefits</h2>
On the <b><i>national level</i></b>, a 1992 study cosponsored by the 
Solar
Energy Industries Association, the American Gas Association, and the 
Alliance
to Save Energy conservatively projects 175,000 new jobs by 2010, with an 
energy
scenario emphasizing efficiency improvements, renewables, and strategic 
use of
natural gas.<p>

The value of renewable energy equipment <b><i>exports</i></b> reached 
$245
million in 1992, including $210 million for photovoltaic equipment.  
Near-term
export market expansion of $800 million in sales of renewable energy and 
energy
efficiency equipment would create approximately 29,000 new jobs.<p>

The U.S. employment base would increase by 67,500 jobs annually from the 
years
1991 to 2000 as a result of the <b><i>lighting efficiency</i></b> upgrade 
under
a federal accelerated technology diffusion proposal.  Wage and salary 
income
would grow $1.15 billion annually during the same period.<p>

With an average increase in <b><i>electric motor efficiency</i></b> of 
6%, the
U.S. employment base would increase an average of 9200 jobs per year from 
1991
to 2000.  An associated annual increase in wage and salary income of $190

million would also be realized during this same period. Electric bill 
savings
of approximately $600 million would be realized by the year 2000.<p>

The Wisconsin Energy Bureau recently found that with a 75% increase in 
the
state's <b><i>renewable energy</i></b> use, the state would realize more 
than
62,000 new jobs, $1.2 billion in new wages, and $4.6 billion in new sales 
for
Wisconsin businesses.<p>

By improving automobile and light truck <b><i>fuel economy</i></b> from 
28
miles per gallon (mpg) in 1990 to 40 mpg in 2000, and then to 50 mpg in 
2010,
large numbers of jobs would be created. Under this fuel economy 
improvement
proposal, 72,000 and 244,000 jobs would be created by 2000 and 2010,
respectively.<p>

About 293,000 new jobs could be created by 1995, 471,000 new jobs by 
2000, and
nearly 1.1 million new jobs by 2010 with a major national commitment to
<b><i>energy efficiency</i></b> improvements.  Less than 10% of the new 
jobs
created are associated with direct investment in efficiency measures, 
while
more than 90% are associated with energy savings and the "respending" of 
those
savings.<p>

<h1>Energy Awareness Month<p>
Op-Ed Article</h1><p>
<p>
<h2>Saving Energy in the '90s</h2><p>
<b>by Christine A. Ervin</b><p>
<p>
It has been nearly 20 years since we experienced our last oil shock in 
the
United States. Should we still care about using energy more efficiently, 
and
about making greater use of solar, wind and other types of renewable 
energy?<p>

You bet. Even though no crisis appears to be lurking around the corner, 
there
is more reason than ever for each of us to make our country, our 
community and
our personal lives cleaner, wealthier, healthier and more productive with 
good
energy choices.<p>

Never before have we consumers had so many options for saving energy 
dollars.
Since the last energy crises in the 1970s, America's scientists and
entrepreneurs have developed new generations of products--super-saving
appliances, incredibly efficient lighting, intelligent designs for 
buildings,
clean industrial processes that prevent the generation of wastes, cars 
that
operate on renewable fuels rather than gasoline. <p>

These are no longer the gizmos of the future. Many of the new energy
technologies--ranging from wind machines to passive solar buildings, and 
from
compact fluorescent lights to cars powered by natural gas--are on the 
market
today, providing clean energy at money-saving prices.<p>

Today, wind machines are producing electric power as cheaply as coal or
nuclear power plants in some parts of the United States. In parts of the
Midwest and Northeast, there is enough untapped wind to provide more than

enough electricity for the entire country.<p>

Geothermal heat pumps, which heat and cool buildings using the earth's 
natural
temperatures, are growing in popularity. Passive solar buildings, which 
make
use of sunlight for heat and illumination, continue appearing all around 
the
country. And photovoltaic cells--those wafer-thin devices that power
calculators, watches and satellites--are providing economical electricity 
in all
types of remote applications, from park shelters to highway signs. One 
utility
--the Sacramento Municipal Utility District--is building its next power 
plant on
the roofs of its customers, in the form of house-by-house photovoltaic
panels.<p>

More revolutionary products are on the horizon. At the U.S. Department of

Energy (DOE), to give just two examples, we are researching ways to make
completely recyclable automobiles, cars that get three times more fuel 
mileage
than the models on the road today, and roofing shingles that produce
electricity when exposed to sunlight.<p>

Without a crisis to spur us on, why should we care about improving our 
energy
efficiency and expanding our use of renewable energy systems? There are 
many
reasons.<p>

The money each of us saves on our energy bills is like new tax-free 
income.
That new income not only makes us wealthier, it also creates jobs for 
others as
we spend the money on other goods and services. Studies done for DOE 
indicate
that each dollar invested in energy efficiency creates more employment 
than
dollars spent on many other types of investment, including building new 
power
plants.<p>

Efficiency and renewable energy strengthen the economy in other ways, 
too.
Today, the United States imports nearly 50% of its petroleum from 
elsewhere--
more than during the oil shocks of the 1970s--and the amount is projected 
to
rise to 60% by 2010. Most of our foreign trade deficit is due to these 
imports.
Reducing oil imports lowers the trade deficit, makes our economy 
healthier, and
keeps dollars at home, creating jobs. <p>

Reducing our dependence on imports may also reduce the number of military

conflicts the United States is forced to confront in the future. <p>

By investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy at home, we can 
make
these young U.S. industries stronger and more competitive in the global
marketplace. Today, half the world's people do not have electricity. 
Massive
nations like China and India are undertaking development projects that 
will
open up vast new markets for energy technologies.<p>

By capturing these opportunities, U.S. energy efficiency and renewable 
energy
companies will not only increase America's exports, they'll also help 
make sure
that newly industrializing nations are built upon foundations of clean,
inexhaustible energy supplies.<p>

And that leads to another major benefit:  Energy efficiency and most 
renewable
energy systems prevent pollution and many other types of environmental 
damages.
At home and abroad, they are the key to making economic growth compatible 
with
environmental health.<p>

There have never been more good reasons or more good opportunities for 
each of
us to take advantage of energy efficiency and renewable resources. If you 
want
to learn more about your choices, call DOE's Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable
Energy Clearinghouse at 1-800-363-3732.<p>

2.7.3 --><title>Article: Energy Awareness -- Why Should We
Care?</title></head><body>

<h1>Energy Awareness Month<p>
Op-Ed Article</h1><p>
<p>
<h2>Energy Awareness--Why Should We Care?</h2><p>
<p>
For the fifteenth year in a row, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has
declared that October is Energy Awareness Month.  So what?  Prices seem
reasonable.  There are no gas lines or fuel shortages.  Why should people

care?<p>

The reason is our children, and their children, and the generations that
follow.  The United States and other nations are making decisions today 
that
will affect the global economy and environment for centuries to come.<p>
In 1860, when Abe Lincoln was running for President, the United States 
was
using the equivalent of 111 million barrels of oil annually.  Today, we 
use
that much oil in less than a week. <p>

Last year, we spent $51 billion on imported oil. Oil imports accounted 
for 44%
of our foreign trade deficit.  By the end of this decade, the amount of 
U.S.
dollars leaking away to oil-producing nations overseas is expected to 
grow to
$94 billion.  Today, we spend almost $500 billion annually in the U.S. to 
light
and heat our homes and offices, run our transportation systems, and 
operate our
farms and factories.  Even modest energy savings can produce new tax-free

disposable income for our families, new capital for our businesses, and 
lower
overhead to make our industries more competitive.<p>

But money is not the only reason we should be aware of energy.  The 
production
and consumption of energy causes more environmental damage than any other

single human activity.  To give just one example; the energy that runs 
our
appliances, furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners, and lighting 
produces
two tons of carbon dioxide each year for every man, woman, and child in 
the
United States.<p>

This October, the world stands at a crossroads in regard to energy use 
and, by
extension, the quality of the environment and the quality of life.<p>

During this decade, the United States is expected to spend as much as 
$200
billion on new electric generating capacity.  Worldwide, nations will 
spend an
estimated $1 trillion in the next few years to bring electric power to 
the
billions of people who don't have it.<p>

China and India--the world's two most populous nations--are among the 
many
underdeveloped countries undertaking aggressive economic development 
programs
and planning major investments in energy systems.
<p>
The world investment in energy, with its attendant impact on environment, 
will
keep growing.  Driven by continued population growth and economic 
development,
global energy consumption is expected to increase as much as 50% by the 
year
2010. <p>

The choices we make about where that energy comes from and how it is 
produced
and consumed will affect the world environment for a long, long time to 
come.<p>
That's why DOE established this year's Energy Awareness Month theme as 
"Energy
--Our Future Is Today."  We are indeed deciding our future by the choices 
we make
today.<p>

It's also why DOE is sponsoring a series of town hall meetings around the

country this fall, preparing to write a National Energy Policy Plan for
Congress with "sustainable energy" as its theme. <p>

Sustainable development--meeting the needs of the present without 
compromising
the needs of future generations--is the key to a livable future, and 
energy is
the key to sustainable development.  The United States must lead the 
world in
developing and using energy efficiently, and in making the transition to 
clean,
renewable resources like solar, wind, biomass and geothermal energy.<p>

As Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary puts it, "There has never been a 
greater
opportunity for the United States and other nations around the world to
harmonize the needs of people with the protection of the environment.  If 
we
don't produce and use energy correctly today, we risk damage to our 
environment
tomorrow...The discovery and use of sustainable energy resources advance
economic growth, energy security and environmental health at the same 
time."<p>

As we celebrate Energy Awareness Month, we all can renew our commitment 
to
using energy resources wisely for the generations that will follow.<p>

      The  last,  the  fourth  stage  began  on  6  May  and   was 
characterized by abrupt decrease of the release  rate  because  of 
the undertaken  measures  and  of  formation  of  more  refractory

<H2>Hypertext Data base:<B> Chernobyl and its consequences</B>.(<I>Project "Polyn"</I>).</H2>
<HR>
<H1> NEW DATA ON RADIOACTIVE RELEASE </H1>
<HR>
     The well known <A HREF = "frelleg.gif">picture of dynamics of radionuclide release</A> at 
the Chernobyl accident is the basis for majority of  model 
calculations. In this section the authors would  like  to  present 
the data on radionuclide  composition  of  the  release  from  the 
reactor ruins during two months after the accident, which have not 
been analyzed earlier and considerably  compliment  and  partially 
change the generally accepted picture of the release. 
<P> 
     The aerosol samples for  gamma  spectrometric  analysis  were 
obtained by means of filter  cars  towed  by  <A HREF = "helabove.html">helicopters  of  air 
forces</A> at flights directly over the reactor ruins.  In  the  main, 
the sampling was made at the heights from 300 to 700  m,  and  the 
volume of the air pumped for the samples was several thousands  of 
cubic meters. The data of  gamma  spectrometric  analysis  of  the 
samples are presented  in the form  of  charts  of  volume 
activity.  
<P> 
<IMG SRC  = "frelease.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE>Release of Nuclide. Measurements above reactor.
<P> 
     The data were obtained systematically beginning from  27 
April 1986 and till the end of  June  (one,  more  rarely  several 
measurements per day), but they are insufficient  for  application 
of standard mathematical methods for estimation  of  significance. 
More fine time structure of release intensity than it is shown  in 
the generally <A HREF = "frelleg.gif">accepted model</A>  attracts attention. 
<P> 
     Another new result is the conclusion about  the  presence  of 
high-power radionuclide releases outside the limits  of  ten  days 
after 26 April, whereas the active stage terminates in ten days in 
the generally  accepted  model  <A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A>.  For  instance,  there  is a 
peak in 20-21 days after the beginning of the accident, and a less 
pronounced peak in the region of 25-30 days. 
<P> 
     The estimation of significance of new data was  performed  in 
several ways. At first they were checked  by  comparing  with  the 
results  of  independent  sufficiently  reliable  measurements  of 
radionuclide activity in the air of <B>Kiev</B> and <B>Vilnus</B>.  There  is  a 
considerable set of estimated data on measurements  of  <A HREF = "ikiev.gif">iodine-131 
concentration in the air of Kiev</A> ( 140 km to the  south  from  the 
Chernobyl NPP) during May-June 1986 <A HREF = "sources.html#8">[8]</A>. If we match  the 
data on iodine-131 concentration over the ruins 
in  the  same  time  scale,  then  one  can  see  noticeable  time 
correlation in activity peaks even without attraction  of  weather 
data and transport models. 
<P> 
     The analysis of the measurement data  of  <cs-vil.gif">Ru-103  and  Cs-137 
</A>activity over the reactor and  in the air of the near-ground layer 
in Vilnus <A HREF = "sources.html#7">[7]</A> and in Berezino biosphere reserve <A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14]</A>  also  showed 
time correlations with the shift of 1-2 days  noticeable  increase 
of activity on 16-20 May is seen in  all  charts.  The  book  <A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14]</A> 
indicates that "the measurements at large distances  indicate  the 
release of radioactive products (mainly of Cs-137) continuing up to 
25 May 1986, which was obviously attributed to new local  releases 
from the mostly heated zones of the reactor." 
<P> 
     Correlations  and  ratios  of  activities  of  characteristic 
radio nuclides in samples served from the very beginning  as  basic 
bench marks both for identification of the samples proper, and for 
reconstruction  of  the  values  measured  more  difficulty,  for 
instance, of the levels of plutonium isotopes. It  is  interesting 
to consider correlations for cesium-134 and  cesium-137  isotopes, 
which should vary in  rather  narrow  limits,  if  the  considered 
measurements were performed correctly. The range of the values  of 
the ratio    Cs134/Cs137 for fuel assemblies with different level  of 
burn-up at the moment  of the accident varied from 0.4 to 0.7 with 
the average 0.52-0.54.  
<P> 
<IMG SRC  = "cscs.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE>
<P> 
This picture presents these ratios obtained  from 
the results of measurements of wair samples over the  reactor,  and 
the difference of the values is whithin - 15%. 
<P> 
<IMG SRC  = "zrnb.gif">
<P> 
     It is  revealing  that  the  ratio  of   Nb-95  and  Zr-95 
activities, which  are  rather  close  in  physical  and  chemical 
properties, remains constant, at least within 30%.  The 
ratio of activities of these radio nuclides  with  Ce-144  is  also 
stable. The dynamic picture of the  release  of  these  relatively 
refractory radionuclides strongly connected with the  fuel  matrix 
is quite homogeneous, and in the whole repeats the picture of <A HREF = "frelease.gif">full release</A> for volatile radio nuclides. As for the ratio  of  plutonium  and 
Ce-144 activities in samples of air and soil, which was the  basis 
for reconstruction  of  the  amount  of  released  plutonium  and,

<B>FOREWORD</B>
<P>
Several years after the Three Mile Island accident, in the United
States, the Chernobyl accident completely changed the public's
perception of nuclear risk. While the first accident provided
the impetus to develop new research programmes on nuclear safety,
the second, with its human death toll and the dispersion of a
large part of the reactor core into the environment, raised a
large number of problems of &quot;management&quot; not only for
the treatment of severely exposed persons, but also for the decisions
that had to be taken affecting the population. Clearly, the national
authorities were not ready to manage an accident whose consequences
were not confined to their territory.
<P>
The way the accident was managed and the lack of information provoked
a feeling of distrust in the minds of the public that was reinforced
by the fact that radiation cannot be perceived by humans and also
that it is easily detected even at a very low level. The prospect
of contaminated food, aggravated by ambiguous, even contradictory
recommendations by national authorities, gave rise to a variety
of reactions, and sometimes overreactions, in the management of
the accident consequences in several European countries.
<P>
In the country of the accident itself, where political, social
and economic conditions were worsening, the association of the
Soviet regime with nuclear activities contributed to raise feelings
of mistrust towards the public authorities. 
<P>
Ten years later, many improvements in radiation protection and
emergency preparedness have been made possible by the Chernobyl
experience and we are also able to arrive at a more accurate assessment
of the impact of this accident. The fact remains that the future
consequences in terms of health effects remain imprecise for simple
technical reasons, and, because of this, lend themselves to a
competition between those who want to minimise the consequences
of the accident and those who wish to promote a catastrophic assessment.
<P>
In these circumstances, having discussed in 1994 the question
of the future of radiation protection with the dawning of the
next millenium <I>(NE94)</I>, the NEA Committee on Radiation Protection
and Public Health (CRPPH) wished to make an honest assessment,
ten years on of the accident, on the state of the contaminated
territories and the state of health of the populations and, on
this basis, to attempt an appreciation of the risks to be expected
not only for man but also for his environment.
<P>
This review does not end there. The CRPPH also details the lessons
that have been learned by Member countries and the international
organisations such as the ICRP, the IAEA, the EC, the WHO, etc.
It has also organised international emergency exercises, the INEX
Programme. Information between States and the public has been
considerably expanded.
<P>
The accident was followed by numerous assistance and research
programmes supported by international organisations and bilateral
agreements. All these organisations are or will be publishing
their results. This report differs from those in that it is a
synthetic consensus view aimed at those persons who wish to know
the salient points without having to go into the technical details
which one can find elsewhere.
<P>
We thank all those organisations (UNSCEAR, FAO, WHO, EC) which
have put information at our disposal so that this report could
be as up to date as possible. However, those Agencies are still
generating a large amount of information to be submitted to the
forthcoming international Conference &quot;One Decade After Chernobyl&quot;
to be held in April 1996, some of which could not be made available
in time for incorporation into this report.
<P>
The report was drafted by Dr. Peter Waight (Canada) under the
direction of an editing committee chaired by Dr. Henri M&eacute;tivier
(France). The members of the Editing Committee were:

<TITLE>RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY</TITLE><H3>RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY</H3>
       
<H2> Renewables Savaged</H2>
<STRONG>"We consider that it is very doubtful that the relatively modest increases in new electricity generation justify the large sums spent"</STRONG>.  

So said the all-party House of Commons Public Accounts Committee in its report on the UK Renewable Energy Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) programme, on which &pound;340m has been spent so far.
The Committee were clearly unimpressed by the prospects for renewables - despite the Department of Trade and Industries stalwart defence.  The DTI pointed out that given the support of the NFFO subsidy new renewables should provide 1,500 megawatts of capacity by 2000, this, on top of existing renewable capacity, amounts to a 5% contribution to UK electricity supply.  That, in turn, would mean a saving of 3 million tonnes of carbon emission - useful in the fight against global warming.  And by the year 2025 the contribution could rise to 20% of UK electricity; renewables thereby continuing to play their part in meeting the UK's committment to climate protection, as well as providing a valuable element of diversity of supply.
<STRONG>The Public Accounts Committe</STRONG>e was, however, unmoved:  its main concern was the cost and short term 'value for money'.  Following very much the same line as in the earlier National Audit Office report (see Renew 89), they were sharply critical of the fact that &pound;54 million had been spent on wind power, but with the bulk of this being focussed on one large 3MW machine, and one vertical axis prototype, neither of which were now seen as relevant, since smaller conventional machines had proved to be the most commercially popular.  Worse still, 84% of the machines now in operation in the UK were imported - and were getting subsidies, via the NFFO, from consumers.
Similarly the Committee was unhappy that &pound;40m was spent on a, now abandoned, hot dry rock geothermal test well.<P>
The Committee clearly had it in for renewables: they seemed convinced that they were irrelevant and seized on every problem as further proof.  Thus the fact that around half of the projects so far supported by the NFFO had been delayed or halted by planning objections was seen as very significant - even though the DTI's Godfrey Bevan managed to point out during the hearings that the 200MW or so of capacity lost due to the withdrawal of projects supported by NFFO-1 and 2 would be 'offered again during future rounds of the NFFO' so that 'it is not a permanent impediment to the development of 1,500 megawatts'.
The DTI is more usually involved in defending its renewable programme from those of us who would like to see much more being done. Facing the Public Accounts Committee it was, however, forced to almost play it down. Thus on wave power the DTI representative, Sir Peter Gregson, depicted it as now only 'a very modest programme' looking at  shore line options, which was in any case being wound up, at a cost of only &pound;0.21 million; with just the 'quite small' Islay device being involved.<P>
The DTI was hamstrung in its defence of renewables primarily because it couldn't argue the case for expansion effectively. As we have pointed out relentlessly (most recently in Renew 90), the real problem with the UK's programme so far was that it was too small and short term to develop all the options properly. The DTI has increasingly adopted a short term approach, focussing on the near-market options, i.e. those that could be commercially viable without the NFFO by 2005 (which seems to be the new target), at the expense of the generally larger scale longer term big resource (e.g. offshore wind). So inevitably the programme looks marginal.
All the DTI would say, rather apologetically, was that the RD & D investment so far allocated ought to pay off in the future, but that it was cutting back on RD & D in future. Not a very robust defence .... But given the hostile tone of the Public Accounts Committee you can see why Energy Paper 62 had announced a 20% RD & D cut back and was desperately trying to shift everything onto a commercial basis, with just the NFFO, and hopefully European money, to keep it going.<P>
What is perhaps a little strange is that the Public Accounts Committee is an all-party Committee. One might expect hostility to renewables from Tory backbenchers concerned about 'wasted millions', but surely the opposition party members could have introduced more vision into the review. 
All we got was negative short termism, coupled with just a slight dig at the comparative level of nuclear spending, and at the location of ETSU within the Atomic Energy Authority, plus some resentment at the UK's failure to attract sufficient EC funds. The absence of any longer term strategic thinking does not bode very well for the future, if and when a Labour administration comes to power...
The Renewable Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Programme', Committee of Public Accounts. Session 1993-94 Forty-Second Report (11 July) is available from HMSO for &pound;8.95. 



<H4>AIEP Response</H4>
The Public Accounts Committee report received quite a lot of press coverage  and in a press release produced in response, the Association of Independent Electricity Producers (AIEP) saw the report as 'confusing and misinterpreted' in that it focussed on Government R & D spending from 1975 to 1993, but took less account of what had happened since.  In the earlier phase, evidently seen as the 'bad old days' by the AIEP, publicly funded R & D dominated, and although a risk of failure was inevitable and to be expected for all R & D, the AIEP felt that 'Governments are not good at picking winners'.  So the Committee was 'absolutely right to question the way that money was spent in the past'.
However according to the AIEP things have now changed, and a more commercial approach had been adopted with a small part of the NFFO levy being used to subsidise projects 'which not only work, but are the product of billions of pounds of private investment'.  True some projects had not gone ahead.  But that was mainly due to planning problems and the fact that the NFFO arrangements were 'complicated and had at times been unpredictable'.  Nevertheless, overall privatisation had been beneficial and competition was now identifying viable projects and forcing prices down. So, as far as the AIEP is concerned, the DTI had now got it right ...
But if further R & D was to be supported the AIEP felt that its members should advise the DTI on how 'to focus the use of its resources'.
The AIEP put the same line on the horrors of direct Government subsidies versus the merits of market enablement strategies, in its evidence to the Governments Nuclear Review.  
It said it  ' regards a process of support which eneables projects to be developed and operated in a demonstration market environment as offering better value for money than direct Government funding of research and devlopemnt of particular technologies.'
This seems a little shorsighted. Surely the AIEP will want to make use of more advanced renewable systems in future- and it seems unlikely that the private sector will fund the necessary R&D. 
It may be, as the DTI argued in Energy Paper 62, that  BIG STIG biomass  fired gas turbines and the like are  now just about ready for 'demonstration' , but they, and certainly the next wave of renewable technologies like wavepower and tidal stream systems,  are still some way from the market.<P> 
  
NATTA produced its own response to the Public Accounts Committee report taking a longer term view : <CITE>see Renew 92  for the full text.</CITE>
<H4>Technology Foresight</H4>
As the Public Accounts Committee noted the UK Government has not so far been conspicuously successful at 'picking  technological winners'. However, as we noted in Renew 87, a  new attempt  to improve on the process of picking winners was initiated in 1993, when the Governments Office of Science and Technology announced that it was going to introduce a new `Technology Foresight' scheme, designed to look 20 years ahead in selected fields, so as to provide guidance on future R & D priorities. Fifteen Sector Panels were set up bringing together a wide range of expertise from the civil service, industry  and academia.<P> 
In addition to Godfrey Bevan from the DTI, the Energy panel  includes several people known for their support of renewables  such as Dr Mary Archer from the  National Energy Foundation and the Solar Energy Association, Prof Bob Hill from Northumbria Universities Photovoltic Solar Centre, and Dr Gordon McKerron  from the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex. 
The next stage in the process is the production preliminary conclusions, for  discussion,  early  next year. 


<H4>DTI cuts Renewables 
by 73%</H4>
The Department of Trade and Industry has announced some significant changes in the way official figures for energy resources and usage are to be presented in future, e.g. in the annual 'Energy Trends' and statistical digest booklets. The result is that the renewable contribution will be significantly undervalued.
These statistical charges may sound trivial at first glance:  following a consultation exercise the UK will now use 'million tonnes of oil equivalent' (mtoe) in line with much European practice, instead of 'kilowatt hours' (kWh) or 'gigajoules' or therms.  That's a little annoying since 'kWh's are more familiar to most people - being the unit electricity (and now gas) is sold by. But from now on its 'toe's' (=11,630kWh) and its multiples.
Much more significantly however, electricity use figures will be presented in 'energy supplied' terms, rather than in 'substitution' terms. 
Under the UK's old substitution approach, the figures for electricity supplied, whatever the fuel actually used, were converted to the equivalent fossil fuel energy imput,in reality mostly coal, that would be required to generate it, via a conventional thermal plant.
That gave a useful picture of the 'primary' input fuel use - reminding us that thermal conversion systems had huge losses, up to 70% or more, 
The familiar unit was 'million tonnes of coal equivalent'. Even though nearly 70% of our electricity still comes from coal it is understandable politically why the DTI has shifted to 'million tonnes of oil equivalent'.  But the shift to presenting it on a energy supplied basis, i.e. in terms of the energy content of the electricity produced, rather than primary energy input on a substitution basis,  has major repercussions.
Firstly, for both schemes, a standard 'energy conversion' efficiency factor has to be assumed:  in line with international practice 36% was selected for the new 'energy supplied' scheme (this in fact being the figure for the UK's nuclear plants) instead of 34%, the figure used in the UK's old substitution approach (this being the figure for fossil fuel plants).  
The result is that the new statistics will show the nuclear contribution as 5% higher.
At the same time, and here is where it really starts to have an impact, under the new scheme, the contribution of hydro and windpower is reduced by 73% from 1.4 mtoe on a substitution basis to 0.4 mtoe on an energy supplied basis.  

<H4>Other changes 
at the DTI</H4>
There has also been a minor organisational reshuffle within the Department of Trade and Industry.
While Tim Eggar MP retains overall ministerial responsibility for energy, Ian Taylor MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Technology, now has responsibility for, amongst other things, 'Environmental and Energy Technologies', including renewables.  It is unclear whether this amounts to a demotion of renewables. But certainly the Treasury seems keen on cutbacks. According to the Guardian (1/8/94) it wants 'all state R&D spending on non-nuclear energy technologies, including coal, renewables and North Sea oil'   axed.  As far as renewables go, Energy Paper 62's 20% cut would thus just be a start.<P> 

That's not a misprint - it's 73% less.  A fine example of shifting the goal posts!  Basically the 73% or so of waste heat produced by fossil and nuclear plants has been cleverly disguised so that renewables look much worse by comparison, 73% worse!<P>
Fortunately the UK statistics will also be presented in substitution terms for references, since it was argued, by objectors during the consultation process, that this conveyed valuable information about the amount of fossil fuel use replaced by nuclear, hydro and other renewables.  And it's only for primary input energy - not end use or delivered energy. But the new primary 'energy supplied' figures are likely to be widely used in policy debates - thus, in effect, seriously under representing the renewable contribution.  The new system will bring the UK into line with European practice, but it is rather strange that what we seem to be seeing is a shift from a measure which gives an indication of the degree of success we are having in substituting renewables for fossil and nuclear fuel, to a system which is only concerned with the saleable end product, i.e. electricity, regardless of where it came from.  Market forces rule OK?

<H4>New DTI Energy Overview</H4>
<STRONG>Wave, Tidal and even Offshore wind are once again savaged in a new report from the Governments Department of Trade and Industry.</STRONG>

Hot on the heals of the DTI's Energy Paper 62 and ETSU's R82 on Renewable Energy (see Renew 90), the Department of Trade and Industry published Energy Paper 61 'Energy Technologies for the UK'.
As EP62 and R82 made clear, they were the renewable energy part of a larger study of all the UK's energy options.  EP61 presents the conclusions, with much of the detail being in a back up ETSU report R83.
It's an ambitious project, looking at future prospects to 2025, environmental impacts R&D options (or rather RDD&D - Research Development Demonstration and Dissemination) all based on a range of energy supply/demand scenarios including a 'heightened environmental concern' scenario.
However EP61 notes that, since energy conservation was now the responsibility of the Department of Environment 'it would not be appropriate for the demand side to be included' in the RDD&D appraisals.
EP61 classifies the technologies under four main headings - robust, vulnerable, fragile and unpromising, depending on how well they do in the various scenarios.  
Unsurprisingly, given the EP62/R82 reviews, tidal barrages, offshore wave, geothermal aquifers and hot dry rocks come under the last category, i.e. unpromising.
But, more surprisingly, so does offshore wind.
Hydrogen production by electrolysis , hydrogen   use in internal combustion engines, and fuel cells for large scale generation are also dumped in this category - which also contains nuclear fusion! All of which offer 'no contribution on any scenario/discount rate'  except perhaps under an environmentally constrained future.<P>
The robust technologies, include, of course, gas cooled nuclear reactors and PWR's, combined cycle gas turbines, CHP, pumped storage and hydro - along with passive solar design!  They allegedly offer a potential contribution under all scenarios, and at all discount rates.<P>
The vulnerable technologies include wind power and municipal solid waste in the short term, hydrogen from biomass and photovoltaics in the medium term, these possibly offer a potential in three or more scenario, regardless of discount rate.<P>
The fragile technologies, which offer contributions under only one scenario, regardless of discount rate, include landfill gas, agricultural waste as fuel and shore line wave power in the short term, energy crops in the medium term and biodiesel in the long term.<P>

EP61 then looks at the implications for RDD&D on the basis of a 'risk versus payback' assessment.  It reports that the bulk (55%) of the 1992/3 RDD&D expenditure (both public and private) was in the high risk/low payback zone and comments that 'plans have already been announced to curtail some of these programmes' ,  quoting fast reactors, tidal and geothermal HDR as examples. These they say accounted for 75% of the high risk/low payback expenditure in 1992/93.<P>
Offshore wave was also in the same category.  As noted earlier shoreline wave just about scrapes in, and wind, passive solar, land fill gas and photovoltaics are seen as reasonable bets.  But of the renewables, only hydro, agricultural wastes and energy crops get the top billing in risk/benefit terms - along strangely with active solar, although it is indicated that the likely 'limited take up' of some of the renewables meant that the scale of expenditure and hence the risk was low.<P>
EP61 costs of &pound;15.92 from HMSO.  The back up ETSU report R83 comes in 7 volumes.  Volume 1 is on fossil fuel technologies, Vol 2 on nuclear, Vol 4 on transmission, including hydrogen, Vols 5, 6 and 7 cover Energy Efficiency in (respectively) buildings, industry and transport and Vol 8 is on methodology.  Vol 3 is actually R82, on renewables.


<H4>Planning  Renewables</H4>
The UK's planning system is gradually adapting to renewables - the rather open ended 'Planning Policy Guideline 22' has been added to by various ministerial statememnts and adjustments, designed to help planners in the difficult process of balancing local and national/global environmental concerns.  Energy Minister Tim Eggar has already indicated that holding an NFFO contract did not over-rule local planning objections.<P>  
Next, it was decided that wind farm proposals could henceforth be required to submit detailed, formal environmental impact assessment, if they feel it could have a significant effect on an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Park, SSI, Heritage Coast, or if the wind farm consisted of more than 10 turbines, or had a total capacity of more than 5 Mega watts.<P>
In parallel, local planners are increasingly now able to draw on more detailed assessments of local and regional renewable resources.
In the past it was often difficult for planners faced with a specific proposal for a renewable project, to assess its worth in relation to other possible projects in the area.  Now around 50% of local councils in England and Wales have developed or are in the process of developing renewable energy policies in their development plans, which usually include a detailed assessment of the local renewable resource.<P>
The pioneering regional studies, like those carried out by SWEB and NORWEB, have been followed by more detailed local studies.
Lancashire County Council has been a pioneer in this respect:  it has identified zones suited to wind farm deployment, covering 9% of its area, with AONB's etc. being protected.<P>
In addition, as we noted in Renew 90, there have been planning studies for the counties of Devon and Durham and studies on Cornwall, Cumbria and Gwynedd will be published shortly.<P>
A Regional Planning Study covering the Berks, Oxfordshire, Hampshire, Wilts, Dorset and Isle of Wight area has been initiated, along with a South Wales study looking in detail at landscape issues.<P>
Studies by the East Midlands, South East Counties, Yorkshire and South Pennines are also planned.<P>
The Devon study is being followed up by a detailed local study of the renewable potential of the green around Hatherleigh. 	Some of these developments were discussed at a one day seminar back in May, held in Newcastle upon Tyne, and organised for the Northern Branch of the Royal Town Planning Institute :   local contact Angela Hull at Newcastle University.
 
<H4>Diversity?  Renewables have it</H4>
Investments in renewable electricity supply options offers a significantly more efficient means to foster system diversity than continued support for nuclear power'.   So said Andrew Stirling from SPRU in Energy Policy (March 1994).
His analysis of diversity is very timely:  so far it has been used to justify a significant nuclear contribution - nuclear being seen as the main non-fossil option.<P> 
Clearly the UK's traditional fuel mix, heavily biased towards coal, is already on the way out, with gas taking a large share of electricity supply;, for example Energy Paper 59 saw gas rising to a 57% share while coal falls back to 27% by 2020 (see Renew 81).  But EP59 also saw the nuclear contribution falling to 1% - i.e. essentially just Sizewell B - at least on a 'hands off' business as usual free market scenario, with renewables expanding to 3%, 4% if hydro was included.<P>
Stirling goes further, and suggests that optimal diversity, providing a robust flexible balance of sources, would involve a much larger renewable contribution - 17-18% from firm renewables, 13-14% from intermittent renewables, with nuclear charitably, given between a 3 and 14% stake. 
It's a complex analysis, we've not done justice to it in this brief account:  
but the implications are clear, even leaving aside issues like strategic flexibility, environmental impact and public acceptability, renewables look very good at providing a diverse range of inputs.<p>

<P><H2><A NAME = "juice">Fruit Juice Adulteration : New Detection Methods Announced</A></H2></P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="fruit.gif">As one of the leading centres in the world for the authentication of fruit juice and fruit products, RSSL is continually examining new methods and procedures which could be used to detect adulteration.  As part of this investigation RSSL recently invited Professor Nick Low from the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, to spend part of  his sabbatical year at its Research Centre in Reading.   To coincide with his stay, 55 guests from the food industry attended a special seminar to review new areas of interest in the detection of juice adulteration.</P>

<P>Over the last 15 years there have been ongoing problems associated with both the misrepresentation and adulteration of juices.  Dr Roger Evans, RSSL&#39;s Science Director discussed the ways in which juices are routinely adulterated by the addition of sugar, other cheaper juices, pulpwash, second extracts of fruit (particularly in the case of citrus juices) and misrepresented as being natural juice when in fact they have been derived from concentrates.  </P>

<P>Recent work by Professor Low at RSSL on oligosaccharide fingerprinting has enabled the detection of a new form of adulteration i.e. the addition of high fructose syrups derived from inulin.  The technique used by Professor Low is a highly sensitive capillary gas chromatography procedure.  </P>

<P>Dr David Hammond described the use of a phenolic marker called phlorin to detect the addition of peel extract and pulpwash and the use of HPAEC-PAD chromatography to isolate oligogalacturonide fragments from adulterated juices.  The final speaker of the day, Dr Andrew Lea, showed how phenolic marker compounds like phloridzin and arbutin could pinpoint adulteration of citrus, soft fruit juices and pures with cheaper apple and pear juices and how the use of carotenoid screening could be used to characterise particular citrus juices.</P>

<P>For a profile of Professor Nick Low see the following story in this issue of Contract.  For further information about any authenticity issues contact Dr David Hammond at RSSL or call the Customer Service Desk freefone on 0800 243482.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME = "low">Visiting Worker : Nicholas Low</A></H2></P>

<P>	Adulteration of foods is not a new problem.  In the early 1800s unscrupulous tea traders would treat used tea leaves with black lead to restore the colour in order to resell the leaves as &#39;fresh&#39;.  Similar situations occurred with other foods which were of poor quality or spoiled. </P>

<P>In recent years, adulteration of foods rich in carbohydrate, such as citrus and apple juices,  honey and maple syrup, has become a significant problem for the food industry.  Of particular importance to reputable food producers and processors is the undeclared addition of inexpensive sweeteners / syrups to high carbohydrate foods.  Considering that the price of frozen concentrated orange juice is around $3.08/kg solids and that of sugar syrups is $0.75/kg solids, it is easy to see the economic attraction for adulteration.  </P>

<P>Low cost sweeteners include sucrose and invert sugar and syrups with varying levels of glucose, fructose and sucrose derived from beet or cane sugar by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis.  High fructose syrups, manufactured from raw materials like Jerusalem artichoke, chicory, corn, potato, cassava or palm can also be used.   Acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of starch (a glucose polymer) or inulin (a fructose polymer) is sometimes involved.</P>

<P>Carbohydrates comprising two to ten monomeric units are called oligosaccharides.  These can arise by the transglycosylation action of hydrolase enzymes in the food itself, or by the use of hydrolase enzyme in sweetener / syrup production.  For instance, glucosidase is present in the honey sac of bees; amylase / glucoamylase is used in high fructose syrup production.  Oligosaccharides can also form chemically by reversion reactions from the action of acid on sucrose, fructose and glucose.   Therefore commercial conditions used to produce total invert sugar can result in the formation of oligosaccharides.  It is the differences between the natural oligosaccharide patterns or &#39;fingerprints&#39; of the pure foods and the inexpensive sweeteners/syrups which can allow detection of the fraudulent addition of such materials.</P>

<P>Oligosaccharide analysis of foods is accomplished by high performance anion exchange liquid chromatography (HPAE), capillary gas chromatography (CGC) or capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE).  Although these oligosaccharides make up only a fraction (0.1 - 0.001%) of the total carbohydrate content of foods they can be &#39;seen&#39; by pulsed amperometric / flame ionization detectors or by UV/fluorescence.</P>

<P>Nick Low was born in the UK and moved to Canada at the age of eight.  He has a Chemistry Degree from the Simon Fraser University, an MSc in Nucleic Acid Chemistry from the University of Alberta and a PhD in Food Chemistry, also from Alberta.  In 1987 he joined the Department of Applied Microbiology and Food Science of the University of Saskatchewan, and was appointed Professor of Food Chemistry in 1994. His career has encompassed a wide area of research including food authenticity, enzymatic synthesis of complex carbohydrates, chlorophyll and its relationship to edible oil stability, nutraceuticals and the instrumental analysis of foods.  In 1990, Professor Low was invited to spend nine months at the European Community Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy,  training European scientists in the use of oligosaccharide fingerprinting for fruit juice authentication and he is currently on sabbatical leave at RSSL where he has been investigating the adulteration of fruit juices with high fructose syrups derived from inulin.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME = "portuguese">The Portuguese Connection</A></H2></P>

<P>RSSL regularly provides work experience for students as part of HND/MSc degree courses.  Of particular interest is our link with the Escola Superior de Biotechnologia which is part of the University of Catolica in Porto, Portugal.  We have taken students on placement as part of their course in Chemical Analysis and some of them have returned as permanent members of staff on completion of their courses.</P>

<P>Our photo shows Susana Guedes who originally joined on a six month placement in RSSL&#39;s Product Chemistry section and Patrica Correia who originally carried out a six-month placement in Beverage Research and is currently working on a MAFF project.  Rodolfo Rosa and Joana Azvedo are currently in the middle of six-month placements in Pharmaceutical Analysis and Lipid Chemistry,  respectively.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME = "taints">Taints and Off Flavours</A></H2></P>

<P>The sources of taints and off-flavours in foodstuffs are manifold and the range and type of products affected equally varied.  During 1995, the Flavour and Trace Analysis Laboratory at RSSL investigated over 100 individual cases of taint in foods as diverse as dairy products, confectionery, snack foods, baked goods, distilled beverages and soft drinks.</P>

<P>A prominent feature of the casework during this period was the high incidence of taints in dairy products.  Many of the cases involved contamination of raw and processed milks with a disinfectant-like taint.  The taint was invariably caused by the presence of either chlorophenols or chlorocresol.  However, the source of these tainting species differed in each case.  In one example a disinfectant like taint in milk from a large dairy was found to be caused by the presence of low levels of 6-orthochlorocresol, an extremely powerful taint with a taste threshold of 0.05 ppb.  The taint was found not to originate in the dairy but was traced to milk from a specific farm and thence to a particular batch of animal feed used on the farm.</P>

<P>Another example of taint in a dairy product was a natural style yoghurt that developed an objectionable goaty / sweaty and farmyard / faecal odour.  The presence of skatole, indole and paracresol in the yoghurt was found to be responsible for the faecal / farmyard component of the taint whereas elevated levels of branched chain volatile fatty acids was responsible for the goaty / sweaty odour.  On-going microbiological activity in the yoghurt was the source of the tainting chemicals.</P>

<P>A different dairy product, cheddar cheese, was found to possess a strong petroleum / kerosene like aroma and taste.  Flavour analysis failed to identify any of the components typically found in commercial petrochemical fractions.  However, careful analysis for volatile hydrocarbons identified cis- and trans-1,3-pentadiene in the cheese. Trans-1,3-pentadiene has a bp of 42% and possesses a distinct paraffin / kerosene aroma and taste.  It was generated in the cheese via degradation of potassium sorbate.</P>

<P><H2><A NAME = "preservative">Preservative Efficacy Testing</A></H2></P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="packaging200.gif">If a pharmaceutical preparation or healthcare product does not itself have adequate antimicrobial activity, preservatives may be added to prevent proliferation or to limit microbiological contamination.  Unpreserved aqueous preparations and multidose containers are particularly susceptible to microbial spoilage and could present a health hazard to a patient or consumer.  In order to reduce the risk of both spoilage and microbial hazards, preservatives are added to a wide variety of preparations from nasal sprays to toothpaste.  It is important to assess the effectiveness of the preservative(s) in production batches of the preparations or products.</P>

<P>RSSL&#39;s Microbiology laboratory carries out Preservative Efficacy Testing to both the British and European Pharmacopoeia methods.  The Preservative Efficacy Test involves challenging the preparation or product with a prescribed inoculum of micro-organisms (105 to 106 per g or per ml), storing the product at a prescribed temperature, withdrawing samples at specified time intervals and counting the micro-organisms in the withdrawn samples.  The prescribed organisms include the fungus Aspergillus niger, the yeast Candida albicans and the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.  In addition, Escherichia coli is included for all oral preparations and the osmotolerant yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii for those oral preparations containing a high concentration of sugar.</P>

<P>Some of our clients also include factory spoilage isolates in addition to the prescribed organisms.  The criteria for the evaluation of antimicrobial activity are given in the terms of log reduction in the number of micro-organisms from the original inoculum level and vary for the type of preparation under test.  The test result is given as a pass or fail.  RSSL will shortly be applying to NAMAS for an extension to its accreditation scope to include both Preservative Efficacy and Microbial Limit Tests.  This work can also be carried out according to GLP with raw data being archived with the client.  </P>

<P><H2><A NAME = "glp">Good Laboratory Practice</A></H2></P>

<P>GLP was originally introduced to ensure the quality and integrity of safety data generated in non-clinical laboratory studies in selected industry sectors.  The scope has since been extended to cover a broad range of scientific work from classical toxicology and pharmaceuticals to environmental studies and the generation of safety data for any &#39;new chemical substance&#39;.</P>

<P>RSSL has an extremely wide range of test methods accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service through NAMAS, and although some of these test methods relate directly to the Pharmaceutical / Healthcare industry, often clients require that work is carried out to GLP standards.  RSSL has extended its Quality System to incorporate the additional procedures that are specific to GLP (e.g. Study Plan, Study Director, Master Schedule).  These procedures are used most frequently by RSSL&#39;s Pharmaceutical laboratory.  However, other laboratories are also proficient in their use, thus ensuring that any work required to this standard is fully GLP compliant.</P>

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>




<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="fruit.gif" alt=fruit align=bottom>
The authenticity of foods is a major issue for the industry. There is always a profit incentive for expensive commodities to be extended by the addition of cheaper ingredients, and such adulteration is becoming increasingly sophisticated. RSSL is acknowledged world-wide for its services in fruit juice authenticity. The full service involves tests of over 15 key parameters which enables our expert analysts to determine both the purity of a juice and its country of origin. These tests can be applied to a number of juices, and fruit products. </P>

<BR><BR><BR>
<P><IMG SRC="juice200.gif" alt="trace" align=bottom></P>
<P>
RSSL also has authenticity services for oils and fats. Certain oils are traded at a premium because of their alleged quality and/or health properties, and again, adulteration with cheaper oils is a potential problem. RSSL's services can check the purity, quality, safety and properties of all these products.</P>



<P>Other authenticity services are available for coffee, fish, pasta, rice, meat, wines, and honey.</P>

<P>Similar techniques may also be applied in the area of compositional / nutritional analysis, and these are frequently necessary both for accurate labelling and in the detection of counterfeit products, especially perfumes and premium spirits.</P>

These methods may be used to compare one product against its competitors, and further, to understand the factors that drive consumer preference for one product over another. This enables companies to reformulate products having due regard for those characterisitics that will make the product preferred by a majority of consumers.</P>

<P>Sensory evaluation is also used in <A HREF=taint.html>taint and off-flavour</A> investigations giving analysts the vital first clues that allow them to direct chemical investigations at the most likely cause of the problem.</P>

<H1>Taints and off-flavours</H1>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>


<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="sniff200.gif" alt=sniff test align=bottom>Taints and off-flavours (and off odours) are a growing problem for the food, drink and cosmetic industries. The problem can occur from a variety of sources, including packaging migration, environmental pollutants, microbial spoilage, process problems, factory paints, cleaning solvents. Trace levels of a contaminant can affect many tonnes of production so it is vital that the contaminant and its source are identified as quickly as possible. </P>

<P>RSSL has particular expertise in this field and has helped many many companies over the years to resolve specific problems. Using <A HREF="sensory.html">sensory evaluation</A> techniques, followed by sophisticated chemical extraction and identification procedures, RSSL can identify the most potent tainting chemicals down to parts per trillion concentrations. The result of these investigations is often critical in helping manufacturers secure compensation from suppliers or distributors for their part in causing the problem.</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="razorflies200.gif" alt="foreign bodies" align=bottom>Foreign bodies in products are a constant cause for concern to manufacturers and a worry to consumers. Even the best manufacturing plant is vulnerable to the problem, and will require expert assistance to identify the nature of a foreign body and its source.

<P>The Lord Zuckerman Research Centre, Whiteknights, PO Box 234, Reading. RG6 6LA. <BR>Tel : +44 118 986 8541  Fax:+44 118 986 8932</P>

<H2>What are the implications for the food industry of genetically modified organisms ?</H2>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>





<P>The advent of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) presents several challenges to the food industry, and concern to many consumers. </P>

<P>The challenges for the industry are ultimately concerned with securing consumer acceptance and commercial advantage. Consumer acceptance will be the ultimate judge of whether GMOs have a place on the supermarket shelves. However, in order to achieve that acceptance, suppliers, manufacturers and retailers must inform themselves first about the health, safety, authenticity, quality and legal implications of using GMOs. Then they must consider how to educate consumers.</P>

<P>This education process may prove difficult, not least because there is a vociferous lobby that objects to GMOs. </P>

<P>Some people object to the idea in principle. There is a popular science-fiction myth that geneticists are meddling with nature to produce dangerous new life forms. The fact that altering, adding or deleting one gene comes nowhere close to creating a new organism is irrelevant to these objectors. It is also the case at the moment that genetic modification of farm animals has not progressed as far as it has in plants. This is partly because the gene transfer technology is more complicated in animals, and partly because commercially important genes have yet to be identified.</P>

<P>In the case of plants, some have attempted to address public concerns by arguing that genetic engineering is nothing more than a sophisticated form of the cross pollination science that has been practiced for years. However, this is an over simplification. </P>

<P>There are two basic methods of inserting genes into a recipient plant tissue. One involves use of a bacterium (Agrobacterium) that naturally infects many dicotyledonous plants. The other involves bombarding cell nuclei with tiny gold or tungsten particles coated with genetic material. The bombardment technique is necessary for inserting genes into cereal crop tissues, since these are not infected by Agrobacterium. </P>

<P>In both techniques only some of the cells in a tissue are transformed and these have to be selected out from the mass. This is achieved by inserting a second gene at the same time as the first. The second gene codes for a protein that confers resistance to a chemical which is toxic to the untransformed cells. When this chemical - usually an antibiotic or herbicide - is added, the untransformed cells are killed, leaving the transformed cells behind and available for growth into new plants. </P>

<P>A third gene is also usually included in the DNA used for transformation. This will encode for a protein which can be assayed readily to confirm that transformation has occurred. </P>

<P>It is the use of the second marker gene that raises objections to GMOs amongst more informed objectors. It is argued that this gene could cross from the GMO to other plant species by natural means. The benefit of having a crop with some quality or processing improvement would be neglible against the downside of creating a strain of herbicide resistant &#39;superweeds&#39;. </P>

<P>A further concern about GMOs is that almost by definition, the long term health impact of consumption is not known. There are fears that the &#39;foreign&#39; genes could bring problems as well as benefits. The most cited example is that of a soybean containing genetic material from a Brazil nut, which caused allergies in individuals who consumed the soya made from the beans. In this case the soya product was withdrawn voluntarily from sale. </P>

<P>This example may prove exceptional, but is interesting from a number of perspectives. </P>

<P>First, it shows that gene transfer can confer unwanted characteristics as well as desirable ones. How many of these characteristics will have long term or indeed short term health implications will only be determined after the event. However it is likely that the media and consumers will be on the look out for risks associated with GMOs and the first sign of problems could spell disaster for a given GMO. </P>

<P>Second, it raises a specific concern about genetic modification of soy beans. Since soya products are amongst the most widely used food ingredients, genetically modified soybean could find its way into many, many food products. </P>

<P>This begs the question of whether legislation is required to ensure that foods containing GMOs are labelled as such. Currently, labelling is voluntary. The soybean/Brazil nut case suggests there is a case for declaring the source of transferred genes, as well as the recipient plant. Such labelling would impose massive administrative burdens on food manufacturers in setting up complex traceability systems, but these might prove unavoidable if the health of a minority of consumers is to be protected. </P>

<P>The labelling issue has been thrown into focus by Monsanto&#39;s recent introduction of a genetically modified soybean which has resistance to the company's own herbicide product. The company plans to mix the new bean with existing varieties without labelling the mixture. Industry groups are divided on the issue. The British Retail Consortium has expressed the view that the two types of soybean should be kept separate, whereas the Food and Drink Federation has stated that separation is &#39;impractical&#39;, &#39;unnecessary&#39; and &#39;unenforceable&#39;.</P>

<P>Retailers in general have taken the view that foods containing GMOs should be labelled as such in order to inform consumers. However, Monsanto&#39;s policy will make it impossible for the retailers to give this information. They will either have to source supplies that contain no GMOs, or adopt a labelling policy that takes account of the possibility that products contain ingredients sourced from GMOs.</P>

<P>The first option raises the issue of authenticity. It may never be possible to state categorically that a given food product contains no GMOs. Even with the best intentions, it is conceivable that some traders may deal in products derived from a GMO source without declaring it to their own customers. It is likely that tests, perhaps based on detection of the marker gene proteins, will have to be developed in much the same way that authenticity tests are required for fruit juices etc.</P>

<P>Perhaps the most insidious aspect of the development of GMOs is the extent to which a few very powerful biotechnology companies might be in a position to exploit the international food industry. For example, if a genetically modified crop is so superior to the alternatives, commercial necessity may force the GMO variety to be grown. The company that holds the &#39;plant variety right&#39; in the GMO stands to make significant gains from its use. It is interesting to speculate on the extent to which that company would also be liable for damages if there were health problems arising from use of one of its GMOs.</P>

<P>It is undoubtedly the case that GMOs have great potential benefit. A growing world population depends on sustainable food resources. Crops that are better able to resist disease, to survive drought, or remain wholesome during transportation have clear benefits. Much of the plant breeding technology that has been practiced for centuries has been directed at producing these better crops. The new technology of genetic engineering offers the potential to tailor make produce with even greater refinement. Crops can be developed to have better flavours, easier processing characteristics, stronger colours etc. Whether consumers are prepared to accept an uncertain level of risk in order to receive these relatively modest gains remains to be seen.

<H2>How easy is it to detect meat mixtures ?</H2>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>




<P>It has long been recognised that unscrupulous traders might be tempted to adulterate meat products. There are potential profits to made from substituting a cheaper meat for a more expensive cut of the same species, or of higher-value species. Particularly in minced meat, canned meat, sausages and pies etc, it is relatively easy to see how a cheaper meat might be introduced in place of the meat supposed to be present. </P>

<P>Clearly, deliberate mixing is fraudulent and an offence unless the meat product is accurately labelled. In the case of cross species adulteration, it is also potentially offensive to any religious community that might have a prohibition on the consumption of certain animal products.</P>

<P>Isolated cases of mixing may also arise from inadequate cleaning of mincing equipment etc. Though accidental, such contamination would be no more acceptable to consumers or trading standards authorities. It would also point to an alarming failure to observe basic hygiene controls during processing.</P>

<P>The recent press coverage of the finding by Hounslow trading standards officers of beef mince in lamb mince has alerted the general public to the issue of mixing. Six out of the ten lamb mince products purchased were found to contain beef. In one case the beef content was claimed to be as high as 10%. The results were made public in August although the survey took place in April/May. </P>

<P>Not surprisingly, the finding of such a high percentage of beef content raised the issue beyond that of misrepresentation of products. The suspicion was that otherwise unsaleable beef was being deliberately added to lamb mince. Regardless of any intent to deceive the public, the finding added further to the concerns about BSE. Whilst there was no evidence to suggest that the beef concerned was in any way infected with BSE, the findings did nothing to improve consumer confidence in the meat trade. What it did do was confirm the importance of methods for identifying mixing.</P>

<P>Laboratory techniques for identifying different species of meat are based on the genetic and chemical differences between the species. A thorough account of appropriate methods is given in the text book &#39;Food Authentication &#39; (Blackie) in the chapter on  &#39;Authenticity of meat and meat products&#39;.</P>

<P>The most widely used methods are immunological assays (looking at species specific proteins, again most commonly in raw meat although cooked meats may be assayed using different test kits), electrophoretic (looking at protein markers in raw meat), and DNA methods (applicable to both raw and cooked meats). Lipid analysis has limited application in identifying the fatty acid and triglyceride components of meats but the technique is relatively insensitive.</P>

<P>The sensitivity of these techniques will vary, often according to the quality of reagents used as much as the quality of the meats being tested. High performance liquid chromatography, electron spray mass spectrometry and near infra red spectrometry have also been used or studied as speciation techniques with varying degrees of success. However, these techniques are unlikely to be commercially viable at least in the short term.</P>

<P>In any scientific analysis it is important to appreciate the limitations of the technique for answering a given question. Therefore, it is vital to run detection limit controls, and false positive / false negative controls especially with immunological techniques.</P>

<P>None of the techniques as described is able to differentiate between meat from different breeds, although DNA analysis has the potential to differentiate between breeds. </P>

<P>However there is enough concern about mixing meats between species to provide enough impetus for further research in this area. An EU Standards Measurement and Testing project is currently underway which aims to prepare homogeneous and stable meat species reference materials for use in intercomparison studies to investigate and evaluate the analytical procedures for meat speciation commonly used within in the EU. The project is being coordinated by Ian Lumley of the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, and author of the chapter referred to above. This programme is well advanced and preparation of the required samples has been completed. A number of laboratories across Europe have participated in the first stages of the study, and a second stage of interlaboratory comparisons and further method developments are yet to be proposed.</P>

<P>In the meantime, the meat industry must do all it can to regain and preserve consumer confidence in its products. At the very least that must mean taking every step to ensure the authenticity of its products. Where authenticity is in doubt, any of the rapid screening techniques referred to above might be used to identify the suspect products, which can then be subjected to more thorough testing. </P>

<H1>HACCP - the video</H1>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<P>A new training video explaining the principles and practice of HACCP has been released by RSSL.  &#34;HACCP - How The System Works&#34; is an ideal tool for introducing HACCP to the wider workforce, senior management and the staff charged with implementing HACCP systems.</P>

<P>The video explains the theory behind HACCP, demonstrates its importance to food safety, and gives a clear guide on setting up HACCP teams, establishing HACCP procedures and monitoring their effectiveness. </P>

<H1>Review of European Union Legislative Issues: January - June 1996</H1>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>


<H2>Authenticity</H2>

<H3>Official Control of Foodstuffs</H3>

<P>A question raised by  Gerhard Schmid in the European Parliament (Official Journal 96/C 9/48 of 15.1.96 ) on the official control of foodstuffs Directive  elicited the response from the Commission that the Coca-Cola Company are technically obliged to divulge details of their formulae.  </P>


<H3>Fraud</H3>

<P>The European Commission has issued a proposal (COM 95 690 ) for a Regulation to enable them to make spot checks and inspections for the detection of frauds and irregularities to back up the efforts made by the member states in this area.  It has been suggested that the Commission is taking action because of the apparent ineffectiveness of the member states in combatting fraud.</P>


<H3>Chocolate</H3>

<P>After three years of prevarication, the Commission has finally adopted proposals to streamline unwieldy legislation in 7 vertical foodstuffs Directives.  The proposals have been held up because of the difficulty in reaching agreement on the definition of chocolate. Europe is fairly evenly split on what constitutes chocolate.  One half believes it should contain no other fat than cocoa butter while the other half believe that up to 5% of other vegetable fat is necessary to meet market conditions, particularly in the hotter climates. A compromise has been reached allowing chocolate products containing up to 5% vegetable fats as a substitute for cocoa butter but they will have to carry a label saying so.  Member states can still deny their national manufacturers the right to use vegetable fats but they cannot deny market access to imported chocolate.  This compromise proposal is likely to secure a qualified majority in Council but under the co-decision procedure it could have problems in the European Parliament.</P>


<H3>Specification Loophole</H3>

<P>The European Court of Justice has ruled that national product specifications are unenforceable if the national government has not given copies of all the technical rules that it adopts to the Commission.  Thus national courts have been advised to ensure that national standards have been deposited with the Commission before proceeding with local infringements.</P>


<H3>Contaminants</H3>

<P>The European Commission has published in the Official Journal L64 the Recommendation 96/199/EU on the 1996 coordinated programme of inspection to comply with maximum pesticide residue levels in foodstuffs.</P>

<P>The Economic and Social Committee has given its opinion (96/C 82/01) on the proposed Directive (95/C 201/07) amending Directive 76/363/EEC on the maximum levels of pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables, Directive 86/362/EEC on cereals, Directive 86/363/EEC on products of animal origin, and Directive 90/642/EEC on products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables.</P>

<P>The draft Directive, 96/C 87/02 on integrated pollution prevention and control has reached the common position stage.  It will now go to the European Paliament for its second reading through the co-decision process.</P>

<P>Member of the European Parliament, Amedeo Amadeo, was assured on asking about the unauthorised use of pesticides in agriculture that the system was indeed under control (96/C 112/19). </P>


<HR>

<H2>Consumer Protection</H2>

<H3>Consumer Power</H3>

<P>When Emma Bonino was appointed the European Commissioner for Consumer Affairs she was shocked at the low status of consumer matters within the Commission.  She is determined to simplify the resolution of individual consumer complaints and announced plans to launch discussions on an action plan for this area.  To this end, she is shepherding a Directive to give consumers equal access to justice in all EU member states.  There would be mutual recognition of consumer associations which would be able to represent European citizens before the courts in any of the 15 member states.  The Directive will affect advertising and consumer credit.  Bonino sees this as an important step in fostering the citizen's belief in belonging to the EU.  Understandably the European Consumers  Council (BEUC) in Brussels is pleased.  Member states will have to designate their approved consumer associations and notify  the Commission who will ensure publication in the Official Journal.   The proposals for the Directive are published in Commission document  COM 95 712.   The Economic and Social Committee gave its opinion on the proposed legislation in the Official Journal 96/C 39/12 of 12.2.96, and the proposed revised Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of Member States relating to injunctions for the protection of consumers interests was published in the Official Journal 96/C 107/03 of 13.4.96.</P>

<H3>Action Plan</H3>

<P>A proposed  action plan (Communication from the Commission, COM 96 13) proposed on 14 February complementing the above legislation aims to encourage amicable resolution of conflicts by offering a working plan for a voluntary system of additional legal help for handling consumer complaints.  A simplified form something like the one used to report car accidents, is proposed to facilitate individual consumer-related disputes in the EU.  A legal action guide is already available on the Internet to enhance legal protection for European consumers.  This is a stage two sequel from the draft Directive (COM 95 712) initiated by the Commission in January of this year aimed at protecting consumers' collective interests by the mutual recognition of cross border legal actions.</P>

<H3>Unit Pricing</H3>

<P>The Council reached a Common Position on 23 April on the Proposed Directive on consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers. The Directive will replace three earlier Directives 79/581/EEC  as amended by 88/315/EEC and 88 314/EEC.  It has not yet been published in the Official Journal but the European Parliament has already considered it and put forward amendments.  The Directive will require the indication of both the selling price and the price per unit of measurement of most products offered by traders to consumers to improve consumer information and to facilitate comparison of prices.  There are openings for derogations for street traders, small businesses, for products for which the Directive would be inappropriate, etc.  The Economic and Social Committee put forward its comments on the proposed legislation in the Official Journal 96/C 82/08 of 19.3.96.  But European MP, Riccardo Garasci,  in a question (96/C 66/136) to the Commission asserted that the multiplicity of prices confronting the consumer will only mislead.</P>


<H3>Open Forum on Consumer Policy</H3>

<P>A three year plan on  protection of the consumer will focus on quality, information and openness. At a ministerial open forum, four of ten main issues discussed were:   protecting consumers from unscrupulous financial services traders;   getting better quality of service from the public utilities;  facilitating access to new technologies for the information society;    and restoring public confidence in food products following the mad cow scare.  The lone dissenting voice was the British Minister who regretted the unnecessary burden imposed on industry by yet more Community intervention. </P>

<HR>

<H2>Food Additives</H2>

<H3>Miscellaneous Additives</H3>
<P>The Commission is drafting an amendment to the Miscellaneous Additives Directive (Commission Document COM 96 212).  A draft was circulated by the UK government to interested parties in January. The three additive Directives (sweeteners, colours, and miscellaneous) are now more or less adopted in practice throughout the EU, except France and Portugal.</P>


<H3>Flavourings for use in Foodstuffs</H3>

<P>A basis for compiling a list of approved flavourings and procedues for the use of such flavours in foodstuffs has been reached.  A regulation to effect was adopted on 25 June 1996.  The common position stage was published in the Official Journal 96/C 59/03 of 28.2.96. </P>


<H3>Derogation on the use of Additives</H3>

<P>Some Member States have insisted on  maintaining national laws prohibiting the use of additives in certain foodstuffs.  An amended proposal for a Decision to regularise this has been published, COM 96 50, and a common position was adopted on 18 June 1996.   Similar products from other member states containing additives permitted by EU law cannot be denied access to those markets.  Thus for products which benefit from the inclusion of an additive, the restrictive member states are effectively hindering their own industry.</P>


<H3>Sweeteners Directive</H3>

<P>The amendment to the Sweeteners Directive has reached the Common Position.  The amendments are a tidying up operation and make no major changes  - there are no new sweeteners included.    Throughout the Annex, the definition of "breakfast cereals" has been modified to include a minimum threshold of 15% fibre (the 20% minimum bran remains).  Three categories of permitted foods, breakfast cereals, energy reduced soups, and distilled drinks containing less than 15% alcohol, have been deleted from that part of the Annex covering cyclamate.  For the use of cyclamate in the category "food supplements/diet integrators based on vitamins and or mineral elements, syrup-type or chewable" the maximum permitted level has been reduced from 2000 mg/kg to 1250 mg/kg cyclamate.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Food Imports</H2>

<H3>Edible Oils</H3>

<P>For the transport of bulk edible oils and fats by sea, there has been a derogation  (96/3/EU published on 27.1.96 in Official Journal L 21) from the hygiene of foodstuffs Directive 93/43/EU.</P>

<H3>Import Tariffs</H3>

<P>Regulation 3009/95 published on 30.12.95 in Official Journal L 319, amends Annex I  of Regulation 2658/87 on tariff and statistical nomenclature and on common customs tariff.  This refers to the importation of food.</P>

<H3>Illegal Banana Imports</H3>

<P>Until recently, Germany has had a derogation allowing the importation of "dollar" bananas into the European Union on the basis of long standing custom.  This derogation has now been rescinded much to the annoyance of the German importers who have apparently been defying the change in EU law, and have been importing bananas out of quota and duty free through Hamburg!  The matter was raised in the European Parliament by Fernando Fernandez Martin who asked ( Official Journal 96/C 9/50 of 15.1.96) about measures to combat fraudulent import of non-EU bananas.  </P>

<H3>Maize Residues</H3>

<P>Following the increased importation of residues from maize starch manufacture from the USA, the EU has placed restrictions on the volume.  These restrictions embodied in Regulation 2019/94  have been amended in Regulation 396/96 published on 5.3.96 in  Official Journal  L 54.</P>


<H3>TARIC</H3>

<P>The European Union system of tariffs (TARIC) is updated periodically. The most recent update appeared in the Official Journal 96/C 98/01 of 1.4.96.</P>

<P>The GATT Uruguay Round has made necessary certain changes to the trading regulations of the European Union.   The Commission has proposed (COM 96 23)  amending Regulation 519/94 on common rules for imports fom certain third countries as a result.</P>

<HR>
<H2>Food Law</H2>

<H3>Food Law</H3>

<P>Among the items on the Commission's programme for 1996 will be a proposal for a general Directive on food law to establish (in retrospect!) a framework of principles for European food legislation.   A discussion paper has been drawn up by the Commissioners of Industry, Agriculture, Internal Market, and Consumer Policy as a basis for an internal policy debate, setting out the range of options open to the Commission including both the scope of the proposed Green Paper and the regulatory approach to be adopted.  Long standing differences between the Agriculture and Industry Directorates General will have to be resolved before the Paper is tabled by the Commission for more general discussion.  Once made public it will be the basis for far-reaching consultations with all interested parties.</P>

<H3>Legislation Streamlining - SLIM</H3>

<P>The Commission has launched a new initiative called SLIM (Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market) published in Commission document COM 96 204 to cut down the quantity of legislation and to improve its quality. A number of test cases will be considered this year and the results assessed by the Internal Market ministers in November.  If successful, the scheme will be applied to most other areas of EU legislation.</P>

<H3>Foodstuffs</H3>

<P>A Green Paper on Foodstuffs is expected this year from the Commission. In it will be an assessment of EU action in the food sector since 1962, an analysis of the workings of the Internal Market, an identification of gaps in legislation and an overview of the international dimension.  The objective of the Paper is to elicit from Member States, consumer groups, industry and farmers their views on what type of  framework is needed for making the any changes.</P>

<H3>Vertical Directives</H3>

<P>After three years of prevarication, the Commission has finally made a Proposal to Council (COM 96 722) for a Directive to amend all 7 vertical foodstuffs Directives affecting coffee and chicory extracts, tinned milk, jam jellies and marmalade, fruit juices, sugars and honey to streamline legislation in those Directives which have become out-dated.   Existing Directives contain a number of details which have been superseded due to the adoption of horizontal Directives on labelling, hygiene, additives etc.   The proposals have been held up because of the difficulty in reaching agreement on the definition of chocolate. </P>

<HR>

<H2>Health & Safety</H2>

<H3>Legislation</H3>
<P>In the last six months, a number of legislative changes have been progressed.    Directive 95/63/EU was published on 30.12.95 in Official Journal L 335,  amending Directive 89/655/EEC on minimum safety and health requirements for equipment. A common position has been reached  (Official Journal 96/C 147/01 published on 21.5.96) on a  Directive on pressure equipment. The Economic and Social Committee has given its opinion (Official journal 96/C 39/05 published on 12.2.96) on the European Union programme on safety, hygiene and health at work.  Finally,  proposals hae been  put forward (Official Journal  96/C 23/07 published on 27.1.96) to amend Directive 89/686 on personal protective equipment.</P>


<H3>Working Conditions</H3>

<P>Commission proposals on flexible working hours and safety at work for part-time workers, employees with fixed term contracts and temporary workers are now the subject of consultation.  Employers see no need for further legislation but the Commission and the unions disagree.  All agree that  any obstacles to flexible working have to be removed as long as the basic principle of equal treatment for people engaged in flexible working is maintained.</P>

<H3>Radiation</H3>

<P>A Directive setting out basic standards for the protection of the general population and workers from the dangers of ionising radiation was adopted in the middle of May by the Council of Ministers.  It follows recommendations made by the several international authorities on the subject.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Labelling</H2>

<H3>Trade Marks</H3>

<P>Joseph Dalby, a barrister based in Brussels, has been cautioning industry on some of the pitfalls in the trade mark arena.  The new Community Trade Mark (CTM) which has recently been introduced can take precedence over national marks.  At the moment the CTM is running in parallel with national schemes.  Not all holders of national trade marks will be able to upgrade their industrial property.  The granting of a CTM, as in national applications, has to be justified.  There is a case before the Court of Justice currently concerning the right of a manufacturer to prevent the resale of his trademarked goods when they have been repackaged.  Interim opinion deems it to be lawful.</P>

<H3>Food Claims Directive</H3>

<P>After two abortive attempts to draft legislation on this subject, the Commission is looking at other ways of dealing with it.  One suggestion is through an amendment to the legislation already  in force.</P>

<H3>QUID Directive</H3>

<P>At the second reading of the proposed quantitative labelling amendment to the labelling Directive 79/112/EEC, the European Parliament adopted five amendments.  The Commission has published its formal opinion on these, in which it accepts two of them - on sales denomination and quantitative ingredient declaration for products consisting of a single ingredient, but opposes the other three stating the reasons why.  The Council would have to agree unanimously to overturn the Commission's opposition.  That is highly unlikely.</P>

<H3>Labelling Confusion</H3>

<P>European Parliament MP,Riccardo Garusci, in a question to the Commission on the Directive on labelling of prices on foods and other products (unitary pricing),   believes the multiplicity of prices on products is going to confuse consumers and add to the burden on retailers.</P>

<H3>Protected Products</H3>

<P>Regulation 2091/92  sets out the basis for those categories of foods which enjoy special protection in the European Union.  For example feta cheese can only be used to describe cheese made by a special technique in Greece from goats milk, but cheddar cheese is considered not to be regional specific.   The Comission has now made a proposal for a Decision (COM 96 38) on a non-exhaustive list of generic products under Article 3(3) of Regulation 2081/92; and a proposal for a Regulation (COM 96 48) on the registration of geographical indications and designations of origin under Article 17 of Regulation 2081/92.  Recently, the registration of geographical indications and designations of origin  has been published as a regulation 1107/96 published on 21.6.96 in the Official Journal L 148.</P>


<H3>Sweeteners</H3>

<P>The Labelling Directive 94/54/EC on the compulsory indication on labels of foodstuffs of particulars other than prescribed in Directive 79/112/EEC was amended by Directive 96/21/EU published on 5.4.96 in the Official Journal L 88. The substance of the change was to ensure that the phrase with sweeteners should accompany the name under which the product is sold for all foodstuffs containing a sweeteners or sweeteners permitted by Directive 94/35/EC.  Furthermore foodstuffs containing both added sugar(s) and a sweetener or sweeteners requires the accompanying title with sugar(s) and sweetener(s).  Additionally there are mandatory warning messages when a product contains aspartame and more than 10% added polyols.</P>

<H3>Coeliac Disease</H3>

<P>In answering a European Parliamentary question by  Martin Grechler on labelling of gluten in foodstuffs for sufferers from coeliac disease (Official Journal  96/C 109/24 published on 15.4.96 ), the Commission adsvised that changes in the labelling Directive 79/112/EEC are in hand to deal with this.</P>

<H3>Genetic Modification</H3>
<P>In a European Parliamentary question (96/C 173/24 published on 17.6.96),  Martin Grechler asked if the labelling of genetically modified foodstuffs should be mandatory.  He made particular reference to sugar beet genetically modified  to counter viral yellowing of the leaves.  The Commission replied that the genetic modification had no effect on the purity of the resulting sugar and so special labelling was inappropriate.</P>

<H3>Labelling of Additives</H3>
<P>Following the coming into force of the EU regulations on food labelling, there have been numerous enquiries aboout how additives should be labelled in the ingredients list of a product.  The UK MAFF have prepared  a set of criteria in conjunction with the European Commision to clarify the situation.  These can be obtained from MAFF by telephoning (44) 171 238 6463.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Nutrition</H2>

<H3>Dietary Supplements</H3>

<P>96/C 56/103 of 26.2.96 Ian White in a European Parliamentary question asked about pending legislation on dietary supplements. The Commission in answer said that a discussion paper is in preparation (by the Scientific Committee for Food ) but no legislation is planned. </P>

<H3>Diabetic Food </H3>

<P>In the PARNUTS area, there have been two proposals (Official Journal 96/C 37/07 of 8.2.96 and 96/C 41/09 of 13.2.96) to amend Directive 89/398/EEC on PARNUTS to include diabetic foods as a result of pressure from the European Paliament.   Council however, apart from Germany, seems to be against the proposal.   At the Internal Market meeting at the end of May, Germany stood out against the other member states who wanted no specific Directive on foods for diabetics.  Unanimity is required on this issue since there is a direct clash between the Commission (really the European Parliament) and the Council.  Because of this, it was suggested in discussions recently at the CIAA with Dr Crauser of DG III/E, that the Commission may have to withdraw the proposed amendment to the PARNUTS Directive 89/398/EEC on diabetic food.</P>

<H3>Infant and Baby Food</H3>

<P>Commission Directives have been adopted on infant and follow-up formulae, (96/4/EC published on 28.2.96 in Official Journal L 49), and cereal-based baby foods, (96/5/EC published on 28.2.96 in Official Journal L 49), using the Standing Committee procedure.  The first Directive, 96/4/EC amends the original Directive 91/321/EC on infant formulae and follow-on formulae, but 96/5/EC lays down uniform rules for the first time on cereal-based formulae and baby food for infants and young children. It specifies basic requirements on the addition of minerals, vitamins, etc, and ingredients they may not contain.  The criteria governing the addition of ingredients are: no risk to health, effective availability of the ingredients, perfect solubility, stability and lack of interaction.</P>

<H3>Low-calorie Food</H3>
<P>The Directive, 96/8/EU published on 6.3.96 in Official Journal  L 55,  on foods intended for use in energy restricted diets for weight reduction, means tighter control on slimming products.  The deadline for incorporation into member state law is 30 September 1997.  The daily energy from such food has to fall between 800 and 1200 kcal, with a dietary fibre between 10 and 30 g.  Minimum and maximum values are required for fats and proteins and minimum values for vitamins and minerals.  This Directive falls under the PARNUTS umbrella.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Novel Ingredients</H2>

<H3>Novel Foods</H3>
<P>Following the publication of the common position on the novel foods and novel ingredients regulation last November, the regulation has had its second reading in the European Parliament where further changes were proposed.  The Commission has published its opinion on the Parliament s  modifications to the Regulation (COM 96 229).</P>

<H3>Genetically Engineered Corn</H3>
<P>Several EU member states have decided against allowing Ciba Geigy to market its genetically engineered maize  which  is resistant to the European corn borer and more resistant to the Ciba weedkiller Basta (glufosinate ammonium.)  According to Greenpeace, the maize also contains a toxin gene of Bacillus thuringiensis and another gene making it resistant to Ampicillin, an antibiotic.  Although the Commission has approved the marketing of the maize (COM 96 206: Proposal for a Council Decision to allow marketing of genetically modified maize with insecticidal properties and tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium with respect to Directive 90/220),  Austria, Denmark, Sweden  and the UK are opposed to it on the lack of conclusive evidence that it poses no threat to the environment or human health.   However it should be noted that the UK Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes has given clearance for food products processed from the maize.  Greenpeace will be lobbying the other member states against allowing it when it comes up for discussion at the June Environment Council meeting on the basis that the safety testing was flawed.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Packaging</H2>

<H3>Plastic Materials</H3>
<P>A Directive (96/11/EU published on 12.3.96 in the Official Journal L 61) amends Directive 90/128/EEC on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs by elaborating on the list of chemicals that can be used.</P>

<H3>Packaging Turmoil</H3>
<P>Two new drafts on the proposed identification system for packaging and the formats for databases have angered national experts when they were told that they would not be voluntary after all.   All packaging would have to carry an identification number if the new draft is adopted, to allow waste packaging to be sorted efficiently for recycling.  There will also be an obligation to measure the amount of packaging which is reused.</P>

<H3>Recycling</H3>
<P>The European Commision,  in response to a Parliamentary question by Anita Pollock on packaging directive for uniform recycling symbol  (96/C 173/55 published on 17.6.96 ),  advised that work is in hand.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Product Safety</H2>

<H3>Official Control of Foodstuffs</H3>
<P>In Directive 96/290/EC, published on 3.5.96 in the Official Journal L 109, the Commission recommends that member states take samples of or inspect the following sectors during 1996:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Microbiological assessment of dried and fermented ready-to-eat meat and meat products
<LI>Migration of plasticisers into foods</LI>
<LI>Temperature of chilled foods on display for sale</LI>
<LI>Benzopyrene in smoked pork products</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Safety of Food in the UK</H3>

<P>The UK Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food has published its Annual Report for 1995.  Subjects covered during that year were trends in human foodborne infectious intestinal disease and relevant animal data; microbial antibiotic resistance in relation to food safety; foodborne viral infections; and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis in milk.</P>


<H3>Hydrolysed Vegetable Protein</H3>

<P>The European Union Scientific Committee for Food has recommended that levels of the most common chloropropanol, 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol which has been shown at high doses and on  prolonged dosing to cause cancers in rats, be reduced to undetectable levels.    Chloropropanols are found at very low levels in hydrolysed vegetable protein which is used in small amounts to flavour savoury products.   The UK Food Advisory Committee at its meeting in May has initiated discussion with industry to find means of further reducing the already low levels of chloroprpanols in HVP, if necessary by changing the manufacturing process.</P>


<H3>Malachite Green</H3>

<P>Trout farmers are advised to take steps to reduce the concentrations of malachite green (used to control fungal growth on mature fish) in fish reaching the market.  Although the UK Committee on Toxicology has raised no concern,  the UK Veterinary Medicines Directorate, the British Trout Association and the major retailers are cooperating to investigate the reason for the higher than expected levels of the residues.</P>

<H3>Water</H3>

Water Resource Planning
<P>The Commission has issued a Communication (COM 96 59) on EU water policy, addressing not just quality but quantity as well.  The use of water has to be coordinated across the Union to ensure there are no shortages and environmental damage.  The objective is to ensure that one member state does not move its problem into another state.  The proposed framework Directive is expected to cover the definition of quality objectives, monitoring requirements, the management of water programmes, public participation, and openness in the management of water resources.</P>

<H3>Water Quality</H3>

<P>The Economic and Social Committee has given its opinion on the proposed Directive on water quality for human consumption, (Official Journal 96/C 82/12 of 19.3.96).</P>

<H1>Phthalates</H1>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<P><H2>Analytical Support During Food Contamination Scares</H2></P>
<P>Responding to the current phthalate controversy</P>

<P>The recent incident concerning levels of phthalate in baby milk formulae has once again illustrated how the media can distort a story to create a major food scare.  Many food manufacturers and retailers have been monitoring the levels of phthalates in their products for some time and have taken steps to reduce levels either from packaging materials or environmental sources.  The potential damage to brands from this type of media attention can do untold harm to responsible manufacturers who endeavour to produce safe and high quality products.</P>

<P>RSSL first reported on phthalate contamination through our company newsletter Contract in 1994 and have for some years developed GC-MS methodology to analyse for the whole range of phthalates in foods and food contact materials.  The methods are not straightforward because of the need to eliminate accidental contamination from phthalates already present in the laboratory environment.  These methods have enabled levels of potentially toxic phthalates such as di-n-butyl phthalate and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate to be monitored at mg/kg levels.  </P>

<P>By providing these services on a routine basis, RSSL has assisted companies to monitor levels of phthalates in their products as part of  &#39;due diligence&#39; screening programmes.  We also offer companies an Emergency Response Service for the immediate analysis of products.  This service is available 24 hours a day,  365 days of the year and provides emergency cover in situations where companies need all the analytical facts before they can determine their most appropriate response.</P>

<P>Data on the toxicity of phthalic acid esters have been collected over many years with references dating back to the 1930&#39;s.  RSSL has compiled an extensive information file on phthalates covering toxicity information and surveillance reports.  If you would like some of this data for your own records, please contact Di Amor on 0118 986 8541.</P>

<P>To give a brief history of the situation, the majority of the work has been carried out on rodents  which showed that high doses of certain phthalate esters can lower blood lipids and have adverse effects on the testes and embryonic survival.  In their Food Surveillance Paper in 1987 (No. 21) MAFF reported that there was around a 100,000-fold margin between the no-effect levels for reproductive toxicity and the maximum likely human intakes. Nevertheless an update on food contact materials in Food Surveillance Paper No 30 (1990) showed that certain foodstuffs (potato snacks and chocolates) contained up to 18.6 mg/kg of dicyclohexyl phthalate and it was recommended that steps be taken to reduce the chance of  any contamination.</P>  

<P>During 1994, MAFF further acknowledged the widespread occurrence of very low levels of phthalates in the environment, including food packaging materials, and stated that it intended to include routine phthalate determinations in its Total Diet Study from early in 1995.  It also continues to look at the migration of phthalates and other printing ink components as part of its surveillance of paper and board food contact materials.</P>

<P>The debate on the dangers of so-called &#34;environmental oestrogens&#34; was re-opened in 1994 by American scientists who claimed that a cocktail of pollutants from food and water were damaging the reproductive functions of the Western male.  Although the original articles focussed on DDT and PCBs, which are chemically distinct from phthalates, concern about the reproductive toxicity of phthalates has resurfaced in the UK media and teams of biologists at Brunel and Edinburgh Universities are currently looking at the hazards posed by longer term, cumulative effects of  phthalates and other plastic components.</P>

<P>The recent controversy over infant formulae has arisen from a MAFF survey which indicated that dietary intakes of phthalates by formula-fed infants expressed on a body weight basis would be proportionally higher than intakes by adults on a mixed diet.  MAFF have recommended that sources of phthalates in the formulae should be established and steps taken to reduce levels found where possible.</P>

<P>To reassure customers, retailers can encourage their suppliers to test products for phthalate levels. In this way companies can determine whether they have a widespread problem in their own products and if they do, to test samples at various stages of the production process to establish the sources of contamination. </P>

<P>For further information on RSSL&#39;s analytical services for phthalates, please call our Customer Service Desk, free of charge, on 0800 243482.</P>
